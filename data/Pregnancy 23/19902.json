    "en": "A 36-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, at 34 weeks gestation is brought to labor and delivery due to heavy vaginal bleeding. She has had no contractions, leakage of fluid, or recent trauma. The patient has received no prenatal care. Her first pregnancy ended in a full-term cesarean delivery. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 134/86 mm Hg, and pulse is 98/min. On speculum examination, there is active heavy bleeding. An emergency cesarean delivery is performed. After delivery of the infant, the placenta cannot be removed and remains densely adherent to the uterine wall. An emergency hysterectomy is performed. Pathologic examination will most likely show which of the following?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient presents with a clinical scenario highly suggestive of placenta accreta, which is characterized by abnormal adherence of the placenta to the uterine wall. This condition arises from a defect in the decidua basalis, the specialized layer of the endometrium that normally separates the placenta from the myometrium. In placenta accreta, the decidua basalis is either absent or deficient, allowing the placental villi to directly invade and adhere to the myometrium. This abnormal attachment can lead to severe postpartum hemorrhage when the placenta fails to detach after delivery, often necessitating a hysterectomy. The patient's history of a prior cesarean delivery is a significant risk factor for placenta accreta due to potential scarring and disruption of the endometrium. The pathologic examination of the placenta and uterus would reveal the direct adherence of placental tissue to the myometrium, consistent with the absence or defect of the decidua basalis.\n\n(Choice A) Abnormal placental trophoblast proliferation is characteristic of gestational trophoblastic disease, such as a hydatidiform mole. These conditions typically present with vaginal bleeding and uterine enlargement but do not involve the abnormal adherence of the placenta to the myometrium in the same way as placenta accreta.\n\n(Choice C) Wharton jelly is the gelatinous connective tissue that surrounds the umbilical vessels, providing protection. Its absence at the cord insertion site is not directly related to placenta accreta. Vasa previa, a condition where umbilical vessels run near the internal cervical os, can be associated with absence of Wharton jelly at the insertion site, but this is a separate pathology.\n\n(Choice D) Infiltration of neutrophils into the umbilical cord suggests an inflammatory process, such as intraamniotic infection (chorioamnionitis). While infection can complicate pregnancy, it is not the primary cause of placenta accreta. Patients with chorioamnionitis would typically have other signs of infection, such as fever and purulent amniotic fluid, and the placenta would not necessarily be densely adherent to the myometrium due to a decidual defect.\n\nEducational objective:\nPlacenta accreta occurs due to abnormal attachment of the placenta directly onto the uterine myometrium. This condition most often develops because the endometrial decidua basalis is absent or defective due to previous uterine scarring (eg, prior cesarean delivery). The classic presentation is a morbidly adherent placenta that does not detach after fetal delivery.",
    "zh": "患者表现出的临床情况高度提示胎盘植入，其特征是胎盘异常粘附于子宫壁。这种情况源于基底蜕膜的缺陷，基底蜕膜是子宫内膜的特殊层，通常将胎盘与子宫肌层分开。在胎盘植入中，基底蜕膜缺失或不足，导致胎盘绒毛直接侵入并粘附于子宫肌层。这种异常附着可能导致严重的产后出血，因为胎盘在分娩后未能脱离，通常需要进行子宫切除术。患者既往剖宫产史是胎盘植入的重要危险因素，这与子宫内膜可能出现的瘢痕和破坏有关。胎盘和子宫的病理检查将显示胎盘组织直接粘附于子宫肌层，这与基底蜕膜的缺失或缺陷一致。\n\n（选项A）胎盘滋养细胞异常增生是妊娠滋养细胞疾病（如葡萄胎）的特征。这些疾病通常表现为阴道出血和子宫增大，但不会像胎盘植入那样涉及胎盘异常粘附于子宫肌层。\n\n（选项C）华通氏胶是包绕脐血管的胶状结缔组织，提供保护。它在脐带插入部位的缺失与胎盘植入没有直接关系。前置血管，一种脐血管靠近宫颈内口的情况，可能与插入部位华通氏胶的缺失有关，但这是一种单独的病理。\n\n（选项D）中性粒细胞浸润脐带提示炎症过程，如羊膜腔内感染（绒毛膜羊膜炎）。虽然感染可能使妊娠复杂化，但它不是胎盘植入的主要原因。患有绒毛膜羊膜炎的患者通常会有其他感染迹象，如发烧和脓性羊水，并且胎盘不一定由于蜕膜缺陷而紧密粘附于子宫肌层。\n\n教育目标：\n胎盘植入是由于胎盘直接异常附着在子宫肌层上引起的。这种情况最常发生的原因是由于既往子宫瘢痕（例如，既往剖宫产）导致子宫内膜基底蜕膜缺失或缺陷。典型的表现是病理性粘连的胎盘，在胎儿娩出后未能脱离。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of placenta accreta, its pathophysiology, risk factors, and the expected histopathological findings. It assesses the ability to correlate clinical presentation with underlying placental abnormalities.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the clinical features suggestive of placenta accreta, such as prior cesarean delivery, heavy vaginal bleeding, and failure of placental separation. Recall the normal placental implantation process and the role of the decidua basalis. Then, consider how defects in this layer lead to abnormal adherence and evaluate the provided options based on this understanding.",
