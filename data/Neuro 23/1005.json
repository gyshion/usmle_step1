    "en": "A pharmaceutical researcher is developing a novel agent to prevent meningococcal disease in people exposed to the bacteria. Pili antigens from *Neisseria meningitidis* are extracted and used to generate antibodies that impair normal pili function. The antibodies are administered to experimental animals with no prior exposure to *N. meningitidis*. These animals, along with control animals that had not received the antibodies, are subsequently exposed to the bacteria. Compared to the control animals, a significantly greater proportion of the animals that received the antibodies remain healthy and develop no symptoms. The efficacy of these antibodies in preventing meningococcal disease is most likely due to direct interference with which of the following microbial processes?",
    "zh": "一位制药研究员正在开发一种新型药物，用于预防暴露于脑膜炎奈瑟菌的患者发生脑膜炎球菌病。从脑膜炎奈瑟菌中提取菌毛抗原，并用于生成可损害正常菌毛功能的抗体。将抗体施用于之前未暴露于脑膜炎奈瑟菌的实验动物。这些动物，以及未接受抗体的对照动物，随后暴露于细菌。与对照动物相比，接受抗体的动物中保持健康且未出现症状的比例显著增加。这些抗体预防脑膜炎球菌病的功效最可能归因于直接干扰以下哪种微生物过程？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "*Neisseria meningitidis* is commonly isolated from the oropharynx and nasopharynx of asymptomatic carriers. Colonization rates are variable but highest in close contact populations (eg, military recruits, university students). Transmission of meningococci usually occurs through exposure to respiratory droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions.\n\nThe pili on the capsular surface of *N. meningitidis* are responsible for attachment to and colonization of the nasopharyngeal epithelium; antibodies against pili are primarily protective due to reduced bacterial colonization, which limits carrier status. However, because pili undergo high rates of antigenic variation (eg, on-off gene switching, horizontal gene transfer), vaccines that target pili have limited effectiveness.\n\nOther prominent *N. meningitidis* virulence factors include IgA protease (destroy mucosal antibodies that would otherwise inhibit epithelial colonization), capsular polysaccharides (prevent phagocytosis and phagolysosome destruction), lipo-oligosaccharide (an endotoxin that is the major source of toxicity), and opacity proteins (aid in endothelial attachment and invasion).\n\n(Choices A and D) Vaccines that target endothelial or meningeal invasion would act too late in the disease process to prevent significant illness; once *N. meningitidis* disseminates within the bloodstream, increased circulating levels of endotoxin put patients at high risk for sepsis, circulatory collapse, and death.\n\n(Choices C and E) Capsular polysaccharides prevent phagocytosis and allow the pathogen to replicate and disseminate within the bloodstream. They also promote bacterial survival within phagocytes by inhibiting phagolysosome destruction. Most existing meningococcal vaccines target capsular polysaccharides.\n\nEducational objective:\nPili are the primary virulence factor that allow *Neisseria meningitidis* to initially attach to and colonize the nasopharyngeal epithelial surface. Pili undergo significant antigenic variation, which makes them a difficult vaccination target.",
    "zh": "脑膜炎奈瑟菌通常从无症状携带者的口咽和鼻咽中分离出来。定植率各不相同，但在密切接触人群（例如，新兵、大学生）中最高。脑膜炎奈瑟菌的传播通常通过接触呼吸道飞沫或直接接触呼吸道分泌物发生。\n\n脑膜炎奈瑟菌荚膜表面的菌毛负责附着于鼻咽部上皮并定植；针对菌毛的抗体主要具有保护作用，原因是细菌定植减少，从而限制了携带状态。然而，由于菌毛经历高频率的抗原变异（例如，开关基因转换、水平基因转移），针对菌毛的疫苗的有效性有限。\n\n其他突出的脑膜炎奈瑟菌毒力因子包括 IgA 蛋白酶（破坏会抑制上皮定植的粘膜抗体）、荚膜多糖（阻止吞噬作用和吞噬体破坏）、脂寡糖（一种内毒素，是主要的毒性来源）和混浊蛋白（有助于内皮附着和侵袭）。\n\n（选项 A 和 D）针对内皮或脑膜侵袭的疫苗会在疾病过程的后期发挥作用，无法预防严重的疾病；一旦脑膜炎奈瑟菌在血液中播散，循环内毒素水平升高会使患者处于败血症、循环衰竭和死亡的高风险中。\n\n（选项 C 和 E）荚膜多糖可防止吞噬作用，并使病原体在血液中复制和播散。它们还通过抑制吞噬体破坏来促进细菌在吞噬细胞内的存活。大多数现有的脑膜炎球菌疫苗靶向荚膜多糖。\n\n教育目标：\n菌毛是主要的毒力因子，可使脑膜炎奈瑟菌最初附着于鼻咽部上皮表面并定植。菌毛经历显著的抗原变异，这使得它们成为一个难以疫苗接种的靶标。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathogenesis of *Neisseria meningitidis* and the role of pili in attachment to nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. It also assesses understanding of how antibodies against pili can prevent meningococcal disease.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that pili are the primary virulence factor for initial attachment and colonization. Therefore, antibodies that interfere with pili function would most likely prevent attachment to nasopharyngeal epithelial cells.",
