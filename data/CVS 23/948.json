She denies chest pain, hemoptysis and shortness of breath. Her past medical history is significant for long-standing hypertension, diabetes and myocardial infarction experienced two months ago. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg and heart rate is 70/min.",

    "en": "With a history of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease, the likelihood that this patient is on standard ACE inhibitor therapy is very high. A dry, nonproductive, and persistent cough is one of the most well-known side effects of ACE inhibitor therapy.\n\nThe mechanism of ACE inhibitor induced cough is believed to involve increased bradykinin, substance P, or prostaglandins. ACE is a very nonspecific enzyme responsible for the breakdown of many substrates. By blocking ACE, ACE inhibitors block degradation of bradykinin and substance P. Bradykinin and substance P accumulation can cause inflammation and stimulate lung irritation.\n\nBecause angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not affect ACE activity, they theoretically should not cause cough.\n\n(Choice A) Chronic cough is one of the early signs of cancer. Screening family history will allow risk assessment for cancer, but since patient does not complain of any other symptoms of cancer (unexplained fatigue, weight loss, change in bowel habits, etc.), suspicion for cancer is low.\n\n(Choice B) Although cough can occur secondary to post nasal drip in patients with allergies, the patient describes no other allergy type symptoms (itchy and watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, etc.).\n\n(Choice D) Diet and physical activity are not linked to causing cough.\n\n(Choice E) Cough may be linked to pulmonary infection or disease. Chest x-ray would be helpful in diagnosis if suspicion for pneumonia, TB, bronchitis, or emphysema were high. However, patient has no symptoms associated with any infection and her risk for emphysema is low since she does not smoke.\n\nEducational Objective:\nCough is a very well recognized side effect of ACE inhibitor therapy. Cough secondary to ACE inhibitor therapy is characterized as dry, nonproductive, and persistent. The mechanism behind ACE inhibitor induced cough is accumulation of bradykinin, substance P, or prostaglandins. Because angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not affect ACE activity, they theoretically should not cause cough.",
    "zh": "鉴于患者有高血压、糖尿病和冠心病病史，该患者使用标准ACE抑制剂治疗的可能性非常高。干咳、无痰和持续性咳嗽是ACE抑制剂治疗最广为人知的副作用之一。\n\n据认为，ACE抑制剂引起的咳嗽机制涉及缓激肽、P物质或前列腺素的增加。ACE是一种非常非特异性的酶，负责分解许多底物。通过阻断ACE，ACE抑制剂会阻断缓激肽和P物质的降解。缓激肽和P物质的积聚可引起炎症并刺激肺部刺激。\n\n由于血管紧张素受体阻滞剂（ARB）不影响ACE活性，理论上它们不应引起咳嗽。\n\n（选项A）慢性咳嗽是癌症的早期征兆之一。筛查家族史将有助于评估患癌风险，但由于患者没有主诉任何其他癌症症状（不明原因的疲劳、体重减轻、排便习惯改变等），因此对癌症的怀疑程度较低。\n\n（选项B）虽然咳嗽可能继发于过敏患者的鼻后滴漏，但患者没有描述任何其他过敏类型症状（眼睛发痒和流泪、流鼻涕、打喷嚏等）。\n\n（选项D）饮食和体力活动与引起咳嗽无关。\n\n（选项E）咳嗽可能与肺部感染或疾病有关。如果高度怀疑肺炎、结核病、支气管炎或肺气肿，胸部X光检查将有助于诊断。然而，患者没有任何与任何感染相关的症状，而且由于她不吸烟，她患肺气肿的风险很低。\n\n教育目标：\n咳嗽是ACE抑制剂治疗非常公认的副作用。继发于ACE抑制剂治疗的咳嗽的特征是干咳、无痰和持续性。ACE抑制剂引起的咳嗽的机制是缓激肽、P物质或前列腺素的积聚。由于血管紧张素受体阻滞剂（ARB）不影响ACE活性，理论上它们不应引起咳嗽。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of common side effects of ACE inhibitors, specifically the mechanism and presentation of ACE inhibitor-induced cough. It also tests the ability to differentiate this cough from other potential causes of chronic cough.\n\nThe best approach is to consider the patient's medical history and medications. Given the history of hypertension, diabetes, and myocardial infarction, ACE inhibitor use is highly likely. Recognizing the dry, nonproductive cough as a typical side effect of ACE inhibitors leads to the correct answer.",
