    "en": "A 34-year-old woman comes to the office due to inability to lose weight despite diet and exercise. She reports that she gained a significant amount of weight after she stopped smoking 4 years ago. The patient has tried several commercial weight-loss diet programs in the last year without success. She wants to lose at least 4.5 kg (10 lb) over the next few months before she gets married. The patient does not have any other medical conditions and takes no medications. Blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg and pulse is 78/min. BMI is 33 kg/m². Physical examination shows an obese habitus but is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory testing for secondary causes of weight gain is unrevealing. In addition to encouraging continued efforts at lifestyle change, the physician prescribes a short course of oral phentermine for weight loss. The weight loss induced by this medication is caused by which of the following mechanisms?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Norepinephrine-releasing agents (eg, phentermine) are sympathomimetic weight-loss drugs indicated for short-term (≤12 weeks) treatment of obesity. They work by stimulating release and inhibiting reuptake of norepinephrine and, to a lesser extent, serotonin and dopamine. Subjective effects include an INCREASED sensation of satiety and subsequently reduced caloric intake.\n\nBecause of the increased sympathetic activity associated with these drugs, they can raise blood pressure and should be avoided in patients with comorbid HYPERTENSION or heart disease. Norepinephrine-releasing agents can induce brisk initial weight loss but are notable for poor long-term benefit, and most patients regain the weight following discontinuation.\n\n(Choice A) Glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists (eg, liraglutide) increase glucose-dependent insulin secretion and are most commonly used in treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, GLP-1 agonists cause delayed gastric emptying and decreased appetite, leading to weight loss.\n\n(Choice B) Orlistat is an intestinal lipase inhibitor. It acts by reducing the digestion and subsequent absorption of dietary fats. The increased residual fat content in the intestinal lumen can lead to intestinal discomfort, diarrhea, fecal incontinence, and impaired absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (eg, vitamin D).\n\n(Choice C) Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist indicated for the treatment of opioid abuse and alcohol dependence. It is also used in a combination pill with bupropion for weight loss, in which it is thought to potentiate the otherwise minor weight-loss effects of bupropion.\n\n(Choice D) In addition to treating depression and anxiety, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (eg, fluoxetine) are commonly used in the treatment of eating disorders, especially bulimia nervosa. Although some patients taking SSRIs experience minor weight loss, the effects on weight are variable, and these medications are not prescribed for weight loss.\n\nEducational objective:\nNorepinephrine-releasing agents (eg, phentermine) are sympathomimetic weight-loss drugs indicated for short-term treatment of obesity. They stimulate the release and inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine. Subjective effects include an increased sensation of satiety, leading to reduced caloric intake. Weight regain after cessation is common with these drugs.",
    "zh": "去甲肾上腺素释放剂（例如，芬特明）是拟交感神经减肥药物，适用于短期（≤12周）治疗肥胖症。它们通过刺激去甲肾上腺素的释放并抑制其再摄取发挥作用，在较小程度上也影响血清素和多巴胺。主观效应包括饱腹感增强，进而减少热量摄入。\n\n由于与这些药物相关的交感神经活动增加，它们可能会升高血压，应避免用于合并高血压或心脏病的患者。去甲肾上腺素释放剂可以诱导快速的初始体重减轻，但长期获益不佳，大多数患者在停药后会恢复体重。\n\n（选项 A）胰高血糖素样肽-1 (GLP-1) 激动剂（例如，利拉鲁肽）可增加葡萄糖依赖性胰岛素分泌，最常用于治疗 2 型糖尿病。此外，GLP-1 激动剂会导致胃排空延迟和食欲下降，从而导致体重减轻。\n\n（选项 B）奥利司他是肠道脂肪酶抑制剂。它通过减少膳食脂肪的消化和随后的吸收而起作用。肠腔内残留脂肪含量增加会导致肠道不适、腹泻、大便失禁以及脂溶性维生素（例如，维生素 D）的吸收受损。\n\n（选项 C）纳曲酮是一种阿片受体拮抗剂，用于治疗阿片类药物滥用和酒精依赖。它也与安非他酮联合使用于减肥，据认为它会增强安非他酮原本较小的减肥效果。\n\n（选项 D）除了治疗抑郁症和焦虑症外，选择性血清素再摄取抑制剂 (SSRIs)（例如，氟西汀）通常用于治疗饮食失调症，尤其是神经性贪食症。尽管一些服用 SSRIs 的患者会经历轻微的体重减轻，但对体重的影响是可变的，并且这些药物不用于减肥。\n\n教学目标：\n去甲肾上腺素释放剂（例如，芬特明）是拟交感神经减肥药物，适用于短期治疗肥胖症。它们刺激去甲肾上腺素的释放并抑制其再摄取。主观效应包括饱腹感增强，从而减少热量摄入。停药后体重反弹是这些药物的常见情况。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of phentermine, a sympathomimetic amine used for short-term weight loss. It also requires understanding of other weight loss medications and their mechanisms.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that phentermine is a norepinephrine-releasing agent that increases satiety and reduces caloric intake. Eliminate options based on knowledge of other weight loss drugs and their mechanisms of action.",
