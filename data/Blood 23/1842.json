Medical history is significant for 2 prior hospitalizations for abdominal pain that resolved with analgesics and hydration. Evaluation today shows a hematocrit of 23% and reticulocyte count of 9%. Several hours after being admitted to the hospital, the patient dies. At autopsy, the spleen is small and firm.",

    "en": "This patient's hematologic findings (eg, anemia, reticulocytosis) and medical history (eg, recurrent episodes of abdominal pain that resolved with analgesics and hydration) are suggestive of SICKLE CELL DISEASE (SCD). SCD is a hemoglobinopathy characterized by sickle hemoglobin (HbS), an abnormal hemoglobin that can polymerize in deoxygenated conditions. HbS polymerization leads to sickle-shaped erythrocytes that can occlude small vessels. This patient's most recent presentation (eg, fever, chest pain, dyspnea) was most likely due to small-vessel occlusion localized to the pulmonary vasculature (ie, acute chest syndrome).\n\nVascular occlusion can also cause splenic infarctions. Repeated infarctions produce a shrunken, fibrotic spleen. By adulthood, most patients with SCD have undergone AUTOSPLENECTOMY and have a small, scarred splenic remnant. As a result, these patients have functional asplenia and are susceptible to infection with encapsulated organisms (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae).\n\n(Choice A) Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) can develop in patients with hemolytic anemias (eg, beta-thalassemia, SCD) or myeloproliferative neoplasms (eg, primary myelofibrosis) and typically occurs in the liver and spleen. Splenic EMH would result in splenomegaly, not splenic atrophy.\n\n(Choice B) Splenic follicular hyperplasia can be seen with systemic infections and can result in an enlarged, not small and firm, spleen.\n\n(Choice C) Intrasplenic lipid accumulation may occur in lysosomal storage disorders such as Gaucher disease. Although such patients can have bone pain and anemia, they typically have splenomegaly.\n\n(Choice D) Pressure atrophy of the splenic parenchyma can be seen when a lesion (eg, a cyst) compresses the spleen, which would likely have been detected during autopsy.\n\nEducational objective:\nIn patients with sickle cell disease, repetitive splenic infarctions caused by microvessel occlusion result in a small, firm splenic remnant (ie, autosplenectomy).",
    "zh": "该患者的血液学检查结果（例如，贫血、网织红细胞增多）和病史（例如，反复发作的腹痛，经止痛药和补液后缓解）提示为镰状细胞病（SCD）。镰状细胞病是一种血红蛋白病，其特征是镰状血红蛋白（HbS），这是一种异常的血红蛋白，可在缺氧条件下聚合。HbS聚合导致镰刀状红细胞，可阻塞小血管。该患者最近的症状（例如，发烧、胸痛、呼吸困难）很可能是由于小血管阻塞，位于肺血管系统（即，急性胸部综合征）。\n\n血管阻塞也可导致脾梗死。反复梗死会产生萎缩、纤维化的脾脏。到成年后，大多数镰状细胞病患者都经历了自体脾切除术，并且有一个小而疤痕的脾残余。因此，这些患者具有功能性脾无能，并且容易感染有包膜的生物（例如，肺炎链球菌）。\n\n（选项 A）髓外造血（EMH）可在患有溶血性贫血（例如，β-地中海贫血、镰状细胞病）或骨髓增生性肿瘤（例如，原发性骨髓纤维化）的患者中发生，并且通常发生在肝脏和脾脏中。脾脏EMH会导致脾肿大，而不是脾萎缩。\n\n（选项 B）脾滤泡增生可见于全身感染，并可导致脾脏增大，而不是小而硬。\n\n（选项 C）脾内脂质积聚可能发生在溶酶体贮积症中，例如高雪病。尽管此类患者可能出现骨痛和贫血，但他们通常有脾肿大。\n\n（选项 D）当病灶（例如，囊肿）压迫脾脏时，可见脾实质的压迫性萎缩，这很可能在尸检中被发现。\n\n教育目标：\n在镰状细胞病患者中，由于微血管阻塞引起的反复脾梗死导致小的、坚硬的脾残余物（即，自体脾切除术）。"
