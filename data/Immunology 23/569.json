    "en": "A 57-year-old woman with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease develops end-stage renal disease and undergoes deceased-donor kidney transplantation. During the operation, the surgeon notices that the graft becomes cyanotic and mottled soon after its blood vessels are connected with those of the recipient. Blood flow to the graft ceases, and no urine is produced. Which of the following best explains the findings observed by the surgeon?",

    "en": "This patient is experiencing hyperacute rejection of a renal transplant. Hyperacute rejection is an antibody-mediated reaction (ie, type II hypersensitivity) caused by preformed IgG antibodies in the recipient that are directed against donor antigens. These are commonly anti-HLA antibodies (eg, formed during prior blood transfusion or pregnancy) or ABO blood group antibodies.\n\nHyperacute rejection is usually diagnosed in the operating room when the kidney becomes cyanotic and mottled after anastomosis of the donor and recipient blood vessels. Perfusion through the transplanted organ ceases immediately due to antibody- and complement-mediated vascular injury with subsequent thrombotic occlusion. This rapidly leads to ischemic necrosis of the glomeruli and renal cortex with little to no urine output and irreversible graft loss.\n\nTo minimize the risk of hyperacute rejection, donor and recipient ABO and HLA cross-matching is performed prior to renal transplantation.\n\n(Choice A) Activation of recipient T lymphocytes is the primary mechanism of acute organ transplant rejection. Recipient T cells are sensitized by donor graft antigens, leading to cell-mediated (ie, type IV hypersensitivity) rejection that typically occurs within 6 months after transplant. This type of rejection is generally reversible with increased doses of immunosuppression.\n\n(Choice C) Degranulation of mast cells and basophils occurs during a type I hypersensitivity reaction (eg, allergic reaction), which is not involved in organ transplant rejection.\n\n(Choice D) Graft versus host disease occurs when donor T lymphocytes recognize recipient antigens, leading to vasculitis and tissue damage that frequently affects the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. The risk is highest with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n\n(Choice E) Atherosclerotic stenosis of the transplanted renal artery can occur over time, but it would not cause acute graft ischemia with cyanosis and mottling at the time of transplant surgery.\n\nEducational objective:\nHyperacute rejection is caused by preformed antibodies in the recipient that recognize and attack donor antigens (ie, type II hypersensitivity). These are often anti-ABO blood group or anti-HLA antibodies. Vascular injury and capillary thrombotic occlusion lead to rapid ischemic necrosis of the renal graft, often evidenced by gross cyanosis and mottling immediately following graft perfusion.",
    "zh": "该患者正在经历肾移植的超急性排斥反应。超急性排斥反应是一种抗体介导的反应（即，II 型超敏反应），由受者中针对供者抗原的预先形成的 IgG 抗体引起。这些通常是抗-HLA 抗体（例如，在之前的输血或妊娠期间形成）或 ABO 血型抗体。\n\n当肾脏在供者和受者血管吻合后变成青紫色和斑驳时，通常在手术室诊断出超急性排斥反应。由于抗体和补体介导的血管损伤，随后发生血栓性闭塞，移植器官的灌注立即停止。这迅速导致肾小球和肾皮质的缺血性坏死，尿量极少或无尿，以及不可逆的移植肾丧失。\n\n为了最大限度地降低超急性排斥反应的风险，在肾移植前进行供者和受者的 ABO 和 HLA 交叉配型。\n\n（选项 A）受者 T 淋巴细胞的激活是急性器官移植排斥的主要机制。受者 T 细胞被供者移植抗原敏化，导致细胞介导（即，IV 型超敏反应）排斥反应，通常发生在移植后 6 个月内。这种类型的排斥反应通常可以通过增加免疫抑制剂的剂量来逆转。\n\n（选项 C）肥大细胞和嗜碱性粒细胞的脱颗粒发生在 I 型超敏反应（例如，过敏反应）期间，这与器官移植排斥无关。\n\n（选项 D）当供者 T 淋巴细胞识别受者抗原时发生移植物抗宿主病，导致血管炎和组织损伤，通常影响皮肤、肝脏和胃肠道。异体造血干细胞移植的风险最高。\n\n（选项 E）移植肾动脉的动脉粥样硬化性狭窄可能随着时间的推移而发生，但它不会在移植手术时引起伴有青紫色和斑驳的急性移植肾缺血。\n\n教学目标：\n超急性排斥反应是由受者中识别并攻击供者抗原的预先形成的抗体引起的（即，II 型超敏反应）。这些通常是抗-ABO 血型或抗-HLA 抗体。血管损伤和毛细血管血栓性闭塞导致肾移植肾的快速缺血性坏死，通常表现为移植肾灌注后立即出现明显的青紫色和斑驳。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of transplant rejection, specifically hyperacute rejection, its mechanism, and clinical presentation. It requires understanding the role of preformed antibodies in causing immediate graft failure.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the rapid onset of cyanosis and mottling after transplantation as indicative of hyperacute rejection. Recall that hyperacute rejection is mediated by preformed antibodies against donor antigens, leading to vascular thrombosis and graft ischemia.",
