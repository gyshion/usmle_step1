    "en": "This patient presents with new-onset hypertension (systolic ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 90 mm Hg) and proteinuria at 36 weeks gestation, which are diagnostic criteria for PREECLAMPSIA. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific syndrome characterized by widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction. This dysfunction is thought to result from an imbalance between antiangiogenic factors and proangiogenic factors. Specifically, there is increased release of antiangiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF), and decreased release of proangiogenic factors. This imbalance leads to widespread endothelial cell dysfunction, characterized by increased vascular tone (vasospasm), increased vascular permeability (leading to proteinuria and edema), and impaired placental perfusion. The decreased activity of VEGF, a proangiogenic factor, is a key contributor to the endothelial dysfunction seen in preeclampsia. \n\n(Choices A and D) Endothelin and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) are potent VASOCONSTRICTORS. Their activity is typically INCREASED, not decreased, in preeclampsia due to increased production by dysfunctional endothelial cells. Therefore, decreased activity of these factors would not explain the patient's hypertension.\n\n(Choices B and C) Decreased human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and prolactin levels are associated with first-trimester pregnancy loss (e.g., spontaneous abortion); however, the activity of neither hormone is directly related to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. \n\nEducational objective: Preeclampsia is new-onset hypertension (systolic ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 90 mm Hg) with proteinuria and/or signs of end-organ damage (eg, renal insufficiency). Preeclampsia is associated with widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, which occurs due to increased antiangiogenic factor release and decreased proangiogenic factor activity (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor).",
    "zh": "该患者出现新发高血压（收缩压≥140 mmHg或舒张压≥90 mmHg）和妊娠36周的蛋白尿，这些是子痫前期的诊断标准。子痫前期是一种妊娠特有的综合征，其特征是广泛的母体内皮功能障碍。这种功能障碍被认为是由于抗血管生成因子和促血管生成因子之间的失衡所致。具体而言，抗血管生成因子（如血管内皮生长因子（VEGF）和胎盘生长因子（PlGF））的释放增加，而促血管生成因子的释放减少。这种失衡导致广泛的内皮细胞功能障碍，其特征是血管张力增加（血管痉挛）、血管通透性增加（导致蛋白尿和水肿）和胎盘灌注受损。作为促血管生成因子的VEGF的活性降低是导致子痫前期内皮功能障碍的关键因素。\n\n（选项A和D）内皮素和血栓素A2（TXA2）是强效的血管收缩剂。在子痫前期，它们的活性通常会增加，而不是降低，这是由于功能障碍的内皮细胞产生的增加所致。因此，这些因子的活性降低并不能解释患者的高血压。\n\n（选项B和C）人绒毛膜促性腺激素（hCG）和催乳素水平降低与妊娠早期流产（如自然流产）有关；然而，这两种激素的活性都与子痫前期的发病机制无直接关系。\n\n教学目标：子痫前期是新发高血压（收缩压≥140 mmHg或舒张压≥90 mmHg）伴有蛋白尿和/或终末器官损伤的体征（例如肾功能不全）。子痫前期与广泛的母体内皮功能障碍有关，这是由于抗血管生成因子释放增加和促血管生成因子活性降低（例如血管内皮生长因子）所致。"

It requires the identification of the hormonal imbalance that leads to the characteristic clinical presentation of hypertension and proteinuria.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the clinical diagnosis of preeclampsia based on the provided vital signs and urinalysis results. Then, recall the underlying mechanisms of preeclampsia, focusing on the imbalance between vasoactive and antiangiogenic factors, and identify which factor's decreased activity would lead to the observed endothelial dysfunction and hypertension.",
