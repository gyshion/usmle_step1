    "en": "A 72-year-old man develops mild abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea after undergoing urgent cholecystectomy. The surgery was complicated by an episode of hypotension that was treated with bolus intravenous crystalloid fluids. The patient had no previous gastrointestinal bleeding. His last colonoscopy 10 years ago was normal. Past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a myocardial infarction 7 years ago. The patient smoked for 40 years and quit after the myocardial infarction. Colonoscopy would most likely show pathology in which of the following portions of the large bowel?",

    "en": "This patient with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea following a complicated surgical procedure likely has acute nonocclusive ISCHEMIC COLITIS. The colon receives blood from the marginal artery of the colon (artery of Drummond), an anastomotic system of arteries that is in turn supplied by the superior (SMA) and inferior (IMA) mesenteric artery systems. The distal colon receives blood also from the internal iliac artery. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nIn low-flow states, as may be seen in severe hypotension in patients with underlying arterial insufficiency (eg, atherosclerotic arterial disease), nonocclusive ischemia may occur at the margins of the anastomotic distributions. These \"watershed\" areas are primarily in the left colon at the SPLENIC FLEXURE (border between SMA and IMA supply) and RECTOSIGMOID JUNCTION (border between sigmoid artery and superior rectal artery). Less commonly, occlusive ischemia can also be caused by thromboembolic (eg, hypercoagulable states, atrial fibrillation) or atheroembolic (eg: aortic instrumentation) events.\n\nImpaired perfusion to the bowel leads to ischemia and necrosis of the intestinal wall. Complications can include acidosis, sepsis, gangrene, and perforation. Colonoscopy will reveal pale mucosa and petechial hemorrhages.\n\n(Choices A, B, C, and E) The ascending colon, cecum, hepatic flexure, and most of the transverse colon are supplied by branches of the SMA. Mesenteric ischemia in these areas is significantly less common than in the watershed areas of the left colon. Ischemia is also uncommon in the rectum, which receives collateral blood supply via the rectal arteries.",
    "zh": "这名患者在复杂的手术后出现腹痛和血性腹泻，很可能患有急性非阻塞性缺血性结肠炎。结肠的血液供应来自结肠边缘动脉（Drummond 动脉），这是一组动脉吻合系统，依次由肠系膜上动脉（SMA）和肠系膜下动脉（IMA）系统供血。远端结肠的血液供应也来自髂内动脉。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n在低灌注状态下，如在存在潜在动脉功能不全（例如，动脉粥样硬化性动脉疾病）的患者中出现严重低血压时，非阻塞性缺血可能发生在吻合分布的边缘。这些“分水岭”区域主要位于左侧结肠，包括脾曲（SMA 和 IMA 供应之间的界限）和直乙状结肠交界处（乙状结肠动脉和直肠上动脉之间的界限）。不常见的是，阻塞性缺血也可能由血栓栓塞（例如，高凝状态、心房颤动）或动脉粥样硬化栓塞（例如：主动脉器械植入）事件引起。\n\n肠道的灌注受损会导致肠壁缺血和坏死。并发症可包括酸中毒、败血症、坏疽和穿孔。结肠镜检查将显示粘膜苍白和点状出血。\n\n（选项 A、B、C 和 E）升结肠、盲肠、肝曲和大部分横结肠由 SMA 的分支供血。这些区域的肠系膜缺血比左侧结肠的分水岭区域明显少见。直肠的缺血也不常见，因为直肠通过直肠动脉接收侧支血供。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of ischemic colitis, specifically the watershed areas of the colon that are most susceptible to ischemia during hypotensive states. The question requires understanding of the arterial supply to the colon and the locations where blood supply is most vulnerable.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's risk factors for ischemic colitis (hypotension post-surgery) and identify the watershed areas of the colon (splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction). Eliminate options that are supplied by major arteries and less prone to ischemia.",
