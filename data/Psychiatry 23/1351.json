  "correct_answer": "G",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is G. Suppression is a mature defense mechanism in which an individual consciously decides not to dwell on an unpleasant thought or feeling. This student is aware of her anxiety about the exam but consciously decides to put it aside until she receives her score. Suppression is a conscious process, whereas repression is unconscious.\n\n(Choice A) Denial is an immature defense mechanism in which an individual behaves as if an aspect of reality does not exist. This student acknowledges the exam and her anxiety about it, so she is not in denial.\n\n(Choice B) Dissociation is an immature defense mechanism characterized by a disruption in consciousness, memory, identity, or perception. This student's experience does not involve such a disruption.\n\n(Choice C) Intellectualization is an immature defense mechanism that involves focusing on nonemotional aspects to avoid distressing feelings. While the student mentions \"worrying isn't going to change the result,\" this is more about managing her current feelings than an intellectual detachment from the situation.\n\n(Choice D) Rationalization involves justifying unacceptable feelings or situations with logical-sounding excuses. The student's statement is not an excuse for her feelings but a decision to postpone dealing with them.\n\n(Choice E) Reaction formation is an immature defense mechanism in which unacceptable feelings or impulses are transformed into their opposite. The student's behavior does not suggest she is acting the opposite of how she feels.\n\n(Choice F) Repression is an immature defense mechanism in which unacceptable thoughts or feelings are blocked from entering conscious awareness. This is an unconscious process, whereas the student's decision to not think about the exam is a conscious choice.\n\nKey defense mechanisms:\nImmature: Acting out, Denial, Displacement, Intellectualization, Passive aggression, Projection, Rationalization, Reaction formation, Regression, Splitting.\nMature: Altruism, Sublimation, Suppression, Humor.\n\nThis student is using SUPPRESSION to alleviate anxiety about her exam results as she is aware of her discomfort but decides not to attend to it. Suppression is a mature defense mechanism in which an individual INTENTIONALLY puts aside unpleasant thoughts or feelings to better cope with the present reality.\n\nSuppression should not be confused with repression (Choice F), in which unacceptable thoughts or feelings are blocked from entering conscious awareness (eg, an adult who was sexually abused as a child unconsciously buries feelings about the trauma).\n\n(Choice A) Denial involves avoiding awareness of an external reality (eg, a student who has failed an exam denies having done so).\n\n(Choice B) Dissociation is an immature defense in which a transient disruption to memory, identity, and/or consciousness occurs as a way to cope with a distressing event (eg, this student does not remember taking the exam and feels numb when her peers discuss the questions).\n\n(Choice C) Intellectualization is an immature defense mechanism that involves focusing on nonemotional components of a distressing event to make it more tolerable (eg, this student becomes preoccupied with thinking about the passing rates and other statistics of the exam).\n\n(Choice D) Rationalization involves making excuses for unacceptable feelings or situations (eg, a student explaining that poor performance on an exam was due to the trickiness of the questions).\n\n(Choice E) Reaction formation involves unconsciously transforming an unacceptable thought or feeling into its opposite (eg, a student hiding fears of failing the exam by being overly confident).\n\nEducational objective:\nSuppression is a mature defense mechanism involving a conscious choice not to dwell on a particular thought or feeling.",
    "zh": "正确的答案是 G。抑制是一种成熟的防御机制，在这种机制中，个体有意识地决定不去沉溺于不愉快的想法或感觉。这位学生意识到自己对考试的焦虑，但有意识地决定将这种焦虑放在一边，直到她收到成绩。抑制是一个有意识的过程，而压抑是无意识的。\n\n（选项 A）否认是一种不成熟的防御机制，在这种机制中，个体表现得好像现实的某个方面不存在。这位学生承认了考试和她对考试的焦虑，所以她并没有否认。\n\n（选项 B）分离是一种不成熟的防御机制，其特征是意识、记忆、身份或知觉受到干扰。这位学生的经历不涉及这种干扰。\n\n（选项 C）理智化是一种不成熟的防御机制，它涉及关注非情感方面以避免痛苦的感觉。虽然学生提到“担心不会改变结果”，但这更多的是关于管理她当前的感觉，而不是对情况的理智脱离。\n\n（选项 D）合理化涉及用合乎逻辑的借口为不可接受的感觉或情况辩护。这位学生的陈述并不是她感觉的借口，而是一种推迟处理这些感觉的决定。\n\n（选项 E）反向形成是一种不成熟的防御机制，在这种机制中，不可接受的感觉或冲动会转化为它们的对立面。这位学生的行为并没有表明她表现得与她的感受相反。\n\n（选项 F）压抑是一种不成熟的防御机制，在这种机制中，不可接受的想法或感觉被阻止进入意识。这是一个无意识的过程，而学生决定不去想考试则是一个有意识的选择。\n\n关键防御机制：\n不成熟：行动、否认、置换、理智化、被动攻击、投射、合理化、反向形成、退行、分裂。\n成熟：利他主义、升华、抑制、幽默。\n\n这位学生正在使用抑制来减轻她对考试结果的焦虑，因为她意识到她的不适，但决定不去关注它。抑制是一种成熟的防御机制，在这种机制中，个体有意地把不愉快​​的想法或感觉放在一边，以便更好地应对当前的现实。\n\n抑制不应与压抑（选项 F）相混淆，在压抑中，不可接受的想法或感觉被阻止进入意识（例如，小时候遭受过性虐待的成年人会无意识地掩埋有关创伤的感受）。\n\n（选项 A）否认涉及避免意识到外部现实（例如，考试不及格的学生否认自己不及格）。\n\n（选项 B）分离是一种不成熟的防御机制，其中记忆、身份和/或意识会出现短暂的干扰，以此来应对痛苦的事件（例如，这位学生不记得参加考试，当她的同伴讨论问题时感到麻木）。\n\n（选项 C）理智化是一种不成熟的防御机制，它涉及关注痛苦事件的非情感成分，以使其更易于忍受（例如，这位学生开始专注于思考考试的通过率和其他统计数据）。\n\n（选项 D）合理化涉及为不可接受的感觉或情况找借口（例如，学生解释说，考试成绩不佳是由于问题的棘手程度造成的）。\n\n（选项 E）反向形成涉及无意识地将不可接受的想法或感觉转化为其对立面（例如，学生通过过度自信来掩盖对考试失败的恐惧）。\n\n教育目标：\n抑制是一种成熟的防御机制，涉及有意识地选择不去沉溺于特定的想法或感觉。"
