    "en": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the office due to fatigue, weight gain, and insomnia for the past 2 months. The patient has difficulty falling asleep, awakens at 4:00 AM, and stays awake for the rest of the day. She also describes nonspecific muscle aches and pains in her shoulders, neck, and abdomen. She says, \"I was always pretty healthy, but now I worry that something is wrong or that I could have cancer.\" The patient has stopped exercising due to lack of motivation and has lost nearly all of her interest in spending time with friends or family. She has a history of hypertension, for which she takes hydrochlorothiazide. Physical examination is normal except that blood pressure is slightly higher than usual at 142/88 mm Hg and there has been a weight gain of 2.7 kg (6 lb). The patient admits that she has been forgetful recently, sometimes neglecting to take her medication. Laboratory evaluation, including thyroid function testing, is within normal range. The patient appears tense and anxious.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by a persistent depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in activities, along with other symptoms, for at least 2 weeks. The diagnostic criteria for MDD include at least five of the following symptoms, with at least one being depressed mood or loss of interest/pleasure: depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, change in appetite or weight, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor retardation or agitation, low energy, poor concentration or indecisiveness, thoughts of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. The patient's 2-month history of low energy, weight gain, insomnia with early morning awakening, impaired concentration (forgetfulness), and loss of interest is most consistent with MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER. Some individuals with MDD do not report feeling depressed due to poor recognition or concerns of stigma and may come to their primary care physicians with excessive worry over physical health, pain symptoms (eg, muscle aches, abdominal cramps, headaches), and other SOMATIC SYMPTOMS (eg, fatigue, sleep disturbance, appetite change). When medical illness has been ruled out, MDD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with these symptoms.\n\n(Choice A) Depressive disorder due to another medical condition is diagnosed when there is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory tests that the symptoms can be entirely explained by the physiologic mechanism of another illness. This patient's unremarkable physical examination and normal laboratory results make MDD more likely.\n\n(Choice B) Patients with MDD can have worry and psychomotor agitation (eg, restlessness, fidgeting); however, generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by multiple worries, not just health anxiety, lasting ≥6 months.\n\n(Choices C and E) Illness anxiety disorder involves an extreme level of worry about having a serious illness, followed by excessive health-related behaviors for ≥6 months. Somatic symptom disorder involves a focus on the seriousness of bodily symptoms with excessive thoughts, anxiety, or energy devoted to them for ≥6 months. Somatic symptoms and related disorders are not diagnosed if they arise only during an acute depressive episode.\n\nEducational objective: MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER can present with loss of interest or pleasure without depressed mood. Patients may seek treatment in the primary care setting for somatic symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, and pain.",
    "zh": "重度抑郁障碍 (MDD) 的特征是持续的抑郁情绪或对活动的兴趣或愉悦感丧失，并伴有其他症状，至少持续2周。MDD的诊断标准包括以下至少五种症状，且至少有一种为抑郁情绪或兴趣/愉悦感丧失：抑郁情绪，兴趣或愉悦感丧失，食欲或体重变化，失眠或嗜睡，精神运动迟滞或激动，精力低下，注意力不集中或犹豫不决，无价值感或不适当的内疚感，以及反复出现死亡或自杀的想法。患者2个月的低能量、体重增加、伴有清晨觉醒的失眠、注意力受损（健忘）和兴趣丧失，与重度抑郁障碍最为一致。一些MDD患者由于识别能力差或担心污名化而没有报告感到抑郁，他们可能会带着过度担心身体健康、疼痛症状（例如，肌肉酸痛、腹部绞痛、头痛）和其他躯体症状（例如，疲劳、睡眠障碍、食欲改变）来看他们的初级保健医生。当已排除躯体疾病时，对于出现这些症状的患者，应考虑MDD的鉴别诊断。\n\n(选项A) 当病史、体格检查或实验室检查有证据表明症状完全可以由另一种疾病的生理机制解释时，诊断为继发于其他躯体疾病的抑郁症。该患者的体格检查无明显异常和实验室结果正常，使得MDD的可能性更大。\n\n(选项B) MDD患者可能出现担忧和精神运动性激动（例如，躁动不安、坐立不安）；然而，广泛性焦虑症的特征是多种担忧，不仅仅是健康焦虑，且持续≥6个月。\n\n(选项C和E) 疾病焦虑症涉及对患有严重疾病的极度担忧，随后出现过度与健康相关的行为，持续≥6个月。躯体症状障碍涉及关注躯体症状的严重性，并过度关注、焦虑或投入精力≥6个月。如果躯体症状和相关疾病仅在急性抑郁发作期间出现，则不予诊断。\n\n教育目标：重度抑郁障碍可表现为兴趣或愉悦感丧失，而没有抑郁情绪。患者可能因躯体症状（如疲劳、睡眠障碍和疼痛）而在初级保健机构寻求治疗。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) when it presents with atypical symptoms such as somatic complaints and anxiety, rather than overt depressed mood. It emphasizes the importance of considering MDD in patients with a constellation of symptoms like fatigue, insomnia, weight changes, and loss of interest, even when overt depression is not reported.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully evaluating the patient's reported symptoms against the diagnostic criteria for various psychiatric disorders. Key steps include identifying the duration and nature of symptoms, ruling out medical causes, and differentiating between conditions like MDD, anxiety disorders, and somatic symptom disorders based on their specific diagnostic features.",
