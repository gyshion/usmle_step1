    "en": "A 59-year-old woman comes to the office due to recurrent facial pain for the past month. The pain occurs only on the left side. It starts just in front of the ear as a shock-like sensation that quickly radiates down the jaw over 4-8 seconds, then resolves. It is most commonly triggered by chewing, so the patient sometimes skips meals to avoid the pain. Vital signs are normal. The patient has lost 4.5 kg (10 lb) since she was last seen 6 months ago. Physical examination of the oral cavity shows no dental caries. Severe pain is reproduced with light touch of the left cheek. Neurologic examination is otherwise normal.",
    "zh": "一名59岁女性因过去一个月反复出现面部疼痛就诊。疼痛仅发生在左侧。疼痛始于耳前，呈电击样感觉，迅速沿下颌向下放射，持续4-8秒后缓解。最常见的诱因是咀嚼，因此患者有时会跳过进餐以避免疼痛。生命体征正常。自6个月前的上次就诊以来，患者体重减轻了4.5公斤（10磅）。口腔检查显示无龋齿。轻触左颊可诱发剧烈疼痛。神经系统检查无其他异常。"

    "en": "This patient with unilateral, intermittent, shock-like pain of the left face that lasts several seconds and is triggered by minor stimuli (eg, chewing) likely has trigeminal neuralgia (TN) {{exhibit_1}}. Characteristic clinical features of TN include the following:\n\n*   Paroxysmal severe attacks of neuropathic pain (eg, shock-like, stabbing) lasting a few seconds to 2 minutes\n*   Unilateral pain involving primarily the V2 and V3 distributions of the trigeminal nerve (CN V)\n*   Innocuous triggers (eg. chewing, talking, brushing teeth) and allodynia (pain to light touch)\n*   Absence of other neurologic deficits on examination\n\nThe pathophysiology of TN seems to be related to compression of the trigeminal nerve root as it enters the pons, leading to demyelination and atrophy of the nerve. Compression most commonly occurs due to an abnormal vascular loop, neoplastic growth, or multiple sclerosis plaque.\n\n(Choice A) Inflammatory degradation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can lead to TMJ disorder, which often causes pain with jaw movement (eg, chewing). However, pain due to the TMJ is classically dull and waxing and waning rather than neuropathic (eg, shock-like). Clicking/popping noises with jaw movement are common, as are ear-related symptoms (eg, ear pain, stuffiness, tinnitus).\n\n(Choice C) Reactivation of herpes zoster virus in a sensory ganglion can lead to herpetic neuralgia, which can impact CN V. Dermatomal pain can precede development of the classic vesicular rash by several days. However, seconds-long paroxysms of pain triggered by eating and unaccompanied by a rash after a month are more consistent with TN.\n\n(Choice D) Herpesvirus-mediated inflammatory demyelination may underlie the development of Bell palsy (idiopathic palsy of the facial nerve [CN VII]). However, this usually does not cause pain but instead results in unilateral facial weakness. In TN, demyelination and atrophy are due to compression of the nerve root.",
    "zh": "该患者出现左侧面部单侧、间歇性、电击样疼痛，持续数秒，并由轻微刺激（如咀嚼）诱发，很可能患有三叉神经痛 (TN) {{exhibit_1}}。TN的特征性临床表现包括：\n\n*  阵发性剧烈神经性疼痛发作（如电击样、刺痛），持续几秒钟到2分钟\n*  单侧疼痛，主要涉及三叉神经 (CN V) 的 V2 和 V3 分支分布区域\n*  无害诱因（例如，咀嚼、说话、刷牙）和异痛（轻触引起的疼痛）\n*  检查中无其他神经功能缺损\n\nTN的病理生理学似乎与三叉神经根进入脑桥时受压有关，导致神经脱髓鞘和萎缩。压迫最常由于异常血管袢、肿瘤生长或多发性硬化斑块引起。\n\n(选项A) 颞下颌关节 (TMJ) 的炎症性退变可导致 TMJ 疾病，这通常会导致下颌运动（如咀嚼）时出现疼痛。然而，由 TMJ 引起的疼痛通常是钝痛，呈进行性和缓解，而不是神经性疼痛（如电击样）。下颌运动时出现咔哒/弹响声很常见，与耳朵相关的症状（如耳痛、闷胀、耳鸣）也很常见。\n\n(选项C) 感觉神经节内的带状疱疹病毒再激活可导致疱疹性神经痛，可影响 CN V。皮节性疼痛可在典型水疱性皮疹出现前数天发生。然而，由进食诱发的、持续数秒钟的阵发性疼痛，且持续一个月后没有皮疹，更符合 TN。\n\n(选项D) 疱疹病毒介导的炎症性脱髓鞘可能导致贝尔氏麻痹（面神经 [CN VII] 的特发性麻痹）的发展。然而，这通常不会引起疼痛，而是导致单侧面部无力。在 TN 中，脱髓鞘和萎缩是由于神经根受压引起的。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of trigeminal neuralgia, its clinical presentation, and underlying pathophysiology related to nerve compression. It requires differentiating trigeminal neuralgia from other causes of facial pain.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the characteristic features of trigeminal neuralgia (paroxysmal, unilateral, triggered by innocuous stimuli) and understand the common mechanism of nerve root compression. Rule out other conditions based on their distinct clinical features.",
