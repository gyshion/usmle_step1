    "en": "This patient with sinusitis is found to have a markedly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count with an increase in myeloid precursor forms on peripheral blood smear. The differential diagnosis is chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (uncontrolled mature granulocyte production, mostly neutrophils but also basophils and eosinophils) or leukemoid reaction (over-exuberant WBC response associated with bacterial infection or malignancy, among others). Both cause an ELEVATED WBC count (>50,000/mm3) with an increase in precursor forms (eg, bands, metamyelocytes, myelocytes). However, the enzyme leukocyte (neutrophil) alkaline phosphatase is decreased in CML (as seen in this patient) because the WBCs are cytochemically abnormal; by contrast, it is normal or elevated in a leukemoid reaction (Choice I).\n\nOther clues to the diagnosis of CML are the predominance of myelocytes compared to more mature forms such as metamyelocytes (\"myelocyte bulge\") and the absolute basophilia and eosinophilia. CML is confirmed by demonstration of the Philadelphia chromosome (translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22) or the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene or mRNA. Immature blast cells (eg, myeloblasts, promyelocytes) are typically <2%. Management generally includes a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n\n(Choice A) This patient has an abnormality of myeloid (not lymphoid) cells and his smear shows only 1% blasts. In general, >25% bone marrow lymphoblasts are seen in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is much more common in young children.\n\n(Choice B) Acute myelogenous leukemia is the most common acute leukemia in adults. However, the mean age at diagnosis is around 65, and most patients will have a WBC count of about 15,000-20,000/mm3 with a significant increase in blast cells (eg, ≥20%) rather than the 1% seen in this patient.\n\n(Choices C, F, and G) Follicular lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cause lymph node and/or soft-tissue (not peripheral blood) abnormalities. In addition, these cancers are all lymphoid, not myeloid, in nature.\n\n(Choice D) Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia have increased circulating mature lymphoid cells, not increased myeloid cells.\n\n(Choices H and J) Parasitic superinfection (which can lead to eosinophilia) and fungal infection would not explain the predominance of myeloid neutrophil precursor forms in this patient.\n\nEducational objective:\nChronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and leukemoid reaction can have presentations similar to leukocytosis; however, leukocyte (neutrophil) alkaline phosphatase level is normal or elevated in a leukemoid reaction but decreased in CML. The definitive diagnosis of CML requires demonstration of the Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22) or BCR-ABL fusion gene or mRNA.",
    "zh": "这位患有鼻窦炎的患者被发现外周血涂片中白细胞（WBC）计数显着升高，并伴有髓系前体细胞增加。鉴别诊断是慢性髓细胞性白血病（CML）（不受控制的成熟粒细胞生成，主要为中性粒细胞，但也包括嗜碱性粒细胞和嗜酸性粒细胞）或类白血病反应（过度活跃的WBC反应，与其他因素一样，与细菌感染或恶性肿瘤相关）。两者都会导致白细胞计数升高（>50,000/mm3），并伴有前体细胞增加（例如，杆状核细胞、晚幼粒细胞、中幼粒细胞）。然而，CML患者的白细胞（中性粒细胞）碱性磷酸酶活性降低（如本例患者所示），因为白细胞在细胞化学上异常；相比之下，类白血病反应中其活性正常或升高（选项I）。\n\nCML诊断的其他线索包括中幼粒细胞相对于晚幼粒细胞等更成熟形式的占优势（“中幼粒细胞膨胀”）以及绝对性嗜碱性粒细胞增多症和嗜酸性粒细胞增多症。CML通过证实费城染色体（9号染色体和22号染色体之间的易位）或BCR-ABL1融合基因或mRNA来确诊。未成熟的原始细胞（例如，成髓细胞、早幼粒细胞）通常<2%。治疗通常包括酪氨酸激酶抑制剂。\n\n（选项A）该患者有髓系（而非淋巴系）细胞异常，并且其涂片仅显示1%的原始细胞。一般来说，在急性淋巴细胞白血病中可以看到>25%的骨髓淋巴母细胞，这种疾病在幼儿中更为常见。\n\n（选项B）急性髓细胞性白血病是成人中最常见的急性白血病。然而，诊断时的平均年龄约为65岁，大多数患者的白细胞计数约为15,000-20,000/mm3，原始细胞显着增加（例如，≥20%），而不是本例患者中看到的1%。\n\n（选项C、F和G）滤泡性淋巴瘤、伯基特淋巴瘤和弥漫性大B细胞淋巴瘤会导致淋巴结和/或软组织（而非外周血）异常。此外，这些癌症的性质均为淋巴系，而非髓系。\n\n（选项D）慢性淋巴细胞白血病患者的循环成熟淋巴细胞增加，而非髓系细胞增加。\n\n（选项H和J）寄生虫超感染（可能导致嗜酸性粒细胞增多症）和真菌感染并不能解释该患者髓系中性粒细胞前体细胞的占优势。\n\n教育目标：\n慢性髓细胞性白血病（CML）和类白血病反应的临床表现可能与白细胞增多症相似；然而，类白血病反应中的白细胞（中性粒细胞）碱性磷酸酶水平正常或升高，但在CML中降低。CML的明确诊断需要证实费城染色体t(9;22)或BCR-ABL融合基因或mRNA。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and its distinguishing features from other leukocytosis-causing conditions, particularly leukemoid reaction. It assesses the ability to interpret peripheral blood smear findings and understand the significance of leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) levels.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the elevated WBC count with myeloid precursors, the low LAP score, and the presence of basophilia and eosinophilia. These findings point towards CML, which can be confirmed with further testing for the Philadelphia chromosome.",
