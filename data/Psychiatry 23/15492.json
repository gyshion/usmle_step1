    "en": "A 28-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 1, comes to the office for a 6-week postpartum checkup following an uncomplicated delivery. The patient reports feeling increasingly fatigued and having little energy for the past few weeks. She feels very anxious about being a new mother and has been getting up multiple times at night to check on the baby when he is sleeping. She tends to skip meals and says, \"I don't have time to sit and eat—I can't even find the time to shower.\" Although the baby is healthy and doing well, the patient berates herself for being a \"terrible mother.\" She becomes tearful during the interview and says, \"I don't know why I keep crying when I should be so happy.\" Physical examination is normal. The patient has no suicidal ideation or thoughts of harming the baby.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's persistent depressive symptoms at her 6-week postpartum visit (increasing fatigue/low energy, depressed mood/frequent tearfulness, sleep disturbance, poor appetite, feelings of worthlessness) are concerning for POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION (PPD). PPD is diagnosed using the same diagnostic criteria used to diagnose a MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODE (≥2 weeks of at least 5 of 9 symptoms that include DEPRESSED MOOD plus SIGECAPS: Sleep disturbance, loss of Interest, Guilt/worthlessness, low Energy, impaired Concentration, change in Appetite, Psychomotor retardation or agitation, and Suicidal thoughts). PPD is common, and all patients should be screened for postpartum depression at the 6-week postpartum visit. Untreated postpartum depression is associated with impaired maternal-infant bonding and negatively impacts both maternal and infant health.\n\n(Choice A) In acute stress disorder, exposure to a life-threatening trauma results in symptoms of reexperiencing (ie, intrusive memories, flashbacks), avoidance of reminders, negative mood, dissociation, and hyperarousal. This patient had an uncomplicated delivery, and her symptoms are more consistent with a major depressive episode.\n\n(Choice B) Although being a new parent is a significant stressor, adjustment disorder is diagnosed only if symptoms do not meet the criteria for another specific disorder, such as major depressive disorder.\n\n(Choice C) This patient's anxiety revolves around her ability to parent and is a common feature of patients with PPD. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by pervasive anxiety about multiple issues lasting ≥6 months.\n\n(Choice D) Mild sadness and anxiety are commonly experienced by mothers in response to the stress of taking care of a newborn (ie, postpartum blues). This normal and self-limited response typically peaks at 5 days postpartum and resolves within 2 weeks. However, this patient's symptoms have persisted beyond 2 weeks and are sufficient in number and severity to diagnose major depression.\n\nEducational objective: Postpartum depression is diagnosed using the same diagnostic criteria used for major depressive episodes that occur outside the postpartum period. It should be differentiated from postpartum blues, which is a milder and self-limited form of depression that peaks at 5 days and resolves within 2 weeks.",
    "zh": "该患者在产后6周复诊时持续存在的抑郁症状（疲劳/低能量增加、情绪低落/频繁流泪、睡眠障碍、食欲不振、无价值感）提示产后抑郁症 (PPD)。PPD 使用与诊断重度抑郁发作相同的诊断标准（至少持续2周，至少有9个症状中的5个，包括情绪低落，以及 SIGECAPS：睡眠障碍、对事物的兴趣丧失、内疚/无价值感、精力低下、注意力受损、食欲改变、精神运动迟滞或激越和自杀念头）。PPD很常见，所有患者都应在产后6周复诊时筛查产后抑郁症。未经治疗的产后抑郁症与母婴情感联系受损有关，并对母亲和婴儿的健康产生负面影响。\n\n（选项 A）在急性应激障碍中，暴露于危及生命的创伤会导致再体验症状（即，侵入性记忆、闪回）、避免提醒、负面情绪、解离和过度警觉。该患者分娩顺利，其症状更符合重度抑郁发作。\n\n（选项 B）虽然成为新父母是一个重要的应激源，但只有当症状不符合其他特定疾病（如重度抑郁症）的标准时，才能诊断为适应障碍。\n\n（选项 C）该患者的焦虑围绕着她为人父母的能力，这是PPD患者的常见特征。广泛性焦虑症的特征是持续存在对多个问题的焦虑，持续≥6个月。\n\n（选项 D）母亲在应对照顾新生儿的压力时通常会经历轻度的悲伤和焦虑（即，产后忧郁）。这种正常且自限性反应通常在产后5天达到高峰，并在2周内缓解。然而，该患者的症状已持续超过2周，并且在数量和严重程度上足以诊断为重度抑郁症。\n\n教育目标：产后抑郁症的诊断标准与产后期间以外发生的重度抑郁发作所使用的诊断标准相同。应将其与产后忧郁症区分开来，产后忧郁症是一种较轻且自限性的抑郁症，在5天达到高峰并在2周内缓解。"

It requires understanding the diagnostic criteria for major depressive episodes and their application in the postpartum period.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully review the patient's symptoms, noting their duration and severity. Compare these symptoms against the diagnostic criteria for postpartum blues, adjustment disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, acute stress disorder, and postpartum depression.
