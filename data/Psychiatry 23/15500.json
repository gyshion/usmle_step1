    "en": "A 31-year-old woman comes to the office for a yearly checkup. The patient has no medical conditions but expresses dissatisfaction with her appearance and wishes she could lose weight more easily. She reports occasional constipation and fatigue. The patient exercises daily and drinks 1 or 2 glasses of wine 2-3 times a week when socializing with friends. Weight is 58.1 kg (128 lb) and height is 157.5 cm (5 ft 2 in). BMI is 23.4 kg/m^2. Routine laboratory evaluation shows a potassium level of 3.1 mEq/L. Physical examination is most likely to show which of the following abnormalities?",

    "en": "Hypokalemia in an otherwise healthy young adult with a normal BMI and preoccupation with body shape and weight is concerning for self-induced vomiting associated with BULIMIA NERVOSA (BN). BN is characterized by repeated episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors (eg, vomiting, laxative use, fasting, excessive exercise) to prevent weight gain. Because patients may not be forthcoming about their eating behavior due to embarrassment, physical examination and laboratory assessment can assist in making the diagnosis. Painless bilateral PAROTID GLAND ENLARGEMENT due to repetitive vomiting is a common finding.\n\nOther signs of BN include tachycardia, hypotension, dry skin, calluses or scarring on the dorsum of the hand (Russell sign), and erosion of dental enamel. Common electrolyte abnormalities in BN include hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.\n\n(Choices A, B, and D) BN is more commonly associated with tachycardia, dry skin, and hypotension rather than bradycardia (typically seen in anorexia nervosa), diaphoresis, and hypertension.\n\n(Choice C) Goiter can be asymptomatic or associated with symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism can present with fatigue and constipation but would not explain this patient's hypokalemia.\n\n(Choice E) Lanugo hair growth (soft, downy hair typical of newborns) more commonly occurs in anorexia nervosa due to malnutrition.\n\n(Choice F) A malar (butterfly) rash is a characteristic finding in systemic lupus erythematosus, a condition often associated with fatigue. However, other typical findings, including fever, weight loss, and myalgias, are not present in this patient.\n\nEducational objective:\nHypokalemia in an otherwise healthy young adult with a normal BMI and preoccupation with body size is concerning for self-induced vomiting associated with bulimia nervosa. Common physical examination findings in bulimia nervosa include tachycardia, hypotension, painless bilateral parotid gland swelling, calluses or scarring on the dorsum of the hand, and erosion of dental enamel.",
    "zh": "在其他方面健康的年轻成年人中，BMI正常，但专注于体型和体重，且出现低钾血症，提示与神经性贪食症（BN）相关的自我诱发呕吐。BN的特征是反复的暴食发作，随后出现代偿行为（例如，呕吐、使用泻药、禁食、过度运动）以防止体重增加。由于患者可能因尴尬而不会坦诚其进食行为，体格检查和实验室评估有助于做出诊断。由于反复呕吐引起的无痛性双侧腮腺肿大是常见发现。\n\nBN的其他体征包括心动过速、低血压、皮肤干燥、手背上的老茧或瘢痕（Russell征）和牙釉质腐蚀。BN中常见的电解质异常包括低钾血症和代谢性碱中毒。\n\n（选项A、B和D）BN更常见于心动过速、皮肤干燥和低血压，而不是心动过缓（通常见于神经性厌食症）、出汗和高血压。\n\n（选项C）甲状腺肿可无症状或与甲状腺功能减退或甲状腺功能亢进的症状相关。甲状腺功能减退可表现为疲劳和便秘，但这并不能解释该患者的低钾血症。\n\n（选项E）毳毛生长（新生儿典型的柔软绒毛）更常见于神经性厌食症，是由于营养不良所致。\n\n（选项F）颧部（蝴蝶形）皮疹是系统性红斑狼疮的特征性发现，这种情况通常与疲劳有关。但是，该患者未出现其他典型发现，包括发烧、体重减轻和肌痛。\n\n教育目标：\n在其他方面健康的年轻成年人中，BMI正常，但专注于体型，出现低钾血症，提示与神经性贪食症相关的自我诱发呕吐。神经性贪食症常见的体格检查结果包括心动过速、低血压、无痛性双侧腮腺肿胀、手背上的老茧或瘢痕以及牙釉质腐蚀。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation and physical examination findings associated with bulimia nervosa, particularly in the context of hypokalemia in a young adult with a normal BMI.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the constellation of symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of an eating disorder, specifically bulimia nervosa, and then correlating these with the characteristic physical examination abnormalities.",
