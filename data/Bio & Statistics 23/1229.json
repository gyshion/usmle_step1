  "explanation": {
    "en": "The sensitivity of a test determines how well the test categorizes patients who have the disease of interest. Tests with higher sensitivity have an increased probability of assigning a positive test result to those patients who truly have the disease; these are considered true positives (rightmost part of the curve). Conversely, patients who test negative even though they have the disease are considered false negatives (leftmost part of the curve).\n\nTrue positives (TP) and false negatives (FN) are complementary (ie, an increase in one parameter is exactly offset by a decrease in the other, such that the total is always equal to the number of confirmed patients). As such, the test sensitivity and number of patients with the disease can be used to calculate the number of each.\n\nTP = (Sensitivity) × (Number of patients with the disease)\nFN = (1 – Sensitivity) × (Number of patients with the disease)\n\nIn this case, the sensitivity of the test is 75% and the total number of patients with confirmed acute myocardial infarction is 200. Therefore, a test that is 75% sensitive will correctly classify 75% of the patients as positive (TP) and incorrectly classify 25% of the patients (1 – Sensitivity) as negative (FN).\n\nUsing this information, the number of FN can be calculated as follows (alternate method):\nFN = (1 – Sensitivity) × (Number of patients with the disease) = (1 – 0.75) × 200 = 50\n\nEducational objective:\nWhen undergoing diagnostic testing, patients with the disease can test positive (true positive, TP) or negative (false negative, FN). The sensitivity of a test determines the proportion of patients that are correctly classified. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nTP = (Sensitivity) × (Number of patients with the disease)\nFN = (1 – Sensitivity) × (Number of patients with the disease)",
    "zh": "一项检测的敏感性决定了该检测方法对患有相关疾病的患者的分类效果。敏感性较高的检测方法更有可能对真正患有该疾病的患者给出阳性检测结果；这些被认为是真阳性（曲线的最右端部分）。相反，即使患有该疾病但检测结果为阴性的患者被认为是假阴性（曲线的最左端部分）。\n\n真阳性（TP）和假阴性（FN）是互补的（即，一个参数的增加正好被另一个参数的减少所抵消，使得总数始终等于确诊患者的数量）。因此，可以使用检测的敏感性和患有该疾病的患者数量来计算每个数量。\n\nTP = (敏感度) × (患病患者数量)\nFN = (1 – 敏感度) × (患病患者数量)\n\n在这种情况下，该检测的敏感性为75%，确诊为急性心肌梗死的患者总数为200。因此，一项敏感度为75%的检测将正确地将75%的患者分类为阳性（TP），并将25%的患者（1 – 敏感度）错误地分类为阴性（FN）。\n\n使用这些信息，可以按如下方式计算FN（备选方法）：\nFN = (1 – 敏感度) × (患病患者数量) = (1 – 0.75) × 200 = 50\n\n教育目标：\n当接受诊断性检测时，患有该疾病的患者可能检测结果呈阳性（真阳性，TP）或阴性（假阴性，FN）。一项检测的敏感性决定了被正确分类的患者的比例。{{exhibit_1}}\n\nTP = (敏感度) × (患病患者数量)\nFN = (1 – 敏感度) × (患病患者数量)"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of test characteristics, specifically the definition and calculation of false negatives based on sensitivity. It requires applying the formula for false negatives and understanding how sensitivity relates to true positives and false negatives in a diagnostic test.\n\nTo solve this type of question, first identify the key variables provided (sensitivity, number of patients with the disease). Then, apply the correct formula: FN = (1 – Sensitivity) × (Number of patients with the disease) to calculate the number of false negatives.",
