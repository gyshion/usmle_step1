    "en": "Primary amebic meningoencephalitis is a rare, highly fatal condition caused by the free-living, flagellated protozoan *Naegleria fowleri*. This pathogen resides in warm fresh water (30-45 C) and moist soil. Humans are primarily exposed when the organism comes into contact with nasal mucosa during recreational water activities (eg, swimming, diving, water skiing, unchlorinated hot tub bathing). Although serologic evidence of exposure is widespread, only a small number of individuals develop invasive disease (~300 known cases).\n\nPatients typically have rapidly progressive meningeal signs, cranial nerve deficits, and confusion. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis with wet mount can usually identify motile trophozoites. Although treatment should be attempted, almost all patients die within 2-3 days.\n\n(Choice A) Rabies migrates centrally through peripheral nerves to the spinal cord and then rapidly ascends to the brain. Patients with rabies usually have preceding history of animal bite; furthermore, rabies is a virus, not an amoeba, and it generally presents with several days of constitutional symptoms followed by fever, hydrophobia, and pharyngeal spasm.\n\n(Choice B) Most bacterial and fungal causes of meningitis enter the brain via the hematologic dissemination (eg, basilar artery). Although meningeal signs, vomiting, and headache frequently occur, amoebas would not be seen in the cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n(Choices C and D) The oculomotor and optic nerve do not generally transmit infections into the brain; the herpes virus can travel via the trigeminal nerve (not labeled) into the brain, leading to temporal lobe encephalitis.\n\nEducational objective: Primary amebic encephalitis occurs when the free-living, motile protozoan *Naegleria fowleri* penetrates the olfactory mucosa and migrates in a retrograde fashion through the olfactory nerve to the brain. This rare, deadly infection primarily occurs after exposure to warm, fresh water during recreational activities. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "原发性阿米巴脑膜脑炎是一种罕见且高度致命的疾病，由自由生活的鞭毛原生动物福氏耐格里虫（*Naegleria fowleri*）引起。这种病原体存在于温暖的淡水（30-45°C）和湿润的土壤中。人类主要在进行休闲水上活动（如游泳、潜水、滑水、未氯化的热水浴）时，该生物体接触鼻粘膜。虽然接触的血清学证据广泛存在，但只有少数人会发展为侵袭性疾病（约300例已知病例）。\n\n患者通常有快速进展的脑膜体征、颅神经功能缺损和意识模糊。湿片法的脑脊液分析通常可以识别运动的滋养体。尽管应该尝试治疗，但几乎所有患者都会在2-3天内死亡。\n\n（选项 A）狂犬病通过周围神经中枢移行至脊髓，然后迅速上升到大脑。狂犬病患者通常有动物咬伤史；此外，狂犬病是一种病毒，而不是阿米巴，并且通常表现为数天的全身症状，随后出现发烧、恐水症和咽痉挛。\n\n（选项 B）大多数细菌性和真菌性脑膜炎通过血液传播进入大脑（例如，基底动脉）。尽管经常出现脑膜刺激征、呕吐和头痛，但在脑脊液中不会看到阿米巴。\n\n（选项 C 和 D）动眼神经和视神经通常不会将感染传播到大脑；单纯疱疹病毒可以通过三叉神经（未标记）进入大脑，导致颞叶脑炎。\n\n教育目标：当自由生活的、有动力的原生动物福氏耐格里虫（*Naegleria fowleri*）穿透嗅觉粘膜，并通过嗅神经以逆行方式迁移到大脑时，就会发生原发性阿米巴脑炎。这种罕见且致命的感染主要发生在休闲活动期间接触温暖的淡水后。 {{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathogenesis of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) caused by Naegleria fowleri, specifically the route of entry into the central nervous system. It requires understanding how the amoeba reaches the brain and causes infection.\n\nThe best approach is to recall the association of Naegleria fowleri with warm freshwater environments and recreational water activities. Knowing that the amoeba enters through the nasal mucosa and travels along the olfactory nerve to the brain is key to answering this question correctly.",
