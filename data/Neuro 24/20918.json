    "en": "A 55-year-old woman is brought to the office by her husband for evaluation of strange behavior. She has been spending large amounts of money to buy expensive clothes and jewelry. The patient has also offered sex to unknown men in the neighborhood and has become increasingly indifferent toward her family, whom she used to care deeply. She usually drinks 1 or 2 glasses of wine on weekends but lately has been drinking 2 or 3 glasses almost every day. When asked about these changes during the interview, the patient states that she has not noticed any change in her behavior. Vital signs are normal. The general physical and neurologic examinations are normal. This patient's condition is most likely due to abnormal accumulation of which of the following?",

    "en": "This patient with disinhibition (eg, soliciting sex from strangers), loss of empathy toward her family, complex compulsive behaviors (eg, excessive shopping), and hyperorality (eg, increase in drinking wine) likely has frontotemporal dementia (FTD). FTD is characterized by degeneration of the prefrontal cortex, which progresses to include the anterior temporal lobes. The disease process results in accumulation of different neurotoxic proteins, including:\n\n• Tau, a protein associated with neuronal microtubules that normally takes part in microtubule stabilization. In patients with FTD, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and disassociates from the microtubules, which may lead to instability and disrupted axonal transport. It also forms paired helical filaments, which create intracellular tangled clumps of tau proteins predominantly in the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as the hippocampi. Tau-related neurofibrillary tangles are also found in patients with Alzheimer dementia.\n\n• TDP-43 (transactive response DNA-binding protein 43), a protein that normally functions as a transcription inhibitor or a DNA repair protein. Abnormal ubiquitination leads to immunoreactive inclusions of TDP-43. Pathologic TDP-43 is also found in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\n(Choices A and C) CAG trinucleotide (polyglutamine) repeats can lead to neurotoxic protein formation. When this occurs in the ataxin genes, it can lead to spinocerebellar ataxia. When it occurs in the huntingtin protein, it leads to Huntington disease, which can present with prominent changes in mood or cognition. However, both spinocerebellar ataxia and Huntington disease also typically present with significant gait abnormalities (ie, ataxia).\n\n(Choice B) Extracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid occurs in Alzheimer disease. Alzheimer disease commonly presents with early and prominent memory impairment with language deficits and spatial disorientation. Although personality changes can occur, they typically occur later in the disease process. This patient's early personality changes are more characteristic of FTD.\n\n(Choice D) Excessive prion accumulation causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Although behavioral changes are common, dementia is rapidly progressive and associated with myoclonus and/or seizures.",
    "zh": "这位患者表现出失抑制（例如，向陌生人提供性服务）、对家人缺乏同情心、复杂的强迫行为（例如，过度购物）和口欲过度（例如，饮酒增加），很可能患有额颞叶痴呆 (FTD)。 FTD的特征是前额叶皮质退变，并逐渐扩展到前颞叶。 疾病过程导致不同神经毒性蛋白的积聚，包括：\n\n• Tau蛋白，一种与神经元微管相关的蛋白质，通常参与微管的稳定。 在 FTD 患者中，tau蛋白变得过度磷酸化并从微管中分离，这可能导致不稳定和轴突转运受损。 它还会形成成对的螺旋状丝，形成细胞内缠结的tau蛋白团块，主要位于额叶和颞叶，以及海马体。 与 tau 相关的神经原纤维缠结也存在于阿尔茨海默病患者中。\n\n• TDP-43（反式反应DNA结合蛋白43），一种通常用作转录抑制剂或DNA修复蛋白的蛋白质。 异常的泛素化导致TDP-43的免疫反应性包涵体。 病理性 TDP-43 也存在于肌萎缩侧索硬化症患者中。\n\n（选项 A 和 C）CAG 三核苷酸（多聚谷氨酰胺）重复序列可导致神经毒性蛋白的形成。 当这种情况发生在共济蛋白基因中时，可导致脊髓小脑性共济失调。 当它发生在亨廷廷蛋白中时，会导致亨廷顿病，亨廷顿病可表现为情绪或认知方面的明显变化。 然而，脊髓小脑性共济失调和亨廷顿病通常也表现出显着的步态异常（即，共济失调）。\n\n（选项 B）阿尔茨海默病中发生细胞外β-淀粉样蛋白的积聚。 阿尔茨海默病通常表现为早期和明显的记忆障碍，伴有语言缺陷和空间定向障碍。 尽管会出现人格改变，但它们通常发生在疾病过程的后期。 这位患者早期的性格改变更符合FTD。\n\n（选项 D）过度的朊病毒积聚会导致克雅病。 尽管行为改变很常见，但痴呆症进展迅速，并伴有肌阵挛和/或癫痫发作。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and the underlying neuropathological protein accumulations associated with it. It requires differentiating FTD from other neurodegenerative diseases based on the pattern of cognitive and behavioral changes.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the constellation of behavioral and personality changes as indicative of FTD. Then, recall the specific proteins that accumulate in FTD, particularly TDP-43 and tau, and differentiate them from the protein aggregates seen in other neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer disease (beta-amyloid, tau), Huntington disease (polyglutamine), spinocerebellar ataxias (ataxin), and prion diseases.",
