    "en": "A 62-year-old man is brought to the office by his son due to memory impairment and frequent falls. The patient has been living alone since the death of his wife a year ago. His son, who is visiting from out of town, found his father in poor living conditions. The patient is forgetful and did not know the location of various items in his house, where he has lived for more than 20 years. His gait is also unsteady, and he had had several falls. The son says his father has always been \"a drinker\" and may have been drinking more recently. The patient is indifferent to his son's concerns and says he feels fine. Vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, bilateral lateral gaze palsy and nystagmus are present. Muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes are normal, but the gait is ataxic. On memory testing, he recalls 0 out of 3 objects after 5 minutes. A lesion of which of the following labeled structures on a normal brain MRI {{exhibit_1}} is most specifically associated with this patient's current condition?",

    "en": "This patient, with a suspected history of alcohol use disorder, has oculomotor dysfunction (nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia), ataxia, and encephalopathy (confusion, anterograde amnesia). This presentation is consistent with the classic triad of Wernicke encephalopathy (WE), a complication of thiamine (vitamin B₁) deficiency. \n\nThiamine is a cofactor for multiple enzymes involved in glucose metabolism; deficiency results in the brain's inability to use glucose and turn it into energy, leading to neuronal damage and necrosis. Areas of the brain with high metabolic demand are particularly susceptible; the mammillary bodies are nearly universally affected and demonstrate focal hemorrhage or atrophy on imaging. Other commonly involved areas include the thalamus, periaqueductal gray substance, and locus caeruleus.\n\nThiamine deficiency occurs most commonly in alcohol use disorder but can also manifest with any form of malnutrition (eg, anorexia, advanced malignancy). Infusion of dextrose-containing solutions without concurrent thiamine supplementation acutely lowers thiamine levels and can precipitate WE; however, some patients with severe deficiency can develop symptoms without a clear inciting event. The chronic effects of thiamine deficiency lead to Korsakoff syndrome, which is characterized by anterograde and retrograde amnesia, apathy, lack of insight, and confabulation. Attention, social behavior, and long-term memory are relatively preserved.\n\n(Choice A) Demyelination of the pons (central pontine myelinolysis) can occur with overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia. It can result in locked-in syndrome, in which patients can move their eyes but cannot move or verbally communicate. The pons is not typically involved in WE.\n\n(Choice C) The fornix is a bundle of axons originating from the hippocampal subiculum that projects to the mammillary bodies. Although it can (rarely) be involved in WE, the mammillary bodies are more specifically associated.\n\n(Choice D) The splenium of the corpus callosum is not typically affected in WE. Lesions (demyelinating or ischemic) in this structure will clinically result in alexia without agraphia.\n\n(Choice E) The pineal gland synthesizes melatonin and is involved in circadian rhythm; it is not typically involved in WE.\n\n(Choice F) Alcohol-associated cerebellar degeneration also causes ataxia but does not typically cause confusion or ophthalmoplegia. The cerebellum is less frequently involved in WE.\n\nEducational objective:\nWernicke encephalopathy is a complication of thiamine deficiency and is characterized by oculomotor dysfunction, encephalopathy, and ataxia. Chronic deficiency results in Korsakoff syndrome (eg, anterograde and retrograde amnesia, confabulation, apathy). Thiamine is involved in glucose metabolism, and areas of the brain with high metabolic demands are particularly susceptible; the mammillary bodies are most commonly affected. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者有疑似饮酒障碍病史，出现动眼神经功能障碍（眼球震颤、眼肌麻痹）、共济失调和脑病（意识模糊、顺行性遗忘）。这种表现与韦尼克脑病（WE）的经典三联征相符，韦尼克脑病是硫胺素（维生素B₁）缺乏症的并发症。\n\n硫胺素是参与葡萄糖代谢的多种酶的辅因子；缺乏会导致大脑无法利用葡萄糖并将其转化为能量，从而导致神经元损伤和坏死。大脑中代谢需求高的区域特别容易受到影响；乳头体几乎普遍受到影响，并在影像学上显示局灶性出血或萎缩。其他常见受累区域包括丘脑、导水管周围灰质和蓝斑核。\n\n硫胺素缺乏症最常见于酒精使用障碍，但也可能表现为任何形式的营养不良（例如，厌食症、晚期恶性肿瘤）。在没有同时补充硫胺素的情况下输注含葡萄糖的溶液会迅速降低硫胺素水平，并可能导致WE；然而，一些严重缺乏的患者可能会在没有明确诱发事件的情况下出现症状。硫胺素缺乏症的慢性影响会导致Korsakoff综合征，其特征是顺行性和逆行性遗忘、冷漠、缺乏洞察力和虚构。注意力、社会行为和长期记忆相对保留。\n\n(选项A) 桥脑脱髓鞘（中央性桥脑髓鞘溶解）可能发生在过度快速纠正慢性低钠血症时。它可能导致闭锁综合征，在这种综合征中，患者可以移动眼睛但无法移动或口头交流。桥脑通常不参与WE。\n\n(选项C) 穹窿是起源于海马回下部的轴突束，投射到乳头体。虽然它（很少）可能参与WE，但乳头体更具体相关。\n\n(选项D) 胼胝体压部通常不受WE影响。该结构的病变（脱髓鞘或缺血性）在临床上会导致无书写的失读症。\n\n(选项E) 松果体合成褪黑激素并参与昼夜节律；它通常不参与WE。\n\n(选项F) 酒精相关的脑小脑变性也会导致共济失调，但通常不会引起意识模糊或眼肌麻痹。小脑很少参与WE。\n\n教学目标：韦尼克脑病是硫胺素缺乏症的并发症，其特征是动眼神经功能障碍、脑病和共济失调。慢性缺乏会导致Korsakoff综合征（例如，顺行性和逆行性遗忘、虚构、冷漠）。硫胺素参与葡萄糖代谢，大脑中代谢需求高的区域特别容易受到影响；乳头体最常受到影响。 {{exhibit_2}}"

It also tests the link between thiamine deficiency and WE/Korsakoff syndrome.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic triad of WE, associate it with thiamine deficiency and alcohol use disorder, and then identify the mammillary bodies (structure B) as the most likely location of a lesion in this condition based on the MRI.",
