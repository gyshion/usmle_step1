He is diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the physician writes an order to begin aripiprazole \"2.0\" mg. The patient mistakenly receives 20 mg aripiprazole instead of 2 mg. This order is overlooked during the pharmacy review process, and the nurse fails to question it before administering aripiprazole to the patient.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Illegible orders and transcribing errors are preventable causes of medication errors. In this case, the medication error could be due to an unclear decimal point or a transcription error. Although the increased use of computerized physician order entry systems with drop-down menus for drug, dose, route, and frequency has reduced the incidence of these errors, the systems are not universally available. Physicians must write or enter orders clearly and specifically avoid using trailing zeros to prevent errors in dosage. Studies show that educational interventions to reduce the use of certain abbreviations (eg, QD, µg) and avoid trailing zeros lead to a significant decrease in transcription errors.\n\n(Choice A) Confirming the dosage with the patient may be helpful. However, it is an inadequate double-check due to many patients being unaware of their medication dosage or in a mental state (due to a psychiatric or medical condition) that may prevent them from thinking clearly about it.\n\n(Choice C) Because a particular medication may be available in different dosages, computerized checks with automated alerts may not consistently identify a higher dosage as an error. Computerized systems are helpful in eliminating illegible orders; identifying patients at high risk for an adverse event; and alerting physicians to medication allergies, drug interactions, and dosage limits.\n\n(Choice D) Eliminating trailing zeros entirely is a better option than reminding physicians to be careful placing decimal points.\n\n(Choices E and F) Hiring additional nursing and pharmacy staff to perform double-checks on each medication order would not be cost-effective and would not consistently detect handwritten notation errors, as individuals reviewing the orders may influence each other's opinion.\n\nEducational objective:\nAvoiding the use of unsafe abbreviations and trailing zeros in medication orders can help reduce the incidence of medication errors.",
    "zh": "字迹潦草的医嘱和转录错误是可预防的用药错误原因。在这种情况下，用药错误可能是由于小数点不清晰或转录错误引起的。尽管越来越多地使用带有药物、剂量、给药途径和给药频率下拉菜单的计算机化医生医嘱录入系统减少了这些错误的发生率，但这些系统并非普遍适用。医生必须清楚、具体地书写或录入医嘱，避免使用尾随零，以防止剂量错误。研究表明，减少某些缩写词（如 QD、µg）的使用并避免尾随零的教育干预措施可显著减少转录错误。\n\n（选项 A）与患者确认剂量可能有所帮助。然而，由于许多患者不了解他们的药物剂量，或者处于可能妨碍他们清晰思考的精神状态（由于精神病或医疗状况），因此这是一个不充分的复查。\n\n（选项 C）由于特定药物可能以不同的剂量提供，因此带有自动警报的计算机检查可能无法始终如一地将较高剂量识别为错误。计算机系统有助于消除字迹潦草的医嘱；识别发生不良事件的高危患者；并提醒医生注意药物过敏、药物相互作用和剂量限制。\n\n（选项 D）完全消除尾随零比提醒医生小心放置小数点更好。\n\n（选项 E 和 F）聘用额外的护理和药房人员来对每份药物医嘱进行复查，这在成本效益方面不可行，也不会始终如一地检测手写笔录错误，因为审查医嘱的个人可能会相互影响意见。\n\n教育目标：\n避免在药物医嘱中使用不安全的缩写词和尾随零有助于减少用药错误的发生率。"
