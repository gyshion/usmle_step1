    "en": "A 66-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to dizziness, dysarthria, and bilateral limb ataxia. His symptoms have been steadily worsening over the last 2 weeks. He has no other medical problems and takes no medications. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history and does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Chest x-ray shows a mass in his right lung. He is admitted to the hospital for evaluation, but his neurologic symptoms continue to progress. He dies several months later despite receiving appropriate treatment. Autopsy shows extensive cerebellar Purkinje cell degeneration. Which of the following best describes the etiology of this patient's neurologic condition?",

    "en": "The patient's presentation of progressive neurologic symptoms (dizziness, dysarthria, ataxia) in the setting of a lung mass, followed by autopsy findings of extensive cerebellar Purkinje cell degeneration, is highly suggestive of a PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROME. Specifically, subacute cerebellar degeneration is a well-recognized paraneoplastic syndrome, most commonly associated with SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER, but also seen with breast, ovarian, and uterine malignancies. The etiology is thought to be an immune response against tumor cells that cross-reacts with Purkinje neuron antigens, leading to DEGENERATION of the cerebellum. Antibodies such as ANTI-YO, ANTI-P/Q, and ANTI-HU are often detected in the serum. Therefore, the underlying etiology is AUTOIMMUNE.\n\n(Choice B) Endocrine causes of neurologic symptoms are possible, but the constellation of symptoms and autopsy findings in this case are not typical for endocrine disorders. While some paraneoplastic syndromes involve ectopic hormone production (e.g., Cushing syndrome from ACTH production), the primary mechanism in cerebellar degeneration is immune-mediated.\n\n(Choice C) Infectious causes of cerebellar degeneration (e.g., viral encephalitis) are less likely given the subacute onset and progression over weeks, and the presence of a lung mass. While some infections can cause cerebellar symptoms, the autopsy finding of Purkinje cell degeneration in the context of a lung malignancy points away from a primary infectious etiology.\n\n(Choice D) Metastatic disease to the cerebellum can cause progressive neurologic symptoms. However, autopsy findings would typically show malignant cells within the cerebellar tissue, often with surrounding inflammation, rather than widespread Purkinje cell degeneration as the primary pathology. While the lung mass is metastatic, the neurologic degeneration is a separate paraneoplastic phenomenon.\n\n(Choice E) Toxic causes of cerebellar dysfunction exist (e.g., alcohol, certain medications), but the patient's history does not suggest significant toxic exposure. Furthermore, the specific finding of Purkinje cell degeneration is more characteristic of paraneoplastic syndromes than common toxic insults.\n\n(Choice F) Cerebellar infarction can cause ataxia and other neurologic deficits. However, infarction typically presents more acutely and would show evidence of ischemic necrosis on autopsy, not diffuse Purkinje cell degeneration. While vascular events can cause progressive neurologic decline, the specific pathology described points to an immune-mediated process.\n\nKey clinical pearls:\n- Paraneoplastic syndromes are disorders that occur as a result of a tumor but are not directly caused by the tumor's invasion, metastasis, or secretion of hormones.\n- Neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes are often immune-mediated, targeting neuronal antigens that are also expressed by the tumor.\n- Subacute cerebellar degeneration is a classic example, strongly associated with small cell lung cancer and characterized by anti-Yo, anti-P/Q, or anti-Hu antibodies.\n- The presence of a malignancy and progressive neurologic symptoms should raise suspicion for a paraneoplastic etiology.",
    "zh": "患者在肺部肿块的情况下出现进行性神经系统症状（头晕、构音障碍、共济失调），随后尸检结果显示广泛的小脑浦肯野细胞变性，这高度提示为副肿瘤综合征。具体而言，亚急性小脑变性是一种公认的副肿瘤综合征，最常见于小细胞肺癌，但也可见于乳腺癌、卵巢癌和子宫恶性肿瘤。其病因被认为是针对肿瘤细胞的免疫反应，与浦肯野神经元抗原发生交叉反应，导致小脑变性。血清中常可检测到抗Yo、抗P/Q和抗Hu等抗体。因此，其潜在病因是自身免疫。\n\n（选项 B）内分泌因素可能导致神经系统症状，但本例的症状组合和尸检结果并非内分泌疾病的典型表现。虽然一些副肿瘤综合征涉及异位激素产生（例如，ACTH 产生的库欣综合征），但小脑变性的主要机制是免疫介导。\n\n（选项 C）考虑到亚急性起病和数周内的进展，以及存在肺部肿块，感染性病因导致小脑变性的可能性较小。虽然某些感染可引起小脑症状，但尸检发现肺部恶性肿瘤背景下的浦肯野细胞变性表明其并非主要的感染性病因。\n\n（选项 D）转移至小脑的疾病可引起进行性神经系统症状。然而，尸检结果通常会在小脑组织内显示恶性细胞，且常伴有周围炎症，而不是广泛的浦肯野细胞变性作为主要病理表现。虽然肺部肿块是转移性的，但神经系统变性是一种单独的副肿瘤现象。\n\n（选项 E）小脑功能障碍的毒性原因存在（例如，酒精，某些药物），但患者病史并未提示明显的毒物暴露。此外，浦肯野细胞变性的特异性发现更符合副肿瘤综合征的特征，而不是常见的毒性损伤。\n\n（选项 F）小脑梗死可引起共济失调和其他神经功能缺损。然而，梗死通常表现得更急，并且会在尸检中显示缺血性坏死的证据，而不是弥漫性浦肯野细胞变性。虽然血管事件可导致进行性神经系统衰退，但所描述的特定病理表现指向免疫介导过程。\n\n关键临床要点：\n- 副肿瘤综合征是由于肿瘤而发生的疾病，但并非直接由肿瘤的侵袭、转移或激素分泌引起。\n- 神经系统副肿瘤综合征通常是免疫介导的，靶向肿瘤也表达的神经元抗原。\n- 亚急性小脑变性是一个经典例子，与小细胞肺癌密切相关，其特征是抗Yo、抗P/Q或抗Hu抗体。\n- 恶性肿瘤的存在和进行性神经系统症状应引起对副肿瘤病因的怀疑。"
