She has a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease. After a prolonged hospital course complicated by a pulmonary embolus, she is discharged on multiple medications, including a higher dose of her warfarin. The patient is scheduled for follow-up appointments with her internist, gynecologist, cardiologist, and gastroenterologist.

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The transition from hospital to outpatient care is a time of high risk for patients. Individuals with multiple medical problems, complex medication regimens, low health literacy, and poor social support are at particularly high risk. The most effective strategy for decreasing adverse outcomes and preventing avoidable readmissions is a structured approach that uses a comprehensive discharge checklist. The checklist should provide instructions at the appropriate literacy level and patient education materials to facilitate a successful transition from the hospital to the outpatient setting. Key elements of the discharge checklist include detailed instructions regarding medications (their purpose, dosing schedule, and adverse events), follow-up appointments with the primary care provider and any specialists, pending laboratory measurements or tests, and an emergency contact number with specific directions on when to call. Medication changes that have occurred during the hospitalization (eg, new medications, discontinued medications, changes in dose or frequency) should be clearly identified on the checklist to reduce the risk of medication errors.\n\n(Choice A) Although emphasizing the importance of adherence to treatment is beneficial, a detailed list with specific instructions regarding medications and follow-up that the patient can refer to at home would be more helpful. Patients are frequently overwhelmed by verbal information at the time of discharge and can benefit from a written checklist.\n\n(Choice B) Communication with outpatient specialists is an important component of the discharge process, but it does not help the patient manage the complex follow-up tasks required.\n\n(Choice C) A discharge summary is prepared by the hospital physician to document the hospital course and assist other medical providers and support staff in the care of the patient. It uses technical language that may be confusing to the patient. In contrast, the discharge instruction checklist uses simple and clear language intended to optimize patient understanding.\n\n(Choice E) Reviewing discharge instructions with the patient's daughter would be appropriate if the patient lived with her or if the daughter was helping the patient obtain medication or was providing transportation to follow-up appointments.",
    "zh": "从住院到门诊护理的过渡对患者来说是一个高风险时期。患有多种疾病、复杂的用药方案、文化程度低和社会支持不足的个体尤其面临高风险。减少不良后果和预防可避免的再入院的最有效策略是采用结构化方法，使用全面的出院清单。该清单应提供适当文化程度的说明和患者教育材料，以促进从医院到门诊的成功过渡。出院清单的关键要素包括关于药物的详细说明（其用途、给药时间表和不良事件）、与初级保健医生和任何专科医生的复诊预约、待进行的实验室测量或检查，以及紧急联系电话以及何时拨打电话的具体说明。住院期间发生的药物变化（例如，新药、停药、剂量或频率的变化）应在清单上清楚地标明，以降低用药错误的风险。\n\n（选项A）虽然强调治疗依从性的重要性是有益的，但一份包含有关药物和复诊的具体说明的详细清单，供患者在家参考会更有帮助。患者在出院时经常被口头信息淹没，可以从书面清单中受益。\n\n（选项B）与门诊专科医生的沟通是出院过程的重要组成部分，但它无助于患者管理所需的复杂后续任务。\n\n（选项C）出院小结由医院医生准备，用于记录住院病程，并协助其他医疗保健提供者和支持人员护理患者。它使用患者可能感到困惑的技术语言。相比之下，出院说明清单使用简单明了的语言，旨在优化患者的理解。\n\n（选项E）如果患者与女儿同住，或者女儿正在帮助患者获得药物或提供复诊交通工具，那么与患者的女儿一起审查出院说明是合适的。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of strategies to improve patient adherence to outpatient treatment after hospital discharge, particularly in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities and complex medication regimens. It emphasizes the importance of structured discharge planning and patient education.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the intervention that directly addresses the patient's potential challenges in managing their medications and follow-up appointments. A discharge checklist provides a clear and organized way for the patient to keep track of their medications and appointments, which is more effective than simply emphasizing adherence or providing a discharge summary.",
