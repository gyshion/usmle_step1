    "en": "A 44-year-old man comes to the office due to several weeks of difficulty walking and frequent falls. He has had no headache or visual impairment but reports episodes of sharp, stabbing pain in his extremities. The patient has HIV acquired from unprotected sexual contact and is nonadherent with treatments. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F). Neurologic examination shows 5/5 motor power in all extremities. Deep-tendon reflexes are absent at the knee and ankle bilaterally. Proprioception and vibration sensation are reduced throughout the lower extremities. He has a wide-based gait and a positive Romberg sign.",

    "en": "This patient's sensory ataxia and lancinating pains raise suspicion for TABES DORSALIS, a late form of NEUROSYPHILIS that usually manifests several years or decades after initial infection with Treponema pallidum. Tabes dorsalis is characterized by a slow degeneration of nerve fibers in the DORSAL COLUMN of the spinal cord and DORSAL NERVE ROOTS, which leads to diminished vibratory, proprioception, and discriminative touch sensation. Common manifestations include: Sensory ataxia: Wide-based gait and loss of equilibrium when the patient's eyes are closed (positive Romberg sign); due to damaged lower extremity proprioception. Absent deep-tendon reflexes: Due to damaged dorsal nerve roots. Lancinating pains: Sharp, stabbing pains that may last minutes or hours; the exact cause is unclear. Spirochetal damage to the midbrain tectum also commonly results in ARGYLL ROBERTSON PUPIL. This finding is marked by small, irregularly shaped pupils that fail to constrict to light but that constrict normally to accommodation (light-near dissociation). Most patients with tertiary syphilis will have a POSITIVE VDRL and mild lymphocytic pleocytosis on cerebrospinal fluid analysis.\n\n(Choice A) Central nervous system infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an acid-fast bacillus, is usually characterized by headache, vomiting, cranial nerve deficits, and confusion. Lancinating pains and altered lower extremity sensation would be atypical.\n\n(Choice B) Herpes simplex encephalitis primarily affects the temporal lobe and causes fever, headache, impaired consciousness, and seizures.\n\n(Choice C) Cryptococcal meningitis can be diagnosed by examining the cerebrospinal fluid for encapsulated yeasts using India ink. However, cryptococcal meningitis usually manifests with fever, malaise, and headache. Lancinating pains, absent deep-tendon reflexes, and altered sensation would be atypical.\n\n(Choice D) JC virus is a polyomavirus that replicates in oligodendrocytes (glial cells). Reactivation of JC virus causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which occurs primarily in severely immunocompromised patients (e.g., AIDS, lymphoma, leukemia) and causes progressive dementia, motor deficits, and visual impairment.\n\n(Choice F) Patients with untreated HIV are at high risk for cerebral toxoplasmosis, which usually manifests with headache, confusion, fever, and focal neurologic deficits. MRI of the brain usually reveals ring-enhancing lesions.\n\nEducational objective: Tabes dorsalis, a late form of neurosyphilis, causes progressive degeneration of the dorsal columns and dorsal roots of the spinal cord. Manifestations include loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation, severe lancinating pains, and sensory ataxia (eg, wide-based gait, positive Romberg sign). Many patients also have Argyll Robertson pupils.",
    "zh": "该患者的感觉性共济失调和刺痛提示TABES DORSALIS，这是一种迟发性神经梅毒，通常在感染梅毒螺旋体后数年或数十年出现。Tabes dorsalis的特征是脊髓后索和背根神经纤维的缓慢退变，导致振动觉、本体感觉和辨别性触觉减弱。常见表现包括：感觉性共济失调：患者闭眼时步态宽基和平衡失调（Romberg征阳性）；这是由于下肢本体感觉受损所致。深腱反射消失：由于背根神经受损所致。刺痛：尖锐、刺痛，可持续数分钟或数小时；确切病因尚不清楚。螺旋体对中脑盖的损伤也常导致ARGYLL ROBERTSON 瞳孔。此发现的特征是瞳孔小而不规则，对光线刺激无收缩反应，但对调节（光-近分离）收缩正常。大多数三期梅毒患者的脑脊液分析显示VDRL试验阳性和轻度淋巴细胞增多。\n\n(选项A) 结核分枝杆菌（一种抗酸杆菌）引起的中枢神经系统感染通常表现为头痛、呕吐、颅神经功能缺损和意识模糊。刺痛和下肢感觉改变不典型。\n\n(选项B) 单纯疱疹性脑炎主要影响颞叶，引起发热、头痛、意识障碍和癫痫发作。\n\n(选项C) 隐球菌性脑膜炎可以通过检查脑脊液中的包膜酵母菌来诊断，采用墨汁染色。然而，隐球菌性脑膜炎通常表现为发热、不适和头痛。刺痛、深腱反射消失和感觉改变不典型。\n\n(选项D) JC病毒是一种多瘤病毒，可在少突胶质细胞（神经胶质细胞）中复制。JC病毒再激活会导致进行性多灶性白质脑病，主要发生在严重免疫功能低下的患者（如艾滋病、淋巴瘤、白血病）中，并引起进行性痴呆、运动功能缺损和视力障碍。\n\n(选项F) 未经治疗的HIV患者发生脑弓形虫病的风险很高，通常表现为头痛、意识模糊、发热和局灶性神经功能缺损。脑部MRI通常显示环形增强病灶。\n\n教学目标：Tabes dorsalis，一种迟发性神经梅毒，会导致脊髓后索和背根进行性退变。表现包括本体感觉和振动觉丧失、严重的刺痛和感觉性共济失调（如步态宽基、Romberg征阳性）。许多患者也有Argyll Robertson瞳孔。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings associated with tabes dorsalis, a late manifestation of neurosyphilis, particularly in an immunocompromised patient.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recognize the constellation of symptoms including sensory ataxia, absent deep-tendon reflexes, and lancinating pains as indicative of dorsal column and dorsal root involvement, and then correlate these findings with the most likely diagnostic test for tertiary syphilis.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对tabes dorsalis（一种迟发性神经梅毒）相关的临床表现和诊断发现的理解，尤其是在免疫功能低下的患者中。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须认识到包括感觉性共济失调、深腱反射消失和刺痛等症状组合表明后索和背根受累，然后将这些发现与三期梅毒最有可能的诊断测试相关联。"
