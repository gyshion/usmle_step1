    "en": "A 62-year-old woman undergoes hip replacement surgery. The patient has a history of advanced hip osteoarthritis that limits her daily activities. She has no other medical conditions and no known drug allergies. After appropriate preoperative evaluation, total hip arthroplasty is performed under general anesthesia. The intraoperative course is uncomplicated, and after recovery from anesthesia, patient-controlled intravenous morphine is started for pain control. Several minutes later, the patient reports generalized itching. Physical examination reveals hypotension, tachycardia, and mild bilateral wheezing but no rashes.",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Opioids (eg, morphine) can generate a pseudoallergic response by directly stimulating MAST CELL DEGRANULATION, releasing HISTAMINE and other vasoactive mediators. This nonimmunologic reaction can cause itching, urticarial rash, wheezing, hypotension, and tachycardia that closely mimic true IgE-mediated type 1 hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylaxis). However, true IgE-mediated allergic reaction is rare with opioids (Choice D), and suggestive symptoms rarely indicate the need to avoid opioids altogether. Because direct mast cell degranulation tends to be most prominent with relatively low-potency opioids (eg, morphine, meperidine), a relatively high-potency opioid (eg, fentanyl) is usually better tolerated.\n\nOther drugs that can have a similar non-IgE-mediated effect on mast cell degranulation include vancomycin and radioiodide contrast.\n\n(Choice A) Halothane, an inhalation anesthetic, is rarely used but can cause hypotension via direct suppression of myocardial contractility. It is not associated with itching and wheezing.\n\n(Choice B) Because pain increases sympathetic output, opioid analgesia can reduce sympathetic output and thus decrease heart rate and blood pressure. However, this does not explain the itching and wheezing.\n\n(Choice E) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit cyclooxygenase, which leads to increased 5-lipoxygenase activity. This effect can precipitate bronchoconstriction and wheezing due to increased production of leukotrienes (ie, NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease); however, itching and hypotension are not expected.",
    "zh": "阿片类药物（如吗啡）可通过直接刺激肥大细胞脱颗粒，释放组胺和其他血管活性介质，从而产生假性过敏反应。这种非免疫学反应可引起瘙痒、荨麻疹、喘息、低血压和心动过速，这些症状与真正的IgE介导的1型超敏反应（如过敏反应）非常相似。然而，真正的IgE介导的过敏反应在阿片类药物中很少见（选项D），并且提示性症状很少表明需要完全避免阿片类药物。由于直接的肥大细胞脱颗粒往往在相对低效力的阿片类药物（如吗啡、哌替啶）中最为突出，因此相对高效力的阿片类药物（如芬太尼）通常耐受性更好。\n\n其他可能对肥大细胞脱颗粒有类似非IgE介导作用的药物包括万古霉素和放射碘造影剂。\n\n（选项A）氟烷，一种吸入性麻醉剂，很少使用，但可通过直接抑制心肌收缩力引起低血压。它与瘙痒和喘息无关。\n\n（选项B）由于疼痛会增加交感神经输出，阿片类镇痛药可以减少交感神经输出，从而降低心率和血压。然而，这并不能解释瘙痒和喘息。\n\n（选项E）非甾体抗炎药 (NSAIDs) 抑制环氧合酶，导致5-脂氧合酶活性增加。这种作用会由于白三烯产生增加而引起支气管收缩和喘息（即，NSAID加重的呼吸系统疾病）；然而，不预期出现瘙痒和低血压。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pseudoallergic reactions to opioids, specifically the mechanism of direct mast cell degranulation and histamine release. It also requires differentiating this reaction from true IgE-mediated allergic reactions and other potential causes of hypotension and wheezing.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the signs and symptoms of a pseudoallergic reaction (itching, wheezing, hypotension, tachycardia) following opioid administration. Understand that opioids can directly stimulate mast cell degranulation, leading to histamine release, and rule out other options based on their mechanisms of action and associated symptoms.",
    "zh": "本题考察对阿片类药物的假性过敏反应的认识，特别是肥大细胞直接脱颗粒和组胺释放的机制。它还需要将这种反应与真正的IgE介导的过敏反应以及其他可能导致低血压和喘息的原因区分开来。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要认识到阿片类药物给药后假性过敏反应的体征和症状（瘙痒、喘息、低血压、心动过速）。了解阿片类药物可以直接刺激肥大细胞脱颗粒，导致组胺释放，并根据其他选项的作用机制和相关症状排除其他选项。"
