    "en": "A 39-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to several episodes of severe upper abdominal pain. Her pain is triggered by fatty foods and resolves spontaneously. The symptoms first began a few months earlier after an uncomplicated pregnancy. Past medical history is notable for hypertension, for which the patient takes a calcium channel blocker, and hypertriglyceridemia, which is treated with a fibrate. Temperature is 37.2 C (98.9 F) and blood pressure is 143/76 mm Hg. The patient weighs 95 kg (210 lb) and is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall. Ultrasound reveals thickening of the gallbladder wall, with tenderness elicited by the ultrasound probe directly over the gallbladder. She undergoes a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, with multiple stones noted in the contents of the gallbladder. Decreased activity of which of the following enzymes would most likely have contributed to this patient's condition?",

    "en": "The patient presents with symptoms consistent with cholelithiasis (gallstones), specifically cholesterol gallstones, given the description of fatty food triggers and the presence of multiple stones in the gallbladder. The formation of cholesterol gallstones is a complex process influenced by several factors, including bile composition, gallbladder motility, and supersaturation of bile with cholesterol. \n\nFormation of cholesterol gallstones {{exhibit_1}} is primarily related to an imbalance in bile composition, specifically an excess of cholesterol relative to bile salts and phospholipids. Cholesterol is synthesized in the liver and secreted into bile. Bile salts are crucial for solubilizing cholesterol. When cholesterol levels in bile are too high, it can precipitate out, forming crystals that aggregate into gallstones. \n\nCholesterol 7α-hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol. Bile acids are essential for solubilizing cholesterol in bile. Therefore, decreased activity of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase leads to reduced bile acid synthesis, resulting in decreased solubilization of cholesterol in bile. This leads to cholesterol supersaturation of bile and promotes the formation of cholesterol gallstones. \n\nThe patient is being treated with a fibrate, which is known to inhibit cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. This inhibition reduces bile acid synthesis and can contribute to gallstone formation, especially in individuals predisposed to it. \n\n(Choice A) Aromatase is involved in estrogen synthesis. While estrogen can influence cholesterol metabolism and gallstone formation, aromatase itself is not directly involved in cholesterol synthesis or bile acid formation in a way that would be the primary cause of gallstones. \n\n(Choice B) β-glucuronidase is an enzyme that deconjugates bile acids and bilirubin. Its activity is more related to the formation of pigmented gallstones (bilirubin stones) rather than cholesterol gallstones. \n\n(Choices D and E) HMG-CoA reductase and thiolase are enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis. Decreased activity of these enzymes would lead to decreased cholesterol synthesis, which would be protective against cholesterol gallstone formation, not contributory. HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Thiolase is involved in the early steps of cholesterol synthesis. \n\nKey clinical pearls: Fibrates are known to increase the risk of gallstones by inhibiting cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. Cholesterol gallstones are the most common type and are related to supersaturation of bile with cholesterol.",
    "zh": "患者表现出的症状与胆石症（胆结石）一致，特别是胆固醇胆结石，因为描述了高脂食物的诱因以及胆囊中存在多个结石。胆固醇胆结石的形成是一个复杂的过程，受到多种因素的影响，包括胆汁成分、胆囊动力和胆汁中胆固醇的过饱和。\n\n胆固醇胆结石的形成 {{exhibit_1}} 主要与胆汁成分的失衡有关，特别是胆固醇相对于胆盐和磷脂的过量。胆固醇在肝脏中合成并分泌到胆汁中。胆盐对于溶解胆固醇至关重要。当胆汁中的胆固醇水平过高时，它会析出，形成聚集形成胆结石的晶体。\n\n胆固醇7α-羟化酶是胆固醇合成胆汁酸的限速酶。胆汁酸对于溶解胆汁中的胆固醇至关重要。因此，胆固醇7α-羟化酶活性降低会导致胆汁酸合成减少，导致胆汁中胆固醇的溶解度降低。这会导致胆汁中胆固醇的过饱和，并促进胆固醇胆结石的形成。\n\n患者正在接受贝特类药物治疗，已知贝特类药物会抑制胆固醇7α-羟化酶。这种抑制作用会减少胆汁酸的合成，并可能导致胆结石的形成，尤其是在易感人群中。\n\n（选项A）芳香化酶参与雌激素合成。虽然雌激素会影响胆固醇代谢和胆结石的形成，但芳香化酶本身并不直接参与胆固醇合成或胆汁酸形成，因此不是胆结石的主要原因。\n\n（选项B）β-葡萄糖醛酸苷酶是一种使胆汁酸和胆红素去结合的酶。它的活性与有色胆结石（胆红素结石）的形成有关，而不是胆固醇胆结石。\n\n（选项D和E）HMG-CoA还原酶和硫解酶是参与胆固醇合成的酶。这些酶的活性降低会导致胆固醇合成减少，这可以预防胆固醇胆结石的形成，而不是促成。HMG-CoA还原酶是胆固醇合成的限速酶。硫解酶参与胆固醇合成的早期步骤。\n\n关键临床要点：已知贝特类药物通过抑制胆固醇7α-羟化酶来增加胆结石的风险。胆固醇胆结石是最常见的类型，与胆汁中胆固醇的过饱和有关。"
