    "en": "A 6-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother due to pubertal development over the past year. The mother has noticed that her daughter has developed breasts and is also much taller than most of her classmates. Weight is at the 50th percentile and height is at the 95th percentile. Physical examination reveals Tanner stage 3 breast development and coarse pubic hair. She is diagnosed with idiopathic precocious puberty. Without treatment, this patient's projected height will most likely be shorter than average due to which of the following hormonal effects?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Normal pubertal development in girls manifests with secondary sexual characteristics at age ≥8 and is due to pulsatile GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus. This stimulates LH and FSH release from the pituitary, which triggers ovarian estrogen production. Precocious puberty, defined in girls as the development of secondary sexual characteristics at age <8, is often caused by early maturation of this hormonal axis, or idiopathic precocious puberty. This condition is gonadotropin-dependent and characterized by early-onset pulsatile GnRH secretion, resulting in rising estrogen production in young girls.\n\nMajor actions of estrogen include stimulation of breast development and bone growth. A growth spurt occurs during early puberty primarily due to positive feedback by estrogen on growth hormone (GH) production. GH stimulates insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) synthesis, which leads to the differentiation and proliferation of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate and therefore increased linear growth (Choices D and E). This rapid growth explains this patient's height at the 95th percentile, and the growth spurt typically results in achievement of 90% of final adult height.\n\nAt high doses, estradiol, a potent estrogen-derived steroid hormone, promotes senescence of chondrocytes and therefore closure of the epiphyseal plate (ie, growth plate) (Choices A and B). Once it is closed, linear growth is irreversibly stopped. Although this patient is now taller than her peers, without treatment, excess estrogens will cause the growth plates to close prematurely, and she will be shorter than average. Treatment of central precocious puberty is typically with a GnRH agonist, which causes continuous (rather than pulsatile) stimulation of the gonadotrophs, leading to decreased sex hormone production.\n\nEducational objective:\nIdiopathic precocious puberty is characterized by early-onset, pulsatile GnRH secretion, resulting in increased estrogen production. Estrogens promote bone growth but also epiphyseal plate (ie, growth plate) closure, so without treatment, patients typically have an early growth spurt but a shorter-than-expected adult height. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "女孩的正常青春期发育在8岁或以上时表现为第二性征，这归因于下丘脑脉冲式促性腺激素释放激素（GnRH）的分泌。这会刺激垂体释放LH和FSH，从而触发卵巢雌激素的产生。性早熟，定义为女孩在8岁之前出现第二性征，通常由该激素轴的早期成熟或特发性性早熟引起。这种情况是促性腺激素依赖性的，其特征是早期出现脉冲式GnRH分泌，导致年轻女孩的雌激素产量升高。\n\n雌激素的主要作用包括刺激乳房发育和骨骼生长。青春期早期出现生长突增，这主要归因于雌激素对生长激素（GH）产生的正反馈。GH刺激胰岛素样生长因子1（IGF-1）的合成，导致骺板中软骨细胞的分化和增殖，从而增加线性生长（选项D和E）。这种快速生长解释了该患者的身高处于第95百分位数，并且生长突增通常会导致达到最终成人身高的90％。\n\n在高剂量下，雌二醇是一种有效的雌激素衍生类固醇激素，会促进软骨细胞的衰老，从而导致骺板（即生长板）闭合（选项A和B）。一旦闭合，线性生长就会不可逆地停止。尽管该患者现在比同龄人高，但未经治疗，过量的雌激素会导致生长板过早闭合，并且她的身高将低于平均水平。中枢性性早熟的治疗通常使用GnRH激动剂，这会导致促性腺细胞持续（而不是脉冲式）刺激，从而导致性激素的产生减少。\n\n教育目标：\n特发性性早熟的特征是早期出现脉冲式GnRH分泌，导致雌激素产量增加。雌激素促进骨骼生长，但也促进骺板（即生长板）闭合，因此，未经治疗的患者通常会出现早期生长突增，但最终身高低于预期。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the hormonal effects on bone growth during puberty, specifically the role of estrogen in precocious puberty and its impact on final adult height. It requires understanding of the mechanism by which estrogen initially promotes growth but ultimately leads to premature closure of the epiphyseal plates.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that precocious puberty leads to early estrogen exposure, which initially causes a growth spurt but ultimately results in premature epiphyseal plate closure and reduced final height. Therefore, the correct answer must relate to the effect of estrogen on the epiphyseal plate.",
    "zh": "此问题考察了青春期激素对骨骼生长的影响，特别是雌激素在性早熟中的作用及其对最终身高的影响。这需要理解雌激素最初促进生长，但最终导致骺板过早闭合的机制。\n\n解决此问题的关键是认识到性早熟会导致早期接触雌激素，这最初会导致生长突增，但最终导致骺板过早闭合和最终身高降低。因此，正确的答案必须与雌激素对骺板的影响有关。"
