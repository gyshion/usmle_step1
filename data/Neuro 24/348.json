    "en": "A 76-year-old man comes to the office due to severe insomnia of several months' duration. He has trouble falling asleep and feels tired and irritable during the day. The patient's other medical problems include hypertension and a prior cerebrovascular accident with residual right leg weakness. He takes aspirin, rosuvastatin, and lisinopril regularly as prescribed. Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 118/76 mm Hg, pulse is 62/min, and respirations are 14/min. Examination shows clear lungs with normal S1 and S2. The abdomen is soft and nontender. In addition to nonpharmacologic interventions for insomnia, short-term pharmacologic therapy is being considered.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Insomnia is common in the elderly population and can significantly impair quality of life. Nonpharmacologic interventions such as sleep hygiene measures and cognitive-behavioral therapy are recommended for initial management. When nonpharmacologic interventions fail, pharmacotherapy may be indicated but must be used with extreme caution in elderly patients and should generally be limited to short-term management. Medication selection for elderly patients requires special attention to safety issues due to this population's increased sensitivity to adverse effects of medications in general and sedative-hypnotic agents in particular (eg, oversedation, dizziness, confusion, impaired psychomotor performance, ataxia).\n\nOf the currently available sedative-hypnotic agents, the melatonin agonist ramelteon has demonstrated the LOWEST SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN in older adults. Ramelteon binds with high affinity to melatonin receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.\n\n(Choices A, C, and D) Benzodiazepines should be avoided in elderly patients due to the increased risk of cognitive impairment, delirium, falls, fractures, and motor vehicle accidents when taking these medications.\n\n(Choices B and E) Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, and diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, should be avoided in the elderly due to their strong anticholinergic effects and risks of sedation, delirium, and falls.\n\n(Choice F) Quetiapine is a second-generation antipsychotic that would not be appropriate as a first-line treatment for insomnia. Antipsychotics carry a risk of increased falls and cardiac mortality in older adults and should not be used without an appropriate indication (eg, psychosis, dangerous agitation).\n\nEducational objective:\nBenzodiazepines, antihistamines, and sedating antidepressants should be avoided in the treatment of insomnia in elderly patients due to their adverse effects. Ramelteon, a melatonin agonist, has a lower side-effect burden than other sedative-hypnotic agents and is effective in reducing time to sleep onset in the elderly.",
    "zh": "失眠在老年人群中很常见，并且会严重损害生活质量。建议首先采取非药物干预措施，如睡眠卫生措施和认知行为疗法。当非药物干预措施失败时，可以考虑药物治疗，但必须在老年患者中极其谨慎地使用，并且通常应限于短期管理。老年患者的药物选择需要特别注意安全问题，因为该人群对药物（特别是镇静催眠药）的不良反应更为敏感（例如，过度镇静、头晕、意识模糊、精神运动功能受损、共济失调）。\n\n在目前可用的镇静催眠药中，褪黑激素激动剂雷美替胺在老年人中表现出最低的副作用负担。雷美替胺与视交叉上核中的褪黑激素受体具有高亲和力。\n\n（选项A、C和D）由于服用这些药物后认知障碍、谵妄、跌倒、骨折和交通事故的风险增加，应避免在老年患者中使用苯二氮卓类药物。\n\n（选项B和E）由于其强烈的抗胆碱能作用以及镇静、谵妄和跌倒的风险，应避免在老年人中使用三环类抗抑郁药阿米替林和抗组胺药苯海拉明。\n\n（选项F）喹硫平是一种第二代抗精神病药物，不适合作为失眠的一线治疗。抗精神病药物会增加老年人跌倒和心脏死亡的风险，不应在没有适当适应症的情况下使用（例如，精神病、危险性激动）。\n\n教学目标：\n由于其不良反应，在治疗老年患者的失眠时应避免使用苯二氮卓类药物、抗组胺药和镇静类抗抑郁药。褪黑激素激动剂雷美替胺的副作用负担低于其他镇静催眠药，并且能有效缩短老年人的入睡时间。"
