    "en": "A 55-year-old man comes to the clinic due to gradual, progressive weakness of the right upper extremity over the past 6 months. Over the last month, he has also noticed weakness in the left upper extremity. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows fasciculations and atrophy of the intrinsic muscles of the right hand and the muscles of the forearm. Reflexes are brisk in the upper extremities, and the plantar responses are extensor. Mild gait ataxia is present.",

    "en": "This patient has progressive weakness with signs of UPPER motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction (eg, brisk reflexes, extensor plantar reflex) and LOWER motor neuron (LMN) dysfunction (eg, fasciculations, muscle atrophy), which is characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a terminal neurodegenerative disease.\n\nPatients with ALS most often die of respiratory failure, which is caused by multiple factors:\n\n*   Inspiratory muscle (eg, diaphragm) atrophy and weakness, which leads to poor inspiratory strength. This is evident on pulmonary function testing as decreased vital capacity (the maximum volume displaced from the lung), which is followed as a marker of disease progression in patients with ALS.\n*   Expiratory muscle weakness, which leads to an ineffective cough and poor airway clearance.\n*   Bulbar muscle weakness, which leads to dysphagia and chronic aspiration.\n\nTreatment of ALS often focuses on improving respiratory function, which both prolongs survival and improves quality of life.\n\n(Choice A) Friedreich ataxia also presents with gait abnormalities and limb weakness. Death is typically due to cardiac dysfunction, due to either abnormalities of the cardiac conduction system or cardiac muscle defects (eg, decreased left ventricular compliance). However, Friedreich ataxia occurs in children age 5-15 years.\n\n(Choice C) Disseminated Lyme disease can present with radiculopathy; the classic triad of neurologic Lyme is meningitis, cranial neuropathy, and radiculoneuropathy (sensory or motor). Carditis can also occur, which can result in degeneration of the cardiac conduction system. However, this patient's combination of UMN and LMN signs is much more likely to be ALS.\n\n(Choice D) ALS is a disease that primarily affects motor neurons (both upper and lower). Although sensory disturbances can be present in some patients, widespread sensory defects do not occur.\n\n(Choice E) Tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant disorder that results in tumors in multiple organ systems. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures often occur and become refractory as the disease progresses. This patient has no evidence of tumors or seizures nor a positive family history to suggest tuberous sclerosis.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis often develop respiratory failure due to inspiratory muscle weakness (causing decreased vital capacity), expiratory muscle weakness (causing a weak cough), and bulbar dysfunction (causing dysphagia and chronic aspiration).",
    "zh": "该患者出现进行性无力，并伴有上运动神经元 (UMN) 功能障碍（如，反射活跃，跖反射伸性）和下运动神经元 (LMN) 功能障碍（如，肌束震颤，肌肉萎缩）的体征，这符合肌萎缩侧索硬化症 (ALS) 的特征，这是一种终末期神经退行性疾病。\n\nALS 患者最常死于呼吸衰竭，其原因有多种：\n\n*   吸气肌（如，膈肌）萎缩和无力，导致吸气力量不足。这在肺功能测试中表现为肺活量降低（肺部排出的最大体积），这被认为是ALS患者疾病进展的指标。\n*   呼气肌无力，导致咳嗽无力，气道清除能力差。\n*   延髓肌无力，导致吞咽困难和慢性吸入。\n\nALS 的治疗通常侧重于改善呼吸功能，这既延长了生存期，又提高了生活质量。\n\n(选项 A) Friedreich 共济失调也表现为步态异常和肢体无力。死亡通常是由于心脏功能障碍，这可能是由于心脏传导系统异常或心肌缺陷（如，左心室顺应性降低）所致。然而，Friedreich 共济失调发生在 5-15 岁的儿童中。\n\n(选项 C) 播散性莱姆病可表现为神经根病；神经性莱姆病的经典三联征是脑膜炎、颅神经病和神经根神经病（感觉或运动）。也可发生心肌炎，这可导致心脏传导系统变性。然而，该患者的 UMN 和 LMN 体征的组合更可能提示ALS。\n\n(选项 D) ALS 是一种主要影响运动神经元（上运动神经元和下运动神经元）的疾病。虽然某些患者可能出现感觉障碍，但不会出现广泛的感觉缺陷。\n\n(选项 E) 结节性硬化症是一种常染色体显性遗传病，导致多个器官系统的肿瘤。全身强直-阵挛性癫痫发作经常发生，并且随着疾病的进展变得难治。该患者没有肿瘤或癫痫发作的证据，也没有提示结节性硬化症的阳性家族史。\n\n教育目标：\n肌萎缩侧索硬化症患者常因吸气肌无力（导致肺活量降低）、呼气肌无力（导致咳嗽无力）和延髓功能障碍（导致吞咽困难和慢性吸入）而发生呼吸衰竭。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the clinical presentation and complications of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), specifically the respiratory failure that results from inspiratory and expiratory muscle weakness. It also tests the ability to differentiate ALS from other conditions with similar symptoms.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the UMN and LMN signs, which are characteristic of ALS. Then, recall that respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in ALS patients due to inspiratory muscle weakness, leading to decreased vital capacity.",
