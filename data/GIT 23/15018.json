    "en": "Peptic ulcers (defects in the stomach or duodenal mucosa) are most commonly due to *Helicobacter pylori* infection or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use.  \nThe educational objective is: Peptic ulcers are most commonly caused by *Helicobacter pylori* infection or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. NSAIDs inhibit cyclo-oxygenase-1, leading to increased gastric acid formation, decreased mucosal bicarbonate production, and decreased mucosal blood flow, which promote mucosal injury and ulcer formation.",
    "zh": "消化性溃疡（胃或十二指肠黏膜的缺损）最常见的原因是幽门螺杆菌感染或非甾体抗炎药（NSAID）的使用。\n教育目标是：消化性溃疡最常见的原因是幽门螺杆菌感染或非甾体抗炎药（NSAID）的使用。NSAIDs抑制环氧合酶-1，导致胃酸形成增加，黏膜碳酸氢盐产生减少，黏膜血流减少，从而促进黏膜损伤和溃疡形成。"

    "en": "The patient presents with an ulcer, and H. pylori has been ruled out. The most likely cause is NSAID use. NSAIDs inhibit cyclo-oxygenase-1, leading to increased gastric acid formation, decreased mucosal bicarbonate production, and decreased mucosal blood flow, which promote mucosal injury and ulcer formation.",
    "zh": "患者出现溃疡，并且已经排除了幽门螺杆菌。最可能的原因是非甾体抗炎药（NSAID）的使用。NSAIDs抑制环氧合酶-1，导致胃酸形成增加，黏膜碳酸氢盐产生减少，黏膜血流减少，从而促进黏膜损伤和溃疡形成。"
