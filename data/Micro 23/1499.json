    "en": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the office with 3 days of fever, irritability, and oral lesions. His parents are concerned due to his refusal to eat or drink and lack of urination today. Physical examination demonstrates painful ulcers on the tongue and gingiva, swollen gums, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The remainder of his examination is unremarkable. Microscopic examination of an oral ulcer base scraping is shown in the image below.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The above image depicts a Tzank smear, in which epithelial cells are scraped from an ulcer base and stained. The presence of multinucleated giant cells is suggestive of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, which is consistent with this child's symptoms. Tzank smears are insensitive and do not differentiate between HSV and varicella-zoster virus infection. Therefore, Tzank smears largely have been replaced by polymerase chain reaction testing.\n\nPrimary infection with HSV-1 results in herpetic gingivostomatitis. Peak age for primary infection is age 6 months to 5 years. Prodromal symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, chills) begin approximately 1 week after contact with an infected person (who is generally asymptomatic). Painful vesicles appear, extensively covering the lips and gingiva, and may include the palate, tongue, or oropharynx. The vesicles organize into extensive ulcers and resolve within 1-2 weeks. The pain of gingivostomatitis often results in dehydration, the most common reason for hospitalization.\n\n(Choice A) An abortive viral infection refers to an infection in which the virus enters the cell but does not successfully produce new infective virus. Therefore, an abortive infection is not capable of causing disease.\n\n(Choice B) HSV is capable of latency by integrating into the trigeminal (or sacral, for HSV-2) ganglia. However, during latency no virus is produced and therefore no clinical disease occurs.\n\n(Choice D) A slow virus infection is characterized by a prolonged incubation period that lasts months to years. During this time, the virus gradually multiplies before finally causing clinically apparent disease. Examples of slow viral infections include HIV, hepatitis C, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis following measles infection.\n\n(Choice E) Reactivation of HSV from the trigeminal ganglia causes herpes labialis. In contrast to gingivostomatitis, recurrent labialis disease is usually mild, unilateral, and limited to the lips due to host immune mechanisms (eg, presence of neutralizing antibody & HSV-specific cytotoxic T cells).\n\nEducational objective: Herpetic gingivostomatitis is a severe vesicular or ulcerative disease following primary infection with herpes simplex virus type 1. The diagnosis is supported by the presence of multinucleated giant cells in a Tzank smear. Involvement of the gingiva, tongue, palate, and pharynx along with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, malaise) is common. In contrast, herpes reactivation in the trigeminal ganglia generally results in mild perioral vesicles.",
    "zh": "上图描述了Tzank涂片，其中从溃疡基底部刮取上皮细胞并染色。多核巨细胞的存在提示单纯疱疹病毒（HSV）感染，这与该孩子的症状一致。Tzank涂片不敏感，不能区分HSV和水痘-带状疱疹病毒感染。因此，Tzank涂片已被聚合酶链反应检测所取代。\n\nHSV-1的原发性感染导致疱疹性龈口炎。原发性感染的高峰年龄为6个月至5岁。前驱症状（例如，发烧、不适、寒战）在与被感染者（通常无症状）接触后大约1周开始出现。出现疼痛性水疱，广泛覆盖嘴唇和牙龈，可能包括腭、舌或口咽。水疱组织成广泛的溃疡，并在1-2周内消退。龈口炎的疼痛通常导致脱水，这是住院的最常见原因。\n\n（选项A）流产性病毒感染是指病毒进入细胞但未能成功产生新的感染性病毒的感染。因此，流产性感染不能引起疾病。\n\n（选项B）HSV能够通过整合到三叉神经节（或HSV-2的骶神经节）中来实现潜伏。然而，在潜伏期间，不产生病毒，因此不会发生临床疾病。\n\n（选项D）慢病毒感染的特征是潜伏期长，持续数月至数年。在此期间，病毒逐渐增殖，然后最终引起临床明显的疾病。慢病毒感染的例子包括HIV、丙型肝炎和麻疹感染后的亚急性硬化性全脑炎。\n\n（选项E）HSV从三叉神经节的再激活导致唇疱疹。与龈口炎相比，复发性唇疱疹通常较轻，单侧，且仅限于嘴唇，这归因于宿主免疫机制（例如，中和抗体的存在和HSV特异性细胞毒性T细胞）。\n\n教育目标：疱疹性龈口炎是继发于1型单纯疱疹病毒原发性感染的严重水疱性或溃疡性疾病。诊断依据是Tzank涂片中存在多核巨细胞。牙龈、舌、腭和咽的受累以及全身症状（例如，发烧、不适）很常见。相比之下，三叉神经节中的疱疹再激活通常导致轻度的口周水疱。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the clinical presentation and diagnosis of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, including the characteristic findings on a Tzanck smear. It also requires differentiating primary infection from other types of viral infections, such as latent, abortive, slow, and reactivation infections.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of herpetic gingivostomatitis (painful oral ulcers, fever, lymphadenopathy) and the diagnostic value of multinucleated giant cells on a Tzanck smear. Rule out other viral infection types based on their distinct characteristics and clinical manifestations.",
