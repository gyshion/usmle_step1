  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Sexual history is a key part of comprehensive patient care and should be obtained at all initial visits, routine preventive screenings, and visits when sexually transmitted infections are suspected. Physicians should attempt to put patients of all sexual orientations and gender identities at ease when reviewing sexual history because, for some, the discussion may feel uncomfortable and intrusive. Normalizing the discussion as a routine component of the medical examination, ensuring confidentiality, remaining nonjudgmental, and expressing a willingness to address all sexual health concerns can facilitate the discussion.\n\nWhen asking about sexual partners, the physician should avoid using labels or making assumptions about patients or their partners' sexual orientation or gender identity. Asking an open-ended question about all sexual partnersallows patient to describe their sexual partners and behavior in terms that they are familiar with and that reflect their gender identity. After inquiring about the gender of sexual partners (including trans, nonbinary), the physician can ask about pertinent types of sex (eg, vaginal, oral, anal) with each partner in order to make testing recommendations for sexually transmitted infections (eg, HIV) and discuss risk-reduction strategies. Another possible formulation is, \"What is/are the sex and gender of your sexual partner(s)?\"\n\n(Choice B) This question is nonspecific and does not directly address sexual behavior. An individual may be sexually active outside of a romantic relationship or may not view an interaction as romantic. Although this question may yield some information regarding the patient's relationship history, it may exclude important information about some partners and sexual behaviors.\n\n(Choice C) Questioning the patient about other sexual partners while he was married may make him feel judged and less willing to disclose his sexual history. This inquiry also fails to focus on all sexual partners.\n\n(Choice D) This question forces the patient to choose a sexual orientation label. Many individuals may identify as heterosexual but have sexual contact with individuals of the same gender. Others may not relate to any of these labels to describe their sexuality.\n\n(Choice E) Asking the patient whether he has ever had intercourse with a man is a narrow, closed-ended question that does not address the possible range of his sexual behaviors or partners.\n\nEducational objective:\nTaking a sexual history is a key part of comprehensive care and requires an inclusive and nonjudgmental approach. Physicians should avoid making assumptions about a patient's sexual history and use an open-ended inquiry about all sexual partners.",
    "zh": "性史是综合患者护理的关键部分，应在所有初次就诊、常规预防性筛查以及怀疑性传播感染时获取。医生在回顾性史时应努力让所有性取向和性别认同的患者感到轻松，因为对某些人来说，讨论可能会感到不舒服和侵入。将讨论常态化为体格检查的常规组成部分，确保保密性，保持不带偏见，并表示愿意解决所有性健康问题，可以促进讨论。\n\n在询问性伴侣时，医生应避免使用标签或对患者或其伴侣的性取向或性别认同做出假设。询问有关所有性伴侣的开放式问题，可以让患者用他们熟悉并能反映其性别认同的术语来描述他们的性伴侣和行为。在询问性伴侣的性别（包括跨性别者、非二元性别者）后，医生可以询问与每个伴侣相关的性行为类型（例如，阴道性交、口交、肛交），以便提出性传播感染（例如，HIV）的检测建议，并讨论降低风险的策略。另一种可能的表述是：“您的性伴侣的性别是什么？”\n\n（选项 B） 这个问题不具体，没有直接针对性行为。一个人可能在浪漫关系之外有性行为，或者可能不认为这种互动是浪漫的。虽然这个问题可能会产生关于患者关系史的一些信息，但它可能会排除关于某些伴侣和性行为的重要信息。\n\n（选项 C） 询问患者在结婚期间是否有其他性伴侣可能会让他感到被评判，并且不愿意透露他的性史。这种询问也未能关注所有性伴侣。\n\n（选项 D） 这个问题迫使患者选择性取向标签。许多人可能认为自己是异性恋，但与同性别人士有性接触。其他人可能与任何这些标签无关，以描述他们的性取向。\n\n（选项 E） 询问患者是否曾与男性发生性交是一个狭隘的、封闭式的问题，没有涉及他可能的性行为或伴侣范围。\n\n教育目标：\n获取性史是综合护理的关键部分，需要一种包容和不带偏见的方法。医生应避免对患者的性史做出假设，并对所有性伴侣进行开放式询问。"
