    "en": "A 73-year-old man comes to the clinic with epigastric pain that starts 30-40 minutes after meals and does not respond to antacids. The pain is non-radiating and is graded 6/10 in intensity. The patient has lost more than 4.5 kg (10 lb) over the last few months, which he attributes to eating less due to his fear of the pain. He has no vomiting, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery bypass grafting, and right-sided carotid endarterectomy. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 32 years. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy shows no abnormalities. The underlying pathophysiology of this patient's disease process is most similar to which of the following conditions?",

    "en": "This patient's postprandial epigastric pain and associated food aversion/weight loss in the setting of generalized atherosclerosis (eg, coronary and carotid artery disease) is consistent with chronic mesenteric ischemia.\n\nWhen atherosclerosis involves the mesenteric arteries, the bowel can suffer from diminished blood supply. Intestinal hypoperfusion, which can be very painful, is especially pronounced within an hour after meals when more blood is needed for the digestion/absorption of nutrients (intestinal angina). This is analogous to stable cardiac angina, chest pain that occurs with physical exertion due to increased myocardial oxygen demand. The diagnosis can be made with duplex ultrasonography or angiography showing high-grade stenosis in the celiac and mesenteric arteries.\n\n(Choice A) Aortic dissection results from an aortic intimal tear with formation of a false lumen that can propagate and obstruct the vessels branching off the aorta (eg, renal, splanchnic, spinal, lower limb). A similar process would be more likely to cause acute end-organ damage (eg, cerebral infarction) rather than chronic, episodic ischemia.\n\n(Choice B) Diffuse esophageal spasm is a motility disorder characterized by episodic, painful, non-propulsive esophageal smooth muscle contraction. Biliary colic is similar to esophageal spasm in that gallbladder contraction against an obstructed cystic duct results in postprandial epigastric pain.\n\n(Choice C) Peptic ulcer disease is characterized by gastrointestinal erosions/ulcerations and is typically due to Helicobacter pylori infection or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. This patient's pain did not respond to antacids and his upper endoscopy is normal, so he is unlikely to have a condition associated with peptic ulcers.\n\n(Choice D) Pulmonary embolism is often due to an embolic blood clot lodging in the branches of the pulmonary artery, resulting in acute pulmonary ischemia/infarction. A similar pathogenesis accounts for acute mesenteric ischemia, which can occur with superior mesenteric artery embolism. This condition is more likely to cause sudden, severe abdominal pain rather than recurrent postprandial abdominal pain with food aversion.\n\nEducational objective:\nChronic mesenteric ischemia is characterized by atherosclerosis of the mesenteric arteries, resulting in diminished blood flow to the intestine after meals. This causes postprandial epigastric pain (intestinal angina) with associated food aversion/weight loss. Its pathogenesis is similar to angina pectoris.",
    "zh": "该患者的餐后上腹痛以及相关的厌食/体重减轻，结合全身动脉粥样硬化（如冠心病和颈动脉疾病），与慢性肠系膜缺血一致。\n\n当动脉粥样硬化累及肠系膜动脉时，肠道会因血供减少而受损。肠道灌注不足，这可能非常疼痛，在餐后一小时内尤为明显，因为消化/吸收营养需要更多的血液（肠绞痛）。这类似于劳力型心绞痛，劳力型心绞痛是由于心肌耗氧量增加而引起的体力活动时发生的胸痛。可以通过双功能超声检查或血管造影显示腹腔干和肠系膜动脉高度狭窄来诊断。\n\n（选项A）主动脉夹层是由于主动脉内膜撕裂，形成可蔓延并阻塞主动脉分支血管（如肾脏、内脏、脊髓、下肢）的假腔。类似的过程更有可能导致急性终末器官损伤（如脑梗死），而不是慢性阵发性缺血。\n\n（选项B）弥漫性食管痉挛是一种动力障碍，其特征是阵发性、疼痛性、非推进性食管平滑肌收缩。胆绞痛类似于食管痉挛，胆囊收缩对抗阻塞的胆囊管会导致餐后上腹痛。\n\n（选项C）消化性溃疡病的特征是胃肠道糜烂/溃疡，通常由于幽门螺杆菌感染或非甾体类抗炎药的使用所致。该患者的疼痛对抑酸药无反应，并且他的上消化内镜检查是正常的，因此他不太可能患有与消化性溃疡相关的疾病。\n\n（选项D）肺栓塞通常是由于栓塞性血栓滞留在肺动脉分支中，导致急性肺缺血/梗死。类似的病理生理学也适用于急性肠系膜缺血，这种缺血可能发生在肠系膜上动脉栓塞时。这种情况更有可能导致突发、剧烈的腹痛，而不是反复出现的餐后腹痛伴厌食。\n\n教育目标：\n慢性肠系膜缺血的特征是肠系膜动脉粥样硬化，导致餐后肠道血流减少。这会导致餐后上腹痛（肠绞痛），并伴有厌食/体重减轻。其发病机制类似于心绞痛。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of chronic mesenteric ischemia, its presentation, and its pathophysiologic similarity to stable angina. It requires understanding the mechanism of postprandial pain due to decreased blood flow to the intestines after meals.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of chronic mesenteric ischemia (postprandial pain, food aversion, weight loss) and associate it with the underlying atherosclerosis.
