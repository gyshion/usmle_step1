    "en": "A 32-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, at 30 weeks gestation comes to the office for a routine prenatal visit. The patient's pregnancy has been uncomplicated, and she has had no vaginal bleeding or contractions. She has continued to jog daily throughout the pregnancy but is becoming more fatigued by the end of her workouts. The patient has no chronic medical conditions, and her only medication is a daily prenatal vitamin. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 20/min. Fetal heart tones are normal. Physical examination is unremarkable. Compared to a nonpregnant state, this patient most likely has which of the following hematologic changes?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is A. During pregnancy, there are significant physiologic changes in the hematologic system. Plasma volume increases by 30%-50% and red blood cell mass increases by 20%-30%. Because the increase in plasma volume is greater than the increase in red blood cell mass, there is a dilutional anemia, leading to a mild reduction in hemoglobin concentration. This is a normal adaptation to pregnancy, ensuring adequate oxygen delivery to the fetus and protecting against excessive blood loss during delivery.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while plasma volume and red blood cell mass increase, the percentage decrease in hemoglobin concentration is typically around 63% in the context of these increases, not 27%.\n\nOption C is incorrect because a 2% decrease in hemoglobin concentration is not representative of the dilutional anemia seen in pregnancy, where the expansion of plasma volume outpaces red blood cell mass expansion.\n\nOption D is incorrect because plasma volume does increase significantly during pregnancy; it does not remain unchanged.\n\nOption E is incorrect because plasma volume increases significantly during pregnancy; it does not remain unchanged, and the percentage decrease in hemoglobin concentration is typically greater than 1% due to the dilutional effect.\n\nKey clinical pearls: Pregnancy is a hypervolemic state. The increase in plasma volume is greater than the increase in red blood cell mass, leading to physiologic anemia of pregnancy. This is a normal adaptation and should not be confused with pathological anemia.",
    "zh": "正确答案是A。在妊娠期间，血液系统会发生显著的生理变化。血浆容量增加30%-50%，红细胞总容量增加20%-30%。由于血浆容量的增加大于红细胞总容量的增加，会出现稀释性贫血，导致血红蛋白浓度轻度降低。这是对妊娠的正常适应，确保向胎儿提供充足的氧气，并防止分娩期间的过度失血。\n\n选项B不正确，因为虽然血浆容量和红细胞总容量增加，但在这些增加的背景下，血红蛋白浓度降低的百分比通常约为63%，而不是27%。\n\n选项C不正确，因为血红蛋白浓度降低2%并不能代表妊娠期间出现的稀释性贫血，在妊娠期间，血浆容量的扩张超过了红细胞总容量的扩张。\n\n选项D不正确，因为血浆容量在妊娠期间确实会显著增加；它不会保持不变。\n\n选项E不正确，因为血浆容量在妊娠期间会显著增加；它不会保持不变，并且由于稀释效应，血红蛋白浓度降低的百分比通常大于1%。\n\n关键临床要点：妊娠是一种高血容量状态。血浆容量的增加大于红细胞总容量的增加，导致妊娠期生理性贫血。这是一种正常的适应，不应与病理性贫血混淆。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the normal hematologic adaptations that occur during pregnancy. Specifically, it assesses knowledge of the changes in plasma volume, red blood cell mass, and hemoglobin concentration, and the underlying pathophysiology of dilutional anemia.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall the typical percentage increases in plasma volume and red blood cell mass during pregnancy and understand that the greater expansion of plasma volume leads to a relative decrease in hemoglobin concentration. Evaluating the options based on these physiological changes is key to identifying the correct answer.",
    "zh": "此问题考察对妊娠期间发生的正常血液学适应的理解。具体来说，它评估对血浆容量、红细胞总容量和血红蛋白浓度变化的了解，以及稀释性贫血的潜在病理生理学。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须回忆妊娠期间血浆容量和红细胞总容量的典型百分比增加，并理解血浆容量的更大扩张导致血红蛋白浓度的相对降低。根据这些生理变化评估选项是确定正确答案的关键。"
