    "en": "This patient has chronic, well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with a thick scale consistent with plaque psoriasis. Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disorder characterized by hyperkeratosis (overgrowth of the stratum corneum) and epidermal hyperplasia. It has a strong genetic predisposition and is often seen in patients with a family history of the disorder; other risk factors include smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and obesity.\n\nPsoriasis has multiple variants (eg, guttate, pustular); however, up to 75% of cases are due to chronic plaque psoriasis. Plaques are well-defined and erythematous and may appear raised above the surrounding skin. They are typically covered in a coarse silver scale, which, when removed, results in pinpoint bleeding (Auspitz sign) of the underlying dilated capillaries.\n\nPlaques usually form in locations subject to trauma or friction (Köbner phenomenon); the extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees are most classic, but the dorsal surface of the hands, as in this patient {{exhibit_2}}, is also common. Other typical locations include the scalp, back, and gluteal cleft. They are often mildly pruritic but may be asymptomatic.\n\n(Choice A) Atopic dermatitis can present with erythematous, scaly plaques, but it is more common in flexural areas, shows less prominent scaling, and is usually associated with more prominent itching.\n\n(Choice B) Cutaneous warts (verruca vulgaris) are caused by human papillomavirus infection and present as discrete, hyperkeratotic papules. Although patients can have multiple warts, numerous scaly plaques are more consistent with psoriasis.\n\n(Choice C) Lichen planus presents with pink or purple plaques and papules. It is usually associated with severe pruritus and typically affects the volar surface of the wrists rather than the dorsum of the hands.\n\n(Choice E) Tinea manuum presents with scaly plaques on the hands. The lesions are typically very pruritic and often have an annular appearance with central clearing. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "该患者有慢性、界限清楚的红斑性斑块，伴有厚厚的鳞屑，与斑块型银屑病一致。银屑病是一种常见的炎症性皮肤病，其特征是角化过度（角质层过度增生）和表皮增生。它具有很强的遗传易感性，通常见于有该病家族史的患者；其他危险因素包括吸烟、大量饮酒和肥胖。\n\n银屑病有多种变体（例如，点滴状、脓疱性）；然而，高达75%的病例是由于慢性斑块型银屑病引起的。斑块边界清晰，呈红斑，可能高于周围皮肤。它们通常覆盖着粗糙的银色鳞屑，当去除时，会导致下方扩张的毛细血管点状出血（Auspitz征）。\n\n斑块通常形成于易受外伤或摩擦的部位（Köbner现象）；肘部和膝盖的伸展表面最为典型，但手背，如该患者{{exhibit_2}}，也很常见。其他典型部位包括头皮、背部和臀裂。它们通常轻度瘙痒，但也可能无症状。\n\n(选项A) 特应性皮炎可表现为红斑性、鳞屑性斑块，但更常见于屈侧区域，鳞屑较不明显，并且通常伴有更明显的瘙痒。\n\n(选项B) 皮肤疣（寻常疣）由人乳头瘤病毒感染引起，表现为独立的角化过度丘疹。尽管患者可以有多个疣，但大量的鳞屑性斑块更符合银屑病。\n\n(选项C) 扁平苔藓表现为粉红色或紫色的斑块和丘疹。它通常伴有严重的瘙痒，并且通常影响手腕的掌面而不是手背。\n\n(选项E) 手癣表现为手上的鳞屑性斑块。这些病灶通常非常瘙痒，并且通常呈环形外观，中央有清除区。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the clinical presentation and diagnosis of psoriasis, focusing on its characteristic skin lesions, distribution, and associated features. It requires differentiating psoriasis from other common skin conditions with similar presentations.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of psoriasis such as erythematous plaques with silvery scales, Auspitz sign, and predilection for extensor surfaces. Rule out other conditions based on their distinct clinical characteristics and distribution patterns.",
