    "en": "A 63-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease comes to the office for a follow-up visit. He uses a tiotropium inhaler daily, and his pulmonary symptoms are sufficiently controlled. During a previous visit, the patient was counseled on the benefits of smoking cessation. He reports that despite trying he has been unable to stop smoking due to overwhelming cravings. The physician prescribes a drug that reduces nicotine cravings and decreases the pleasurable effects of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Which of the following medications was most likely prescribed to the patient?",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Quitting smoking cigarettes is difficult due to nicotine content and its activation of reward pathways in the brain. The reinforcing effects of nicotine that lead to dependence are thought to be caused by stimulation of the alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor present in the CNS. Varenicline is a partial agonist of this receptor that competes with nicotine (a full agonist) and prevents it from binding to the receptor {{exhibit_1}}.\n\nBecause varenicline is a partial agonist, it helps reduce the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal by mildly stimulating the receptor. However, because varenicline is not a full agonist, downstream release of dopamine is modest, resulting in less stimulation of reward pathways than nicotine.\n\n(Choices A and B) Benzodiazepines (eg, clonazepam) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, fluoxetine) have not been shown to be effective for smoking cessation.\n\n(Choice C) Nicotine patches slowly release nicotine, thus preventing withdrawal symptoms when the patient stops using cigarettes. However, because nicotine is a full agonist (and does not partially block the receptor like varenicline does), patches do not prevent the pleasurable effects of additional nicotine received by smoking cigarettes.\n\n(Choice D) Topiramate is an anticonvulsant used to treat epilepsy, and it is also effective for migraine prophylaxis. Several studies have tested the effectiveness of topiramate for smoking cessation; however, the current evidence shows little or no significant difference in long-term tobacco abstinence over placebo.\n\nEducational objective: Varenicline is a partial agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It can help patients stop using tobacco by reducing withdrawal symptoms and attenuating the rewarding effects of nicotine.",
    "zh": "由于尼古丁含量及其对大脑奖励通路的激活，戒烟非常困难。导致依赖性的尼古丁的强化作用被认为是由中枢神经系统中存在的α-4 β-2 烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体的刺激引起的。伐尼克兰是该受体的一种部分激动剂，它与尼古丁（一种完全激动剂）竞争，并阻止其与受体结合 {{exhibit_1}}。\n\n由于伐尼克兰是一种部分激动剂，它通过轻度刺激受体来帮助减轻尼古丁戒断症状。然而，由于伐尼克兰不是完全激动剂，多巴胺的下游释放量适中，导致对奖励通路的刺激少于尼古丁。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）苯二氮卓类药物（例如，氯硝西泮）和选择性 5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（例如，氟西汀）已被证明对戒烟无效。\n\n（选项 C）尼古丁贴片缓慢释放尼古丁，从而在患者停止吸烟时防止戒断症状。然而，由于尼古丁是一种完全激动剂（并且不像伐尼克兰那样部分阻断受体），贴片并不能阻止吸烟者获得的额外尼古丁带来的快感。\n\n（选项 D）托吡酯是一种用于治疗癫痫的抗惊厥药，对偏头痛预防也有效。几项研究测试了托吡酯戒烟的有效性；然而，目前的证据表明，与安慰剂相比，在长期戒断烟草方面没有或没有显着差异。\n\n教育目标：伐尼克兰是烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体的部分激动剂。它可以通过减轻戒断症状和减弱尼古丁的奖赏作用来帮助患者戒烟。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pharmacologic agents used in smoking cessation, specifically the mechanism of action of varenicline as a partial agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It also requires differentiating varenicline from other medications used for smoking cessation or other conditions.\n\nThe best approach is to recall the mechanism of action of each medication listed and consider which would best address both nicotine cravings and the pleasurable effects of smoking. Understanding that varenicline is a partial agonist is key to selecting the correct answer.",
