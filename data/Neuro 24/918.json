    "en": "A 34-year-old woman comes to the office due to diplopia, clumsiness of the left hand, and numbness of the right foot. Six months ago, the patient had numbness of the right hand, which resolved without treatment. Ten years ago, she was hurt by an explosion at work that resulted in a metallic foreign body in her left eye. She has no other medical problems and takes no medications. The patient has a 10-pack-year smoking history. Both parents are healthy. Vital signs are normal. BMI is 27 kg/m². Neurologic examination shows slowing of left eye adduction and left arm power of 4/5 with mild spasticity. Sensation to pinprick is decreased over the right foot. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows mononuclear cell pleocytosis and oligoclonal banding. Which of the following pathologic findings is most likely to be present in this patient's brain?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient presents with a history of relapsing and remitting neurologic deficits, including diplopia, clumsiness, numbness, and spasticity, along with cerebrospinal fluid findings of mononuclear cell pleocytosis and oligoclonal banding. These findings are highly suggestive of MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS). MS is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by lesions of focal demyelination. Demyelination involves both cellular and humoral immunity. T helper cells react with myelin antigens and recruit additional lymphocytes and macrophages. Activated CD8+ T cells release cytotoxic granules that injure oligodendrocytes. B cell recruitment leads to the formation of myelin-specific antibodies that activate complement and facilitate myelin breakdown. The result is OLIGODENDROCYTE DEPLETION with relative sparing of axons.\n\nDiagnosis is largely clinical but is supported by the presence of T2 lesions on MRI (precluded in this patient due to the presence of intraocular metal) or OLIGOCLONAL BANDS on cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Oligoclonal bands represent the intrathecal production of immunoglobulins and are highly sensitive for MS. However, oligoclonal bands are nonspecific and may be seen in any CNS disease involving humoral immunity (eg, vasculitis, infection).\n\n(Choice A) Astrocytes undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia, not shrinkage, in response to CNS injury in a process known as glial scarring.\n(Choices B and C) Both Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer disease are characterized by protein aggregates in brain tissue. Lewy body dementia causes visual hallucinations, dysautonomia, and parkinsonism and is characterized by eosinophilic inclusions in neurons (Lewy bodies). Alzheimer disease causes progressive memory loss and is characterized by extracellular fibrillar protein accumulation (amyloid). Both diseases are uncommon in young patients and are not associated with focal neurologic deficits.\n(Choice D) Cerebral vasculitis can resemble MS with neurologic deficits that may wax and wane, and oligoclonal bands can be seen. However, patients typically develop severe headache, and systemic symptoms (eg, fever, fatigue, night sweats) are common.\n(Choice E) Intracerebral hemorrhaging can cause focal deficits, but symptoms would likely have an acute rather than intermittent or relapsing presentation. In addition, lumbar puncture would typically show xanthochromia (yellow-tinged cerebrospinal fluid from blood product breakdown), not a mononuclear pleocytosis.\n\nEducational objective:\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease that results from oligodendrocyte depletion. Within the lesions, inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes and macrophages are seen surrounding oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths. Oligoclonal bands are highly sensitive but nonspecific in patients with MS.",
    "zh": "该患者病史表现为复发缓解的神经功能缺损，包括复视、笨拙、麻木和痉挛，并伴有脑脊液检查结果显示单核细胞增多和寡克隆带。这些发现高度提示多发性硬化症（MS）。MS是一种中枢神经系统（CNS）的自身免疫性脱髓鞘疾病，其特征是局灶性脱髓鞘病变。脱髓鞘涉及细胞免疫和体液免疫。T辅助细胞与髓磷脂抗原发生反应，并募集额外的淋巴细胞和巨噬细胞。活化的CD8+ T细胞释放细胞毒性颗粒，损伤少突胶质细胞。B细胞募集导致产生髓磷脂特异性抗体，激活补体并促进髓磷脂分解。结果是少突胶质细胞耗竭，轴突相对保留。\n\n诊断主要基于临床，但也可通过MRI上T2病灶（由于患者存在眼内金属而排除）或脑脊液分析上的寡克隆带支持。寡克隆带代表鞘内免疫球蛋白的产生，对MS高度敏感。然而，寡克隆带是非特异性的，可能见于任何涉及体液免疫的CNS疾病（例如，血管炎、感染）。\n\n(选项A) 星形胶质细胞对CNS损伤的反应是肥大和增生，而不是萎缩，这个过程被称为神经胶质瘢痕形成。\n(选项B和C) 路易体痴呆和阿尔茨海默病均以脑组织中的蛋白质聚集为特征。路易体痴呆引起视觉幻觉、自主神经功能障碍和帕金森病，其特征是神经元内嗜酸性包涵体（路易体）。阿尔茨海默病引起进行性记忆丧失，其特征是细胞外纤维蛋白聚集（淀粉样蛋白）。这两种疾病在年轻患者中并不常见，并且与局灶性神经功能缺损无关。\n(选项D) 脑血管炎可类似于MS，神经功能缺损可能时好时坏，并且可见寡克隆带。然而，患者通常会出现严重的头痛，并且全身症状（例如，发烧、疲劳、盗汗）很常见。\n(选项E) 脑内出血可导致局灶性缺损，但症状可能更倾向于急性而非间歇性或复发性表现。此外，腰椎穿刺通常显示黄变（来自血制品分解的淡黄色脑脊液），而不是单核细胞增多。\n\n教育目标：\n多发性硬化症（MS）是一种自身免疫性脱髓鞘疾病，由少突胶质细胞耗竭引起。在病变内，可见淋巴细胞和巨噬细胞的炎症浸润包绕少突胶质细胞和髓鞘。寡克隆带在MS患者中高度敏感，但非特异性。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology and characteristic histopathologic findings of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). It requires integrating clinical presentation, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and knowledge of autoimmune demyelinating diseases to identify the most likely microscopic abnormality in the brain.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recognize the constellation of symptoms and CSF findings suggestive of MS. Then, recall the underlying pathology of MS, which involves autoimmune destruction of myelin and oligodendrocytes, leading to oligodendrocyte depletion as the primary cellular event in demyelinated lesions.",
