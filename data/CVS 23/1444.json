  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has most likely overdosed on beta blocker medications. Beta blocker overdose causes diffuse non-selective blockade of peripheral beta adrenergic receptors, causing depression of myocardial contractility, bradycardia, and varying degrees of AV block. The result is a low cardiac output state.\n\nGlucagon is the drug of choice for beta blocker overdose. Glucagon acts on G protein-coupled receptors, increasing intracellular cAMP and thus increasing the release of intracellular calcium during muscle contraction. This increases heart rate and cardiac contractility. Improvements in heart rate and blood pressure may be observed within minutes.\n\nEducational Objective:\nPatients who have overdosed on beta blockers should be treated with glucagon, which increases heart rate and contractility independent of adrenergic receptors. Glucagon activates G-protein-coupled receptors on cardiac myocytes, causing activation of adenylate cyclase and raising intracellular cAMP. The result is calcium release from intracellular stores and increased sinoatrial node firing.",
    "zh": "该患者很可能过量服用了 β 受体阻滞剂。β 受体阻滞剂过量会导致外周 β 肾上腺素能受体的弥漫性非选择性阻滞，导致心肌收缩力减弱、心动过缓和不同程度的房室传导阻滞。其结果是低心输出量状态。\n\n胰高血糖素是治疗 β 受体阻滞剂过量的首选药物。胰高血糖素作用于 G 蛋白偶联受体，增加细胞内 cAMP，从而在肌肉收缩期间增加细胞内钙的释放。这会增加心率和心肌收缩力。心率和血压的改善可能在几分钟内观察到。\n\n教育目标：\n过量服用 β 受体阻滞剂的患者应使用胰高血糖素治疗，胰高血糖素可独立于肾上腺素能受体增加心率和收缩力。胰高血糖素激活心肌细胞上的 G 蛋白偶联受体，导致腺苷酸环化酶激活并升高细胞内 cAMP。结果是从细胞内储存释放钙并增加窦房结放电。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of beta-blocker overdose and the mechanism of action of glucagon as an antidote. It assesses the understanding of intracellular signaling pathways involved in cardiac contractility.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the clinical presentation of beta-blocker overdose (hypotension, bradycardia) and knowing that glucagon increases cAMP in cardiac myocytes, leading to increased heart rate and contractility.",
    "zh": "此题考察对 β 受体阻滞剂过量以及胰高血糖素作为解毒剂的作用机制的了解。它评估了对涉及心肌收缩力的细胞内信号通路的理解。\n\n解决此题的关键是识别 β 受体阻滞剂过量的临床表现（低血压、心动过缓）并知道胰高血糖素增加心肌细胞中的 cAMP，从而导致心率和收缩力增加。"
