    "en": "A 52-year-old man comes to the office for an annual preventive visit. He has a history of seasonal allergies, and has recently started taking a medication that has improved his runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes. Medical history is remarkable for diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and eczema. He is not on any other medications. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Examination shows a well-appearing man with flushed cheeks and dilated pupils. This patient's physical examination findings are best explained by which of the following mechanisms?",

    "en": "The patient presents with flushed cheeks and dilated pupils, which are signs of anticholinergic toxicity. First-generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, are commonly used for allergies and are known to have anticholinergic properties. These medications are non-specific and act as antagonists to multiple receptors, including muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. This leads to anticholinergic effects such as fever, urinary retention, decreased sweating, and altered mental status. In this patient, the flushing is likely a compensatory response to dissipate excess body heat due to decreased sweating, and the pupillary dilation (mydriasis) is due to inhibition of the iris sphincter. The table provided summarizes the classic symptoms and mechanisms of anticholinergic toxicity, often remembered by the mnemonic \"hot as a hare, dry as a bone, red as a beet, blind as a bat, mad as a hatter, full as a flask, fast as a fiddle.\"\n\n(Choice A) Antagonism of H1 receptors is the primary mechanism by which antihistamines relieve allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes. However, H1 receptor antagonism alone does not explain the flushed cheeks and dilated pupils. While first-generation antihistamines do block H1 receptors, their anticholinergic effects are mediated through muscarinic receptor antagonism.\n\n(Choice B) H2 receptors are primarily found on parietal cells in the gastric mucosa and are involved in acid secretion. H2 antagonists are used to treat conditions like GERD and peptic ulcers, and do not cause the observed symptoms.\n\n(Choice D) Nicotinic cholinergic receptors are found at the neuromuscular junction and in autonomic ganglia. Antagonism of these receptors can lead to muscle weakness and autonomic dysfunction, but this is not the primary mechanism for the observed symptoms from a first-generation antihistamine.\n\n(Choice E) Stimulation of alpha-1 adrenoceptors causes vasoconstriction and mydriasis. While alpha-1 stimulation can cause mydriasis, it does not explain the flushed cheeks, which are more consistent with vasodilation. Furthermore, the medication in question is an antihistamine, not an alpha-1 agonist.\n\nKey clinical pearls:\nFirst-generation antihistamines are non-specific and have significant anticholinergic side effects due to muscarinic receptor antagonism. Remember the mnemonic for anticholinergic toxicity.",
    "zh": "患者表现为面颊潮红和瞳孔散大，这是抗胆碱能毒性的征象。第一代抗组胺药，如苯海拉明，常用于治疗过敏，并已知具有抗胆碱能特性。这些药物是非特异性的，可作为多种受体的拮抗剂，包括毒蕈碱乙酰胆碱受体。这会导致抗胆碱能作用，如发烧、尿潴留、出汗减少和精神状态改变。在该患者中，潮红可能是由于出汗减少而散热过多的一种代偿反应，而瞳孔散大（瞳孔扩大）是由于虹膜括约肌的抑制。提供的表格总结了抗胆碱能毒性的典型症状和机制，通常用助记符“像兔子一样热，像骨头一样干，像甜菜一样红，像蝙蝠一样瞎，像帽子一样疯，像烧瓶一样饱，像小提琴一样快”来记忆。\n\n（选项A）H1受体拮抗是抗组胺药缓解流鼻涕、打喷嚏和流泪等过敏症状的主要机制。然而，仅H1受体拮抗并不能解释面颊潮红和瞳孔散大。虽然第一代抗组胺药确实阻断H1受体，但其抗胆碱能作用是通过毒蕈碱受体拮抗介导的。\n\n（选项B）H2受体主要存在于胃粘膜的壁细胞上，并参与酸分泌。H2拮抗剂用于治疗胃食管反流病和消化性溃疡等疾病，不会引起观察到的症状。\n\n（选项D）烟碱型胆碱能受体存在于神经肌肉接头和自主神经节中。这些受体的拮抗作用可导致肌肉无力和自主神经功能障碍，但这并不是第一代抗组胺药所观察到的症状的主要机制。\n\n（选项E）α-1肾上腺素受体刺激引起血管收缩和瞳孔散大。虽然α-1刺激可引起瞳孔散大，但它不能解释面颊潮红，这与血管舒张更一致。此外，所讨论的药物是抗组胺药，而不是α-1激动剂。\n\n关键临床要点：\n第一代抗组胺药是非特异性的，由于毒蕈碱受体拮抗，具有显着的抗胆碱能副作用。记住抗胆碱能毒性的助记符。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the mechanism of action and side effects of first-generation antihistamines. Specifically, it assesses the knowledge that these drugs possess anticholinergic properties due to muscarinic receptor antagonism, which can lead to a constellation of symptoms including mydriasis and flushing.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the patient's symptoms (flushed cheeks, dilated pupils) and correlate them with the known side effect profile of medications used for allergies. Recognizing that first-generation antihistamines have anticholinergic effects and understanding the specific receptors involved (muscarinic) is crucial for selecting the correct answer.",
