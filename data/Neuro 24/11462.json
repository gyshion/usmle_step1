    "en": "A 65-year-old man comes to the office due to bothersome tremors. The patient was diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson disease 10 years ago and has since been successfully treated with levodopa-carbidopa. However, over the last several months, he has developed frequent freezing episodes characterized by a sudden loss of mobility. More recently, the patient's tremors worsened after he reduced his levodopa dose following the development of involuntary body movements. On examination, he has a bilateral resting tremor that is worse on the right, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity. His symptoms have significantly degraded his quality of life, and he is now interested in discussing surgical options. This patient would benefit most from a treatment targeted at suppressing neuronal activity in which of the following brain structures?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson disease (PD) leads to a reduced amount of dopamine available to inhibit the striatum (nigrostriatal pathway). This results in overactivation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), leading to increased stimulation of the globus pallidus interna (GPi). In turn, the GPi increases its inhibitory output to the thalamus. Decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the thalamus then leads to the classic symptoms of bradykinesia and rigidity.\n\nRestoration of dopamine levels in the brain by treatment with levodopa (precursor to dopamine able to cross the blood-brain barrier) and carbidopa (inhibits peripheral metabolism of levodopa to increase availability to the brain) improves the motor symptoms of PD. However, levodopa has a narrow therapeutic window that worsens with disease progression; over time, periodic dosing inevitably results in motor fluctuations (eg, freezing when dopamine levels drop) as well as dyskinesia (eg, involuntary movements, tremor when dopamine levels spike).\n\nWhen levodopa becomes ineffective, the neuronal pathways from the basal ganglia to the thalamus can be surgically interrupted (eg, deep brain stimulation, lesioning procedures). The most effective surgical targets are the STN (reduces excess GPi excitation) and the GPi (reduces excess thalamic inhibition); inhibition of either nucleus has been shown to improve motor fluctuations and dyskinesia seen with advanced PD.\n\n(Choice A) The globus pallidus externa normally inhibits the STN. If inhibitory impulses from this region are down-regulated, output would increase from the STN, worsening Parkinson symptoms.\n\n(Choice B) Global inhibition of the motor cortex is responsible for the symptoms of PD; increased inhibition would further worsen this patient's bradykinesia.\n\n(Choice C) The rubrospinal tract originates from the red nucleus and contributes to upper extremity flexor tone. Inhibition of this nucleus would result in decerebrate (extensor) posturing, as seen with brain herniation.\n\n(Choice E) The ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus is involved in generating pathologic oscillatory tremors (eg, Parkinson disease, essential tremor). Although suppression of output from the ventral intermediate nucleus is effective for treating refractory tremor, it does not improve bradykinesia or rigidity.\n\nEducational objective:\nNigrostriatal degeneration in Parkinson disease impairs thalamic stimulation of the motor cortex, resulting in bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor. Patients with medically intractable symptoms may benefit from surgery to decrease output of the globus pallidus interna or subthalamic nucleus, promoting thalamocortical disinhibition with improvement in Parkinson symptoms.",
    "zh": "帕金森病 (PD) 多巴胺能神经元的缺失导致可抑制纹状体（黑质纹状体通路）的多巴胺减少。这导致丘脑底核 (STN) 的过度激活，导致苍白球内侧部 (GPi) 的刺激增加。反过来，GPi 增加了其对丘脑的抑制性输出。然后，丘脑对运动皮层的刺激减少会导致运动迟缓和强直的典型症状。\n\n通过左旋多巴（能够穿过血脑屏障的多巴胺前体）和卡比多巴（抑制左旋多巴的周围代谢以增加其在大脑中的利用率）治疗来恢复大脑中的多巴胺水平，可以改善 PD 的运动症状。然而，左旋多巴的治疗窗口很窄，并且随着疾病的进展而恶化；随着时间的推移，周期性给药不可避免地会导致运动波动（例如，当多巴胺水平下降时冻结）以及运动障碍（例如，当多巴胺水平飙升时出现不自主运动、震颤）。\n\n当左旋多巴失效时，可以手术中断来自基底神经节到丘脑的神经通路（例如，脑深部电刺激、毁损术）。最有效的手术靶点是 STN（减少过度的 GPi 兴奋）和 GPi（减少过度的丘脑抑制）；抑制任何一个核都已被证明可以改善在晚期 PD 中看到的运动波动和运动障碍。\n\n(选项 A) 苍白球外侧部通常会抑制 STN。如果来自该区域的抑制性冲动被下调，则 STN 的输出将会增加，从而使帕金森病的症状恶化。\n\n(选项 B) 运动皮层的全面抑制是 PD 症状的原因；增加的抑制作用将进一步恶化该患者的运动迟缓。\n\n(选项 C) 红核发出红核脊髓束，并有助于上肢屈肌张力。抑制该核会导致去大脑（伸展）姿势，如脑疝所见。\n\n(选项 E) 丘脑的腹中间核参与产生病理性振荡性震颤（例如，帕金森病、原发性震颤）。虽然抑制丘脑腹中间核的输出对治疗难治性震颤有效，但它并不能改善运动迟缓或强直。\n\n教育目标：\n帕金森病中的黑质纹状体变性会损害丘脑对运动皮层的刺激，导致运动迟缓、强直和静止性震颤。对于药物难治性症状的患者，手术以减少苍白球内侧部或丘脑底核的输出可能是有益的，从而促进丘脑皮质去抑制，改善帕金森病的症状。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology of Parkinson disease and the neurosurgical targets for managing motor symptoms. It assesses knowledge of the basal ganglia circuitry and how its dysfunction leads to the characteristic motor deficits of Parkinson disease, as well as the rationale behind surgical interventions like deep brain stimulation.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the patient's symptoms as consistent with advanced Parkinson disease refractory to medical management. Then, recall the abnormal basal ganglia pathway in Parkinson disease, specifically the overactivation of the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus interna. Finally, apply this knowledge to determine which brain structure, when its activity is suppressed, would most effectively alleviate the patient's motor symptoms, particularly tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity.",
