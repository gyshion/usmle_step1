    "en": "A 32-year-old man is recovering from extensive burns. Fibroblasts near the site of injury actively synthesize precursor mRNA to be used as templates for protein synthesis. After transcription, extensive processing of the precursor RNA occurs to form the finalized mRNA sequence. The finalized mRNA then exits the nucleus and undergoes translation by ribosome complexes before being degraded.",

    "en": "After transcription, the preliminary, unprocessed mRNA is known as precursor mRNA, or heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). Eukaryotic pre-mRNA undergoes significant posttranscriptional processing before leaving the nucleus, including 5'-capping, poly A tail addition, and intron splicing.\n\nOnce mRNA is finalized, it leaves the nucleus bound to specific packaging proteins. Upon entering the cytoplasm, these mRNA complexes often associate with ribosomes to undergo translation. However, certain mRNA sequences instead associate with proteins that are found in P bodies. P bodies are distinct foci found within eukaryotic cells that are involved in mRNA regulation and turnover. They play a fundamental role in translation repression and mRNA decay, and contain numerous proteins including RNA exonucleases, mRNA decapping enzymes, and constituents involved in mRNA quality control and microRNA-induced mRNA silencing. P bodies also seem to function as a form of mRNA storage, as certain mRNAs are incorporated into P bodies only to be later released and utilized for protein translation.\n\n(Choices A and B) The 5' end of all mRNA is capped with a 7-methylguanosine residue by a unique 5' to 5' linkage, which occurs in two stages. The first step is the addition of guanine triphosphate to the 5' end of mRNA in a reaction catalyzed by guanylyltransferase. Methylation of the guanosine cap is then catalyzed by guanine-7-methyltransferase. Capping of the precursor RNA occurs in the nucleus as the RNA is being transcribed. This methylated cap protects mRNA from degradation by cellular exonucleases, and allows it to exit the nucleus.\n\n(Choice C) mRNA is polyadenylated at the 3' end by the polyadenylate polymerase complex, which recognizes a specific sequence (AAUAAA), cleaves the pre-mRNA molecule a few residues downstream from this sequence, and then adds a stretch of 20 - 250 adenine residues called the poly A tail. The addition of the poly A tail occurs before the mRNA exits the nucleus. In the cytosol, the poly A tail is gradually shortened, eventually leading to mRNA degradation.\n\n(Choices D and E) Since pre-mRNA contains both introns and exons, and only exons code for proteins, introns must be excised before translation through a process known as splicing. Splicing of pre-mRNA occurs within the nucleus and is facilitated by the interaction of pre-mRNA with small ribonucleoprotein particles called snRNPs (or \"snurps\" for short).\n\nEducational objective:\nWhen mRNA is first transcribed from DNA, it is in an unprocessed form called pre-mRNA or heterogeneous nuclear mRNA (hnRNA). Several processing steps are required before finalized mRNA molecules can leave the nucleus, including 5'-capping, poly A tail addition, and intron splicing. Cytoplasmic P bodies play an important role in mRNA translation regulation and mRNA degradation.",
