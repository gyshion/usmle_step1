    "en": "A 71-year-old man with chronic stable angina comes to the office for routine follow-up. He has occasional episodes of chest pain that improve after taking sublingual nitroglycerin. The patient also has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and takes multiple medications for his conditions. Blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg and pulse is 68/min and regular. Examination reveals normal heart sounds. While discussing a plan to start isosorbide dinitrate therapy, the patient becomes concerned about the high dose of oral isosorbide dinitrate compared to sublingual nitroglycerin.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Nitrates, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers are the mainstay of therapy for patients with chronic stable angina. Sublingual nitroglycerin is the therapy of choice in acute episodes for immediate relief of angina and for prevention of angina prior to engaging in strenuous physical activity. Chronic nitrate therapy with long-acting oral formulations (isosorbide dinitrate or mononitrate) is used to prevent recurrent anginal episodes in patients with chronic stable angina.\n\nSublingual nitroglycerin is absorbed rapidly from oral mucosa directly into the venous circulation and has a rapid onset of action within 2-5 minutes. Long-acting isosorbide dinitrate is absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes EXTENSIVE FIRST-PASS METABOLISM in the liver prior to release in the systemic circulation. This leads to LOW BIOAVAILABILITY and the need for much higher doses of oral formulations as compared to sublingual nitroglycerin.\n\n(Choice A) Chronic nitrate therapy on a regular basis leads to nitrate tolerance, with attenuation of blood pressure response and anti-anginal effects. Higher doses do not prevent nitrate tolerance. On the contrary, use of sublingual nitroglycerin on an intermittent, as-needed basis (nitrate-free intervals) prevents the development of nitrate tolerance.\n\n(Choices C and D) The oral nitrate preparations do not have high serum protein binding or volume of distribution.\n\n(Choice E) Isosorbide dinitrate has rapid and nearly complete intestinal absorption. Its low bioavailability is due to considerable first-pass hepatic metabolism.\n\nEducational objective:\nIsosorbide dinitrate has low bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism prior to release in systemic circulation. Sublingual nitroglycerin has a low bioavailability due to absorption directly from oral mucosa into the venous circulation and has a higher bioavailability.",
    "zh": "硝酸酯类药物、β受体阻滞剂和钙通道阻滞剂是慢性稳定性心绞痛患者的主要治疗方法。舌下含服硝酸甘油是急性发作时的首选治疗方法，用于立即缓解心绞痛以及在进行剧烈体力活动之前预防心绞痛。长期口服制剂（异山梨酯二硝酸酯或单硝酸异山梨酯）的慢性硝酸酯治疗用于预防慢性稳定性心绞痛患者的复发性心绞痛发作。\n\n舌下含服硝酸甘油从口腔黏膜迅速吸收，直接进入静脉循环，并在2-5分钟内迅速起效。长效异山梨酯二硝酸酯通过胃肠道吸收，并在进入体循环之前，在肝脏中进行广泛的首过效应代谢。这导致了低生物利用度，因此需要比舌下含服硝酸甘油高得多的口服制剂剂量。\n\n(选项A) 长期、定期使用硝酸酯类药物会导致硝酸酯耐受性，血压反应和抗心绞痛作用减弱。较高剂量并不能预防硝酸酯耐受性。相反，间歇性、按需使用舌下含服硝酸甘油（无硝酸酯间隔）可防止硝酸酯耐受性的发展。\n\n(选项C和D) 口服硝酸酯制剂没有高血清蛋白结合或分布容积。\n\n(选项E) 异山梨酯二硝酸酯具有快速且几乎完全的肠道吸收。其低生物利用度是由于大量首过肝脏代谢。\n\n教育目的：\n由于在进入体循环之前存在广泛的首过肝脏代谢，异山梨酯二硝酸酯的生物利用度较低。舌下含服硝酸甘油的生物利用度较低，是由于药物从口腔黏膜直接吸收到静脉循环中，而其生物利用度较高。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pharmacokinetic differences between sublingual and oral nitrate formulations, specifically the concept of first-pass metabolism and its impact on bioavailability and dosing.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall or deduce that oral medications often undergo first-pass metabolism in the liver, which can significantly reduce their systemic bioavailability, necessitating higher doses compared to drugs administered via routes that bypass this first-pass effect, such as sublingual administration.",
    "zh": "本题考察对舌下含服和口服硝酸酯制剂之间药代动力学差异的理解，特别是首过效应代谢的概念及其对生物利用度和剂量的影响。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须回忆或推断出口服药物通常会在肝脏中进行首过效应代谢，这会显著降低它们的全身生物利用度，因此需要比通过绕过这种首过效应的途径给药的药物（例如舌下给药）更高的剂量。"
