    "en": "A 12-year-old girl is being evaluated for recurrent episodes of self-limited colicky abdominal pain and nausea lasting several days. She was also recently hospitalized for an episode of difficulty breathing. The patient has no significant past medical history, but her mother has a history of attacks of severe abdominal pain and diarrhea. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation reveals decreased serum complement C4 and C1 esterase inhibitor levels.",

    "en": "Low serum levels of C1 esterase inhibitor (and its substrate C4) are diagnostic of HEREDITARY ANGIOEDEMA, an inherited autosomal dominant condition that causes episodes of painless, non-pitting, well-circumscribed edema. The face, neck, lips, and tongue are most commonly affected, but internal organs may also be involved. Angioedema affecting the tracheobronchial tree can cause respiratory obstruction and is potentially fatal. Angioedema of the gastrointestinal tract manifests with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\nNormally, C1 esterase inhibitor suppresses activation of the C1 complement component and therefore the rest of the classic complement pathway. It also inactivates kallikrein, which catalyzes the conversion of kininogen to bradykinin. In hereditary angioedema, low C1 esterase inhibitor activity leads to an increase in active kallikrein and bradykinin levels. Bradykinin (along with C3a and C5a) mediate angioedema by increasing vasodilation and vascular permeability.\n\nAngioedema may also occur as side effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor medications. ACE normally catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II. ACE also converts bradykinin into inactive metabolites. ACE inhibitors can therefore lead to bradykinin accumulation. These medications should not be used in patients with hereditary angioedema as they may precipitate disease episodes. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice B) Furosemide can cause hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, and hypovolemia. Ototoxicity may occur if furosemide is used with aminoglycosides.\n\n(Choice C) Methotrexate can cause hepatitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and bone marrow suppression.\n\n(Choice D) Metoprolol is a selective β1-adrenergic blocker with few side effects. It may cause heart block in patients with conduction system disease and bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients (rare due to β1 selectivity but can still occur).\n\n(Choice E) The most common side effect of penicillin is hypersensitivity.\n\nEducational objective:\nAngioedema can be hereditary (autosomal dominant) or acquired (associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor treatment). In hereditary angioedema, low C1 esterase inhibitor activity leads to increases in bradykinin activity. ACE inhibitors should not be used in these patients.",
    "zh": "C1酯酶抑制剂（及其底物C4）血清水平低是诊断遗传性血管性水肿（一种常染色体显性遗传病）的依据，该病可引起无痛性、非凹陷性、边界清楚的水肿发作。面部、颈部、嘴唇和舌头最常受累，但内脏器官也可能受累。影响气管-支气管树的血管性水肿可引起呼吸道阻塞，并可能致命。胃肠道的血管性水肿表现为腹痛、呕吐和腹泻。\n\n正常情况下，C1酯酶抑制剂会抑制C1补体成分的激活，进而抑制经典补体途径的其余部分。它还能使激肽释放酶失活，而激肽释放酶催化激肽原转化为缓激肽。在遗传性血管性水肿中，C1酯酶抑制剂活性降低导致活性激肽释放酶和缓激肽水平升高。缓激肽（与C3a和C5a一起）通过增加血管舒张和血管通透性介导血管性水肿。\n\n血管性水肿也可能作为血管紧张素转换酶(ACE)抑制剂类药物的副作用而发生。ACE通常催化血管紧张素I转化为血管紧张素II。ACE还可以将缓激肽转化为无活性代谢物。因此，ACE抑制剂可能导致缓激肽蓄积。这些药物不应用于遗传性血管性水肿患者，因为它们可能诱发疾病发作。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项B) 呋塞米可引起低钾血症、高尿酸血症和低血容量。如果呋塞米与氨基糖苷类药物联用，可能会发生耳毒性。\n\n(选项C) 甲氨蝶呤可引起肝炎、肺纤维化和骨髓抑制。\n\n(选项D) 美托洛尔是一种选择性β1-肾上腺素能受体阻滞剂，副作用很少。它可能导致传导系统疾病患者发生心脏传导阻滞，并在哮喘患者中引起支气管收缩（由于β1选择性，这种情况很少见，但仍可能发生）。\n\n(选项E) 青霉素最常见的副作用是过敏反应。\n\n教学目标：\n血管性水肿可以是遗传性的（常染色体显性遗传），也可以是获得性的（与血管紧张素转换酶[ACE]抑制剂治疗相关）。在遗传性血管性水肿中，C1酯酶抑制剂活性降低导致缓激肽活性增加。这些患者不应使用ACE抑制剂。"
