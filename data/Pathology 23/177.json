    "en": "A 73-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. The patient woke up with the symptoms an hour before arriving but felt well when he went to bed last night. He has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation but is not adherent with medical therapy. Temperature is 98.6 F (37 C), blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 110/min and irregularly irregular. Physical examination shows right-sided hemiplegia, hemisensory loss, and aphasia. Despite appropriate treatment, the patient's symptoms fail to improve. Over the next week, which of the following processes is most likely to occur in the affected brain region?",

    "en": "This patient's symptoms are consistent with an ISCHEMIC STROKE involving the left middle cerebral artery territory. An EMBOLISM is the most likely cause given his history of atrial fibrillation in the absence of anticoagulation therapy. The resulting irreversible neural cell injury initiates immune cell migration and HYDROLYTIC ENZYME RELEASE, leading to necrosis of damaged neural tissue. Although ischemic cell death in most organs results in COAGULATIVE NECROSIS, in the brain such injury causes LIQUEFACTIVE NECROSIS within 10 days of the infarction due to the brain's lack of supporting architecture. The infarcted CNS tissue is then digested by microglia and replaced with a cystic space surrounded by a dense astrogial scar (gliosis) over the ensuing months to years. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(Choice A) Fibrinoid necrosis is a pattern of injury that results in accumulation of fibrin-like material in the walls of blood vessels affected by vasculitis syndromes (eg, polyarteritis nodosa) or malignant hypertension. Although fibrinoid necrosis in cerebral arteries can predispose a patient to hemorrhagic stroke, this change would not be an expected complication of acute ischemic stroke.\n\n(Choice B) Focal tuberculous infection can occur in the CNS and cause granulomas with caseous necrosis (epithelioid macrophages around a necrotic focus) within the affected parenchyma. However, the onset of neurologic symptoms in patients with tuberculous brain abscesses tends to be more chronic and progressive than this patient's acute presentation.\n\n(Choice C) Breakdown of adipose tissue (ie, fat necrosis) due to mechanical trauma or pancreatic enzyme release (eg, acute pancreatitis) is characterized by infiltrating foamy macrophages containing engulfed lipid debris and release of free fatty acids that combine with calcium to form basophilic deposits.\n\n(Choice E) Coagulative necrosis occurs following hypoxic cell death in all tissues except the CNS. It results in the acute denaturation of structural and enzymatic cellular proteins. Cell nuclei disappear, but the basic architecture of the affected tissue is preserved because intracellular proteolytic enzymes are inactivated during the injury process.\n\nEducational objective: Irreversible ischemic injury to brain tissue causes tissue digestion by hydrolytic enzymes (liquefactive necrosis). The infarcted CNS tissue is eventually replaced with a cystic astroglial scar. In other organs, lethal ischemic injury results in coagulative necrosis.",
    "zh": "该患者的症状与涉及左侧大脑中动脉区域的缺血性卒中相符。考虑到患者有房颤病史，且未接受抗凝治疗，栓塞是最可能的原因。由此产生的不可逆的神经细胞损伤会引发免疫细胞迁移和水解酶释放，导致受损神经组织的坏死。尽管大多数器官的缺血性细胞死亡会导致凝固性坏死，但在脑中，由于大脑缺乏支持结构，此类损伤会在梗死后10天内引起液化性坏死。梗死的CNS组织随后被小胶质细胞消化，并在随后的几个月到几年内被囊性空间取代，囊性空间周围有致密的星形胶质细胞瘢痕（神经胶质增生）。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(选项A) 纤维素样坏死是一种损伤模式，会导致血管炎综合征（如结节性多动脉炎）或恶性高血压影响的血管壁内纤维蛋白样物质积聚。虽然脑动脉中的纤维素样坏死可使患者易患出血性卒中，但这不应是急性缺血性卒中的预期并发症。\n\n(选项B) 局灶性结核感染可发生在CNS中，并在受累实质内引起肉芽肿，伴有干酪样坏死（坏死灶周围的上皮样巨噬细胞）。然而，结核性脑脓肿患者的神经系统症状发病往往比该患者的急性表现更慢性、更进行性。\n\n(选项C) 脂肪组织分解（即脂肪坏死）是由于机械性创伤或胰酶释放（例如急性胰腺炎），其特征是浸润性泡沫巨噬细胞，其中包含吞噬的脂质碎片，并释放出游离脂肪酸，这些脂肪酸与钙结合形成嗜碱性沉积物。\n\n(选项E) 凝固性坏死发生在除CNS以外的所有组织的缺氧性细胞死亡后。它导致结构性和酶促细胞蛋白的急性变性。细胞核消失，但受影响组织的基本结构得以保留，因为细胞内蛋白水解酶在损伤过程中被灭活。\n\n教学目标：脑组织不可逆的缺血性损伤会导致组织被水解酶消化（液化性坏死）。梗死的CNS组织最终被囊性星形胶质细胞瘢痕取代。在其他器官中，致命性缺血性损伤会导致凝固性坏死。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the patterns of tissue necrosis, specifically focusing on the type of necrosis that occurs in the central nervous system following ischemic injury. It requires differentiating between various forms of necrosis based on their etiology and morphology.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the clinical scenario as an ischemic stroke, recognizing that CNS tissue undergoes a specific type of necrosis upon infarction, and then matching this to the provided options. Understanding the characteristic morphology of CNS infarction, particularly liquefactive necrosis, is key to selecting the correct answer.",
