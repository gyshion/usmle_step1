    "en": "A 65-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The patient undergoes coronary angiography with stent placement in the left circumflex artery, and he is started on therapy with a beta blocker and antiplatelet agents. On day 3 of hospitalization he experiences chest pain. The pain, described as sharp and radiating to his neck and shoulders, is exacerbated by coughing and swallowing. He has no shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or abdominal pain. Temperature is 37.5 C (99.5 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min and regular, and respirations are 20/min. The lungs are clear on auscultation. There is no peripheral edema.",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The sharp and pleuritic nature of this patient's new chest pain suggests pericardial involvement. The exacerbation with swallowing indicates that the posterior pericardium may be involved, and the radiation into the neck suggests involvement of the inferior pericardium, which is adjacent to phrenic nerve afferents supplying the diaphragm. The patient's low-grade fever indicates that this is an inflammatory process.\n\nA fibrinous or serofibrinous pericarditis, known as peri-infarction pericarditis (PIP), develops in about 10%-20% of patients between 2 and 4 days following a transmural myocardial infarction (MI). This pericarditis is a reaction to necrosis of the myocardium near the epicardial surface; delayed treatment presentation increases the risk of PIP due to higher levels of necrosis. Inflammation of the visceral and parietal pericardium is usually localized to the areas overlying the necrotic myocardial segment. The condition is generally short-lived and resolves with several days of supportive care; sometimes therapy with high-dose aspirin is needed.\n\n(Choice A) Dressler syndrome (postcardiac injury syndrome) is an autoimmune-mediated pericarditis that is likely provoked by antigens exposed or created by infarction and necrosis of the cardiac muscle. It is less common and has later onset than PIP, typically occurring a week to few months after an MI. The pericardium is often diffusely affected in Dressler syndrome.\n\n(Choice B) Viral pericarditis usually follows an antecedent upper respiratory infection. However, a viral cause for this patient's pericarditis is less likely than PIP as a direct complication of his transmural infarction.\n\n(Choices D and E) Recurrent thrombosis of the recently stented vessel or thrombosis of another coronary vessel would be expected to cause similar pain to the patient's original, anginal type of pain. The pain of myocardial ischemia is not typically sharp or pleuritic, but rather constant, substernal, and \"crushing.\"\n\nEducational objective:\nIn contrast to angina, the chest pain of pericarditis is sharp and pleuritic and may be exacerbated by swallowing or coughing. Peri-infarction pericarditis (PIP) occurs between 2 and 4 days following a transmural myocardial infarction (MI). PIP is an inflammatory reaction to cardiac muscle necrosis that occurs in the adjacent pericardium.",
    "zh": "该患者新出现的胸痛的锐利性和胸膜性提示pericardial受累。吞咽时加重表明可能累及后pericardium，放射到颈部提示累及下pericardium，后者毗邻支配膈肌的膈神经传入神经。患者的低热表明这是一个炎症过程。\n\n大约10%-20%的患者在透壁性心肌梗死（MI）后2-4天内发生纤维蛋白性或浆液纤维蛋白性心包炎，即围梗死性心包炎（PIP）。这种pericarditis是对心外膜表面附近心肌坏死的反应；延迟治疗会由于坏死程度升高而增加PIP的风险。脏层和壁层pericardium的炎症通常局限于覆盖坏死心肌段的区域。这种情况通常是短暂的，通过几天的支持治疗即可缓解；有时需要大剂量阿司匹林治疗。\n\n（选项A）Dressler综合征（心脏损伤后综合征）是一种自身免疫介导的pericarditis，可能由梗死和心肌坏死暴露或产生的抗原引起。它不如PIP常见，发病时间晚于PIP，通常在MI后一周到几个月内发生。Dressler综合征的pericardium通常弥漫性受累。\n\n（选项B）病毒性pericarditis通常继发于先前的上呼吸道感染。然而，对于该患者的pericarditis来说，病毒性原因不如PIP作为其透壁性梗死的直接并发症的可能性大。\n\n（选项D和E）近期置入支架的血管的复发性血栓形成或其他冠状动脉血管的血栓形成预计会导致与患者原有的、心绞痛类型的疼痛相似的疼痛。心肌缺血的疼痛通常不是锐痛或胸膜性疼痛，而是持续性、胸骨后和“压榨性”疼痛。\n\n教育目标：\n与心绞痛相比，pericarditis的胸痛是锐痛和胸膜性的，并且可能因吞咽或咳嗽而加重。围梗死性心包炎（PIP）发生在透壁性心肌梗死（MI）后2-4天。PIP是对发生在相邻pericardium的心肌坏死的炎症反应。"

It assesses the ability to differentiate PIP from other causes of chest pain, such as Dressler syndrome, viral pericarditis, and recurrent ischemia.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the timing (2-4 days post-MI), the sharp, pleuritic nature of the pain, and the exacerbation with swallowing.
