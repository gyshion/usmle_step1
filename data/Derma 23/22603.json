    "en": "A 40-year-old man comes to the office due to lesions over his thigh that he first noticed 2 weeks ago. The lesions are neither painful nor itchy. The patient has a history of HIV infection. He has not been compliant with HIV therapy. On physical examination, the patient appears mildly cachectic. Vital signs are normal. There are 2 elliptical, raised, nontender, violaceous lesions on his right thigh. No other skin or mucous membrane lesions are present. There is no lymphadenopathy. CD4 count is 100/mm³. The patient's skin condition most likely originated from which of the following cells?",

    "en": "This patient with a history of HIV infection and a current CD4 count of 100/mm³ now has 2 lesions on the right thigh that are violaceous, raised, and nontender. This presentation is classic for Kaposi sarcoma (KS), the most common tumor in HIV-positive individuals, which usually presents as multiple red, purple, or brown papules or plaques and appears first on the lower extremities before spreading proximally.\n\nKS is a vascular tumor that is strongly associated with both HIV and human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8). HHV-8 infects vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells, causing them to differentiate into a mixed phenotype thought to increase oncogenic potential. The HHV-8 genome contains several viral oncogenes that inhibit cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, thereby promoting endothelial cell growth and tumorigenesis. Biopsy of cutaneous KS typically reveals a dermal proliferation of spindle-shaped endothelial cells with slit-like vascular spaces, red blood cell extravasation, and inflammation.\n\n(Choice A) Basal cell carcinomas arise from basal keratinocytes, typically due to ultraviolet radiation-induced mutations. Lesions are commonly pink or skin-colored (vs violaceous), pearly or translucent, and located in sun-exposed areas such as the face (vs the thigh).\n\n(Choice C) Cutaneous mastocytosis is caused by the pathologic accumulation of mast cells within the skin, which, in adults, is often associated with systemic mast cell proliferation (ie, systemic mastocytosis). Skin involvement typically manifests as monomorphic, reddish-brown macules that gradually proliferate and spread over months to years; because of histamine release, the lesions characteristically develop erythema or urticaria when scratched.\n\n(Choice D) Sweet syndrome (ie, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is a rare inflammatory disorder associated with pathologic neutrophilic infiltration into the skin. Because of their inflammatory nature, lesions are typically erythematous, edematous, and tender; ulceration like that of pyoderma gangrenosum (another neutrophilic disease of the skin) may occur. Lesions are classically accompanied by frequent fever.\n\n(Choice E) Melanocytic nevi are caused by the benign proliferation of nevus cells, a type of melanocyte that forms clusters instead of single units evenly dispersed throughout the skin. Acquired melanocytic nevi may be elliptical, raised, and nontender; however, they are not typically violaceous, and most appear in childhood or adolescence (vs adulthood).\n\nEducational objective:\nKaposi sarcoma often presents as multiple red, purple, or brown lesions on the lower extremities in patients with HIV infection. It is a vascular tumor caused by human herpesvirus type 8 infection of endothelial cells.",
    "zh": "这名患者有HIV感染病史，目前的CD4计数为100/mm³，现在右大腿上有2个皮损，呈紫色、隆起且无触痛。这种表现是卡波西肉瘤 (KS) 的典型表现，卡波西肉瘤是HIV阳性个体中最常见的肿瘤，通常表现为多个红色、紫色或棕色的丘疹或斑块，最初出现在下肢，然后向近端蔓延。\n\nKS是一种血管肿瘤，与HIV和人类疱疹病毒8型 (HHV-8) 密切相关。HHV-8感染血管和淋巴内皮细胞，导致它们分化成混合表型，这种表型被认为会增加致癌潜力。HHV-8基因组包含几个病毒癌基因，可抑制细胞周期调节和细胞凋亡，从而促进内皮细胞生长和肿瘤发生。皮肤KS的活检通常显示梭形内皮细胞在真皮中增生，伴有裂隙样血管腔、红细胞外渗和炎症。\n\n(选项A) 基底细胞癌起源于基底角质形成细胞，通常是由于紫外线辐射诱导的突变。皮损通常呈粉红色或肤色（与紫色相反）、珍珠状或半透明，位于暴露于阳光的区域，如面部（与大腿相反）。\n\n(选项C) 皮肤肥大细胞增多症是由肥大细胞在皮肤内病理性聚集引起的，在成人中，这通常与全身性肥大细胞增生（即全身性肥大细胞增多症）有关。皮肤受累通常表现为单形性、红棕色斑疹，这些斑疹逐渐增生并在数月到数年内扩散；由于组胺释放，这些皮损在抓挠时特征性地出现红斑或荨麻疹。\n\n(选项D) Sweet综合征（即急性发热性嗜中性皮病）是一种罕见的炎症性疾病，与嗜中性粒细胞病理性浸润到皮肤有关。由于其炎症性质，皮损通常发红、水肿和触痛；可能发生类似坏疽性脓皮病（另一种嗜中性粒细胞性皮肤病）的溃疡。皮损通常伴有频繁发热。\n\n(选项E) 黑色素细胞痣是由痣细胞（一种黑色素细胞，形成簇而不是均匀分布于整个皮肤的单个单元）的良性增生引起的。获得性黑色素细胞痣可能呈椭圆形、隆起且无触痛；然而，它们通常不是紫色的，而且大多数出现在儿童或青少年时期（与成年期相反）。\n\n教育目标：\n卡波西肉瘤在HIV感染患者中通常表现为下肢上的多个红色、紫色或棕色皮损。它是一种血管肿瘤，由内皮细胞感染人类疱疹病毒8型引起。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) in the context of HIV infection, specifically its etiology related to human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) and the cell type involved in its pathogenesis. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of KS and differentiating it from other skin lesions.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the patient's HIV status, the description of the lesions (violaceous, raised, nontender), and the fact that KS is associated with HHV-8 infection of endothelial cells. Eliminate options that do not align with the clinical presentation or the known etiology of KS.",
