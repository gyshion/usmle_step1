    "en": "A 27-year-old man comes to the office due to dyspnea on exertion and intermittent episodes of palpitations. Blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg and pulse is 78/min. On examination, there is no peripheral edema or jugular venous distension. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is a 3/6 ejection-type systolic murmur along the left sternal border that decreases in intensity when the patient moves from the standing to the squatting position.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Many patients with HCM are asymptomatic and are recognized when an abnormal murmur or ECG is noted during evaluation for other purposes. HCM typically involves left ventricular (LV) enlargement that is most prominent in the basal anterior septum and can lead to LV outflow tract obstruction. The clinical manifestations, which depend on the extent of hypertrophy and outflow tract obstruction, include:\n\n- exertional dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. Sudden cardiac arrest can also occur.\n- a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the apex and left sternal border, with characteristic changes in intensity during physiologic maneuvers.\n\nThe condition is inherited in autosomal dominant fashion, resulting from mutations in genes encoding for myocardial contractile proteins of the sarcomere. The proteins cardiac myosin binding protein C and cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain are most commonly affected. The phenotypic manifestations of the disease (eg, septal enlargement) typically begin to develop around the time of adolescence.\n\nDespite the autosomal dominant inheritance, affected patients may not always have an identifiable first-degree relative who is similarly affected because not all mutations responsible for HCM have been identified and many known mutations have variable penetrance.\n\nEducational objective:\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutation in one of several genes encoding the myocardial contractile proteins of the cardiac sarcomere. Mutations that affect cardiac myosin binding protein C or cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain are responsible for the majority of identifiable mutations in patients with HCM.",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现与肥厚型心肌病（HCM）一致。许多HCM患者无症状，当在评估其他情况时注意到异常杂音或心电图时才被识别。HCM通常涉及左心室（LV）增大，这在基底部前间隔最为明显，并可导致左心室流出道梗阻。临床表现取决于肥厚和流出道梗阻的程度，包括：\n\n- 劳力性呼吸困难、胸痛、疲劳、心悸、晕厥前或晕厥。也可发生猝死。\n- 在心尖和胸骨左缘可听到粗糙的渐强-渐弱型收缩期杂音，其强度在生理操作过程中有特征性变化。\n\n该病以常染色体显性方式遗传，由编码肌节心肌收缩蛋白的基因突变引起。心肌肌球蛋白结合蛋白C和心脏β-肌球蛋白重链是最常受影响的蛋白质。该疾病的表型表现（例如，间隔增厚）通常在青春期前后开始出现。\n\n尽管是常染色体显性遗传，受影响的患者可能并不总是有可识别的同样受影响的一级亲属，因为并非所有导致HCM的突变都已被识别，并且许多已知突变具有可变的外显率。\n\n教育目标：\n肥厚型心肌病（HCM）是一种常染色体显性遗传病，由编码心肌肌节心肌收缩蛋白的几个基因之一的突变引起。影响心肌肌球蛋白结合蛋白C或心脏β-肌球蛋白重链的突变是HCM患者中大多数可识别突变的原因。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), specifically its inheritance pattern and clinical presentation. It requires understanding the effect of maneuvers like squatting on murmur intensity in HCM. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key findings of dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, and a systolic murmur that decreases with squatting, which are characteristic of HCM. Recall that HCM is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.",
    "zh": "本题考察了肥厚型心肌病（HCM）的知识，特别是其遗传模式和临床表现。它需要理解蹲位等操作对HCM杂音强度的影响。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要认识到劳力性呼吸困难、心悸和蹲位时降低的收缩期杂音等关键发现，这些是HCM的特征。回想一下，HCM通常以常染色体显性模式遗传。"
