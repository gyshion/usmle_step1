    "en": "A 33-year-old man comes to the office due to fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance over the past 6 months. The patient was diagnosed with infective endocarditis in the setting of intravenous drug use a year ago and completed a course of antibiotic therapy. He has not used drugs since then. The patient has no other medical problems and takes no medications. A cardiac murmur is heard on auscultation. Both carotid arteries demonstrate a rapid rise and fall of the arterial pulse. Partial compression of the femoral arteries by the stethoscope elicits a systolic-diastolic bruit. Which of the following sets of pressure findings is most likely to be observed during cardiac catheterization of this patient? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient's presentation is consistent with aortic regurgitation (AR), which likely developed as a complication of infective endocarditis. AR is characterized by a rapid loss of aortic pressure during diastole due to backflow of blood into the left ventricle. The left ventricle becomes dilated with an increase in end-diastolic volume and undergoes eccentric hypertrophy that allows for a compensatory increase in stroke volume and cardiac output. The result of these effects is a characteristic high-amplitude, rapid rise-rapid fall pulsation with each ventricular contraction that manifests as widened pulse pressure, rapid distension and collapse of the carotid arteries (Corrigan sign), and a \"to-and-fro\" bruit appreciated over the femoral arteries (Duroziez sign). The hemodynamic changes in AR are evident on cardiac catheterization and include reduced aortic diastolic pressure and elevated left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure due to backflow of blood during diastole. In addition, aortic and LV systolic pressures are increased due to high stroke volume and a compensatory increase in cardiac contractility. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) LV systolic pressure that is higher than aortic systolic pressure is consistent with aortic stenosis. Patients with aortic stenosis have weak and delayed pulses (pulsus parvus et tardus) and pulse pressure may be reduced due to restricted stroke volume. The LV often undergoes concentric hypertrophy (wall-thickening) due to pressure overload.\n\n(Choice B) These are normal LV and aortic pressure findings on cardiac catheterization.\n\n(Choice C) Normal LV systolic and aortic pressures but elevated LV end-diastolic pressure is consistent with compensated heart failure. The left ventricle often undergoes eccentric hypertrophy due to volume overload.\n\n(Choice E) Elevated aortic pressures with no systolic pressure gradient across the aortic valve and normal LV diastolic pressure is consistent with systemic hypertension. Concentric hypertrophy may develop due to pressure overload.",
    "zh": "该患者的表现与主动脉瓣关闭不全(AR)一致，这很可能是感染性心内膜炎的并发症。AR的特征是在舒张期主动脉压力快速下降，因为血液回流到左心室。左心室扩张，舒张末期容积增加，并发生向心性肥大，这使得每搏输出量和心输出量代偿性增加。这些效应的结果是，每次心室收缩时都会出现特征性的高振幅、快速上升-快速下降的搏动，表现为脉压增宽、颈动脉快速扩张和塌陷(Corrigan征)，以及在股动脉上可听到的“来回”杂音(Duroziez征)。AR的血流动力学变化在心脏导管插入术中很明显，包括由于舒张期血液回流导致的主动脉舒张压降低和左心室(LV)舒张压升高。此外，由于高每搏输出量和心肌收缩力代偿性增加，主动脉和左心室收缩压均升高。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n(选项 A) 左心室收缩压高于主动脉收缩压与主动脉瓣狭窄一致。主动脉瓣狭窄患者脉搏微弱且延迟(脉搏微弱)，脉压可能因每搏输出量受限而降低。左心室常因压力超负荷而发生向心性肥大(心壁增厚)。\n\n(选项 B) 这些是心脏导管插入术中正常的左心室和主动脉压力表现。\n\n(选项 C) 正常的左心室收缩压和主动脉压力，但左心室舒张末期压力升高，与代偿性心力衰竭一致。左心室常因容量超负荷而发生向心性肥大。\n\n(选项 E) 主动脉压力升高，主动脉瓣无收缩压梯度，左心室舒张压正常，与全身性高血压一致。可能因压力超负荷而发生向心性肥大。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of aortic regurgitation (AR) and its hemodynamic effects, specifically as assessed during cardiac catheterization. It requires understanding the changes in aortic and left ventricular pressures associated with AR.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the clinical signs of AR (wide pulse pressure, Corrigan's sign, Duroziez's sign) and then select the pressure findings that reflect reduced aortic diastolic pressure and elevated left ventricular diastolic pressure, along with increased systolic pressures.",
