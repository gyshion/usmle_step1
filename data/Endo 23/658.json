  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with lower urinary tract symptoms (eg, hesitancy, dribbling). BPH is characterized by an increase in glandular volume, which obstructs urine flow in the prostatic urethra. Prostate enlargement in BPH is driven primarily by dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is derived from testosterone by 5-alpha-reductase (5AR) in peripheral tissues. DHT has a much higher affinity than testosterone for the androgen receptor and mediates the majority of testosterone effects.\n\n5AR inhibitors (eg, finasteride) are antiandrogen agents that reduce conversion of testosterone to DHT. In men with BPH, 5AR inhibitors induce a gradual reduction in prostate volume, improving urinary flow. However, they are associated with significant androgen-deficiency effects, including decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and decreased ejaculate volume. In addition, the residual testosterone is available for conversion by aromatase to estradiol, leading to gynecomastia.\n\n(Choices B and C) Long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (eg, leuprolide) suppress pituitary LH secretion, leading to decreased testosterone production in Leydig cells. Steroid synthesis inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole) directly reduce testosterone production in the testes. However, 5AR inhibitors affect peripheral testosterone metabolism, not testosterone production.\n\n(Choice D) Aromatase inhibitors (eg, anastrozole) decrease conversion of androgens to the corresponding estrogens and are primarily used in treatment of hormone receptor–positive breast cancer in women. These agents are not used for BPH.\n\n(Choice E) The interaction of testosterone and DHT with the androgen receptor is inhibited by flutamide and spironolactone. These agents have significant feminizing effects (eg, gynecomastia) and are not used in BPH.\n\n(Choice F) The androgen receptor primarily acts as a DNA-binding transcription factor and does not require second messenger action. 5AR inhibitors do not have a significant effect on second messenger systems.\n\nEducational objective:\n5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride) reduce conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. In men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, these agents reduce prostate volume and alleviate obstruction of urinary flow. However, they are associated with androgen-deficiency effects, including decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and decreased ejaculate volume. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有良性前列腺增生症（BPH），并伴有下尿路症状（例如，排尿迟缓、滴尿）。BPH的特征是腺体体积增大，从而阻塞前列腺尿道的尿流。BPH中的前列腺增大主要由双氢睾酮（DHT）驱动，DHT由睾酮在周围组织中通过5-α-还原酶（5AR）产生。DHT与雄激素受体的亲和力远高于睾酮，并介导了大部分睾酮的作用。\n\n5AR抑制剂（例如，非那雄胺）是抗雄激素药物，可减少睾酮向DHT的转化。对于患有BPH的男性，5AR抑制剂可诱导前列腺体积逐渐减小，改善尿流。然而，它们与明显的雄激素缺乏效应相关，包括性欲减退、勃起功能障碍和射精量减少。此外，剩余的睾酮可被芳香化酶转化为雌二醇，导致男性乳房发育。\n\n（选项B和C）长效促性腺激素释放激素（GnRH）类似物（例如，亮丙瑞林）抑制垂体LH分泌，导致间质细胞睾酮产生减少。类固醇合成抑制剂（例如，酮康唑）直接减少睾丸中的睾酮产生。然而，5AR抑制剂影响外周睾酮代谢，而不是睾酮的产生。\n\n（选项D）芳香化酶抑制剂（例如，阿那曲唑）减少雄激素向相应雌激素的转化，主要用于女性激素受体阳性乳腺癌的治疗。这些药物不用于治疗BPH。\n\n（选项E）睾酮和DHT与雄激素受体的相互作用被氟他胺和螺内酯抑制。这些药物具有明显的女性化作用（例如，男性乳房发育），不用于治疗BPH。\n\n（选项F）雄激素受体主要充当DNA结合转录因子，不需要第二信使作用。5AR抑制剂对第二信使系统没有显著影响。\n\n教育目标：\n5-α-还原酶抑制剂（例如，非那雄胺）减少睾酮向双氢睾酮的转化。对于患有良性前列腺增生的男性，这些药物可减小前列腺体积并缓解尿路梗阻。然而，它们与雄激素缺乏效应相关，包括性欲减退、勃起功能障碍和射精量减少。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and the mechanism of action of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors like finasteride, which are commonly used to treat BPH symptoms. It also assesses understanding of the androgen pathway and the role of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in prostate enlargement.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the patient's symptoms as indicative of BPH and to recall that finasteride reduces prostate volume by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to DHT. Understanding the side effects of this medication, such as decreased libido and erectile dysfunction, further supports the correct answer.",
    "zh": "此问题考察了对良性前列腺增生症（BPH）的认识，以及像非那雄胺这样的5-α-还原酶抑制剂的作用机制，这些药物通常用于治疗BPH症状。同时也评估了对雄激素通路和双氢睾酮（DHT）在前列腺增大中的作用的理解。\n\n最好的方法是认识到患者的症状是BPH的征兆，并回忆起非那雄胺通过抑制睾酮向DHT的转化为来减小前列腺体积。了解这种药物的副作用，如性欲减退和勃起功能障碍，进一步支持了正确答案。"
