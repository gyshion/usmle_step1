    "en": "A 28-year-old woman at 32 weeks gestation is seen in the office for a routine prenatal visit. The patient has had burning, squeezing pain in the middle of her chest that lasts for minutes to hours at a time and usually occurs after meals. The pain is occasionally accompanied by small amounts of sour-tasting material in the back of her throat. The patient does not have any abdominal pain, emesis, or visible blood in the stool. Her pregnancy has been complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus, which has been well controlled with nutritional therapy and exercise. She does not use alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are normal. Fundal height is 32 cm and fetal heart tones are normal.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Gastroesophageal reflux is characterized by the retrograde movement of acidic stomach contents through the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) into the esophagus. Manifestations are most common in the minutes or hours after eating and typically include burning, squeezing pain in the retrosternal area, and the regurgitation of acidic (sour-tasting) stomach contents into the mouth.\n\nReflux occurs in most PREGNANT WOMEN and is common in all trimesters. The major underlying cause is elevated ESTROGEN and PROGESTERONE levels, which relax the smooth muscle of the LES leading to decreased LES tone and reduced sensitivity to contractile stimuli (eg, high-protein meal). Later in pregnancy, reflux can also occur when the gravid uterus compresses the stomach and leads to an altered LES angle or increased gastric pressure.\n\n(Choice B) Delayed gastric emptying is common in those with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus due to autonomic neuropathy. It usually presents with nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and a sensation of postprandial fullness. Patients who have short periods of diabetes mellitus (eg, gestational diabetes) are unlikely to develop the autonomic damage that leads to delayed gastric emptying.\n\n(Choice C) Diffuse esophageal spasm presents with difficulty swallowing solids and liquids and a sensation of food getting \"stuck\" in the esophagus. Pregnancy does not increase the risk of esophageal spasm.\n\n(Choice D) Helicobacter pylori infection can cause gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, which typically present with epigastric or abdominal pain 2–5 hours after eating (when acid is in the stomach with no food buffer). H pylori is not considered a predominant cause of reflux.\n\n(Choice E) Increased gastric acid production is seen in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is caused by the secretion of gastrin from a pancreatic or duodenal neuroendocrine tumor. Patients usually have abdominal pain (from peptic ulcers) and diarrhea. Gastric acid levels are not increased in pregnancy.",
    "zh": "胃食管反流的特征是酸性胃内容物通过食管下括约肌（LES）逆行进入食管。 临床表现通常在餐后几分钟或几小时内出现，通常包括胸骨后区域的烧灼样、压榨性疼痛，以及酸性（酸味）胃内容物反流到口腔中。\n\n反流发生在大多数孕妇中，并且在所有三个月内都很常见。 主要的潜在原因是雌激素和孕酮水平升高，这会松弛LES的平滑肌，导致LES张力降低和对收缩刺激（例如，高蛋白餐）的敏感性降低。 在妊娠后期，当妊娠子宫压迫胃并导致LES角度改变或胃内压力增加时，也可能发生反流。\n\n(选项 B) 胃排空延迟在自主神经病变的糖尿病控制不良的患者中很常见。 它通常表现为恶心、呕吐、早期饱腹感和餐后饱胀感。 患有短时间糖尿病（例如，妊娠期糖尿病）的患者不太可能发展导致胃排空延迟的自主神经损伤。\n\n(选项 C) 食管弥漫性痉挛表现为吞咽固体和液体困难，并感觉食物“卡”在食管中。 妊娠不会增加食管痉挛的风险。\n\n(选项 D) 幽门螺杆菌感染可引起胃炎和消化性溃疡病，通常在餐后2-5小时出现上腹部或腹痛（当胃中有酸而没有食物缓冲时）。 幽门螺杆菌不被认为是反流的主要原因。\n\n(选项 E) 胃酸分泌增加见于卓-艾综合征，该综合征是由胰腺或十二指肠神经内分泌肿瘤分泌胃泌素引起的。 患者通常有腹痛（来自消化性溃疡）和腹泻。 妊娠期胃酸水平不会增加。"
