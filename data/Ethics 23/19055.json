  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Voluntarily given informed consent is a prerequisite for proceeding with any nonemergency medical treatment. In this case, informed consent was obtained 3 days prior, but the patient now states that he does not want the surgery. Patients have the right to withdraw consent at any time. When patients change their minds and refuse treatment, it is the physician's responsibility to engage them in a new discussion of informed consent or informed refusal.\n\nThis patient has likely developed concerns about the procedure that were not discussed or fully addressed in the initial informed consent process. The best approach is to ask him what has changed and to explore his specific concerns related to the surgery in a nonjudgmental fashion, without pressuring him to reconsent.\n\n(Choice A) It would be inappropriate to medicate the patient without first assessing his concerns. Sedative drugs have cognitive effects that may impair the patient's capacity to give informed consent or refusal.\n\n(Choice C) Rescheduling the operation without first addressing the patient's concerns and conducting a new informed consent process is inappropriate.\n\n(Choice D) Reviewing only the benefits of the procedure and the risks of no treatment may pressure the patient to reconsent. An informed consent discussion must also include the risks of the procedure and the risks/benefits of alternate treatments.\n\n(Choice E) This patient has withdrawn consent for the procedure, making his signed consent no longer valid. The physician cannot proceed with surgery.",
    "zh": "自愿提供的知情同意是进行任何非紧急医疗治疗的先决条件。在这种情况下，知情同意是在3天前获得的，但患者现在表示他不想做手术。患者有权随时撤回同意。当患者改变主意并拒绝治疗时，医生有责任与他们进行关于知情同意或知情拒绝的新讨论。\n\n该患者可能已经产生了对手术的担忧，这些担忧在最初的知情同意过程中没有被讨论或充分解决。最好的方法是询问他发生了什么变化，并以非评判的方式探讨他与手术相关的具体担忧，而不是强迫他重新同意。\n\n（选项A）在没有首先评估患者的担忧的情况下给药是不合适的。镇静药物具有认知影响，可能会损害患者提供知情同意或拒绝的能力。\n\n（选项C）在没有首先解决患者的担忧并进行新的知情同意程序的情况下重新安排手术是不合适的。\n\n（选项D）仅回顾手术的益处和不治疗的风险可能会迫使患者重新同意。知情同意讨论还必须包括手术的风险以及替代治疗的风险/益处。\n\n（选项E）该患者已撤回手术的同意，使其签署的同意不再有效。医生不能进行手术。"
