    "en": "A 54-year-old man comes to the office due to concerns about having pancreatic cancer after a coworker died of the disease 6 months ago. The patient has no epigastric pain, jaundice, or weight loss. However, he worries constantly because in researching the illness he read that it may not have obvious symptoms in early stages and can be rapidly fatal. The patient saw another physician 2 months ago, who performed a physical examination, laboratory evaluation, and abdominal CT scan. The results were normal and the physician reassured the patient that he did not have cancer. However, the patient reports that he has noticed occasional stomach noises after eating and would like to have additional testing done.",

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's excessive worry about having pancreatic cancer despite negative medical evaluation is consistent with ILLNESS ANXIETY DISORDER (IAD, [hypochondriasis]). Patients with IAD are preoccupied with fears of having a SERIOUS, UNDIAGNOSED ILLNESS and are rarely reassured by negative findings on physical examination or laboratory testing. Their fears of illness often become a dominant feature of their lives and lead to HIGH HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION (eg, doctor shopping, requests for repeated testing). These patients often have catastrophic interpretations of normal physical sensations (eg, this patient thinking that stomach noises could signify cancer).\n\nIAD is differentiated from somatic symptom disorder in that patients with IAD have MINIMAL OR NO SOMATIC SYMPTOMS. In contrast, patients with somatic symptom disorder have prominent and typically multiple somatic symptoms (Choice G). Initial management of IAD consists of scheduling regular visits, limiting diagnostic tests and referrals, and focusing on coping and functional improvement.\n\n(Choice A) Although this patient's anxiety about pancreatic cancer was triggered by his coworker's death, adjustment disorder is not diagnosed when symptoms are better explained by another disorder.\n\n(Choice B) Conversion disorder (functional neurologic symptom disorder) is characterized by neurologic symptoms (eg, weakness, nonepileptic seizures) that are inconsistent with any known condition.\n\n(Choice C) Patients with IAD are not delusional and can acknowledge the possibility that they do not have the disease. In contrast, patients with delusional disorder, somatic type, have false, fixed beliefs about the body.\n\n(Choice D) Factitious disorder involves the intentional falsification of illness with the goal of assuming the sick role.\n\n(Choice E) This patient's anxiety appears to be restricted to fears of having a serious illness. Patients with generalized anxiety disorder worry excessively about multiple everyday issues (eg, relationships, work, finances), not just health anxiety.\n\nEducational objective:\nIllness anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive concern about having a serious, undiagnosed disease, despite few or no symptoms and negative medical workup.",
    "zh": "尽管医学评估结果呈阴性，但该患者过度担心患胰腺癌的情况与疾病焦虑症（IAD，[疑病症]）一致。患有IAD的患者会专注于担心患有严重、未确诊的疾病，并且很少因体格检查或实验室检查的阴性结果而感到安心。他们对疾病的恐惧常常成为他们生活的主要特征，并导致高医疗保健利用率（例如，四处求医、要求重复检查）。这些患者通常会对正常的身体感觉做出灾难性的解读（例如，该患者认为胃部噪音可能预示着癌症）。\n\nIAD与躯体症状障碍的区别在于，患有IAD的患者有轻微或没有躯体症状。相比之下，患有躯体症状障碍的患者有明显的、通常是多重的躯体症状（选项G）。IAD的初步管理包括安排定期复诊、限制诊断性检查和转诊，以及侧重于应对和功能改善。\n\n（选项A）尽管该患者对胰腺癌的焦虑是由他的同事的死亡引发的，但当症状可以用另一种疾病更好地解释时，不诊断为适应障碍。\n\n（选项B）转换障碍（功能性神经症状障碍）的特征是神经系统症状（例如，无力、非癫痫发作），与任何已知疾病不符。\n\n（选项C）患有IAD的患者没有妄想，并且可以承认他们可能没有患病。相比之下，患有妄想障碍（躯体型）的患者对身体有错误的、固定的信念。\n\n（选项D）诈病涉及故意伪造疾病，目的是扮演病人角色。\n\n（选项E）该患者的焦虑似乎仅限于担心患有严重疾病。患有广泛性焦虑症的患者会过度担心多个日常问题（例如，人际关系、工作、财务），而不仅仅是健康焦虑。\n\n教育目标：疾病焦虑症的特征是过度关注患有严重、未确诊的疾病，尽管几乎没有或没有症状并且医学检查结果呈阴性。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding and differentiation of somatic symptom and related disorders, specifically focusing on illness anxiety disorder versus somatic symptom disorder and other anxiety-related conditions.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully evaluating the patient's presentation, particularly the presence and prominence of somatic symptoms, the nature of their health-related worries, and their response to medical reassurance, to distinguish between the various diagnostic options.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对躯体症状和相关障碍的理解和区分，特别侧重于疾病焦虑症与躯体症状障碍以及其他与焦虑相关的疾病。\n\n解决这个问题的方法包括仔细评估患者的临床表现，特别是躯体症状的存在和突出程度、他们与健康相关的担忧的性质以及他们对医疗安慰的反应，以区分各种诊断选择。"
