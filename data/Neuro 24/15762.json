    "en": "A 12-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother due to unusual nighttime behavior. The mother reports that once or twice a month over the past year she has found her daughter walking around the house between the hours of midnight and 2 AM. The mother says, \"Although her eyes are open, she appears to be in a daze and doesn't respond to me. I guide her back to bed and she goes back to sleep, but I worry that she could get hurt or fall down the stairs if I'm not there.\" The girl has no recollection of the events.",

    "en": "This girl's nighttime ambulation associated with incomplete arousal and amnesia for the event is consistent with SLEEPWALKING, a non-REM (NREM) parasomnia. Sleepwalking is more common in children, peaks at age 8-12, and often remits spontaneously. NREM-related parasomnias such as sleepwalking and sleep terrors occur during DEEP, SLOW-WAVE SLEEP. Deep, slow-wave sleep is more prominent in the first half of the night, and as a result, NREM-related parasomnias occur more commonly during this time.\n\nSleep is divided into NREM and REM sleep. Most dreams occur during REM sleep. NREM sleep is further divided into 3 substages based on depth of sleep (N1, N2, and N3). Brain waves of different frequencies are associated with different stages of sleep. DELTA WAVES (frequency up to 3.99 Hz) are characteristic of deep, slow-wave sleep (stage N3). Alpha and beta waves are characteristic of wakefulness and REM sleep (Choices A and B). K complexes and Sleep spindles are characteristic of stage N2 (light, stable sleep) (Choices D and E).\n\nEducational objective:\nSleepwalking, a common non-REM parasomnia of childhood, occurs during slow-wave sleep (stage N3), which is characterized by delta waves on EEG. Sleepwalking typically occurs during the first half of the night, when slow-wave sleep is most prominent.",
    "zh": "这个女孩的夜间行走，伴随着不完全觉醒和对事件的失忆，与梦游症一致，这是一种非快速眼动（NREM）睡眠异态。梦游在儿童中更常见，高峰年龄为8-12岁，并且经常自发缓解。与NREM相关的睡眠异态，如梦游和夜惊，发生在深度慢波睡眠期间。深度慢波睡眠在夜间前半段更为突出，因此，与NREM相关的睡眠异态更常发生在这个时候。\n\n睡眠分为NREM和REM睡眠。大多数梦发生在REM睡眠期间。NREM睡眠根据睡眠深度进一步分为3个亚阶段（N1、N2和N3）。不同频率的脑电波与不同的睡眠阶段相关联。δ波（频率高达3.99 Hz）是深度慢波睡眠（N3期）的特征。α波和β波是清醒和REM睡眠的特征（选项A和B）。K复合波和睡眠纺锤波是N2期（浅度、稳定睡眠）的特征（选项D和E）。\n\n教育目标：\n梦游，一种常见的儿童非快速眼动睡眠异态，发生在慢波睡眠（N3期）期间，其特征是脑电图上的δ波。梦游通常发生在夜间前半段，此时慢波睡眠最为突出。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of NREM parasomnias, specifically sleepwalking, and its association with a particular sleep stage and characteristic EEG pattern. It requires knowledge of the different sleep stages and their corresponding EEG findings.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the clinical presentation as sleepwalking, recognizing that sleepwalking is a NREM parasomnia occurring during slow-wave sleep (stage N3), and then recalling the EEG pattern associated with stage N3 sleep, which is delta waves.",
