    "en": "A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital due to 2 days of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and headache. She was recently hospitalized due to a stroke, and the hospitalization was complicated by a urinary tract infection and delirium. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and her treatment regimen includes theophylline. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 118/min, and respirations are 22/min. On physical examination, the patient appears agitated and restless. There is a coarse tremor of the outstretched arms. Chest auscultation reveals mild expiratory wheezing. Serum theophylline levels are markedly elevated. ",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient was most likely treated with ciprofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone) for her urinary tract infection and experienced subsequent theophylline toxicity. Theophylline is an adenosine receptor antagonist and phosphodiesterase inhibitor that is sometimes used as an alternate therapy for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It causes bronchodilation primarily by increasing intracellular cyclic AMP levels (similar to beta-adrenergic agonists) and also has mild anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nTheophylline is metabolized predominantly by hepatic cytochrome oxidases. Inhibition of these enzymes by concurrent illness (eg, infection with fever) or ingestion of certain drugs or substances (eg, ciprofloxacin) can raise serum concentrations and cause theophylline toxicity due to the drug's narrow therapeutic index. Toxicity presents with excessive CNS stimulation (eg, tremor, insomnia, seizures), gastrointestinal disturbances, and cardiovascular abnormalities (eg, hypotension, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias).\n\n(Choices A, B, and E) Amoxicillin and cephalexin are beta-lactams that inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis. Nitrofurantoin inactivates or alters bacterial ribosomal proteins to inhibit protein and cell wall synthesis. These antibiotics do not interact significantly with the hepatic cytochrome oxidase system.\n\n(Choice D) Haloperidol blocks postsynaptic dopamine (D2) receptors in the brain but does not interact significantly with theophylline to cause toxicity. Chronic haloperidol use can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome presenting with fever, mental status changes, muscle rigidity, and autonomic instability.\n\nEducational objective:\nTheophylline is an adenosine receptor antagonist and indirect adrenergic agent with a narrow therapeutic index. It is predominantly metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome oxidases. Inhibition of these enzymes by concurrent illness (eg, infection with fever) or ingestion of certain drugs or substances (eg, ciprofloxacin) can raise serum concentrations and cause toxicity (eg, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias).",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能因尿路感染接受了环丙沙星（一种氟喹诺酮类药物）的治疗，随后出现茶碱毒性。茶碱是一种腺苷受体拮抗剂和磷酸二酯酶抑制剂，有时被用作哮喘和慢性阻塞性肺病的替代疗法。它主要通过增加细胞内环磷酸腺苷水平（类似于β-肾上腺素能受体激动剂）引起支气管扩张，并且还具有轻微的抗炎作用。\n\n茶碱主要由肝细胞色素氧化酶代谢。同时发生的疾病（如发热感染）或摄入某些药物或物质（如环丙沙星）抑制这些酶，会导致血清浓度升高，并由于该药物的治疗指数狭窄而引起茶碱毒性。毒性表现为过度中枢神经系统刺激（如震颤、失眠、癫痫发作）、胃肠道紊乱和心血管异常（如低血压、心动过速、心律失常）。\n\n（选项A、B和E）阿莫西林和头孢氨苄是抑制细菌细胞壁合成的β-内酰胺类抗生素。呋喃妥因使细菌核糖体蛋白失活或改变，从而抑制蛋白质和细胞壁的合成。这些抗生素与肝细胞色素氧化酶系统没有显着相互作用。\n\n（选项D）氟哌啶醇阻断大脑中的突触后多巴胺（D2）受体，但与茶碱的相互作用不明显，不会引起毒性。长期使用氟哌啶醇可引起神经安定药恶性综合征，表现为发热、精神状态改变、肌肉僵硬和自主神经功能不稳定。\n\n教育目标：\n茶碱是一种腺苷受体拮抗剂和间接肾上腺素能药物，治疗指数狭窄。它主要由肝细胞色素氧化酶代谢。同时发生的疾病（如发热感染）或摄入某些药物或物质（如环丙沙星）抑制这些酶，会导致血清浓度升高，并引起毒性（如癫痫发作、心律失常）。"
