    "en": "A 13-year-old girl is brought to the office for a routine visit. Although the patient is doing well in school and has friends, her mother is concerned about a change in her behavior over the past several months. They had previously enjoyed spending time together, but now the patient is frequently moody and spends most of her time on the computer in her locked bedroom. The mother also observes that her daughter gets upset for no reason and has used swear words on occasion. When the mother recently complimented her party outfit, the girl screamed, \"I look hideous and I'm not going,\" and stormed out of the room. Later that day, she seemed fine and went to the party. On examination, the patient is pleasant and cooperative but makes little eye contact and asks if she can keep her tank top on during the examination.",
    "zh": "一名13岁女孩因例行就诊来到诊所。尽管该患者在学校表现良好并且有朋友，但她的母亲担心她在过去几个月中的行为发生了变化。她们以前喜欢一起度过时光，但现在患者经常情绪低落，并且大部分时间都在她锁着的卧室里的电脑上度过。母亲还观察到她的女儿无缘无故地生气，并且偶尔会说脏话。当母亲最近称赞她的派对服装时，女孩尖叫道：“我看起来很丑，我不去了，”然后冲出了房间。当天晚些时候，她看起来很好，并且去参加了派对。检查时，患者表现得愉快且配合，但很少进行眼神交流，并询问她是否可以在检查期间穿着她的背心。"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's intense SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS, concerns about appearance and social acceptance, MOODINESS, increasing NEED FOR PRIVACY, and transient EMOTIONAL OUTBURSTS are characteristic of NORMAL ADOLESCENCE. Adolescence involves the developmental tasks of separating from the family, developing a sense of identity, and adjusting to the hormonal and physical changes of puberty. This girl's reluctance to remove her tank top for the physical examination is likely related to her self-consciousness regarding pubertal development.\n\nAlthough differentiating normal adolescent behavior from early signs of psychiatric disorders can be difficult, this patient's engagement with school and friends is reassuring. In contrast, adolescents exhibiting persistent anger, sadness, impulsivity, sleep or appetite disturbance, declining academic performance, and social isolation from peers warrant further evaluation.\n\n(Choice A) Patients with body dysmorphic disorder are excessively preoccupied with perceived defects in their physical appearance and engage in time-consuming, repetitive behaviors (eg, mirror checking, excessive grooming) that cause significant impairment in functioning. This patient's appearance concerns and self-consciousness about her changing body are typical of early adolescence.\n\n(Choice B) Although this girl exhibits mood lability that can be seen in borderline personality disorder, she lacks the pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships and self-image, marked impulsivity, and self-injury that characterize the disorder. Personality disorders are not diagnosed in adolescence, as the personality is still forming.\n\n(Choice C) Cyclothymic disorder is a chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance involving numerous periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms that are insufficient to meet the criteria for hypomanic or major depressive episodes. Symptoms must be present for at least a year in children and adolescents and cause significant distress and impairment; this is not the case in this patient.\n\n(Choice D) Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a new diagnosis in DSM-5, is characterized by persistent irritability and frequent, developmentally inappropriate temper outbursts. This patient's transient emotional outburst related to insecurity about social acceptance is consistent with normal adolescent development.\n\n(Choice F) This patient does not exhibit the argumentative, defiant, and vindictive behavior required for the diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder.\n\nEducational objective:\nAdolescence often involves some degree of moodiness, intense self-consciousness, and transient emotional outbursts. Assessment of severity, persistence, and degree of social and academic impairment can help differentiate normal adolescent behavior from behavioral changes requiring further evaluation.",
    "zh": "该患者强烈的自我意识、对容貌和社会接纳的担忧、情绪低落、对隐私的需求增加以及短暂的情绪爆发是正常青春期的特征。青春期涉及与家庭分离、发展自我认同感以及适应青春期的荷尔蒙和身体变化的发育任务。这个女孩在体格检查中不愿意脱掉她的背心可能与她对青春期发育的自我意识有关。\n\n尽管区分正常的青少年行为和精神疾病的早期迹象可能很困难，但该患者参与学校和朋友是令人欣慰的。相比之下，表现出持续性愤怒、悲伤、冲动、睡眠或食欲紊乱、学习成绩下降以及与同伴隔离的青少年需要进一步评估。\n\n(选项 A) 患有躯体变形障碍的患者会过度关注对其外貌的感知缺陷，并从事耗时、重复的行为（例如，照镜子、过度修饰），这些行为会导致功能严重受损。该患者对容貌的担忧以及对身体变化的自我意识是青春期早期的典型特征。\n\n(选项 B) 尽管该女孩表现出情绪不稳定，这可能在边缘型人格障碍中可见，但她缺乏人际关系和自我形象不稳定的普遍模式，以及以该疾病为特征的明显冲动和自残。青春期不诊断人格障碍，因为人格仍在形成中。\n\n(选项 C) 环性心境障碍是一种慢性的、波动的情绪障碍，涉及许多轻躁狂和抑郁症状时期，这些症状不足以满足轻躁狂或重度抑郁发作的标准。症状必须至少在儿童和青少年中存在一年并引起严重的痛苦和损害；在这种情况下，患者并非如此。\n\n(选项 D) 破坏性心境失调障碍是 DSM-5 中的一项新诊断，其特征是持续的易怒和频繁的、与发育不符的暴怒。该患者与对社会接纳缺乏安全感相关的一过性情绪爆发与正常的青少年发育一致。\n\n(选项 F) 该患者没有表现出诊断对立违抗性障碍所需的争论性、反抗性和报复性行为。\n\n教育目标：\n青春期通常涉及一定程度的情绪低落、强烈的自我意识和短暂的情绪爆发。评估严重程度、持续时间和对社会和学业的影响程度可以帮助区分正常的青少年行为和需要进一步评估的行为改变。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of normal adolescent developmental changes versus early signs of psychiatric disorders. It requires differentiating typical moodiness, self-consciousness, and emotional outbursts of adolescence from more persistent and impairing symptoms indicative of conditions like body dysmorphic disorder, borderline personality disorder, cyclothymic disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, or oppositional defiant disorder.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully evaluate the patient's presentation against the diagnostic criteria for various psychiatric disorders, paying close attention to the duration, severity, and impact of the behaviors on functioning. Recognizing the developmental context of adolescence is crucial in distinguishing normal behaviors from those requiring further clinical attention.",
