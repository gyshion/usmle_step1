  "explanation": {
    "en": "This newborn had elevated indirect bilirubin levels with jaundice that self-resolved in the first week of life, findings consistent with benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.\n\nNormally, unconjugated bilirubin is released into the bloodstream upon breakdown of red blood cells (RBCs) and taken up by the liver. Hepatic UDP glucuronosyltransferase then conjugates bilirubin, which is secreted into bile and excreted into the intestines. Bacterial enzymes in the intestines then reduce bilirubin to urobilinogen, allowing for excretion through the urine and stool.\n\nBenign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is caused by several physiologic differences in bilirubin metabolism in newborns as compared to those in older children and adults.\n\n•\tFirst, bilirubin production is increased due to increased breakdown of fetal RBCs, which are high in number (hematocrit up to 60%) and have a shorter life span (90 days as compared to 120 days in adults).\n•\tSecond, bilirubin conjugation is decreased due to physiologically lower levels of UDP glucuronosyltransferase in the immature neonatal liver.\n•\tFinally, relative gut sterility in newborns results in decreased reduction of bilirubin to urobilinogen; instead, intestinal β-glucuronidase (which is synthesized both endogenously and by gut bacteria) deconjugates the bilirubin which allows it to be reabsorbed, therefore increasing enterohepatic circulation.\n\nEducational objective:\nPathophysiology of benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia involves increased bilirubin production and decreased bilirubin conjugation as well as increased enterohepatic circulation. Indirect hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice typically peak in the first few days of life and usually resolve without intervention.",
    "zh": "这名新生儿间接胆红素水平升高，并出现黄疸，黄疸在出生后第一周自行消退，这些发现与良性新生儿高胆红素血症一致。\n\n正常情况下，未结合胆红素在红细胞（RBC）分解后释放到血液中，并被肝脏摄取。然后，肝脏中的 UDP 葡萄糖醛酸转移酶使胆红素结合，结合后的胆红素被分泌到胆汁中，并排泄到肠道中。肠道中的细菌酶随后将胆红素还原为尿胆原，从而可以通过尿液和大便排出。\n\n良性新生儿高胆红素血症是由新生儿与年龄较大的儿童和成人相比，胆红素代谢的几种生理差异引起的。\n\n•\t首先，由于胎儿红细胞分解增加，胆红素的产生增加，胎儿红细胞数量高（血细胞比容高达 60%），寿命较短（90 天，而成人为 120 天）。\n•\t其次，由于未成熟的新生儿肝脏中生理性水平较低的 UDP 葡萄糖醛酸转移酶，胆红素结合减少。\n•\t最后，新生儿相对的肠道无菌会导致胆红素还原为尿胆原减少；相反，肠道 β-葡萄糖醛酸酶（由内源性和肠道细菌合成）使胆红素去结合，从而使其被重新吸收，因此增加了肝肠循环。\n\n教育目标：\n良性新生儿高胆红素血症的病理生理学涉及胆红素产生增加，胆红素结合减少以及肝肠循环增加。间接高胆红素血症和黄疸通常在出生后的头几天达到峰值，通常无需干预即可消退。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of neonatal jaundice, specifically the differences in bilirubin metabolism between newborns and adults. It assesses understanding of bilirubin production, conjugation, and enterohepatic circulation in the context of benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the key differences in bilirubin metabolism in newborns: increased bilirubin production due to fetal RBC breakdown, decreased bilirubin conjugation due to immature UDP glucuronosyltransferase, and increased enterohepatic circulation due to gut sterility and β-glucuronidase activity.",
