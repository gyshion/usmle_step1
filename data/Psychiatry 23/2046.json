    "en": "A 45-year-old man comes to the office due to chronic insomnia. The patient has trouble sleeping because he claims he must remain alert to protect himself from workers at a nearby chemical plant. He says they are poisoning him by secretly dumping toxic waste in his backyard at night. The patient's wife says, \"He's been like this for the past 10 years. He gets very upset when asked for proof, so he's going to install cameras next week.\" She has never seen any unusual activity in the backyard and says that her husband has never received an actual threat or endured actual harm. He has ordered numerous soil toxicity tests over the years, all of which have been negative. The patient started working as a taxi driver at age 21 and continues to work for the same company. He has no history of psychiatric treatment.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's persistent belief that he is being poisoned is consistent with DELUSIONAL DISORDER, which is characterized by ≥1 delusions for ≥1 months. Other positive psychotic symptoms, such as HALLUCINATIONS and DISORGANIZATION, are absent. Apart from the direct impact of the delusions (eg, this patient's insomnia, repeated soil testing), overall behavior in patients with delusional disorder is not obviously bizarre or odd, and general functioning is not significantly impaired (eg, this patient has a stable relationship and employment).\n\nPatients with delusional disorder typically have a persistent, overriding delusion with a specific theme. The diagnosis is further classified based on the type of belief: erotomanic (believing someone is in love with them), grandiose (believing they have great talent, insights, or achievements), jealous (believing their partner is unfaithful), persecutory (believing they are being cheated, spied on, poisoned, or harassed), or somatic (believing bodily functions and sensations are abnormal).\n\n(Choice B) Major depressive disorder with psychotic features can present with delusions as well as insomnia; however, this patient lacks other characteristic depressive symptoms (eg, persistent low mood, amotivation, fatigue, worthlessness), and his symptoms have not caused significant impairment in daily functioning.\n\n(Choices C and F) Personality disorders involve persistent patterns of behavior usually arising in early adulthood. They are pervasive across a broad range of situations (eg, interpersonal, vocational) but do not involve specific delusions (eg, persistent false, fixed beliefs). Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by overarching suspiciousness or distrust (eg, if this patient were generally distrustful of many people, including the chemical plant workers, but did not have fixed beliefs that they were poisoning him). Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by eccentric behavior and odd thoughts and perceptions but no clear delusions.\n\n(Choices D and E) Schizophrenia (≥6 months) and schizophreniform disorder (≥1 month and <6 months) are characterized by ≥2 of the following: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms. In contrast, patients with delusional disorder have delusions but no other psychotic symptoms.",
    "zh": "该患者持续相信自己被毒害，这与妄想症一致，其特征是存在≥1个月的≥1个妄想。其他阳性精神病症状，如幻觉和思维紊乱，不存在。除了妄想的直接影响（例如，该患者的失眠、反复的土壤检测），妄想症患者的总体行为没有明显怪异或怪异之处，并且一般功能没有受到显着损害（例如，该患者有稳定的关系和工作）。\n\n妄想症患者通常有一种持续的、主要的、具有特定主题的妄想。诊断进一步根据信仰类型进行分类：情爱妄想（相信某人爱上了他们）、夸大妄想（相信他们有很高的才能、见解或成就）、嫉妒妄想（相信他们的伴侣不忠）、迫害妄想（相信他们正在被欺骗、监视、毒害或骚扰）或躯体妄想（相信身体功能和感觉异常）。\n\n（选项B）伴有精神病特征的重度抑郁症可以表现为妄想和失眠；然而，该患者缺乏其他特征性的抑郁症状（例如，持续的低落情绪、缺乏动力、疲劳、无价值感），并且他的症状并未导致日常功能受到显着损害。\n\n（选项C和F）人格障碍涉及通常在成年早期出现的持续行为模式。它们在广泛的情况下（例如，人际关系、职业）中普遍存在，但不涉及特定的妄想（例如，持续的错误、固定的信念）。偏执型人格障碍的特征是普遍的猜疑或不信任（例如，如果该患者通常不信任许多人，包括化工厂工人，但没有固定的信念认为他们正在毒害他）。分裂型人格障碍的特征是古怪的行为和奇怪的想法和感知，但没有明显的妄想。\n\n（选项D和E）精神分裂症（≥6个月）和分裂样精神病（≥1个月且<6个月）的特征是以下≥2个：妄想、幻觉、思维混乱、瓦解或紧张症行为和阴性症状。相比之下，妄想症患者有妄想，但没有其他精神病症状。"
