    "en": "A 26-year-old man comes to the office due to a 3-day-history of dysuria and urethral discharge. The symptoms developed about 2 weeks after he had unprotected sexual intercourse with a new partner. His temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F). On physical examination, a mucoid discharge is expressed with gentle milking of the penis. Gram stain of the discharge reveals numerous neutrophils with intracellular diplococci. A sample of the discharge is placed on an antibiotic-containing medium, and bacterial colonies are cultured.",

    "en": "This patient with dysuria and urethral discharge has gonococcal urethritis as indicated by the Gram stain showing gram-negative diplococci within leukocytes. Neisseria gonorrhoeae can be cultured on Thayer-Martin VCN selective medium, which contains vancomycin, colistin, nystatin, and trimethoprim. These antibiotics kill potential contaminants such as gram-positive organisms (vancomycin), gram-negative organisms other than Neisseria (colistin and trimethoprim), and fungi (nystatin).\n\n(Choice A) Differential media help identify cultured organisms based on their metabolic and biochemical properties. Examples of differential media include the MacConkey and eosin methylene blue (EMB) agars used to culture enteric organisms. Organisms that ferment lactose will appear pink on MacConkey agar and black on EMB agar.\n\n(Choice B) Enrichment media contain special growth factors required for some organisms. Examples include the X and V factors required by Haemophilus or the anaerobic conditions needed by Clostridium species.\n\n(Choice C) Reducing media (eg, thioglycolate broth) remove oxygen and are used to culture anaerobic organisms.\n\n(Choice E) A synthetic medium is any chemically-defined medium for which all of the chemical contents are known.\n\nEducational objective:\nNeisseria can be isolated by culture on selective media such as the Thayer-Martin VCN (vancomycin/colistin/nystatin) medium, which inhibits growth of contaminants such as gram-positive organisms, gram-negative organisms other than Neisseria, and fungi.",
    "zh": "该出现排尿困难和尿道分泌物的患者患有淋病性尿道炎，如革兰染色所示，在白细胞内可见革兰阴性双球菌。淋病奈瑟菌可在Thayer-Martin VCN选择性培养基上培养，该培养基含有万古霉素、粘菌素、制霉菌素和甲氧苄氨嘧啶。这些抗生素可杀死潜在的污染物，例如革兰阳性菌（万古霉素）、除奈瑟菌外的革兰阴性菌（粘菌素和甲氧苄氨嘧啶）以及真菌（制霉菌素）。\n\n(选项 A) 鉴别培养基根据培养的微生物的代谢和生化特性来帮助鉴定它们。鉴别培养基的例子包括用于培养肠道微生物的麦康凯琼脂和伊红美蓝 (EMB) 琼脂。乳糖发酵菌在麦康凯琼脂上呈粉红色，在EMB琼脂上呈黑色。\n\n(选项 B) 增菌培养基包含某些微生物所需的特殊生长因子。例子包括嗜血杆菌所需的 X 和 V 因子，或梭菌属所需的厌氧条件。\n\n(选项 C) 还原培养基（例如，硫乙醇酸盐肉汤）去除氧气，用于培养厌氧微生物。\n\n(选项 E) 合成培养基是指任何化学定义的培养基，其中所有化学成分都是已知的。\n\n教学目标：\n奈瑟菌可以通过在选择性培养基上培养来分离，例如Thayer-Martin VCN（万古霉素/粘菌素/制霉菌素）培养基，它抑制污染物（如革兰阳性菌、除奈瑟菌外的革兰阴性菌和真菌）的生长。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of different types of microbiological culture media and their specific uses in isolating and identifying bacterial pathogens. Specifically, it focuses on the properties of selective media and their application in culturing Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key information: the medium contains antibiotics that inhibit the growth of certain organisms. This indicates a selective medium designed to isolate a specific pathogen by suppressing the growth of other potential contaminants.",
