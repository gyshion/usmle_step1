    "en": "Perfusion defect without ventilation defect {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} Pulmonary embolism (PE) should be suspected in this patient with recent extended travel (prolonged immobilization) who now has acute-onset dyspnea and tachypnea, normal lung examination, and sinus tachycardia on ECG. In most patients, CT angiography, which requires intravenous contrast administration, is the diagnostic test of choice. However, the contrast used in CT studies should be avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease due to the increased risk of contrast-induced nephropathy; in such patients, a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan is the preferred diagnostic study.\n\nA V/Q scan is a nuclear medicine study that uses a radioactive tracer placed in both inhaled gas and the bloodstream to visualize areas of ventilation and perfusion in the lung. In patients with PE, ventilation is preserved but the embolus prevents adequate blood perfusion to the affected areas of the lung. Therefore, the most definitive diagnostic finding for PE on V/Q scan is a large area showing a perfusion defect without ventilation defect (mismatched perfusion defect).\n\n(Choice A) The absence of perfusion abnormalities is a useful finding on V/Q scan, as it likely rules out significant PE.\n\n(Choices B and E) Matched ventilation and perfusion defects may result from chronic lung abnormalities (eg, airway inflammation or obstruction, atelectasis) that lead to localized areas of poor ventilation with corresponding hypoxic vasoconstriction, or they may represent a PE that happens to be in an area of poor ventilation. These results are often inconclusive and necessitate additional testing to confirm or rule out PE.\n\n(Choice D) An area of ventilation defect without perfusion defect is suggestive of conditions that lead to acute alveolar filling (eg, pneumonia, pulmonary edema).",
    "zh": "灌注缺陷，无通气缺陷 {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} 对于近期有长途旅行史（长期制动）的患者，如果出现突发性呼吸困难和呼吸急促、肺部检查正常以及心电图显示窦性心动过速，应怀疑肺栓塞（PE）。在大多数患者中，需要静脉注射造影剂的CT血管造影是首选的诊断方法。然而，在慢性肾脏病患者中，应避免使用CT研究中使用的造影剂，因为这样会增加造影剂诱发的肾病的风险；对于此类患者，通气/灌注（V/Q）扫描是首选的诊断研究。\n\nV/Q扫描是一种核医学研究，它使用放射性示踪剂放置在吸入气体和血流中，以可视化肺内的通气和灌注区域。对于PE患者，通气是保留的，但栓子阻止了对肺部受影响区域的充分血液灌注。因此，V/Q扫描上PE的最明确的诊断发现是显示灌注缺陷而无通气缺陷的大面积区域（不匹配的灌注缺陷）。\n\n(选项A) 无灌注异常是V/Q扫描的有用发现，因为它很可能排除了严重的PE。\n\n(选项B和E) 匹配的通气和灌注缺陷可能源于慢性肺部异常（例如，气道炎症或阻塞、肺不张），这些异常导致局部通气不良区域伴有相应的缺氧性血管收缩，或者它们可能代表发生在通气不良区域的PE。这些结果通常不确定，需要进行额外的检查以确认或排除PE。\n\n(选项D) 无灌注缺陷的通气缺陷区域提示导致急性肺泡充盈的病症（例如，肺炎、肺水肿）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis, specifically the interpretation of ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan results. It requires understanding the pathophysiology of PE and how it affects ventilation and perfusion in the lungs.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the classic V/Q scan finding in PE: a perfusion defect without a ventilation defect. This mismatch indicates an area where air is entering the alveoli, but blood flow is obstructed, typically by a pulmonary embolus. Consider recent travel as a risk factor for PE.",
