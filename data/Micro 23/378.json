    "en": "Vertical transmission of hepatitis B from pregnant females to the unborn child can occur with active hepatitis B infection. Typically, such transmission takes place during the passage of the fetus through the birth canal, but transplacental infection can also occur. This is especially common in those women who developed acute hepatitis B infection in the third trimester.\n\nThe presence of HBeAg (a soluble protein that is a marker of viral replication and increased infectivity) in the mother significantly increases the risk of vertical transmission of the virus. Were this woman HBeAg negative, her neonate's risk of infection would be 20%. If she were HBeAg positive, however, her neonate's risk of infection would be 95%. Moreover, should the infant become infected, his chance of progression to chronic hepatitis is 90%. Because of this concern, the newborns of all mothers with active hepatitis B are passively immunized at birth with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), followed by active immunization with recombinant HBV vaccine.\n\n(Choice A) HBcAg is not detectable in serum as it is normally sequestrated within the HBsAg coat.\n\n(Choice B) HBsAg is the first virological marker detected in the serum after inoculation, preceding both the elevation of serum aminotransferases and the onset of clinical symptoms. It remains detectable during the entire symptomatic phase of acute hepatitis B and suggests infectivity. It is not the most ominous marker in the pregnant woman, however.\n\n(Choice D) Anti-HBc appears in the serum shortly after the emergence of HBsAg and remains detectable long after the patient recovers. The IgM fraction signals the acute phase of disease, whereas the IgG fraction signals recovery from the disease. Because IgM anti-HBc is present in the \"window period,\" it is an important tool for diagnosis when HBsAg has been cleared and anti-HBs is not yet detectable. Thus IgM anti-HBc is the most specific marker for diagnosis of acute hepatitis B.\n\n(Choice E) Anti-HBe suggests the cessation of active viral replication and low infectivity.\n\n(Choice F) Anti-HBsAg IgG appears in the serum after either successful HBV vaccination or the clearance of HBsAg and remains detectable for life. It serves as an indicator of noninfectivity and immunity. However, there is a time lag between the disappearance of HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs in the serum, which is termed the \"window period.\"",
    "zh": "乙型肝炎从孕妇向未出生的孩子垂直传播可发生在活动性乙型肝炎感染中。 这种传播通常发生在胎儿通过产道时，但也可发生经胎盘感染。这在那些在妊娠晚期发生急性乙型肝炎感染的妇女中尤为常见。\n\n母亲中 HBeAg（一种可溶性蛋白，是病毒复制和感染性增加的标志物）的存在会显著增加病毒垂直传播的风险。如果这位女性 HBeAg 阴性，其新生儿的感染风险将为 20%。 然而，如果她 HBeAg 阳性，那么她的新生儿的感染风险将为 95%。 此外，如果婴儿受到感染，他进展为慢性肝炎的几率为 90%。 由于这种担忧，所有患有活动性乙型肝炎的母亲的新生儿在出生时都会被动免疫接种乙型肝炎免疫球蛋白 (HBIG)，然后主动免疫接种重组 HBV 疫苗。\n\n(选项 A) 由于 HBcAg 通常被隔离在 HBsAg 包膜内，因此在血清中无法检测到。\n\n(选项 B) HBsAg 是接种后在血清中检测到的第一个病毒学标志物，早于血清转氨酶升高和临床症状的出现。它在急性乙型肝炎的整个有症状阶段保持可检测，并提示感染性。然而，它并不是孕妇中最不祥的标志物。\n\n(选项 D) 抗 HBc 出现于 HBsAg 出现后不久，并在患者康复后很长时间内保持可检测。IgM 组分提示疾病的急性期，而 IgG 组分提示疾病的恢复期。由于 IgM 抗 HBc 存在于“窗口期”，因此当 HBsAg 已清除而抗 HBs 尚未检测到时，它是诊断的重要工具。因此，IgM 抗 HBc 是诊断急性乙型肝炎最特异的标志物。\n\n(选项 E) 抗 HBe 提示活动性病毒复制停止和低感染性。\n\n(选项 F) 抗 HBsAg IgG 在成功接种 HBV 疫苗或 HBsAg 清除后出现在血清中，并终生保持可检测。它用作无感染性和免疫力的指标。然而，HBsAg 的消失和血清中抗 HBs 的出现之间存在时间滞后，这被称为“窗口期”。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of hepatitis B serologic markers and their association with vertical transmission risk from mother to child. Specifically, it focuses on the significance of HBeAg in indicating high viral replication and infectivity, leading to a higher risk of transmission.\n\nTo solve this question, understand the role of each serologic marker in the hepatitis B life cycle and its implications for infectivity. Recognize that HBeAg is a marker of active viral replication and increased infectivity, making it the most likely marker to increase the risk of vertical transmission.",
