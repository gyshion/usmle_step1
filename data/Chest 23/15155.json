    "en": "A 34-year-old man comes to the office due to episodic dyspnea, wheezing, and chest tightness for the past 4 months. He has no prior medical conditions and takes no medications. The patient smoked marijuana as a teenager but does not currently use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. He started working at an automotive body painting shop 7 months ago and has had no sick contacts. The patient's symptoms abated about a month ago during a 2-week vacation to Arizona but reappeared within a few days of his return. Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 18/min. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable. Lungs are clear to auscultation with normal air movement. Office spirometry, performed when the patient is asymptomatic, shows a normal FEV1/FVC of 81%. Chest radiography reveals no abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?",
    "zh": "一名34岁男性因过去4个月出现阵发性呼吸困难、喘息和胸闷来诊。他既往无任何疾病，未服用任何药物。患者青少年时期吸食过大麻，但目前不使用烟草、酒精或娱乐性药物。他于7个月前开始在一家汽车车身喷漆店工作，并且没有生病接触史。患者的症状大约一个月前在亚利桑那州为期2周的假期中缓解，但在他返回后的几天内再次出现。体温36.7摄氏度（98.1华氏度），血压120/80毫米汞柱，脉搏76次/分钟，呼吸18次/分钟。心血管检查无异常。肺部听诊清澈，有正常气流。在患者无症状时进行的诊室肺活量测定显示FEV1/FVC正常，为81%。胸部X光检查未发现异常。以下哪项最有可能参与该患者病情的发病机制？"

    "en": "This patient has intermittent vague respiratory symptoms, including dyspnea, wheezing, and chest tightness. His symptoms developed a few months after he started a new industrial painting job and regressed after sustained absence from the workplace (eg, vacation). This correlation is suspicious for OCCUPATIONAL ASTHMA (OA), a common form of adult-onset asthma.\n\nLike other forms of asthma, OA involves airway inflammation with leukocyte-induced bronchoconstriction. The underlying trigger may be immunologic or nonimmunologic:\n\n*   Immunologic OA (IgE-dependent, T-helper 2-mediated) involves exposure to WORKPLACE AEROALLERGENS (eg, isocyanates in painters, grain proteins in bakers). It often has a LATENT PERIOD of several months as the patient becomes sensitized to the allergen.\n*   Nonimmunologic OA (IgE-independent, irritant-induced) involves inhalation of noxious compounds (eg, chlorine, ammonia) that induce airway irritation and mast cell degranulation. This typically occurs after large accidental exposures (eg, chemical spill); symptom onset is sudden.\n\nNormal spirometry without obstruction (ie, normal FEV1/FVC ratio >0.7) does not exclude asthma as asthmatic bronchoconstriction may be intermittent. Outside of an attack, patients may be relatively asymptomatic with normal pulmonary function tests.\n\n(Choice B) Coccidioidomycosis is endemic to the southwestern United States. It presents as fungal pneumonia (eg, fever, chest pain) often with extrapulmonary manifestations (eg, arthralgia, erythema nodosum). In addition, chest imaging typically reveals pulmonary infiltrates and hilar adenopathy, and this patient's symptoms emerged before his trip to Arizona.\n\n(Choice C) Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, an inherited disorder, causes premature-onset emphysema out of proportion to smoking history. Patients have dyspnea, cough, and wheezing. However, imaging typically reveals basilar-predominant bullae, spirometry consistently shows an obstructive pattern, and symptoms would not resolve with travel.\n\n(Choice D) *BMPR2* gene mutations cause hereditary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); symptoms include progressive dyspnea and signs of right ventricular pressure overload (eg, peripheral edema, jugulovenous distension). Because PAH affects the pulmonary vascular system instead of the airways or parenchyma, spirometry would be normal; resolution while traveling would be unexpected.\n\n(Choice E) Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a vasculitis of small- or medium-sized arteries characterized by asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis. Chest imaging typically demonstrates patchy infiltrates; symptoms would not resolve while traveling.",
    "zh": "该患者有间歇性、模糊的呼吸道症状，包括呼吸困难、喘息和胸闷。他的症状是在开始一份新的工业喷漆工作后几个月出现的，在持续离开工作场所（例如，休假）后缓解。这种相关性提示职业性哮喘（OA），这是一种常见的成人发病哮喘。\n\n与其他形式的哮喘一样，OA涉及气道炎症，伴有白细胞诱导的支气管收缩。潜在的诱因可能是免疫性的或非免疫性的：\n\n*   免疫性OA（IgE依赖性，T辅助细胞2介导）涉及接触工作场所气溶胶过敏原（例如，油漆工中的异氰酸酯、面包师中的谷物蛋白）。它通常具有几个月的潜伏期，因为患者对过敏原变得敏感。\n*   非免疫性OA（IgE非依赖性，刺激物诱导）涉及吸入有害化合物（例如，氯气、氨气），这些化合物会引起气道刺激和肥大细胞脱颗粒。这通常发生在大型意外暴露后（例如，化学品泄漏）；症状突然发作。\n\n没有阻塞的正常肺活量测定（即，FEV1/FVC比率>0.7）并不能排除哮喘，因为哮喘性支气管收缩可能是间歇性的。在发作之外，患者可能相对无症状，肺功能测试正常。\n\n（选项B）球孢子菌病是美国西南部的地方性疾病。它表现为真菌性肺炎（例如，发烧、胸痛），通常伴有肺外表现（例如，关节痛、结节性红斑）。此外，胸部影像学检查通常显示肺部浸润和肺门淋巴结肿大，并且该患者的症状出现在他去亚利桑那州旅行之前。\n\n（选项C）α-1抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症是一种遗传性疾病，会导致早发性肺气肿，与吸烟史不成比例。患者有呼吸困难、咳嗽和喘息。然而，影像学检查通常显示以基底部为主的大疱，肺活量测定持续显示阻塞性模式，并且症状不会随着旅行而缓解。\n\n（选项D）*BMPR2*基因突变导致遗传性肺动脉高压（PAH）；症状包括进行性呼吸困难和右心室压力超负荷的体征（例如，外周水肿、颈静脉扩张）。由于PAH影响肺血管系统而不是气道或实质，肺活量测定将是正常的；旅行时症状缓解是意料之外的。\n\n（选项E）伴有多血管炎的嗜酸性肉芽肿是一种累及中小动脉的血管炎，其特征是哮喘和慢性鼻窦炎。胸部影像学检查通常显示斑片状浸润；旅行时症状不会缓解。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of occupational asthma, including its immunologic and nonimmunologic mechanisms, latency periods, and diagnostic findings. The key to solving this question is recognizing the temporal relationship between the patient's symptoms, his new job as an automotive body painter, and the improvement during his vacation. \n\nConsider the patient's occupation and the timing of symptom onset and resolution. Rule out other causes of respiratory symptoms based on the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings.",
