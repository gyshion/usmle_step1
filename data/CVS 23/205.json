    "en": "A 10-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his parents due to chronic fatigue, shortness of breath, and failure to gain weight. The child was recently adopted from an orphanage in Asia. He weighs 20 kg (44.2 lb). Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals a loud systolic murmur. Echocardiogram shows pulmonary stenosis and subaortic ventricular septal defect with deviation of the origin of the aorta to the right. The mother describes occasional episodes of severe dyspnea and cyanosis, during which the child quickly assumes a squatting position. ",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This child has Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) with ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, pulmonic stenosis, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The pulmonic stenosis and overriding aorta cause a relatively low ratio of systemic vascular resistance (SVR) to pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). This low SVR:PVR ratio allows the deoxygenated right ventricular output to take the low-resistance route to the systemic circulation, leading to acute hypoxemia (“Tet spell”). Tet spells are most common in infancy but can occur at any age in children with unrepaired ToF. The mechanism of Tet spells has not been clearly defined but may be caused by acute changes of the infundibular septum leading to more right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.\n\nChildren with ToF quickly learn to squat to relieve Tet spells (infants who cannot squat can be placed in the knee-to-chest position by their caregiver). This posture increases SVR without changing PVR, increasing the SVR:PVR ratio. The increased SVR forces a higher proportion of right ventricular output to enter the pulmonary circulation and oxygenate in the pulmonary capillary beds, increasing arterial oxygen concentration and relieving the Tet spell.\n\n(Choices A and D) Squatting restricts chest wall expansion and slightly increases work of breathing. Lung compliance is not changed by this positioning.\n\n(Choices B and C) Squatting does not significantly impact PVR as the compressed vessels are primarily in the abdomen and lower extremities. Pulmonary blood flow increases – not decreases – due to decreased right-to-left shunt with increased SVR. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该儿童患有法洛四联症（ToF），伴有室间隔缺损、主动脉骑跨、肺动脉狭窄和右心室肥大。肺动脉狭窄和主动脉骑跨导致体循环血管阻力（SVR）与肺血管阻力（PVR）的比值相对较低。这种低 SVR:PVR 比值允许脱氧的右心室输出走低阻力途径进入体循环，导致急性低氧血症（“紫绀发作”）。紫绀发作在婴儿期最常见，但可能发生在任何年龄的未修复 ToF 儿童中。紫绀发作的机制尚未明确定义，但可能由漏斗部隔的急性变化引起，导致更多的右心室流出道梗阻。\n\nToF 儿童很快学会蹲下以缓解紫绀发作（无法蹲下的婴儿可以由其照护者放置在膝胸位）。这种姿势会增加 SVR，而不会改变 PVR，从而增加 SVR:PVR 比值。增加的 SVR 迫使更高比例的右心室输出进入肺循环并在肺毛细血管床中氧合，从而增加动脉血氧浓度并缓解紫绀发作。\n\n（选项 A 和 D）蹲姿会限制胸壁扩张并略微增加呼吸功。肺顺应性不会因这种姿势而改变。\n\n（选项 B 和 C）蹲姿不会显着影响 PVR，因为受压血管主要位于腹部和下肢。由于右向左分流减少和 SVR 增加，肺血流量会增加——而不是减少。{{exhibit_1}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of Tetralogy of Fallot and the mechanism by which squatting relieves symptoms of a Tet spell. It requires understanding of systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and their impact on blood flow in this congenital heart defect.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that squatting increases systemic vascular resistance, which in turn reduces right-to-left shunting and improves oxygenation. Understanding the underlying physiology of Tetralogy of Fallot is crucial for answering this question correctly.",
