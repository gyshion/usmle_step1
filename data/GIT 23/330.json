    "en": "Normally, neural crest cells start migrating to the intestinal wall in early embryogenesis and give rise to ganglion cells of the submucosal (Meissner) and myenteric (Auerbach) plexus of the bowel wall. These parasympathetic ganglia are responsible for intestinal peristalsis. Neural crest cells enter the developing foregut mesenchyme and then migrate caudally along the entire length of the bowel; they are present in the wall of proximal colon by the 8th week of gestation and in the rectum by the 12th week.\n\nThe arrest of migration of neural crest cells causes Hirschsprung disease, in which a distal segment of colon lacks ganglion cells. Because neural crest cells migrate caudally, the rectum is always involved. The absence of parasympathetic ganglia in the colonic wall causes the affected segment to be narrowed because it cannot relax. The passage of intestinal contents through this area is difficult, and compensatory dilatation of the proximal colon occurs.\n\nNewborns with Hirschsprung disease often fail to pass meconium within 48 hours of birth. They may also develop signs of intestinal obstruction, such as bilious vomiting and abdominal distension. The bowel is filled with stool, but the rectum is empty; anal sphincter tone is usually increased.\n\n(Choice A) Degeneration of neural crest cells forming the myenteric plexus in the esophagus causes achalasia (ie, esophageal dilatation with absent peristalsis). However, the condition is most often due to autoimmune destruction of mature neurons; failed neural crest migration is a very rare etiology.\n\n(Choices B, C, D, E, and F) Although total colonic aganglionosis can occur, the cecum and transverse colon are not commonly involved in Hirschsprung disease. Total intestinal aganglionosis (eg, duodenum, jejunum, ileum) has also been described but is extremely rare. The rectum is most likely to be affected by a problem with neural crest cell migration, as it is at the very end of the migration path.",
    "zh": "正常情况下，神经嵴细胞在胚胎早期开始向肠壁迁移，并产生肠壁的黏膜下（梅斯纳）和肌间（奥尔巴赫）丛的神经节细胞。这些副交感神经节负责肠蠕动。神经嵴细胞进入发育中的前肠间充质，然后沿肠道的整个长度向尾端迁移；它们在妊娠第8周时出现在近端结肠壁中，在第12周时出现在直肠中。\n\n神经嵴细胞迁移的停止导致先天性巨结肠症，其中结肠的远端部分缺乏神经节细胞。由于神经嵴细胞向尾端迁移，直肠总是受累。结肠壁中缺乏副交感神经节导致受累部分变窄，因为它无法松弛。肠内容物通过该区域的通过变得困难，并且近端结肠发生代偿性扩张。\n\n患有先天性巨结肠症的新生儿通常在出生后48小时内未能排出胎便。他们还可能出现肠梗阻的迹象，如胆汁性呕吐和腹胀。肠道充满粪便，但直肠是空的；肛门括约肌张力通常会增加。\n\n（选项 A）形成食管肌间丛的神经嵴细胞退化会导致贲门失弛缓症（即，食管扩张伴蠕动消失）。然而，这种情况最常由于成熟神经元的自身免疫破坏；神经嵴迁移失败是一种非常罕见的病因。\n\n（选项 B、C、D、E 和 F）尽管可发生全结肠无神经节细胞症，但盲肠和横结肠通常不参与先天性巨结肠症。全肠无神经节细胞症（例如，十二指肠、空肠、回肠）也有描述，但极为罕见。由于直肠位于神经嵴细胞迁移路径的末端，因此最有可能受到神经嵴细胞迁移问题的困扰。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Hirschsprung disease and the embryological development of the gastrointestinal tract, specifically the migration of neural crest cells and their role in forming the enteric nervous system. It assesses the understanding that Hirschsprung disease results from the failure of neural crest cells to migrate caudally, leading to aganglionosis, most commonly affecting the rectum.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the caudal migration pattern of neural crest cells during gut development. Recognize that Hirschsprung disease involves aganglionosis and that the rectum is almost always affected due to its position at the end of the neural crest cell migration pathway.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对先天性巨结肠症和胃肠道胚胎学发育的了解，特别是神经嵴细胞的迁移及其在形成肠神经系统中的作用。它评估了对先天性巨结肠症的理解，即神经嵴细胞未能向尾端迁移导致无神经节细胞症，最常见的是影响直肠。\n\n要解决这个问题，请回忆神经嵴细胞在肠道发育过程中的尾端迁移模式。认识到先天性巨结肠症涉及无神经节细胞症，并且由于直肠位于神经嵴细胞迁移通路的末端，因此几乎总是受到影响。"
