    "en": "A male newborn, born at 39 weeks gestation, is evaluated in the labor and delivery unit 2 hours after birth. Prenatal care was limited due to infrequent follow-up, and there were no complications during the delivery. Apgar scores were 7 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Weight is 2.47 kg (5 lbs, 7 oz) and vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows upslanting palpebral fissures, transverse palmar creasing, and widening of the space between the first and second toes. The parents share that they are glad the delivery went well. Which of the following is the most appropriate statement by the physician at this time?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Communicating the news of a suspected diagnosis of Down syndrome (DS) at the time of delivery requires an empathic approach that is responsive to the parent's emotional needs and avoids negative bias about the diagnosis. Parents should be informed of the diagnosis as soon as possible in a private setting that allows them time to process the news, express their emotions, and ask any questions they may have. Initiating the discussion with statements that frame the diagnosis negatively (eg, \"I'm sorry,\" \"I have bad news\") should be avoided because they convey implicit bias that the intellectual disability associated with DS is devastating, which may not reflect the parents' values or views about their child. A shift from \"breaking bad news\" to \"sharing unexpected news\" can help prepare the parents to receive the information without imposing negative value judgements.\n\nDetailed information about the diagnosis should be tailored to the parents' knowledge base and how much they want to know at this point in time. The physician should provide information about local resources and support groups and make a plan for follow-up discussion.\n\n(Choice A) This statement uses medical jargon to deliver life-changing news without warning. Parents should be prepared that unexpected news is coming, and the physician should use language that is easily understood.\n\n(Choices C and D) These statements are not neutral and frame the diagnosis negatively. Initiating the discussion with \"unexpected\" rather than \"bad\" news is preferable.\n\n(Choice E) Sharing alarming news that the baby's examination is abnormal and inquiring if prenatal testing was done is insensitive and may be perceived as judgmental. When characteristic dysmorphic features of DS are present, it is better to share the findings, explain the diagnosis, and answer any questions the parents may have.\n\nEducational objective:\nCommunicating the news of a suspected diagnosis of Down syndrome at the time of delivery requires an empathic approach. A shift from \"breaking bad news\" to \"sharing unexpected news\" can help prepare the parents to receive the information without imposing negative value judgements.",
    "zh": "在分娩时传达疑似唐氏综合征（DS）的诊断需要一种同情的方法，这种方法能够回应父母的情感需求，并避免对诊断产生负面偏见。应尽快在私密环境中告知父母诊断结果，这让他们有时间处理消息、表达情绪并提出任何他们可能有的问题。应避免以负面方式构建诊断的陈述（例如，“我很抱歉”、“我有一个坏消息”），因为它们传达了与DS相关的智力障碍是毁灭性的隐含偏见，这可能不能反映父母对他们孩子的价值观或看法。从“打破坏消息”转变为“分享意外消息”可以帮助父母准备好接收信息，而不会强加负面的价值判断。\n\n关于诊断的详细信息应根据父母的知识基础以及他们此时想了解的程度进行调整。医生应提供有关当地资源和支持小组的信息，并制定后续讨论计划。\n\n（选项A）此陈述使用医学术语来传递改变人生的消息，而没有发出警告。父母应该为即将到来的意外消息做好准备，医生应该使用易于理解的语言。\n\n（选项C和D）这些陈述不是中立的，并以负面的方式构建诊断。最好以“意外”而不是“坏”消息开始讨论。\n\n（选项E）分享婴儿检查结果异常的警报性消息，并询问是否进行了产前检查，是不敏感的，并且可能被认为是带有评判性的。当存在DS的特征性畸形特征时，最好分享发现结果，解释诊断，并回答父母可能有的任何问题。\n\n教育目标：在分娩时传达疑似唐氏综合征的诊断需要一种同情的方法。从“打破坏消息”转变为“分享意外消息”可以帮助父母准备好接收信息，而不会强加负面的价值判断。"
