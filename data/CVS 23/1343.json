    "en": "Administration of the drug caused an increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and a reflexive (delayed) decrease in heart rate; these are the typical effects of a selective α-adrenergic agonist (eg, phenylephrine, methoxamine). Activation of α-adrenoreceptors (in blood vessels of skin and viscera) leads to VASOCONSTRICTION and increased systemic blood pressure. Stimulation of baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch causes a REFLEXIVE INCREASE IN VAGAL INFLUENCE on the heart. The increased vagal tone results in inhibition of pacemaker activity of the sinoatrial node, slowed conduction through the atrioventricular node, and decreased myocardial contractility.\n\n(Choice B) The vasoconstriction caused by α₁-adrenergic agonists increases blood pressure and cardiac afterload, requiring increased myocardial effort to expel the blood.\n\n(Choices C and D) Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure reflects left atrial pressure. It is increased after administration of α₁-adrenergic agonists due to increases in cardiac afterload (elevates left ventricular end-diastolic pressure) and venous tone (results in augmented venous return).\n\n(Choice E) α-adrenergic agonists cause vasoconstriction of the renal and splanchnic arteries, decreasing perfusion to the kidneys and other viscera.\n\nEducational objective:\nα-adrenergic agonists increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure by stimulating α₁-adrenoreceptors in the vascular walls, causing vasoconstriction. The elevated systemic blood pressure then causes a reflexive increase in vagal tone, resulting in decreased heart rate and slowed atrioventricular node conduction.",
    "zh": "该药物的给药导致收缩压和舒张压升高，以及反射性（延迟）心率降低；这些是选择性α-肾上腺素能激动剂（例如，去氧肾上腺素、甲氧胺）的典型作用。激活α-肾上腺素受体（在皮肤和内脏的血管中）会导致血管收缩和全身血压升高。刺激颈动脉窦和主动脉弓中的压力感受器会导致心脏的反射性迷走神经影响增加。迷走神经张力增加导致窦房结起搏器活动的抑制、房室结传导减慢和心肌收缩力降低。\n\n（选项B）α₁-肾上腺素能激动剂引起的血管收缩会增加血压和心脏后负荷，需要增加心肌的努力才能排出血液。\n\n（选项C和D）肺毛细血管楔压反映左心房压力。由于心脏后负荷增加（升高左心室舒张末期压力）和静脉张力增加（导致静脉回流增加），在给予α₁-肾上腺素能激动剂后，肺毛细血管楔压会升高。\n\n（选项E）α-肾上腺素能激动剂导致肾动脉和内脏动脉收缩，降低肾脏和其他内脏的灌注。\n\n教学目标：\nα-肾上腺素能激动剂通过刺激血管壁中的α₁-肾上腺素受体增加收缩压和舒张压，引起血管收缩。然后升高的全身血压导致反射性迷走神经张力增加，导致心率降低和房室结传导减慢。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the physiological effects of alpha-adrenergic agonists on blood pressure, heart rate, and atrioventricular node conduction. It requires understanding of baroreceptor reflexes and the autonomic nervous system's response to changes in blood pressure.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that alpha-adrenergic agonists cause vasoconstriction, leading to increased blood pressure and a reflexive increase in vagal tone. This increased vagal tone results in decreased heart rate and slowed AV node conduction.",
