    "en": "A 5-month-old boy is brought to the office out of concern that he has developmental delay. The patient has 3 older siblings that were much more active and interactive at the boy's age. The family just moved to the United States from South America and did not previously have consistent primary care. Physical examination shows that the boy is unable to push up on his forearms when prone and does not seem to recognize his parents. Comprehensive laboratory evaluation shows impaired tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis. Which of the following substances is most likely deficient in this patient?",

    "en": "The image above depicts the metabolic pathway for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis and its role as a cofactor. Impaired tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis is a genetic disorder that affects the production of several neurotransmitters. BH4 is an essential cofactor for three key enzymes: phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and tryptophan hydroxylase. \n\n(1) Phenylalanine hydroxylase: This enzyme converts phenylalanine to tyrosine. Deficiency in BH4 impairs this conversion, leading to an accumulation of phenylalanine and a deficiency of tyrosine. While phenylalanine accumulation can cause neurotoxicity (similar to phenylketonuria, PKU), the primary issue in BH4 deficiency is the cofactor deficiency affecting multiple pathways.\n\n(2) Tyrosine hydroxylase: This enzyme converts tyrosine to L-DOPA, which is a precursor for catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine). Impaired BH4 synthesis leads to reduced catecholamine production, causing neurological symptoms such as dystonia and autonomic dysfunction.\n\n(3) Tryptophan hydroxylase: This enzyme converts tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan, a precursor for serotonin. Impaired BH4 synthesis leads to reduced serotonin production, which can affect mood, appetite, and sleep. The patient's developmental delay and failure to recognize parents are consistent with neurotransmitter deficiencies, particularly those affecting serotonin and catecholamines.\n\nTherefore, serotonin is a substance that is most likely deficient in this patient due to impaired tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis. \n\n(Choice A) Acetylcholine is synthesized by choline acetyltransferase and does not require BH4 as a cofactor. \n\n(Choice B) GABA is synthesized by glutamate decarboxylase and does not require BH4 as a cofactor. \n\n(Choice C) Phenylalanine is an amino acid that is a substrate for phenylalanine hydroxylase. While its metabolism is affected by BH4 deficiency (leading to its accumulation), it is not the deficient substance itself. Rather, the downstream products of its metabolism (tyrosine and subsequently catecholamines) and the products of tryptophan metabolism (serotonin) are deficient.\n\nKey clinical pearls: BH4 is a cofactor for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. Deficiency leads to impaired synthesis of catecholamines and serotonin, as well as altered phenylalanine metabolism. This can manifest as developmental delay, movement disorders, and autonomic dysfunction.",
    "zh": "上图描绘了四氢生物蝶呤(BH4)合成的代谢途径及其作为辅酶的作用。四氢生物蝶呤(BH4)合成受损是一种影响几种神经递质产生的遗传性疾病。BH4是三种关键酶的必需辅酶：苯丙氨酸羟化酶、酪氨酸羟化酶和色氨酸羟化酶。\n\n(1) 苯丙氨酸羟化酶：这种酶将苯丙氨酸转化为酪氨酸。BH4缺乏会损害这种转化，导致苯丙氨酸的积累和酪氨酸的缺乏。虽然苯丙氨酸积累会导致神经毒性（类似于苯丙酮尿症，PKU），但BH4缺乏的主要问题是影响多条通路的辅酶缺乏。\n\n(2) 酪氨酸羟化酶：这种酶将酪氨酸转化为L-DOPA，后者是儿茶酚胺（多巴胺、去甲肾上腺素、肾上腺素）的前体。BH4合成受损导致儿茶酚胺产生减少，引起神经系统症状，如肌张力障碍和自主神经功能障碍。\n\n(3) 色氨酸羟化酶：这种酶将色氨酸转化为5-羟色胺色氨酸，后者是血清素的前体。BH4合成受损导致血清素产生减少，这会影响情绪、食欲和睡眠。患者的发育迟缓和无法识别父母与神经递质缺乏一致，特别是那些影响血清素和儿茶酚胺的神经递质。\n\n因此，由于四氢生物蝶呤合成受损，血清素最有可能在此患者中缺乏。\n\n(选项A) 乙酰胆碱由胆碱乙酰转移酶合成，不需要BH4作为辅酶。\n\n(选项B) GABA由谷氨酸脱羧酶合成，不需要BH4作为辅酶。\n\n(选项C) 苯丙氨酸是一种氨基酸，是苯丙氨酸羟化酶的底物。虽然其代谢受到BH4缺乏的影响（导致其积累），但它本身并不是缺乏的物质。相反，其代谢的下游产物（酪氨酸和随后的儿茶酚胺）和色氨酸代谢的产物（血清素）是缺乏的。\n\n关键临床要点：BH4是芳香族氨基酸羟化酶的辅酶。缺乏导致儿茶酚胺和血清素的合成受损，以及苯丙氨酸代谢的改变。这可表现为发育迟缓、运动障碍和自主神经功能障碍。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the metabolic pathway of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and its role as a cofactor in neurotransmitter synthesis. Specifically, it assesses the ability to correlate impaired BH4 synthesis with the deficiency of downstream neurotransmitters like serotonin and catecholamines, and their clinical manifestations.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall the enzymes that utilize BH4 as a cofactor, namely phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and tryptophan hydroxylase. Understanding that BH4 deficiency impairs the function of these enzymes leads to reduced production of tyrosine, catecholamines, and serotonin, and an accumulation of phenylalanine. The clinical presentation of developmental delay and neurological symptoms points towards a deficiency in neurotransmitter synthesis, making serotonin a likely deficient substance.",
