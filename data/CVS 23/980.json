    "en": "Thiazide diuretics (eg, chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide) are some of the most widely used agents for treatment of hypertension. However, thiazides, especially in higher doses, can cause a variety of metabolic complications, including hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia. The incidence of the individual side effects is relatively low, and, patients rarely experience all of the potential adverse effects.\n\nThiazides increase renal Ca2+ reabsorption, leading to HYPERCALCEMIA and HYPOCALCIURIA. This occurs through 2 major mechanisms:\n\n1.  Thiazides inhibit the Na+/Cl- cotransporter on the apical side of distal convoluted tubule cells, which decreases intracellular Na+ concentration. This activates the basolateral Na+/Ca2+ antiporter, which pumps Na+ into the cell in exchange for Ca2+ . The resulting decrease in intracellular Ca2+ enhances luminal Ca2+ reabsorption across the apical membrane.\n2.  Hypovolemia induced by thiazides increases Na+ and H2O reabsorption in the proximal tubule, leading to a passive increase in paracellular Ca2+ reabsorption.\n\nThe increase in circulating calcium suppresses parathyroid hormone (PTH) release, leading to a new steady state with a mildly elevated serum calcium concentration and low serum PTH.\n\n(Choice A) Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a benign disorder caused by mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor in the parathyroid gland and kidneys. Higher calcium levels are required to suppress secretion of PTH, leading to mild hypercalcemia and hypocalciuria. However, unlike in patients taking thiazide diuretics, PTH is high-normal or mildly elevated.\n\n(Choice B) Hyperthyroidism can cause hypercalcemia due to increased osteoclastic bone resorption, but serum calcium in hypothyroidism is usually normal.\n\n(Choices D and E) Primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by parathyroid hyperplasia or adenoma; it is characterized by HYPERCALCEMIA with elevated or inappropriately normal PTH levels. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is usually seen in patients with chronic kidney disease and is due to phosphate retention and decreased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; these disturbances lead to decreased intestinal calcium absorption, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and a compensatory increase in PTH secretion. This patient has a decreased PTH level.\n\nEducational objective:\nThiazide diuretics cause hypercalcemia by increasing the distal tubular reabsorption of Ca2+. The increased circulating calcium levels result in suppression of parathyroid hormone, which distinguishes this effect from hyperparathyroidism.",
    "zh": "噻嗪类利尿剂（例如，氯噻酮、氢氯噻嗪）是治疗高血压最广泛使用的药物之一。然而，噻嗪类药物，尤其是高剂量时，可引起多种代谢并发症，包括高钙血症、高血糖、高脂血症、低钠血症和低钾血症。单个副作用的发生率相对较低，患者很少会经历所有潜在的不良反应。\n\n噻嗪类药物增加肾脏对Ca2+的重吸收，导致高钙血症和低钙尿症。这通过2个主要机制发生：\n\n1. 噻嗪类药物抑制远端小管细胞顶端侧的Na+/Cl-协同转运蛋白，从而降低细胞内Na+浓度。这激活了基底外侧Na+/Ca2+反向转运蛋白，该蛋白将Na+泵入细胞，以交换Ca2+。由此产生的细胞内Ca2+减少增强了顶端膜的管腔内Ca2+重吸收。\n2. 噻嗪类药物引起的血容量不足增加近端小管中的Na+和H2O重吸收，导致旁细胞间隙Ca2+的被动增加。\n\n循环钙的增加会抑制甲状旁腺激素(PTH)的释放，从而导致一个新的稳态，表现为轻度升高的血清钙浓度和低血清PTH。\n\n(选项A) 家族性低钙尿性高钙血症是一种良性疾病，由甲状旁腺和肾脏中钙敏感受体的突变引起。需要更高的钙水平才能抑制PTH的分泌，导致轻度高钙血症和低钙尿症。然而，与服用噻嗪类利尿剂的患者不同，PTH是高正常或轻度升高。\n\n(选项B) 甲状腺功能亢进症可因破骨细胞骨吸收增加而引起高钙血症，但甲状腺功能减退症的血清钙通常是正常的。\n\n(选项D和E) 原发性甲状旁腺功能亢进症是由甲状旁腺增生或腺瘤引起的；其特征是高钙血症，PTH水平升高或不适当正常。继发性甲状旁腺功能亢进症通常见于慢性肾脏病患者，是由于磷酸盐潴留和1,25-二羟基维生素D的产生减少所致；这些紊乱导致肠道钙吸收减少、低钙血症、高磷血症和PTH分泌的代偿性增加。该患者的PTH水平降低。\n\n教育目标：\n噻嗪类利尿剂通过增加远端肾小管对Ca2+的重吸收引起高钙血症。循环钙水平的升高导致甲状旁腺激素的抑制，这将其与甲状旁腺功能亢进症区分开来。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of the side effects of thiazide diuretics, specifically their effect on calcium levels and parathyroid hormone. It requires understanding the mechanism by which thiazides cause hypercalcemia and the resulting suppression of PTH. \n\nThe best approach is to recognize the patient's history of hypertension treated with pharmacologic therapy (likely a thiazide diuretic), the elevated calcium level, and the decreased parathyroid hormone level. This combination points towards a medication-induced effect, specifically from a thiazide diuretic.",
    "zh": "本题考察对噻嗪类利尿剂副作用的了解，特别是其对钙水平和甲状旁腺激素的影响。它需要理解噻嗪类药物引起高钙血症的机制以及由此导致的PTH抑制。\n\n最好的方法是认识到患者的高血压病史，并正在接受药物治疗（很可能是噻嗪类利尿剂），钙水平升高以及甲状旁腺激素水平降低。这种组合指向药物引起的作用，特别是来自噻嗪类利尿剂。"
