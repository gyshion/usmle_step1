    "en": "A 36-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up regarding hepatitis C. The patient was last seen 3 years ago for a 2-week history of fatigue, nausea, and decreased appetite; at that time, he was diagnosed with hepatitis C infection due to injection drug use. The patient was offered treatment but declined. He is currently healthy and feels well. There is no family history of liver disease. The patient currently does not use illicit drugs or alcohol. Vital signs are normal. BMI is 26 kg/m². Examination is normal. Laboratory results are as follows: {{exhibit_1}} Liver ultrasound is negative for cirrhosis or masses. If a liver biopsy is performed, which of the following histologic findings would most likely be present in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient has chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is confirmed with positive tests for anti-HCV antibodies and HCV RNA. Intravenous drug users, those who engage in high-risk sexual behavior, patients receiving hemodialysis, and individuals with inadvertent blood exposure are at increased risk. \n\nAcute HCV, lasting approximately 6 months after initial infection, is characterized by negative anti-HCV antibodies and positive HCV RNA. Histologic findings are similar to those of other acute viral hepatitides and include panlobular lymphocytic inflammation (ie, inflammation involving entire lobule) and hepatocyte injury (eg, ballooning degeneration), which may lead to cell death (eg, necrosis, apoptosis [ie, Councilman body]).\n\nMost cases (~80%) progress to chronic HCV, which is predominantly characterized by portal tract-based lymphocytic infiltration, including lymphoid follicles, and fibrosis. Chronic inflammation causes persistent hepatocyte injury and can involve the hepatocytes adjacent to the portal tracts (ie, interface activity). After several decades, chronic HCV can progress to cirrhosis characterized by abnormal hepatic architecture with extensive fibrosis and the formation of bridging fibrous septa that surround regenerative parenchymal nodules. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}}\n\n(Choice A) Congestive hepatopathy results from right-sided heart failure and increased hydrostatic pressure within hepatic sinusoids, which dilate due to the intraluminal accumulation of clumped red blood cells. This predominantly affects the centrilobular regions of the liver and may cause necrosis.\n\n(Choice B) Hepatocellular carcinoma is characterized by dysplastic hepatocytes arranged in clusters and thickened rows. Although it can develop in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis, it is usually identified by ultrasound, which was negative in this patient.\n\n(Choice C) Hepatic sarcoidosis is characterized by aggregates of epithelioid cells (ie, activated macrophages) forming granulomas; when severe, fibrosis and cirrhosis can occur.\n\n(Choice D) Dubin-Johnson syndrome impairs the ability of hepatocytes to excrete conjugated bilirubin into bile canaliculi. The liver grossly appears black, and microscopy shows large amounts of dark brown to black pigment within hepatocyte lysosomes.\n\nEducational objective: Acute hepatitis C is characterized by panlobular lymphocytic inflammation with hepatocyte injury (eg, ballooning degeneration) and cell death (eg, Councilman bodies). Chronic hepatitis C leads predominantly to portal lymphocytic infiltration, including lymphoid follicle formation, and fibrosis. Histologic findings of cirrhosis include extensive fibrosis and the formation of bridging septa that surround regenerative nodules.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the histologic findings associated with chronic hepatitis C infection. Specifically, it assesses the characteristic portal tract-based lymphocytic infiltration seen in liver biopsies of patients with chronic HCV. \n\nTo solve this question, review the patient's history of hepatitis C and the negative liver ultrasound. Recall that chronic HCV is characterized by portal inflammation and fibrosis, leading to the correct answer of lymphocytic infiltration of portal tracts.",
