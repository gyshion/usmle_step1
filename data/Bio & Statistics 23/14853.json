    "en": "Point prevalence refers to the number of DISEASE CASES that are active at a SPECIFIC POINT in time (eg, July 31) divided by the number of people in the at-risk population. In this example, a study determined the number of cases of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) among patients in the intensive care unit during the month of July. There were 9 cases of CAUTI in July; a tenth case developed after July 31. Four of the 9 patients recovered before July 31; therefore, the number of cases of CAUTI still active on July 31 was 5.",
    "zh": "现患率是指在特定时间点（例如，7月31日）活跃的疾病病例数除以处于风险中的人群总数。在本例中，一项研究确定了7月份重症监护病房中导管相关性尿路感染（CAUTI）患者的病例数。7月份共有9例CAUTI病例；第10例发生在7月31日之后。9名患者中有4名在7月31日之前康复；因此，7月31日仍然活跃的CAUTI病例数为5。"
