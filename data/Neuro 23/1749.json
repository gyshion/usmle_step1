    "en": "A 45-year-old woman is evaluated for numbness and painful tingling of the right hand. The symptoms began 2 months ago and are especially prominent after she plays tennis. On examination, there is diminished sensation in the lateral palm, thenar eminence, and palmar aspect of the first 3½ digits of the right hand. Electrodiagnostic studies are consistent with median neuropathy in the forearm. This patient is most likely to have nerve compression between which of the following structures?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has diminished sensation that involves the entire sensory distribution of the median nerve and is exacerbated by repetitive, forceful pronation (eg, playing tennis). This is most consistent with compression of the median nerve as it passes between the two heads of the pronator teres in the proximal forearm (ie, pronator teres syndrome) {{exhibit_1}}.\n\nThe median nerve arises from the medial and lateral cords of the brachial plexus and travels with the brachial artery in the medial bicipital groove (ie, longitudinal hollow between biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles) of the upper arm. In the forearm, the median nerve courses between the humeral and ulnar heads of the pronator teres muscle and between the flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus muscles before entering the hand through the carpal tunnel.\n\nCompression of the median nerve by the pronator teres occurs proximal to the takeoff of the palmar cutaneous branch; sensation is impaired in the lateral palm and thenar eminence (ie, sensory distribution of the palmar branch) plus the first 3½ digits. In contrast, compression at the carpal tunnel (bounded by the flexor retinaculum and carpal bones) is distal to the takeoff of the palmar branch; sensation is typically impaired only in the palmar aspects of the first 3½ digits.\n\n(Choices A and B) Compression of the ulnar nerve can occur at the elbow as it courses between the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the olecranon (ie, the cubital tunnel) or distally at the wrist as it enters between the hook of the hamate and the pisiform bone (ie, Guyon canal). Compression at Guyon canal can cause numbness in the medial 1½ digits; compression at the elbow causes additional numbness in the hypothenar eminence (palmar cutaneous branch) and medial dorsum of the hand (dorsal cutaneous branch).\n\n(Choice C) The deep branch of the radial nerve (ie, posterior interosseous nerve) courses between the supinator muscle and radial head in the upper forearm. Injury (eg, humeral fracture, compression) can cause sensory loss in the posterior forearm, dorsolateral hand, and dorsal thumb.\n\nEducational objective:\nIn the forearm, the median nerve courses between the humeral and ulnar heads of the pronator teres muscle. Compression proximal to the takeoff of the palmar cutaneous branch (eg, between the heads of the pronator teres) results in sensory loss over the lateral palm and thenar eminence plus the palmar aspects of the first 3½ digits. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}",
    "zh": "该患者感觉减退涉及正中神经的整个感觉分布区域，并且因重复、用力旋前（例如，打网球）而加重。这与正中神经在前臂近端通过旋前圆肌的两个头之间（即，旋前圆肌综合征）受压最相符{{exhibit_1}}。\n\n正中神经起自臂丛神经的内侧束和外侧束，并与肱动脉一起走行于上臂的内侧二头肌沟（即，肱二头肌和肱三头肌之间的纵向凹陷）。在前臂，正中神经走行于旋前圆肌的肱骨头和尺骨头之间，以及指浅屈肌和指深屈肌之间，然后通过腕管进入手部。\n\n正中神经被旋前圆肌压迫发生在掌皮支发出处近端；感觉受损发生在手掌外侧和拇指隆起（即，掌支的感觉分布）以及前3个半手指。相反，在腕管（由屈肌支持带和腕骨限定）处的压迫发生在掌支发出处的远端；感觉通常仅在前3个半手指的掌侧受损。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）尺神经的压迫可发生在肘部，它走行于肱骨内上髁和鹰嘴之间（即，肘管），或在腕部，它进入钩骨和豌豆骨之间（即，Guyon 管）。Guyon 管的压迫可导致内侧1个半手指麻木；肘部的压迫会导致鱼际隆起（掌皮支）和手背内侧（背皮支）出现额外的麻木。\n\n（选项 C）桡神经深支（即，骨间后神经）走行于前臂上部的旋后肌和桡骨头之间。损伤（例如，肱骨骨折，压迫）可导致前臂后部、手背外侧和拇指背侧感觉丧失。\n\n教育目标：\n在前臂，正中神经走行于旋前圆肌的肱骨头和尺骨头之间。在掌皮支发出处近端的压迫（例如，在旋前圆肌的头之间）导致手掌外侧和拇指隆起以及前3个半手指的掌侧感觉丧失。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pronator teres syndrome, a median nerve compression neuropathy in the forearm. It assesses the anatomical location of the median nerve in relation to the pronator teres muscle and the resulting sensory deficits when compressed.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the sensory distribution of the median nerve and understanding that compression proximal to the palmar cutaneous branch affects the lateral palm and thenar eminence, as well as the first 3½ digits. Consider anatomical relationships and common compression sites.",
