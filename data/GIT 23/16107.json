    "en": "A 54-year-old man comes to the office due to increasing pain in the right upper quadrant, nausea, and unintentional weight loss. Vitals signs are within normal limits. BMI is 21 kg/m². The patient appears cachectic and there is scleral icterus. The liver is palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin. No ascites is present. Laboratory studies reveal elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Contrast CT scan of the abdomen demonstrates moderately dilated right and left intrahepatic bile ducts, with a vague area of delayed enhancement at their convergence. Biopsy of the lesion reveals columnar cells with hyperchromatic oval nuclei with prominent nucleoli arranged in glandular structures; mucin production with surrounding desmoplastic reaction is present. {{exhibit_1}} Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "en": "This patient with weight loss, pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), and jaundice has radiographic and histologic findings consistent with cholangiocarcinoma, a malignancy of the bile duct epithelium. It is associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis; however, it may occur sporadically.\n\nCholangiocarcinoma is often clinically silent until late in the disease course, when the tumor obstructs bile drainage, leading to a characteristic cholestatic pattern of liver injury (elevated alkaline phosphatase, hyperbilirubinemia). Progressive weight loss, RUQ pain, jaundice, and hepatomegaly are typical, and occasionally, the gallbladder is palpable (Courvoisier sign).\n\nIntraductal malignancies are often difficult to visualize radiographically but usually demonstrates dilated bile ducts in the absence of an obstructing gallstone. The most frequently involved site is at the confluence of the right and left hepatic bile ducts (Klatskin tumors), which may be visible as nonunion of the bile ducts (as in this patient). Most cholangiocarcinomas are adenocarcinomas characterized histologically by columnar epithelial cells with prominent nucleoli arranged in glandular structures with mucin production and significant desmoplasia (reactive fibrous tissue surrounding a malignant mass). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}\n\n(Choice B) Focal nodular hyperplasia is a benign, nonencapsulated liver tumor that typically occurs in women. It is characterized by fibrous septa encasing normal hepatocytes and a central stellate scar, which is visible both histologically and radiographically.\n\n(Choice C) Hepatic adenomas are benign lesions that develop most commonly in women taking oral contraceptives. Jaundice and weight loss are unexpected, and an abdominal CT scan usually demonstrates a solitary lesion in the hepatic parenchyma, not the biliary tree. Histology reveals relatively uniform hepatocytes arranged in thin cell plates without atypia.\n\n(Choice D) Hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant liver mass that most often develops in patients with cirrhosis. Microscopy demonstrates polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli.\n\n(Choice E) Metastatic colon cancer is characterized by adenocarcinoma with gland formation; however, it usually causes multiple hepatic masses, which are not seen on this patient’s CT scan. In addition, the location of the mass at the bifurcation of the common hepatic duct is characteristic of cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nEducational objective:\nCholangiocarcinoma is a malignancy of the bile duct epithelium that eventually obstructs biliary drainage, resulting in cholestasis (elevated alkaline phosphatase, hyperbilirubinemia) with jaundice, weight loss, pain in the right upper quadrant, and hepatomegaly. Imaging often demonstrates dilated bile ducts in the absence of an obstructive gallstone, and biopsy reveals an adenocarcinoma with columnar cells, mucin production, and a significant desmoplastic reaction.",
    "zh": "该患者出现体重减轻、右上腹（RUQ）疼痛和黄疸，其影像学和组织学发现与胆管癌（一种胆管上皮恶性肿瘤）一致。它与原发性硬化性胆管炎有关；然而，它也可能散发出现。\n\n胆管癌在病程晚期之前通常无临床症状，此时肿瘤阻塞胆汁引流，导致特征性的胆汁淤积性肝损伤模式（碱性磷酸酶升高，高胆红素血症）。进行性体重减轻、右上腹疼痛、黄疸和肝肿大是典型表现，偶尔可触及胆囊（Courvoisier征）。\n\n管内恶性肿瘤通常难以通过影像学观察到，但通常显示胆管扩张，而无梗阻性胆结石。最常受累的部位是肝内左右肝管的汇合处（Klatskin肿瘤），这可能表现为胆管不融合（如本例患者）。大多数胆管癌是腺癌，其组织学特征为柱状上皮细胞，具有突出的核仁，呈腺样结构排列，伴有黏蛋白产生和明显的促纤维增生（围绕恶性肿块的反应性纤维组织）。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}\n\n（选项B）局灶性结节增生是一种良性、无包膜的肝肿瘤，通常发生于女性。其特征是纤维间隔包绕正常肝细胞和中央星形瘢痕，这在组织学和影像学上均可见。\n\n（选项C）肝腺瘤是良性病变，最常见于服用口服避孕药的女性。黄疸和体重减轻是意料之外的，腹部CT扫描通常显示肝实质内的单个病灶，而不是胆道。组织学显示相对均匀的肝细胞，排列成薄的细胞板，无异型性。\n\n（选项D）肝细胞癌是一种恶性肝肿块，最常发生于肝硬化患者。显微镜下可见多边形细胞，具有丰富的嗜酸性细胞质和突出的核仁。\n\n（选项E）转移性结肠癌的特征是腺癌伴腺体形成；然而，它通常引起多个肝脏肿块，而这在本患者的CT扫描中未见。此外，肿块位于肝总管分叉处是胆管癌的特征。\n\n教育目标：\n胆管癌是一种胆管上皮的恶性肿瘤，最终会阻塞胆汁引流，导致胆汁淤积（碱性磷酸酶升高、高胆红素血症），伴有黄疸、体重减轻、右上腹疼痛和肝肿大。影像学检查通常显示胆管扩张，而无梗阻性胆结石，活检显示腺癌，具有柱状细胞、黏蛋白产生和明显的促纤维增生反应。"
