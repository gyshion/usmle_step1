    "en": "A 54-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to acute-onset mental status changes and double vision. Examination shows that the patient is awake but disoriented to time and place and has a decreased attention span. Further questioning reveals memory impairment that appears to have been most severe during the last few months. Examination of the eyes shows horizontal nystagmus evoked on lateral gaze with bilateral weakness of the lateral rectus muscles. Strength is equal bilaterally, but the patient is unable to walk without support. She receives appropriate treatment based on the most likely diagnosis, and most of the clinical findings resolve. However, she continues to have residual memory deficits. This patient was most likely treated for which of the following conditions?",

    "en": "This patient has characteristic manifestations of WERNICKE ENCEPHALOPATHY, a condition caused by chronic THIAMINE (VITAMIN B1) DEFICIENCY. The clinical features and course of Wernicke encephalopathy are as follows:\n\n*   OCULOMOTOR DYSFUNCTION (eg, nystagmus, lateral rectus palsy) occurs due to impairment of the oculomotor nuclei. It is rapidly reversible with thiamine administration.\n*   ATAXIA is caused by damage to the cerebellar cortex and vestibular nuclei. Unlike oculomotor function, ataxia takes longer to resolve, and some patients may have permanent symptoms.\n*   ENCEPHALOPATHY, ranging from decreased attention span to disorientation and stupor, can occur, and impaired memory/learning may be apparent. Acute mental status changes respond well to treatment, but MEMORY AND LEARNING ABNORMALITIES usually persist, as a condition known as KORSAKOFF SYNDROME.\n\nKorsakoff syndrome is associated with damage to the anterior and dorsomedial thalamic nuclei. This results in chronic, IRREVERSIBLE memory loss, both short-term retrograde (recent events) and anterograde (unable to form new memories) amnesia. Patients with Korsakoff syndrome also often have a psychologic phenomenon called \"confabulation\"; when such patients are unsure of a fact, they subconsciously fill in the memory gap with a fabricated story that they believe to be true.\n\nThiamine should be administered immediately for suspected Wernicke encephalopathy because it decreases the risk for irreversible neurologic damage.\n\n(Choice A) Abrupt discontinuation of antidepressants may cause transient, nonspecific neurologic symptoms, including dizziness, fatigue, and headache; a gradual taper often leads to symptom resolution. However, oculomotor dysfunction and memory deficits would not be seen.\n\n(Choice B) Localized muscle weakness is a common adverse effect of botulinum toxin injection and usually resolves with time. Although extraocular muscle involvement causing diplopia may occur, this patient's acute mental status changes and ataxia are inconsistent with this diagnosis.\n\n(Choice C) Fluctuating extraocular muscle weakness in myasthenia gravis and may rapidly improve with pyridostigmine. However, ataxia and mental status changes would not occur.\n\n(Choice D) Pituitary apoplexy (acute hemorrhage into the pituitary gland) may compress the optic chiasm, leading to acute vision loss or diplopia that resolves with surgical decompression. However, ataxia, disorientation, and memory deficits would not be seen.\n\nEducational objective:\nOculomotor dysfunction, ataxia, and confusion form the TRIAD of Wernicke encephalopathy. Most of these symptoms usually resolve after thiamine administration. Korsakoff syndrome is a chronic and irreversible complication of Wernicke encephalopathy, the hallmarks of which are permanent memory loss and confabulation.",

    "en": "This question tests the recognition of Wernicke encephalopathy based on its classic triad of oculomotor dysfunction, ataxia, and encephalopathy, and the understanding that it is caused by thiamine deficiency. It also assesses the ability to differentiate this condition from other neurological disorders that might present with similar symptoms.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the key clinical features presented in the vignette, such as horizontal nystagmus, lateral rectus muscle weakness, ataxia, and altered mental status with memory impairment. These findings should prompt consideration of Wernicke encephalopathy. The subsequent resolution of most symptoms with appropriate treatment, while residual memory deficits persist (suggesting Korsakoff syndrome), further supports this diagnosis. Finally, ruling out other differential diagnoses based on the specific presentation is crucial.",
