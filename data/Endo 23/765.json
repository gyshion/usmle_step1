    "en": "A 45-year-old previously healthy man comes to the office due to worsening muscle pain and weakness over the past 6 months. Carrying heavy items such as groceries has become increasingly difficult, and any prolonged activity causes diffuse muscle cramps. He has also had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight gain over this time. The patient takes no medications and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg and pulse is 56/min. BMI is 26 kg/m². Physical examination shows muscle weakness, predominantly of the shoulder and hip girdles. When the knee reflex is elicited, the quadriceps muscle contracts briskly but relaxation takes longer than normal. There are splitting and peeling of the nails. Serum creatine kinase is elevated. Which of the following tests is most likely to identify the cause of this patient's muscle weakness?",
    "zh": "一位 45 岁此前健康的男性因过去 6 个月肌肉疼痛和无力加重而前来就诊。携带重物（如杂货）变得越来越困难，任何长时间的活动都会引起弥漫性肌肉痉挛。在此期间，他的体重也增加了 4.5 公斤（10 磅）。患者未服用任何药物，且不使用烟草、酒精或违禁药物。血压为 140/90 mm Hg，脉搏为 56 次/分钟。BMI 为 26 kg/m²。体格检查显示肌无力，主要累及肩部和髋部带。当诱发膝反射时，股四头肌迅速收缩，但放松时间比正常长。指甲出现开裂和剥落。血清肌酸激酶升高。以下哪项检查最有可能确定该患者肌无力的原因？"

    "en": "An elevated creatine kinase (CK) level suggests a myopathic process with myocyte damage and release of muscle enzymes into the circulation. Common causes of myopathy with elevated CK include hypothyroidism, muscular dystrophies, inflammatory muscle diseases, and medications such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.\n\nThis patient's fatigue, weight gain, bradycardia, and brittle nails are highly suggestive of HYPOTHYROID myopathy. Decreased thyroid hormone levels impair muscle glycogen and triglyceride use and increase oxidative stress, resulting in myocyte injury. Patients typically presents with myalgias, proximal muscle weakness, decreased exercise tolerance, and cramping. Myoedema (focal muscle contraction at the site of percussion) and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes are characteristic findings that are caused by impaired reuptake of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\n\nHYPOTHYROID myopathy and elevations in CK can be the first signs of hypothyroidism and can precede other manifestations by months to years. The diagnosis can be confirmed with an elevated TSH level.\n\n(Choice A) A 24-hour urine cortisol test is used as an initial test for Cushing syndrome. This disorder can present with proximal muscle weakness and atrophy due to the direct catabolic effects of cortisol on skeletal muscle. However, there is no associated muscle pain or rise in CK, reflexes are normal, and other cushingoid features (eg, stria, dorsocervical fatty hypertrophy) are usually present.\n\n(Choices B and C) Myasthenia gravis is caused by autoantibodies against nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. It presents with fluctuating weakness that worsens through the day. Lambert-Eaton syndrome is a paraneoplastic disorder associated with small cell carcinoma of the lung (which can be identified on CT scan). It is caused by autoantibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels on the presynaptic membrane, which cause decreased release of acetylcholine. These disorders affect the neuromuscular junction rather than the muscle itself, and CK is normal.\n\n(Choice D) Muscle biopsy is often needed for diagnosis of inflammatory myositis (eg, polymyositis, dermatomyositis). However, this patient has symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism (eg, weight gain, bradycardia, brittle nails), and histologic findings in HYPOTHYROID myopathy are often nonspecific.\n\nEducational objective:\nHYPOTHYROID myopathy presents with myalgias, proximal muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase levels, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. The diagnosis can be confirmed with an elevated TSH level. Other common causes of myopathy with elevated creatine kinase levels include inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophies, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.",
    "zh": "肌酸激酶 (CK) 水平升高提示肌病过程，伴有肌细胞损伤和肌肉酶释放到血液循环中。 CK 升高的肌病的常见原因包括甲状腺功能减退症、肌营养不良症、炎性肌病和药物（如 HMG-CoA 还原酶抑制剂）。\n\n该患者的疲劳、体重增加、心动过缓和指甲脆是高度提示甲状腺功能减退性肌病的表现。甲状腺激素水平降低会损害肌肉糖原和甘油三酯的利用，并增加氧化应激，导致肌细胞损伤。患者通常表现为肌痛、近端肌无力、运动耐受力下降和痉挛。肌水肿（叩诊部位的局灶性肌肉收缩）和深腱反射延迟放松是特征性发现，这些是由肌浆网对钙的再摄取受损引起的。\n\n甲状腺功能减退性肌病和 CK 升高可能是甲状腺功能减退症的最初征兆，并且可能在其他表现出现前数月至数年。通过 TSH 水平升高可以确诊。\n\n（选项 A）24 小时尿皮质醇检测用于库欣综合征的初步检查。该疾病可表现为近端肌无力和萎缩，这归因于皮质醇对骨骼肌的直接分解代谢作用。但是，没有相关的肌肉疼痛或 CK 升高，反射是正常的，并且通常存在其他库欣样特征（例如，条纹、背颈脂肪肥大）。\n\n（选项 B 和 C）重症肌无力是由针对神经肌肉接头突触后膜上烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体的自身抗体引起的。它表现为波动的无力，并在一天中恶化。 Lambert-Eaton 综合征是一种副肿瘤性疾病，与肺小细胞癌相关（可通过 CT 扫描识别）。它是由针对突触前膜上电压门控钙通道的自身抗体引起的，导致乙酰胆碱的释放减少。这些疾病影响神经肌肉接头而不是肌肉本身，并且 CK 正常。\n\n（选项 D）肌肉活检通常需要用于诊断炎性肌炎（例如，多发性肌炎、皮肌炎）。但是，该患者的症状提示甲状腺功能减退症（例如，体重增加、心动过缓、指甲脆），并且甲状腺功能减退性肌病的组织学发现通常是非特异性的。\n\n教学目标：\n甲状腺功能减退性肌病表现为肌痛、近端肌无力、肌酸激酶水平升高和深腱反射延迟放松。可以通过 TSH 水平升高来确诊。 CK 水平升高的其他常见肌病原因包括炎性肌病、肌营养不良症和 HMG-CoA 还原酶抑制剂。"
