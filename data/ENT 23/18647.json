    "en": "A 62-year-old man comes to the office due to worsening difficulty with swallowing food over the last 3 months. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 45 years. On examination, there is a firm, palpable mass at the base of tongue. Cervical lymph nodes are also palpable. Which of the following histologic features is most likely to be seen on biopsy of the tongue lesion?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with dysphagia, a base of tongue mass, and cervical lymphadenopathy likely has mucosal HEAD AND NECK SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA (HNSCC). HNSCC arises from the mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract after accrual of multiple somatic mutations, often caused by the mutagens found in tobacco. Other risk factors for HNSCC include age >40, alcohol use, and immunocompromised status. There has also been a dramatic increase in HNSCC due to human papillomavirus (HPV), which may be seen in younger, nonsmoking patients. Characteristic pathologic findings of HNSCC include nests and sheets of polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm that invade the submucosa and surrounding structures; intercellular bridges and keratin pearls (ie, foci of keratinization) may be seen on light microscopy {{exhibit_1}}. \n\n(Choice A) Squamous papillomas are benign tumors that have fibrovascular cores surrounded by squamous epithelium. They can occur in the mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract but would not spread to regional lymph nodes as they are not malignant.\n\n(Choice B) Adenocarcinomas arise due to mutation of glandular cells and often retain glandular features and some glandular functions, including the production of mucin. The mucosa of the head and neck is made of stratified squamous cells; therefore, cancers arising from this region often retain some features of squamous cells (eg, production of keratin).\n\n(Choice C) Oral candidiasis (ie, thrush) often has an inflammatory infiltrate with pseudohyphae and can present with oral lesions. However, oral candidiasis characteristically appears as white plaques on an erythematous base throughout the mucosa. It does not form a palpable mass or cause firm cervical adenopathy.\n\n(Choice E) Although non-Hodgkin lymphoma, such as follicular lymphoma (characterized by nodular proliferation of lymphocytic follicles), can rarely present in a tonsil, it is unlikely to occur in the base of tongue and is overall much less common than HNSCC, especially in a patient age >60 with a long history of tobacco use.",
    "zh": "这位出现吞咽困难、舌根部肿块和颈部淋巴结肿大的患者可能患有黏膜型头颈部鳞状细胞癌（HNSCC）。HNSCC源于上呼吸消化道的黏膜，是由于积累了多重体细胞突变，通常由烟草中的诱变剂引起。HNSCC的其他危险因素包括年龄>40岁、饮酒和免疫功能低下。由于人乳头瘤病毒（HPV），HNSCC也有显著增加，这可能见于较年轻、不吸烟的患者。HNSCC的特征性病理学发现包括具有丰富嗜酸性细胞质的多边形细胞巢和片，侵袭黏膜下组织和周围结构；在光学显微镜下可见细胞间桥和角化珠（即角化灶）{{exhibit_1}}。\n\n(选项 A) 鳞状乳头状瘤是良性肿瘤，具有被鳞状上皮包绕的纤维血管核心。它们可能发生在上呼吸消化道的黏膜中，但不会扩散到区域淋巴结，因为它们不是恶性的。\n\n(选项 B) 腺癌是由于腺细胞的突变而引起的，通常保留腺体特征和一些腺体功能，包括粘蛋白的产生。头颈部的黏膜由复层鳞状细胞构成；因此，源于该区域的癌症通常保留一些鳞状细胞的特征（例如，角蛋白的产生）。\n\n(选项 C) 口腔念珠菌病（即鹅口疮）通常具有伴有假菌丝的炎性浸润，并可能出现口腔病变。然而，口腔念珠菌病通常表现为在整个黏膜的红斑基础上出现白色斑块。它不会形成可触及的肿块或引起坚硬的颈部淋巴结病。\n\n(选项 E) 虽然非霍奇金淋巴瘤，如滤泡性淋巴瘤（以淋巴细胞滤泡的结节性增生为特征），极少出现在扁桃体中，但它不太可能发生在舌根部，并且总体上比HNSCC少见得多，尤其是在年龄>60岁且有长期吸烟史的患者中。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the clinical presentation, risk factors, and histologic features of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). It requires recognizing the association between tobacco use, dysphagia, a tongue mass, cervical lymphadenopathy, and the characteristic keratinizing squamous cell histology.\n\nThe best approach is to consider the patient's risk factors (smoking), presenting symptoms (dysphagia, mass), and physical exam findings (cervical lymphadenopathy). Then, recall the typical histologic features of HNSCC, such as irregular nests of cells with keratinization, intercellular bridges, and keratin pearls.",
