    "en": "This patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) with excessive bruising, a normal platelet count, and normal coagulation studies. These findings are suggestive of platelet dysfunction, a common cause of easy bruising and mucosal bleeding in patients with CKD.\n\nNormally, primary hemostasis consists of the formation of a platelet plug. This process begins with binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to the denuded endothelium after injury; vWF creates a bridge between subendothelial collagen and platelets (adhesion). Platelets are then activated and release substances (eg, ADP, thromboxane A2) to promote aggregation (ie, platelet-to-platelet clumping via binding of fibrinogen to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor).\n\nIn CKD, platelet function is thought to be disrupted due to inappropriate upregulation of nitric oxide. Patients with CKD have elevated urea, the end product of ammonia breakdown, which is derived from arginine. As urea levels rise, arginine and its precursors are shunted to a different pathway, instead producing guanidinosuccinic acid (GSA), a precursor to nitric oxide. Inappropriately high nitric oxide levels in CKD inhibit primary hemostasis via the following mechanisms:\n\n*   Decreased platelet adhesion: Nitric oxide downregulates vWF secretion by endothelial cells.\n*   Decreased activation and aggregation: Nitric oxide leads to reduced levels of ADP and thromboxane A2. In addition, it inhibits activation of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor.\n\nAnemia in CKD (due to reduced erythropoietin production) can also contribute to platelet dysfunction by reducing platelet marginalization along the endothelial surface.\n\n(Choice A) Bruising due to atrophy of dermal collagen describes senile purpura (ie, benign purple patches on the hands/forearms in patients age ≥65); this patient's age is inconsistent with this diagnosis.\n\n(Choice B) Bleeding complications are typical of acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a consumptive coagulopathy. However, most patients have an acute risk factor (eg, sepsis, trauma), and PT and PTT would be prolonged. Coagulation studies in chronic DIC may be normal, but these patients typically have thrombosis and a history of malignancy.\n\n(Choice D) Easy bruising is a common finding in factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A), but PTT would be prolonged. In addition, symptoms usually develop by age 2.\n\n(Choice E) Vitamin K deficiency can cause easy bruising, but PT would be prolonged.\n\nEducational objective:\nChronic kidney disease increases the risk for platelet dysfunction, which is thought to be due to inappropriately upregulated nitric oxide, causing decreased platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation. Coagulation studies and platelet count are typically normal. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有慢性肾病（CKD），伴有过度瘀伤、血小板计数正常和凝血检查正常。这些发现提示血小板功能障碍，这是CKD患者容易瘀伤和黏膜出血的常见原因。\n\n正常情况下，原发性止血包括血小板栓子的形成。该过程始于血管损伤后von Willebrand因子（vWF）与裸露的内皮细胞结合；vWF在内皮下胶原蛋白和血小板之间架起桥梁（粘附）。然后血小板被激活并释放物质（例如，ADP、血栓烷A2）以促进聚集（即，通过纤溶酶原与糖蛋白IIb/IIIa受体结合的血小板间聚集）。\n\n在CKD中，血小板功能被认为由于一氧化氮的不适当上调而受到破坏。CKD患者尿素升高，尿素是氨分解的最终产物，来源于精氨酸。随着尿素水平的升高，精氨酸及其前体被分流到不同的途径，从而产生胍琥珀酸（GSA），一氧化氮的前体。CKD中一氧化氮水平的不适当升高通过以下机制抑制原发性止血：\n\n*   血小板粘附降低：一氧化氮下调内皮细胞分泌vWF。\n*   激活和聚集降低：一氧化氮导致ADP和血栓烷A2水平降低。此外，它抑制糖蛋白IIb/IIIa受体的激活。\n\nCKD中的贫血（由于促红细胞生成素生成减少）也可以通过减少血小板沿内皮表面的边缘化来促进血小板功能障碍。\n\n（选项A）因真皮胶原蛋白萎缩引起的瘀伤描述了老年性紫癜（即，年龄≥65岁患者手/前臂上的良性紫色斑块）；该患者的年龄与此诊断不符。\n\n（选项B）出血并发症是急性弥漫性血管内凝血（DIC）的典型表现，这是一种消耗性凝血病。然而，大多数患者都有急性危险因素（例如，败血症、创伤），并且PT和PTT会延长。慢性DIC的凝血检查可能正常，但这些患者通常有血栓形成和恶性肿瘤病史。\n\n（选项D）易于瘀伤是凝血因子VIII缺乏症（血友病A）的常见发现，但PTT会延长。此外，症状通常在2岁前出现。\n\n（选项E）维生素K缺乏可导致易于瘀伤，但PT会延长。\n\n教育目标：\n慢性肾病增加了血小板功能障碍的风险，这被认为是一氧化氮不适当上调所致，导致血小板粘附、激活和聚集减少。凝血检查和血小板计数通常正常。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of platelet dysfunction in the setting of chronic kidney disease. Specifically, it assesses the understanding of how elevated nitric oxide levels in CKD disrupt platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation, leading to easy bruising despite normal platelet count and coagulation studies.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's history of CKD and normal coagulation studies. Consider the common causes of bruising and bleeding in CKD, focusing on platelet dysfunction due to nitric oxide upregulation.
