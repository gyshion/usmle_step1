    "en": "A 12-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother due to left hand clumsiness. Several hours ago, he was climbing a tree but lost his balance and fell, grabbing a branch with his left hand on the way down. He landed safely on his feet with no head injury or loss of consciousness. On physical examination, the patient has difficulty performing fine finger movements with his left hand. Which of the following structures is most likely injured in this patient?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Sudden upward jerking of the arm at the shoulder can cause injury to the inferior trunk of the brachial plexus. The inferior trunk carries nerve fibers from the C8 and T1 spinal levels that ultimately contribute to the median and ulnar nerves. Together, these nerves innervate all of the intrinsic muscles of the hand (eg, lumbricals, interossei, thenar, hypothenar). Injury to the inferior trunk of the brachial plexus may cause paralysis of all the intrinsic hand muscles (KLUMPKE PALSY), resulting in HAND CLUMSINESS. Weakness of lumbricals impairs flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints and extension of the interphalangeal joints. Relative sparing of the extrinsic flexors and extensors of the hand contributes to the total claw hand deformity seen in this condition. Sensory loss can also occur over the medial aspect of the hand and/or forearm. Involvement of the T1 nerve root proximal to the sympathetic trunk may cause CONCOMITANT HORNER SYNDROME (eg, ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis).\n(Choice A) Shoulder dislocations or fractures of the surgical neck of the humerus can cause axillary nerve injury, which results in weakness of the deltoid and teres minor muscles.\n(Choice C) Long thoracic nerve injury classically occurs during axillary lymph node dissection and results in paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle, leading to winging of the scapula.\n(Choice D) Injury to the musculocutaneous nerve causes weakened elbow flexion because the nerve innervates the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles.\n(Choice E) Fractures at the midshaft of the humerus commonly cause radial nerve injury. Patients may experience posterior forearm and dorsolateral hand numbness with paralysis of the wrist and finger extensors (wrist drop).\n(Choice F) The suprascapular nerve innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. Nerve injury may result in difficulties with abduction and lateral rotation of the arm, respectively.\nEducational objective:\nThe inferior trunk of the brachial plexus carries nerve fibers from the C8 and T1 spinal levels that are responsible for innervating all the intrinsic muscles of the hand (via the median and ulnar nerves). Sudden upward stretching on the arm at the shoulder can damage the inferior trunk, resulting in hand clumsiness and total claw hand deformity.",
    "zh": "肩部手臂突然向上抽动可导致臂丛神经下干损伤。下干携带来自C8和T1脊髓节段的神经纤维，这些神经纤维最终形成正中神经和尺神经。这些神经共同支配手的所有内在肌肉（例如，蚓状肌、骨间肌、拇指、小指）。臂丛神经下干损伤可导致所有手部内在肌肉瘫痪（KLUMPKE麻痹），导致手部笨拙。蚓状肌无力会削弱掌指关节的屈曲和指间关节的伸展。手部外在屈肌和伸肌的相对保留有助于在这种情况下出现完全的爪形手畸形。感觉丧失也可能发生在手部和/或前臂的内侧。T1神经根在交感干近端受累可能导致并发的HORNER综合征（例如，同侧眼睑下垂、瞳孔缩小、无汗症）。\n(选项A) 肩关节脱位或肱骨外科颈骨折可引起腋神经损伤，导致三角肌和小圆肌无力。\n(选项C) 胸长神经损伤通常发生在腋窝淋巴结清扫术期间，导致前锯肌瘫痪，从而导致肩胛骨翼状。 \n(选项D) 肌皮神经损伤会导致肘部屈曲无力，因为该神经支配肱二头肌和肱肌。\n(选项E) 肱骨中段骨折常导致桡神经损伤。患者可能会出现后前臂和手背外侧麻木，伴有腕和手指伸肌瘫痪（腕下垂）。\n(选项F) 冈上神经支配冈上肌和冈下肌。神经损伤可能分别导致手臂外展和外旋困难。\n教育目标：\n臂丛神经的下干携带来自C8和T1脊髓节段的神经纤维，这些神经纤维负责支配手部所有内在肌肉（通过正中神经和尺神经）。肩部手臂突然向上伸展会损伤下干，导致手部笨拙和完全的爪形手畸形。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of brachial plexus anatomy and the clinical presentation of injuries to its components, specifically focusing on the inferior trunk and its associated nerve deficits.\nTo solve this question, one must correlate the patient's mechanism of injury (fall with grabbing a branch) and physical exam findings (difficulty with fine finger movements, hand clumsiness) with the anatomical innervation of the hand muscles by the brachial plexus. Identifying the specific nerve or nerve trunk responsible for these functions is key to selecting the correct answer.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试对臂丛神经解剖学的理解以及其组成部分的损伤的临床表现，特别侧重于下干及其相关的神经功能缺损。\n要解决这个问题，必须将患者的损伤机制（摔倒时抓住树枝）和体格检查结果（精细手指运动困难、手部笨拙）与臂丛神经对​​手部肌肉的解剖学支配联系起来。确定负责这些功能的特定神经或神经干是选择正确答案的关键。"
