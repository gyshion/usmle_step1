    "en": "A 56-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient has had inadequate glycemic control with metformin monotherapy; an additional medication that inhibits dipeptidyl peptidase-4 was prescribed 3 months ago. The patient also has hypertension for which he takes ramipril. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. The patient says he is generally compliant with dietary guidance but occasionally eats fast food. Blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg and pulse is 76/min. BMI is 31.4 kg/m². Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory results show a hemoglobin A1c of 6.8%. The newly prescribed medication most likely improved this patient's glycemic control through which of the following mechanisms?",
    "zh": "一名56岁的男性前来就诊，随访2型糖尿病。患者接受二甲双胍单药治疗后血糖控制不佳；3个月前处方了一种额外的药物，该药可抑制二肽基肽酶-4。该患者还患有高血压，正在服用雷米普利。他不吸烟、不饮酒，也不使用娱乐性药物。患者说他通常能遵守饮食指导，但偶尔吃快餐。血压为126/74 mm Hg，脉搏为76次/分钟。BMI为31.4 kg/m²。体格检查未见异常。实验室结果显示糖化血红蛋白A1c为6.8%。新开的药物最有可能通过以下哪种机制改善了该患者的血糖控制？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted by intestinal L cells in response to food intake and regulates glucose levels by slowing gastric emptying, suppressing glucagon secretion, and increasing glucose-dependent insulin release. It acts through cell surface receptors and is degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), which is found on the cell surface and in the circulation.\n\nDPP-4 inhibitors (eg, sitagliptin, saxagliptin) inhibit degradation of GLP-1, prolonging its effects and leading to improved glycemic control (eg, hemoglobin A1c reduction). GLP-1's effect on insulin secretion is glucose dependent: as glucose levels fall (ie, fasting state), so does insulin secretion; therefore, the risk of hypoglycemia is low.\n\nGLP-1 agonists (eg, exenatide) are also available; they are intrinsically resistant to DPP-4 and have a similar (but more potent) effect in lowering blood glucose with a low risk of hypoglycemia. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (eg, acarbose) impair the hydrolysis (ie, digestion) of polymeric carbohydrates, leading to decreased postprandial glucose absorption. Although DPP-4 inhibitors can delay gastric emptying, they do not decrease the digestion of carbohydrates.\n\n(Choice B) Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (eg, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin) act in the kidney to decrease reabsorption of filtered glucose.\n\n(Choice C) GLP-1 acts directly on pancreatic islet cells to suppress (not increase) glucagon secretion, an effect that is enhanced by DPP-4 inhibitors.\n\n(Choice E) Metformin inhibits mitochondrial enzymes required for gluconeogenesis, leading to decreased hepatic glucose production and lower circulating glucose levels. It also increases peripheral glucose uptake and improves insulin sensitivity by activating AMP-activated protein kinase.",
    "zh": "胰高血糖素样肽-1 (GLP-1) 由肠道L细胞在摄食后分泌，通过减缓胃排空、抑制胰高血糖素分泌和增加葡萄糖依赖性胰岛素释放来调节血糖水平。它通过细胞表面受体发挥作用，并被二肽基肽酶-4 (DPP-4) 降解，DPP-4存在于细胞表面和循环中。\n\nDPP-4抑制剂（如西格列汀、沙格列汀）可抑制GLP-1的降解，延长其作用并改善血糖控制（如糖化血红蛋白A1c降低）。GLP-1对胰岛素分泌的作用是葡萄糖依赖性的：随着葡萄糖水平下降（即空腹状态），胰岛素分泌也会降低；因此，低血糖的风险较低。\n\nGLP-1激动剂（如艾塞那肽）也可使用；它们对DPP-4具有内在抵抗力，并且在降低血糖方面具有类似（但更有效）的作用，且低血糖风险较低。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项A) α-葡萄糖苷酶抑制剂（如阿卡波糖）会损害多聚碳水化合物的水解（即消化），导致餐后葡萄糖吸收减少。尽管DPP-4抑制剂可以延缓胃排空，但它们不会减少碳水化合物的消化。\n\n(选项B) 钠-葡萄糖协同转运蛋白2抑制剂（如卡格列净、达格列净）在肾脏中发挥作用，以减少过滤葡萄糖的重吸收。\n\n(选项C) GLP-1直接作用于胰岛细胞以抑制（而不是增加）胰高血糖素的分泌，这种作用被DPP-4抑制剂增强。\n\n(选项E) 二甲双胍抑制糖异生所需的线粒体酶，导致肝脏葡萄糖产生减少和循环葡萄糖水平降低。它还通过激活AMP激活的蛋白激酶来增加外周葡萄糖摄取并改善胰岛素敏感性。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. DPP-4 inhibitors work by inhibiting the degradation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which increases glucose-dependent insulin release and improves glycemic control.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that DPP-4 inhibitors prolong the action of GLP-1. GLP-1 increases insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, suppresses glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying. Therefore, the correct answer is increased glucose-dependent insulin release.",
    "zh": "此题考察对2型糖尿病治疗中二肽基肽酶-4 (DPP-4) 抑制剂的作用机制的理解。DPP-4抑制剂通过抑制胰高血糖素样肽-1 (GLP-1) 的降解发挥作用，从而增加葡萄糖依赖性胰岛素释放并改善血糖控制。\n\n要解决此题，请回忆DPP-4抑制剂会延长GLP-1的作用。GLP-1以葡萄糖依赖性方式增加胰岛素分泌、抑制胰高血糖素分泌并减缓胃排空。因此，正确的答案是增加葡萄糖依赖性胰岛素释放。"
