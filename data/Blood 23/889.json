He has had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms for the past 3 days, including cough, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and sore throat. The parents say that \"a lot of kids at daycare have been sick lately.\" The patient has no prior medical problems. He is consistently at the 50th percentile for height and weight. He takes no medications, and his immunizations are up to date. Pallor, scleral icterus, and palpable splenomegaly are seen on examination. Laboratory results are as follows: {{exhibit_1}} The patient recovers spontaneously after a few weeks. Peripheral smear of the boy's blood after recovery is shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_2}}.",

    "en": "This patient's peripheral smear shows spherocytes, which are approximately two-thirds of the diameter of normal RBCs, more densely hemoglobinized at the periphery, and often lack a zone of central pallor. This patient's presentation is consistent with hereditary spherocytosis (HS), an autosomal dominant hemolytic anemia due to a red blood cell (RBC) membrane defect. The mutation in HS most often affects the plasma-membrane scaffolding proteins spectrin and ankyrin. Without this scaffolding, spherocytes are less deformable than normal RBCs and are prone to sequestration and subsequent accelerated destruction in the spleen. Clinical manifestations include hemolytic anemia, jaundice (increased RBC destruction results in greater bilirubin production), and splenomegaly (spherocytes have difficulty passing through the cords of Billroth and accumulate in the spleen). Infections can trigger hemolysis and lead to an acute hemolytic crisis, as seen in this patient. Age of diagnosis varies considerably, but many patients have jaundice and fatigue in times of increased hemolysis in the setting of viral infections.\n\n(Choice A) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme deficiency anemia usually follows oxidative stress. Common triggers include drugs (sulfonamide or antimalarial agents), fava beans, and infections (viral hepatitis, pneumonia, or typhoid). Peripheral smears of G6PD deficiency anemia show bite cells and Heinz bodies, not spherocytes.\n\n(Choice B) An imbalance between alpha globin and beta globin chain production results in thalassemia. In this patient, the peripheral smear has no morphologic variants associated with thalassemia, such as target cells or hypochromic microcytes.\n\n(choice c)\nA nuclear maturation defect due to defective DNA synthesis is the pathophysiologic mechanism of megaloblastic anemia, which is most commonly caused by vitamin B₁₂ and folic acid deficiencies. In this patient's peripheral smear, small spherocytes are primarily seen and not the enlarged oval cells and hypersegmented neutrophils of megaloblastic anemia.\n\n(Choice D) Polymerization of hemoglobin occurs in sickle cell anemia. A missense mutation in the beta globin chain leads to the production of hemoglobin S, which has the capacity to polymerize in deoxygenated states. This polymerization leads to red blood cell membrane injury and deformation to a \"sickle\" shape seen on peripheral smear.\n\nEducational objective:\nHereditary spherocytosis results from red cell cytoskeleton abnormalities, most commonly spectrin and ankyrin. Hemolytic anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly are classic manifestations. Spherocytes are seen on peripheral blood smear. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "该患者的外周血涂片显示球形红细胞，其直径约为正常红细胞的2/3，外周血红蛋白密度较高，并且通常缺乏中心苍白区。该患者的表现与遗传性球形红细胞增多症 (HS) 一致，这是一种常染色体显性溶血性贫血，由红细胞 (RBC) 膜缺陷引起。 HS 中的突变最常影响质膜支架蛋白血影蛋白和锚蛋白。如果没有这种支架，球形红细胞的变形性低于正常红细胞，并且容易被隔离，随后在脾脏中加速破坏。临床表现包括溶血性贫血、黄疸（红细胞破坏增加导致胆红素产生增加）和脾肿大（球形红细胞难以通过比尔罗氏索并积聚在脾脏中）。感染可触发溶血并导致急性溶血危象，如该患者所示。诊断年龄差异很大，但许多患者在病毒感染时溶血增加的情况下会出现黄疸和疲劳。\n\n（选项 A）葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶 (G6PD) 缺乏症贫血通常发生在氧化应激后。常见诱因包括药物（磺胺类或抗疟药）、蚕豆和感染（病毒性肝炎、肺炎或伤寒）。 G6PD缺乏症贫血的外周血涂片显示咬细胞和海因茨小体，而不是球形红细胞。\n\n（选项 B）α珠蛋白和β珠蛋白链产生之间的不平衡导致地中海贫血。在该患者中，外周血涂片没有与地中海贫血相关的形态学变异，例如靶细胞或低色素性小细胞。\n\n（选项 C）由于DNA合成缺陷导致的核成熟缺陷是巨幼细胞性贫血的病理生理学机制，其最常见的原因是维生素B₁₂和叶酸缺乏症。在该患者的外周血涂片中，主要可见小的球形红细胞，而不是巨幼细胞性贫血的肿大的卵圆形细胞和多叶中性粒细胞。\n\n（选项 D）血红蛋白聚合发生在镰状细胞贫血中。β珠蛋白链中的错义突变导致血红蛋白S的产生，血红蛋白S具有在去氧状态下聚合的能力。这种聚合会导致红细胞膜损伤并变形为外周血涂片中可见的“镰刀”形状。\n\n教育目标：\n遗传性球形红细胞增多症是由红细胞细胞骨架异常引起的，最常见的是血影蛋白和锚蛋白。溶血性贫血、黄疸和脾肿大是经典表现。外周血涂片可见球形红细胞。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hereditary spherocytosis, including its clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and underlying pathophysiology related to red blood cell membrane defects.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key findings of hemolytic anemia (jaundice, splenomegaly), review the lab results (hemoglobin, bilirubin), and identify the spherocytes on the peripheral smear.
