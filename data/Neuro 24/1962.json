    "en": "A 34-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to severe headache. The patient describes unbearable, throbbing pain around his right eye that awakened him. Over the past week, he has had several similar episodes, which spontaneously resolved after 20-30 minutes. He has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. The patient smokes a pack of cigarettes daily and drinks alcohol on social occasions. On physical examination, he appears restless and paces in the room. There is mild conjunctival injection and miosis of the right eye. Neurologic examination shows no abnormalities.",

    "en": "This young man with throbbing, unilateral periorbital headache associated with conjunctival injection and miosis has cluster headaches. The pathogenesis of cluster headaches is poorly understood but likely includes genetic predisposition, vascular dilation, and activation of the trigeminal-autonomic reflex. Males are affected more commonly than females.\n\nCluster headaches present with rapid-onset, severe, unilateral periorbital and temporal pain; patients are often restless or agitated during episodes. Ipsilateral autonomic symptoms due to parasympathetic hyperactivity are common and include nasal congestion, lacrimation, ptosis, miosis, and conjunctival injection. The headaches typically last 15-180 minutes and tend to occur in clusters (often at the same time each day, even if asleep) over a period of several weeks.\n\n(Choice A) Cavernous sinus thrombosis typically occurs in patients with thrombophilia (eg, malignancy, antithrombin deficiency) or as a septic thrombosis related to a sinus infection or facial cellulitis. Orbital pain is common; however, it is typically worsened with eye movement. Periorbital swelling, fever, and proptosis are other frequent findings.\n\n(Choice C) Migraine without aura typically causes severe, pulsatile, unilateral headache often associated with photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Miosis and lacrimation are unexpected.\n\n(Choice D) Opiate withdrawal can cause lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and diaphoresis, but would usually cause bilateral symptoms. It typically also causes gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, diarrhea, nausea), piloerection, and mydriasis; orbital pain is unexpected.\n\n(Choice E) Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) causes sudden, \"electric\" pain in the distribution of the maxillary and/or mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve, often preceded by light touch. Episodes last for seconds and do not typically occur during sleep.\n\n(Choice F) Vertebrobasilar ischemia can cause headaches but also typically causes dizziness, double vision or vision loss, and ataxia.\n\nEducational objective:\nCluster headaches cause severe, episodic, unilateral periorbital and temporal pain associated with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms (eg, lacrimation, nasal congestion, miosis, conjunctival injection). The headaches typically last 15-180 minutes and tend to occur in clusters (often at the same time each day). Males are affected more commonly than females.",
    "zh": "这位年轻人出现搏动性、单侧眶周头痛，伴有结膜充血和瞳孔缩小，患有丛集性头痛。丛集性头痛的发病机制尚不清楚，但可能包括遗传易感性、血管扩张和三叉神经-自主神经反射的激活。男性比女性更容易受到影响。\n\n丛集性头痛表现为快速发作的严重单侧眶周和颞部疼痛；患者在发作期间通常会感到烦躁或激动。由于副交感神经功能亢进引起的同侧自主神经症状很常见，包括鼻塞、流泪、眼睑下垂、瞳孔缩小和结膜充血。头痛通常持续15-180分钟，并且倾向于在数周内以丛集性发作（通常在每天的同一时间，即使在睡眠中）。\n\n(选项A) 海绵窦血栓形成通常发生在患有血栓形成倾向的患者（例如，恶性肿瘤、抗凝血酶缺乏症）或与窦感染或面部蜂窝织炎相关的败血症性血栓形成。眶周疼痛很常见；然而，通常会因眼球运动而加重。眶周肿胀、发烧和眼球突出是其他常见发现。\n\n(选项C) 无先兆偏头痛通常引起严重的搏动性、单侧头痛，通常伴有畏光、畏声、恶心和呕吐。瞳孔缩小和流泪是意想不到的。\n\n(选项D) 阿片类药物戒断可引起流泪、鼻溢和出汗，但通常会导致双侧症状。它通常也会引起胃肠道症状（例如，腹泻、恶心）、竖毛和瞳孔散大；眶周疼痛是意想不到的。\n\n(选项E) 三叉神经痛（抽搐性疼痛）引起三叉神经上颌和/或下颌分支分布范围内的突发性“电击样”疼痛，通常先于轻触。发作持续数秒，通常不会在睡眠期间发生。\n\n(选项F) 椎基底动脉缺血可引起头痛，但通常也会引起头晕、复视或视力丧失和共济失调。\n\n教育目标：\n丛集性头痛引起严重的阵发性单侧眶周和颞部疼痛，伴有同侧自主神经症状（例如，流泪、鼻塞、瞳孔缩小、结膜充血）。头痛通常持续15-180分钟，并且倾向于成簇发生（通常在每天的同一时间）。男性比女性更容易受到影响。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to diagnose cluster headaches based on a patient's presentation of severe, unilateral, periorbital pain with associated autonomic symptoms. It requires differentiating cluster headaches from other causes of headache, such as migraines, trigeminal neuralgia, and cavernous sinus thrombosis.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully evaluate the patient's chief complaint, the character and location of the pain, the duration and frequency of episodes, and any associated symptoms. Pay close attention to the presence of unilateral autonomic features, which are highly suggestive of cluster headaches.",
