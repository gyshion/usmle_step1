  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's acute onset of tremulousness, agitation, and elevated pulse and blood pressure within 48 hours of admission is suggestive of ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL. Alcohol is a CNS depressant that binds to the GABA₊ receptor complex, enhancing the inhibitory action of GABA (the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain). Abrupt cessation of alcohol decreases inhibitory tone and results in CNS excitation. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms typically start within 8-12 hours after the last drink and include insomnia, tremulousness, anxiety, and autonomic hyperactivity (variable blood pressure, diaphoresis, and tachycardia). Alcohol withdrawal seizures can occur within 12-48 hours, and delirium tremens (disorientation, severe agitation, fever) typically begins within 48-96 hours.\n\nAlcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines have similar effects on GABA receptors and act by enhancing GABA inhibitory action. BENZODIAZEPINES (eg, lorazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide) are used as FIRST-LINE therapy for psychomotor agitation associated with alcohol withdrawal and to prevent progression to seizures and delirium. Longer-acting benzodiazepines and those with active metabolites are preferred in the majority of patients due to self-tapering effects, resulting in a smoother course of withdrawal.\n\n(Choice A) Baclofen is an agonist of GABA B receptors and is used to treat spastic conditions. It is less effective than benzodiazepines for treating alcohol withdrawal.\n\n(Choice B) Carbamazepine may have a role in outpatient management of mild alcohol withdrawal, but there is insufficient evidence for its use in moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal.\n\n(Choices C and D) Chlorpromazine and haloperidol are antipsychotic medications that lower the seizure threshold. They should not be used to treat alcohol withdrawal as these patients are already at significant risk for seizure.\n\n(Choice F) Phenobarbital is a barbiturate anticonvulsant that enhances GABA activity. It is no longer used as first-line treatment for alcohol withdrawal because it has a worse safety profile than benzodiazepines.\n\n(Choice G) The beta blocker propranolol can treat tremor, tachycardia, and hypertension, but it has not been shown to prevent development of seizures or delirium tremens. Treatment with benzodiazepines is the most crucial step in the management of alcohol withdrawal.\n\nEducational objective:\nAlcohol withdrawal should be considered in hospitalized patients who develop tremulousness, agitation, and elevated pulse and blood pressure within 48 hours following admission. Benzodiazepines act as a substitute for the effects of alcohol on GABA receptors, preventing alcohol withdrawal from occurring.",
    "zh": "该患者在入院48小时内出现震颤、激动以及脉搏和血压升高，提示为酒精戒断。酒精是一种中枢神经系统抑制剂，与GABA₊受体复合物结合，增强GABA（大脑中主要的抑制性神经递质）的抑制作用。突然停止饮酒会降低抑制张力，导致中枢神经系统兴奋。酒精戒断症状通常在最后一次饮酒后8-12小时内开始，包括失眠、震颤、焦虑和自主神经功能亢进（血压变化、多汗和心动过速）。酒精戒断性癫痫发作可能在12-48小时内发生，震颤谵妄（定向力障碍、严重激动、发热）通常在48-96小时内开始。\n\n酒精、巴比妥类药物和苯二氮卓类药物对GABA受体有类似的作用，通过增强GABA的抑制作用而起作用。苯二氮卓类药物（例如，劳拉西泮、地西泮、氯氮卓）被用作治疗与酒精戒断相关的精神运动性激动的首选疗法，并防止进展为癫痫发作和谵妄。由于自逐渐减量效应，较长效的苯二氮卓类药物和具有活性代谢物的药物在大多数患者中是首选，从而导致戒断过程更平稳。\n\n（选项A）巴氯芬是GABA B受体的激动剂，用于治疗痉挛性疾病。它在治疗酒精戒断方面的效果不如苯二氮卓类药物。\n\n（选项B）卡马西平可能在门诊治疗轻度酒精戒断中发挥作用，但没有足够的证据表明其可用于中度至重度酒精戒断。\n\n（选项C和D）氯丙嗪和氟哌啶醇是降低癫痫发作阈值的抗精神病药物。它们不应用于治疗酒精戒断，因为这些患者已经有发生癫痫发作的重大风险。\n\n（选项F）苯巴比妥是一种增强GABA活性的巴比妥类抗惊厥药。由于其安全性不如苯二氮卓类药物，因此不再用作酒精戒断的一线治疗。\n\n（选项G）β受体阻滞剂普萘洛尔可以治疗震颤、心动过速和高血压，但尚未显示出它可以预防癫痫发作或震颤谵妄的发生。苯二氮卓类药物治疗是管理酒精戒断过程中最关键的步骤。\n\n教育目标：\n对于入院后48小时内出现震颤、激动以及脉搏和血压升高的住院患者，应考虑酒精戒断。苯二氮卓类药物可以替代酒精对GABA受体的作用，从而防止发生酒精戒断。"

    "en": "This question tests the recognition and management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in a hospitalized patient. It assesses the understanding of the pathophysiology of alcohol withdrawal, its clinical manifestations, and the appropriate pharmacotherapy, specifically the first-line treatment.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the classic signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal based on the patient's history of heavy alcohol use and recent cessation. Differentiating alcohol withdrawal from other causes of agitation and anxiety is crucial. The selection of the correct pharmacotherapy requires knowledge of the mechanisms of action of various medications and their established roles in managing alcohol withdrawal, with a focus on benzodiazepines as the preferred first-line agents.",
