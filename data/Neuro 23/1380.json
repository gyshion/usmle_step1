    "en": "The graph depicts the potential voltage changes across a cell membrane; these changes (depolarization, repolarization, hyperpolarization, and resting potential) are collectively known as the action potential. The action potential occurs due to changes in the membrane permeability to Na+ and K- ions. The membrane potential of an excitable cell (eg, nerve and muscle) cycles through the following stages:\n\n1.  Resting potential (Choice A): Usually equal to -70 mV. It is maintained by high resting membrane permeability to K+ and low permeability to Na+. K+ efflux occurs via non-gated K+ channels (leak channels). While at the resting potential, the inner side of the membrane is negatively charged with respect to the outer surface of the membrane.\n\n2.  Depolarization: Occurs due to opening of voltage-gated Na+ channels with rapid influx of Na+ into the cell. The large influx of Na+ leads to an increased positive charge inside the membrane known as depolarization (Choice B). Overshoot refers to the maximal value of the action potential during which the membrane potential obtains a positive value (approximately +35 mV) (Choice C).\n\n3.  Repolarization (Choice D): Results from closure of Na+ channels and simultaneous opening of K+ channels. This causes a sharp decrease in the membrane permeability to Na+ and a significant increase in K- permeance that exceeds that of the resting membrane. K+ efflux is responsible for returning the membrane potential back to the resting potential.\n\n4.  Hyperpolarization (Choice E): Occurs because the voltage-gated K+ channels remain open for a short time after repolarization is completed. The membrane potential thus becomes more negative than the normal resting potential and approaches the K+ equilibrium potential of -85 mV. When the negative-gated K+ channels close, the membrane potential returns to the resting value maintained by the non-gated K+ channels.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe action potential results from changes in the membrane permeability to K+ and Na+ ions. Depolarization results from massive influx of Na+ through voltage-gated Na+ channels. Repolarization occurs due to closure of voltage-gated Na+ channels and opening of voltage-gated K+ channels. K- ion permeance is highest during the repolarization phase of the action potential. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该图描绘了跨细胞膜的潜在电压变化；这些变化（去极化、复极化、超极化和静息电位）统称为动作电位。动作电位是由于膜对Na+和K-离子的通透性发生变化而产生的。可兴奋细胞（如神经和肌肉）的膜电位经历以下几个阶段：\n\n1.  静息电位（选项 A）：通常等于 -70 mV。它由对K+的高静息膜通透性和对Na+的低通透性维持。 K+外流通过非门控K+通道（漏通道）发生。在静息电位时，膜的内侧相对于膜的外表面带负电。\n\n2.  去极化：由于电压门控Na+通道开放，Na+迅速流入细胞而发生。大量Na+内流导致膜内正电荷增加，称为去极化（选项 B）。过冲是指动作电位的最大值，在此期间膜电位获得正值（大约 +35 mV）（选项 C）。\n\n3.  复极化（选项 D）：由Na+通道关闭和K+通道同时开放导致。这导致膜对Na+的通透性急剧下降，而K-通透性显着增加，超过静息膜的通透性。 K+外流负责将膜电位恢复到静息电位。\n\n4.  超极化（选项 E）：发生的原因是电压门控K+通道在复极化完成后保持开放一小段时间。因此，膜电位变得比正常的静息电位更负，并接近 -85 mV 的 K+平衡电位。当负门控K+通道关闭时，膜电位恢复到由非门控K+通道维持的静息值。\n\n教育目标：\n动作电位是由膜对K+和Na+离子的通透性变化引起的。去极化是由于大量的Na+通过电压门控Na+通道内流而产生的。复极化是由于电压门控Na+通道关闭和电压门控K+通道开放而发生的。在动作电位的复极化阶段，K-离子通透性最高。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of the different phases of an action potential and the ion permeability changes associated with each phase.
