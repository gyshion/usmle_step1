    "en": "A 60-year-old farmer is brought to the emergency department due to acute-onset confusion, muscle weakness, and difficulty breathing. The patient has vomited twice and has had 3 loose bowel movements over the past 2 hours. His medical history is insignificant and he currently takes no medications. Blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 58/min, and respirations are 26/min. His pupils are constricted, symmetric, and reactive to light. Examination reveals excessive sweating, lacrimation, and wheezing. He is incontinent of urine. Intravenous atropine is administered.",

    "en": "This farmer is exhibiting multiple signs of excessive cholinergic stimulation. He has likely been exposed to an ORGANOPHOSPHATE, a CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITOR that is commonly used in agricultural pesticides. Organophosphates inhibit cholinesterase in both muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic synapses, leading to decreased acetylcholine degradation. Overabundance of acetylcholine within the synaptic cleft leads to overstimulation of the corresponding receptors.\n\nThis patient is currently experiencing the effects of widespread muscarinic activation, which increases visceral smooth muscle tone and glandular secretions throughout the body (DUMEBELS mnemonic). Nicotinic activation leads to muscle fasciculations, weakness, and paralysis. Activation of both receptors in the central nervous system leads to seizures and coma. Atropine is a competitive inhibitor of acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors, thereby reversing muscarinic symptoms of organophosphate poisoning. However, atropine has no effect on nicotinic receptors; patients are still at risk of MUSCLE PARALYSIS. Pralidoxime is a cholinesterase-reactivating agent that allows for degradation of excess acetylcholine and treats both the muscarinic and nicotinic effects of organophosphates.\n\n(Choices A, B, C, D and F) Bradycardia, bronchospasm, diarrhea, miosis, and urinary incontinence are symptoms of excessive muscarinic activation, and are reversed with atropine.\n\nEducational objective:\nOrganophosphates inhibit cholinesterase in both muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic synapses, leading to decreased acetylcholine degradation and overstimulation of the corresponding receptors. Atropine reverses muscarinic effects but does not prevent the development of nicotinic effects such as muscle paralysis. Pralidoxime is a cholinesterase-reactivating agent that allows for degradation of excess acetylcholine and treats both the muscarinic and nicotinic effects of organophosphates.",
    "zh": "这位农民表现出多重过度胆碱能刺激的迹象。他可能接触了有机磷酸盐，这是一种胆碱酯酶抑制剂，常用于农业杀虫剂。有机磷酸盐抑制毒蕈碱性和烟碱性胆碱能突触中的胆碱酯酶，导致乙酰胆碱降解减少。突触间隙中乙酰胆碱过量会导致相应受体的过度刺激。\n\n该患者目前正在经历广泛的毒蕈碱激活的影响，这会增加全身的内脏平滑肌张力和腺体分泌（DUMEBELS助记符）。烟碱激活会导致肌肉纤维颤动、无力和麻痹。中枢神经系统中两种受体的激活会导致癫痫发作和昏迷。阿托品是毒蕈碱受体上乙酰胆碱的竞争性抑制剂，从而逆转有机磷中毒的毒蕈碱样症状。然而，阿托品对烟碱受体没有影响；患者仍然有肌肉麻痹的风险。氯解磷定是一种胆碱酯酶复活剂，可降解过量的乙酰胆碱，并治疗有机磷酸盐的毒蕈碱和烟碱效应。\n\n（选项 A、B、C、D 和 F）心动过缓、支气管痉挛、腹泻、缩瞳和尿失禁是过度毒蕈碱激活的症状，可通过阿托品逆转。\n\n教育目标：\n有机磷酸盐抑制毒蕈碱性和烟碱性胆碱能突触中的胆碱酯酶，导致乙酰胆碱降解减少和相应受体的过度刺激。阿托品逆转毒蕈碱效应，但不能阻止烟碱效应（如肌肉麻痹）的发生。氯解磷定是一种胆碱酯酶复活剂，可降解过量的乙酰胆碱，并治疗有机磷酸盐的毒蕈碱和烟碱效应。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of organophosphate poisoning and its effects on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, as well as the mechanism of action of atropine and pralidoxime. It requires understanding which symptoms are reversed by atropine and which persist due to nicotinic receptor effects.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the signs of cholinergic toxicity (DUMEBELS), identify the mechanism of organophosphate poisoning, and recall that atropine only reverses muscarinic effects, leaving nicotinic effects like muscle weakness untreated.",
