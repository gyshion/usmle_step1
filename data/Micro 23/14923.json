    "en": "A 38-year-old man comes to the office due to worsening fever, chills, malaise, cough, and shortness of breath. The patient has no prior medical conditions and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. He has not traveled recently or been exposed to sick contacts. Temperature is 39.4 C (103 F). There is dullness to percussion and crackles over the right lung. Leukocyte count is elevated, and chest x-ray reveals a right lung infiltrate. The underlying immune response to this patient's infection largely involves T helper (Th1) cells, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-2.",

    "en": "This patient has high fever, cough, leukocytosis, and a right lung infiltrate indicating lobar pneumonia. Lobar pneumonia is most commonly caused by extracellular bacterial pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Choices A, D, and E). The immune response to extracellular organisms is primarily mediated by neutrophils early in infection and by the humoral antibody response (B lymphocytes, immunoglobulins, complement) as time goes on.\n\nIn this case, components of the cell-mediated immune response were primarily involved in controlling the infection, suggesting that the pneumonia was most likely due to an intracellular pathogen such as Legionella pneumophila (a common cause of atypical community-acquired pneumonia). Intracellular pathogens are phagocytosed by macrophages but are initially resistant to destruction due to the presence of virulence factors that inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion (eg, Legionella) or phagolysosome acidification (eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), or allow bacteria to escape from the phagolysosome (eg, Listeria monocytogenes).\n\nLegionella and other intracellular pathogens that initially replicate within the phagosome eventually undergo some degree of digestion by lysosomes, leading to the display of bacterial antigens on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. This stimulates naive CD4 T lymphocytes to differentiate into T-helper subtype 1 (Th1) cells. Th1 cells release interferon-gamma, which activates macrophages and allows them to form fully mature (acidified) phagolysosomes capable of efficiently killing the intracellular bacteria. Th1 cells also release interleukin-2, which activates and expands the population of naive T cells, Th1 cells, and memory T cells.\n\n(Choice C) Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of pneumonia in patients who are hospitalized in the intensive care unit or those with structural lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is an extracellular pathogen primarily combated by neutrophils and the humoral immune response.\n\nEducational objective:\nIntracellular bacterial organisms such as Legionella pneumophila are primarily countered by the cell-mediated immune response. Intracellular pathogens that replicate within phagosomes (eg, Legionella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) trigger activation and differentiation of T-helper subtype 1 cells with subsequent macrophage activation via interferon-gamma.",
    "zh": "该患者高热、咳嗽、白细胞增多和右肺浸润，提示大叶性肺炎。大叶性肺炎最常见的原因是细胞外细菌病原体，如流感嗜血杆菌、金黄色葡萄球菌和肺炎链球菌（选项 A、D 和 E）。对细胞外病原体的免疫反应主要由感染早期的中性粒细胞和体液抗体反应（B淋巴细胞、免疫球蛋白、补体）介导。\n\n在这种情况下，细胞介导的免疫反应的组成部分主要参与控制感染，这表明肺炎最可能由细胞内病原体引起，如嗜肺军团菌（一种非典型社区获得性肺炎的常见原因）。细胞内病原体被巨噬细胞吞噬，但最初对破坏具有抵抗力，这归因于存在抑制吞噬体-溶酶体融合的毒力因子（例如，军团菌）或抑制吞噬体酸化（例如，结核分枝杆菌），或者允许细菌从吞噬体中逃逸（例如，单核细胞增生李斯特菌）。\n\n军团菌和其他最初在吞噬体内复制的细胞内病原体最终会受到溶酶体的一定程度的消化，导致细菌抗原在主要组织相容性复合物（MHC）I类分子上的展示。这刺激幼稚CD4 T淋巴细胞分化为T辅助1型（Th1）细胞。Th1细胞释放干扰素-γ，激活巨噬细胞，使其形成能够有效杀死细胞内细菌的完全成熟（酸化）吞噬溶酶体。Th1细胞还释放白细胞介素-2，激活并扩大幼稚T细胞、Th1细胞和记忆T细胞的数量。\n\n（选项 C）铜绿假单胞菌是入住重症监护病房的患者或患有结构性肺部疾病（如慢性阻塞性肺病）的患者肺炎的常见原因。它是一种细胞外病原体，主要通过中性粒细胞和体液免疫反应来对抗。\n\n教育目标：\n嗜肺军团菌等细胞内细菌主要通过细胞介导的免疫反应来对抗。在吞噬体（例如，军团菌、结核分枝杆菌）内复制的细胞内病原体会触发T辅助1型细胞的激活和分化，随后通过干扰素-γ激活巨噬细胞。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pneumonia etiology and the immune response to different types of pathogens, specifically intracellular vs. extracellular bacteria.
