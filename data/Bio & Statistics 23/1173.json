    "en": "CONFOUNDING occurs when the exposure-disease relationship is muddled by the effect of a confounding variable, an extraneous factor associated with both exposure and disease.  Stratified analysis by smoking status shows that both smokers and non-smokers have an RR ~1 with large p-values (>0.05). The RR of 1.81 found on crude analysis disappears and there is no true association between alcohol consumption and bladder cancer.",
    "zh": "当暴露-疾病关系被混杂变量（与暴露和疾病相关的无关因素）的影响所混淆时，就会发生混杂。按吸烟状况进行的分层分析表明，吸烟者和不吸烟者的 RR 均约为 1，p 值较大 (>0.05)。在粗略分析中发现的 RR 为 1.81 消失了，并且饮酒与膀胱癌之间没有真正的关联。"
