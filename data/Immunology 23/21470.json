    "en": "A 22-year-old woman comes to the emergency department after development of a diffuse pruritic rash following a meal at a buffet restaurant an hour ago. She also felt light-headed and nearly fainted. The patient has no prior medical conditions and takes no medications. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 96/52 mm Hg, pulse is 128/min, and respirations are 16/min. Physical examination shows mild lip swelling; the tongue appears normal. Heart auscultation demonstrates regular tachycardia without extraneous sounds. Lung sounds are clear with normal work of breathing. Skin examination shows confluent urticaria on the neck, shoulders, and abdomen. Intravenous fluids are begun, and intramuscular epinephrine is administered immediately. In addition to its effect on airway and circulation, this medication is most likely to improve this patient's condition through which of the following mechanisms?",

    "en": "This patient with sudden-onset rash and hypotension after ingesting a likely allergen has anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis classically involves a type 1 (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction to an antigen, resulting in IgE-mediated mast cell and basophil degranulation. Suddenly and massive release of inflammatory mediators (eg, histamine, leukotrienes) into the circulation can quickly lead to urticaria, oropharyngeal edema (eg, lip swelling), and shock (eg, hypotension, tachycardia). \n\nEpinephrine is the only pharmacologic therapy that both decreases the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells and addresses all other manifestations of anaphylaxis. It binds to adrenergic receptors (eg, beta-2 receptors) on the surface of mast cells, inhibiting mast cell degranulation. In addition, it counteracts existing inflammatory effects via widespread stimulation of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors:\n\n*   Alpha-1: causes vasoconstriction and decreases vascular permeability, raising blood pressure and decreasing upper airway edema\n*   Beta-1: increases cardiac contractility and cardiac output, improving blood pressure and peripheral perfusion\n*   Beta-2: causes bronchodilation, relieving airflow obstruction\n\nBecause of its ability to both treat and prevent further inflammatory mediator effects, epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis.\n\n(Choice A) H+ antagnon sts (eg, diphenhydramine) block tissue histamine receptors, preventing the effects of circulating histamine on capillaries (eg, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability). However, they do not decrease the mast cell release of histamine or other inflammatory mediators.\n\n(Choice B) Omalizumab is a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody that binds to free IgE at the same site where IgE normally binds to mast cell IgE Fc receptors. It prevents receptor binding and decreases circulating IgE levels, which eventually induces IgE Fc receptor down-regulation to help stabilize mast cells.\n\n(Choice C) Zileuton, a medication commonly used in the management of asthma, decreases the leukoycte synthesis of leukotrienes by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase. This results in decreased leukotriene activity, reducing inflammation and bronchospasm.\n\n(Choice E) Glucocorticoids reduce inflammation by several mechanisms. One such mechanism is by promoting eosinophil apoptosis, either directly or by decreasing production of IL-5, which usually promotes eosinophil survival. This decreases the number of circulating eosinophils.\n\nEducational objective: Anaphylaxis is a type 1 (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction involving IgE-mediated mast cell and basophil degranulation. Epinephrine is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis because it decreases further mast cell release of inflammatory mediators and counteracts existing systemic inflammatory effects (eg, shock, bronchoconstriction). {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者在摄入可能的过敏原后突然出现皮疹和低血压，患有过敏性休克。过敏性休克通常涉及对一种抗原的I型（速发型）超敏反应，导致IgE介导的肥大细胞和嗜碱性粒细胞脱颗粒。大量炎症介质（例如组胺、白三烯）突然释放到循环中，可迅速导致荨麻疹、口咽水肿（例如唇部肿胀）和休克（例如低血压、心动过速）。\n\n肾上腺素是唯一一种既能减少肥大细胞释放炎症介质，又能解决过敏性休克所有其他表现的药物治疗方法。它与肥大细胞表面的肾上腺素能受体（例如β-2受体）结合，抑制肥大细胞脱颗粒。此外，它通过广泛刺激α-和β-肾上腺素能受体来对抗现有的炎症反应：\n\n*   α-1：引起血管收缩并降低血管通透性，升高血压并减轻上气道水肿\n*   β-1：增加心肌收缩力和心输出量，改善血压和外周灌注\n*   β-2：引起支气管扩张，缓解气流阻塞\n\n由于其既能治疗又能预防进一步的炎症介质作用，肾上腺素是治疗过敏性休克的一线治疗方法。\n\n（选项A）H+拮抗剂（例如苯海拉明）阻断组织组胺受体，阻止循环组胺对毛细血管的影响（例如血管舒张，血管通透性增加）。然而，它们不会减少肥大细胞释放组胺或其他炎症介质。\n\n（选项B）奥马珠单抗是一种单克隆抗IgE抗体，在IgE通常与肥大细胞IgE Fc受体结合的相同位点与游离IgE结合。它阻止受体结合并降低循环IgE水平，最终诱导IgE Fc受体下调，以帮助稳定肥大细胞。\n\n（选项C）齐留通是一种常用于哮喘治疗的药物，通过抑制5-脂氧合酶来减少白细胞合成白三烯。这导致白三烯活性降低，从而减少炎症和支气管痉挛。\n\n（选项E）糖皮质激素通过几种机制减少炎症。其中一种机制是通过促进嗜酸性粒细胞凋亡，无论是直接促进凋亡，还是通过减少通常促进嗜酸性粒细胞存活的IL-5的产生。这减少了循环嗜酸性粒细胞的数量。\n\n教育目标：过敏性休克是一种I型（速发型）超敏反应，涉及IgE介导的肥大细胞和嗜碱性粒细胞脱颗粒。肾上腺素是治疗过敏性休克的主要药物，因为它减少了肥大细胞进一步释放炎症介质，并对抗现有的全身炎症反应（例如休克、支气管收缩）。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

It requires understanding of the immediate hypersensitivity reaction and the role of mast cell degranulation. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the clinical presentation as anaphylaxis and recalling that epinephrine's primary mechanism in this setting is to decrease mediator release from mast cells, in addition to its effects on airway and circulation.",
