    "en": "A 58-year-old man comes to the office with upper abdominal pain, fatigue, and anorexia. He says his symptoms began about a month ago and seem to be getting worse. The patient has a history of cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C. Physical examination shows cachexia and worsening ascites. Imaging studies reveal a large mass in the right hepatic lobe consistent with unresectable hepatocellular cancer. The patient is scheduled to undergo percutaneous embolization of the artery supplying the tumor. Contrast material administration into which of the following structures is most likely to visually enhance the artery prior to embolization?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The vascular supply to the upper abdomen mainly comes from the celiac trunk (celiac artery), which is the first anterior branch of the abdominal aorta. The celiac trunk branches into the left gastric, common hepatic, and splenic arteries. The left gastric artery further divides into the esophageal and stomach branches, which supply blood to the abdominal esophagus and upper stomach. The splenic artery and its branches (dorsal pancreatic, short gastric, left gastro-omental, and greater pancreatic arteries) provide blood to the spleen, the gastric fundus, and part of the pancreas (Choice E). \n\nThe common hepatic artery further divides into the gastroduodenal and proper hepatic arteries. The gastroduodenal artery supplies blood to the pylorus, proximal duodenum, and pancreatic head (Choice B). \n\nThe proper hepatic artery provides into the left and right hepatic arteries, which provide arterial blood supply to the liver and would perfuse this patient's right hepatic lobe mass {{exhibit_1}}.\n\n(Choice C) The inferior mesenteric artery branches off the abdominal aorta at the L3 level (inferior to both the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery). This artery provides blood supply to the colon from the splenic flexure to the upper rectum (eg, descending and sigmoid colon).\n\n(Choice D) The inferior vena cava (IVC) is formed by the union of both common iliac veins and drains blood from the lower part of the body to the right atrium. Other veins that empty into the IVC include the hepatic, renal, lumbar, and gonadal veins.\n\n(Choice F) The superior mesenteric artery branches off the abdominal aorta inferior to the origin of the celiac trunk. The superior mesenteric artery supplies blood to part of the pancreas and the intestine from the lower part of the duodenum to the first two-thirds of the transverse colon.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe celiac trunk is the first main branch of the abdominal aorta; it provides oxygenated blood to the spleen, stomach, liver, abdominal esophagus, and parts of the duodenum and pancreas. The proper hepatic artery branches off the common hepatic artery from the celiac trunk and provides arterial blood supply to the liver.",
    "zh": "上腹部的血管供应主要来自腹腔干（腹腔动脉），它是腹主动脉的第一个前支。腹腔干分支成左胃动脉、肝总动脉和脾动脉。左胃动脉进一步分支成食管和胃支，为腹部食管和胃上部供血。脾动脉及其分支（背胰动脉、胃短动脉、左胃网膜动脉和胰大动脉）为脾脏、胃底和部分胰腺供血（选项E）。\n\n肝总动脉进一步分支成胃十二指肠动脉和固有肝动脉。胃十二指肠动脉为幽门、近端十二指肠和胰头供血（选项B）。\n\n固有肝动脉分支成左肝动脉和右肝动脉，为肝脏提供动脉血液供应，并将灌注该患者的右肝叶肿块 {{exhibit_1}}。\n\n（选项C）肠系膜下动脉在L3水平从腹主动脉分支出（低于腹腔干和肠系膜上动脉）。该动脉为结肠从脾曲到上直肠供血（例如，降结肠和乙状结肠）。\n\n（选项D）下腔静脉（IVC）由两侧髂总静脉汇合而成，将血液从身体下部引流到右心房。其他注入IVC的静脉包括肝静脉、肾静脉、腰静脉和性腺静脉。\n\n（选项F）肠系膜上动脉从腹主动脉分支出，低于腹腔干的起始处。肠系膜上动脉为部分胰腺和肠道供血，从十二指肠下部到横结肠的前三分之二。\n\n教育目的：\n腹腔干是腹主动脉的第一个主要分支；它为脾脏、胃、肝脏、腹部食管以及部分十二指肠和胰腺提供含氧血液。固有肝动脉从肝总动脉（腹腔干的分支）分支出，为肝脏提供动脉血液供应。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the arterial supply to the liver, specifically the origin and branching pattern of the celiac trunk and its relationship to the hepatic arteries. It requires understanding which vessel would be visualized during contrast administration prior to embolization of a hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the anatomy of the celiac trunk and its branches. Recognize that the hepatic arteries, which supply the liver, originate from the common hepatic artery, a branch of the celiac trunk. Therefore, contrast injected into the celiac trunk would visualize the hepatic arteries.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试对肝脏动脉供血的知识，特别是腹腔干的起源和分支模式及其与肝动脉的关系。它需要了解在肝细胞癌栓塞术前，在造影剂给药期间会看到哪条血管。\n\n要解决这个问题，请回忆腹腔干及其分支的解剖结构。认识到供应肝脏的肝动脉起源于肝总动脉，而肝总动脉是腹腔干的一个分支。因此，注入腹腔干的造影剂将可视化肝动脉。"
