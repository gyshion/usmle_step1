    "en": "A 36-year-old man is brought to the hospital after being found wandering the streets barefoot and shouting to himself. Although he takes antipsychotic medication daily, his parents are having difficulty managing him at home. The patient believes he is fighting a conspiracy and that his thoughts are directly controlled by a device that was implanted in his brain during a prior hospitalization. Previous trials of haloperidol, quetiapine, and risperidone resulted in minimal improvement. He has no other medical problems. On mental status examination, the patient is alert, and restless with poor grooming, disheveled clothing, and flat affect. He refuses to answer most questions, accuses his parents of being part of the conspiracy, and mumbles nonsensical words.",
    "zh": "一名36岁男性被带到医院，此前被发现在街上赤脚游荡并自言自语。尽管他每天服用抗精神病药物，但他的父母在家中难以照料他。患者认为他正在对抗阴谋，并且他的思想直接受到先前住院期间植入大脑中的设备控制。先前使用氟哌啶醇、喹硫平和利培酮的治疗效果甚微。他没有其他医学问题。在精神状态检查中，患者清醒，焦躁不安，仪容不整，衣衫不整，情感淡漠。他拒绝回答大多数问题，指责他的父母参与阴谋，并嘟囔着毫无意义的词语。"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient likely has schizophrenia, a chronic mental illness characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior, and negative symptoms. Antipsychotic medication is the treatment of choice. This patient is considered treatment-resistant as he has had a poor response to at least 2 antipsychotics and continues to experience multiple delusions and disorganized speech and behavior. The second-generation antipsychotic CLOZAPINE is the only medication that has consistently shown SUPERIOR EFFICACY in TREATMENT-RESISTANT SCHIZOPHRENIA. Clozapine has an affinity for multiple dopamine and serotonin receptors, but the precise pharmacological mechanism responsible for its superior efficacy is unknown. Treatment with clozapine involves mandatory monitoring of the absolute neutrophil count due to the risk of NEUTROPENIA and life-threatening AGRANULOCYTOSIS. Although clozapine is associated with neutropenia, weight gain, and metabolic effects, the potential benefit of improving symptoms in treatment-resistant schizophrenia often outweighs these risks.\n(Choices A and G) Aripiprazole and ziprasidone are second-generation antipsychotics used in schizophrenia. However this patient has already failed 2 trials with second-generation antipsychotics (risperidone and quetiapine). Due to its superior efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, clozapine would be the preferred agent.\n(Choice B) Chlorpromazine is a low-potency, first-generation antipsychotic that is unlikely to be effective in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.\n(Choice C) Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be used adjunctively to target agitation in individuals with psychosis, but it does not specifically treat psychotic symptoms.\n(Choice E) Haloperidol long-acting injectable would be a good strategy for a patient who is nonadherent and has a history of responding well to oral haloperidol. However, this patient is adherent and has responded poorly to haloperidol.\n(Choice F) Valproate is an anticonvulsant mood stabilizer used in the treatment of bipolar disorder.\nEducational objective: The antipsychotic clozapine is the drug of choice for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Treatment requires monitoring of the absolute neutrophil count due to the risks of neutropenia and agranulocytosis.",
    "zh": "该患者可能患有精神分裂症，这是一种以妄想、幻觉、言语和行为紊乱以及阴性症状为特征的慢性精神疾病。抗精神病药物是首选治疗方法。由于该患者对至少2种抗精神病药物的反应不佳，并且持续出现多种妄想和言语行为紊乱，因此被认为是难治性患者。第二代抗精神病药物氯氮平是唯一一种在难治性精神分裂症中持续显示出卓越疗效的药物。氯氮平对多种多巴胺和血清素受体具有亲和力，但导致其卓越疗效的精确药理学机制尚不清楚。氯氮平的治疗涉及强制监测中性粒细胞绝对计数，因为存在中性粒细胞减少症和危及生命的粒细胞缺乏症的风险。虽然氯氮平与中性粒细胞减少症、体重增加和代谢影响有关，但改善难治性精神分裂症症状的潜在益处通常超过这些风险。\n（选项A和G）阿立哌唑和齐拉西酮是用于治疗精神分裂症的第二代抗精神病药物。然而，该患者已经对2种第二代抗精神病药物（利培酮和喹硫平）的治疗失败。由于其在难治性精神分裂症中的卓越疗效，氯氮平将是首选药物。\n（选项B）氯丙嗪是一种低效价的第一代抗精神病药物，不太可能对难治性精神分裂症有效。\n（选项C）氯硝西泮是一种苯二氮卓类药物，可辅助用于治疗精神病患者的躁动，但它不能专门治疗精神病症状。\n（选项E）对于不依从医嘱且既往对口服氟哌啶醇反应良好的患者，氟哌啶醇长效注射剂是一个很好的策略。但是，该患者依从医嘱，并且对氟哌啶醇的反应不佳。\n（选项F）丙戊酸盐是一种抗癫痫药，情绪稳定剂，用于治疗双相情感障碍。\n教学目标：抗精神病药物氯氮平是治疗难治性精神分裂症的首选药物。治疗需要监测中性粒细胞绝对计数，因为存在中性粒细胞减少症和粒细胞缺乏症的风险。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of treatment-resistant schizophrenia and the appropriate medication choice for such cases. It assesses knowledge of the efficacy of clozapine compared to other antipsychotics and the management of its associated risks.\nTo solve this question, identify the patient's diagnosis as schizophrenia and recognize that they have failed multiple prior antipsychotic treatments, indicating treatment resistance. Recall that clozapine is the gold standard for treatment-resistant schizophrenia and consider why other options are less suitable based on efficacy or patient-specific factors.",
