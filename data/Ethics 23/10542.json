    "en": "A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by a friend who found the patient disoriented in his apartment. The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and tobacco use. He is unmarried and lives alone. The friend says that the patient has a sister who lives in the area but is unaware of when they last spoke. The friend has known the patient for 5 years and says that they are \"good buddies.\" He tells the physician that they have discussed dying and that he believes the patient would prefer to \"go naturally\" and would refuse any heroic measures, including \"being hooked up to a ventilator.\" Temperature is 39 C (102.2 F), blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 24/min. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air and 93% on 2 L of oxygen. The patient is somnolent and unable to answer questions. The lungs have bilateral wheezing and decreased breath sounds. Chest x-ray reveals a right lower lobe infiltrate {{exhibit_1}}. Appropriate bronchodilator and antibiotic therapies are initiated. The physician is concerned about the need for intubation if the patient does not respond to initial treatment in the next 2-3 hours. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has acute pneumonia complicated by hypoxemia and confusion. He is noncommunicative and unable to give consent regarding invasive ventilation. In such cases, consent can often be obtained from an advance directive, either a living will (ie, document specifying consent for certain life-prolonging interventions) or designated surrogate decision-maker (eg, durable power of attorney) if available. In the absence of a living will or designated surrogate, decision-making falls to the next of kin (typically the patient's spouse, adult child, parent, or adult sibling determined by the proximity of relationship). \n\nTherefore, this patient's sister (next of kin) should be contacted regarding consent to intubate. In nonemergent situations, surrogates are responsible for making decisions based on what they believe the patient would want (ie, substituted judgment) and the patient's best interest.\n\n(Choice B) A facility ethics committee may be convened when equal surrogate decision-makers (eg, multiple adult children) disagree or there is reason to suspect that the surrogate is not acting in the patient's interest. In this case, the need to contact the patient's sister is straightforward and does not require ethics committee input.\n\n(Choice C) The patient's friend does not have priority over next of kin for decision-making. If no family members are available, then the advice of his friend could be considered in substituted judgment.\n\n(Choice D) In an emergency, the physician should use clinical judgment and act promptly, and can do so without consent if necessary. However, in this case, intubation is not emergent, so an effort should be made to contact the patient's sister first.\n\n(Choice E) Waiting for the patient's mental status to improve would be inappropriate, given that his respiratory status may deteriorate rapidly.",
    "zh": "该患者患有急性肺炎，伴有低氧血症和意识模糊。他无法交流，也无法就侵入性通气提供同意。在这种情况下，通常可以从预先指示中获得同意，可以是生前遗嘱（即，指定同意某些延长生命的干预措施的文件）或指定的替代决策者（例如，持久授权书），如果可用。在没有生前遗嘱或指定替代者的情况下，决策权属于近亲（通常是患者的配偶、成年子女、父母或成年兄弟姐妹，由关系的亲近程度决定）。\n\n因此，应联系该患者的妹妹（近亲），征得插管同意。在非紧急情况下，替代者有责任根据他们认为患者想要什么（即，替代判断）和患者的最大利益做出决定。\n\n（选项B）当平等的替代决策者（例如，多个成年子女）意见不一致或有理由怀疑替代者没有按照患者的利益行事时，可以召集机构伦理委员会。在这种情况下，联系患者妹妹的需求是直接的，不需要伦理委员会的参与。\n\n（选项C）患者的朋友在决策方面没有优先于近亲的权利。如果没有家人可用，那么可以考虑朋友的建议作为替代判断。\n\n（选项D）在紧急情况下，医生应使用临床判断并迅速采取行动，如有必要，无需征得同意即可这样做。但是，在这种情况下，插管并非紧急情况，因此应首先努力联系患者的妹妹。\n\n（选项E）等待患者的精神状态改善是不合适的，因为他的呼吸状况可能会迅速恶化。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of medical decision-making capacity and the hierarchy of surrogate decision-makers when a patient is unable to provide consent. It emphasizes the importance of contacting the next of kin in non-emergent situations. \n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the patient's inability to provide consent, recognizing the absence of an advance directive, and applying the established hierarchy of surrogate decision-makers, prioritizing the next of kin (in this case, the patient's sister).",
