  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient developed acute vomiting after treatment with systemic chemotherapy. The vomiting reflex is initiated by the CHEMORECEPTOR TRIGGER ZONE (CTZ), or AREA POSTREMA, and nucleus tractus solitarius. The AREA POSTREMA is located on the dorsal surface of the medulla at the caudal end of the fourth ventricle; this region does not have a well-developed blood-brain barrier, allowing it to be exposed to chemicals circulating in the blood.\n\nThe CTZ can be triggered directly by emetogenic substances (eg, drugs, toxins) or indirectly by vagal afferents from the gastrointestinal tract. CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS cause damage to enterocytes, resulting in release of serotonin. This stimulates 5-HT3 RECEPTORS on vagal afferent fibers located in the bowel wall, which then ascend to the CTZ to trigger the VOMITING REFLEX. Chemotherapy-associated emetic stimuli in the cerebrospinal fluid and bloodstream can also stimulate the area postrema directly by causing local release of substance P, which activates NEUROKININ-1 (NK1) RECEPTORS in the brainstem to induce vomiting.\n\nSelective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (eg, ondansetron) and NK1 receptor antagonists (eg, aprepitant, fosaprepitant) can be used to ameliorate chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting by reducing overstimulation of the CTZ.\n\n(Choice A) The thalamus is superior to the midbrain and makes up part of the lateral wall of the third ventricle. It coordinates sensory and motor function, regulates sleep and wakefulness, and plays an important role in memory and cognition.\n\n(Choice B) The superior and inferior colliculi are located in the dorsal midbrain. They are involved in processing visual (superior colliculi) and auditory (inferior colliculi) information and initiating movement of the head and eyes in response to visual or auditory input.\n\n(Choice C) The ventral pons is inferior to the midbrain in the brainstem and contains the corticospinal tract (eg, limb/torso movement), corticobulbar tract (eg, face/head/neck movement), and abducens nucleus (eg, horizontal eye movement).\n\n(Choice E) The cerebellum makes up the posterior wall of the fourth ventricle and plays an important role in motor control (eg, coordination, precise movements, posture) and cognitive function (eg, attention, language).",
    "zh": "该患者在接受全身化疗后出现急性呕吐。呕吐反射由化学感受器触发区（CTZ）或后区和孤束核启动。后区位于延髓背侧面，第四脑室的尾端；该区域的血脑屏障发育不全，因此暴露于血液中循环的化学物质。\n\nCTZ可被催吐物质（例如，药物、毒素）直接触发，或被来自胃肠道的迷走神经传入神经间接触发。化疗药物会损伤肠细胞，导致血清素释放。这会刺激位于肠壁的迷走神经传入纤维上的5-HT3受体，然后上升到CTZ以触发呕吐反射。化疗相关的呕吐刺激物也会在脑脊液和血流中直接刺激后区，导致P物质局部释放，从而激活脑干中的神经激肽-1（NK1）受体以诱发呕吐。\n\n选择性5-HT3受体拮抗剂（例如，昂丹司琼）和NK1受体拮抗剂（例如，阿瑞匹坦、磷酸阿瑞匹坦）可用于改善化疗引起的恶心和呕吐，通过减少对CTZ的过度刺激。\n\n（选项A）丘脑位于中脑上方，构成第三脑室的侧壁的一部分。它协调感觉和运动功能，调节睡眠和觉醒，并在记忆和认知中发挥重要作用。\n\n（选项B）上丘和下丘位于中脑背面。它们参与处理视觉（上丘）和听觉（下丘）信息，并根据视觉或听觉输入启动头部和眼睛的运动。\n\n（选项C）脑桥腹侧位于脑干的中脑下方，包含皮质脊髓束（例如，肢体/躯干运动）、皮质脑干束（例如，面部/头部/颈部运动）和外展神经核（例如，水平眼球运动）。\n\n（选项E）小脑构成第四脑室的后壁，在运动控制（例如，协调、精确运动、姿势）和认知功能（例如，注意力、语言）中发挥重要作用。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the neuroanatomical basis of the vomiting reflex, specifically the role of the area postrema (chemoreceptor trigger zone) in mediating chemotherapy-induced emesis due to its location outside the blood-brain barrier.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the emetogenic stimulus (chemotherapy), recall the primary brain structures involved in the vomiting reflex, and recognize that the area postrema is particularly sensitive to circulating toxins due to its lack of a robust blood-brain barrier.",
