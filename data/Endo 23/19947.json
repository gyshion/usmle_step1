  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has hyperparathyroidism, presenting with osteoporosis and nephrolithiasis associated with mild hypercalcemia and an inappropriately elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level.\n\nPTH increases bone turnover by stimulating the differentiation and activity of osteoblasts, leading to increased bone formation. In addition, PTH upregulates the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANK-L) on the surface of the activated osteoblasts, which binds RANK on nearby osteoclast precursor cells and induces maturation to active osteoclasts. Therefore, PTH causes bone formation (by direct effect on osteoblasts) and bone resorption (by paracrine effect on osteoclasts). Bone turnover is normally balanced, with bone formation proportionate to resorption.\n\nIn hyperparathyroid states, continuous exposure to high PTH levels cause increased RANK-L expression along with suppression of osteoprotegerin (a counterregulatory decoy receptor). This leads to greater bone resorption than formation and net bone loss.\n\n(Choices A and D) PTH upregulates 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidneys, which leads to increased (not decreased) conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol) to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol). Calcitriol subsequently induces increased (not decreased) intestinal calcium absorption.\n\n(Choice B) PTH increases renal reabsorption of calcium. Despite this, hypercalciuria is common in hyperparathyroidism because the filtered calcium load may exceed renal reabsorption capacity. However, the local concentrations of calcium in the bone remain elevated, and urinary calcium wasting is not a major contributor to bone loss.\n\n(Choice C) Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid (eg, prednisone) doses can cause osteoporosis, in part due to decreased proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast precursor cells. PTH increases the differentiation of osteoblast precursors: osteoporosis occurs in hyperparathyroidism because of a proportionally greater increase in osteoclast activity.\n\nEducational objective:\nParathyroid hormone directly stimulates osteoblasts, leading to increased bone formation. Expression of RANK-L on osteoblasts induces increased bone resorption via a paracrine effect on nearby osteoclasts. Hyperparathyroidism causes increased RANK-L expression and decreased expression of osteoprotegerin, leading to net bone loss.",
    "zh": "该患者患有甲状旁腺功能亢进症，表现为骨质疏松症和肾结石，伴有轻度高钙血症和不适当升高的甲状旁腺激素(PTH)水平。\n\nPTH通过刺激成骨细胞的分化和活性来增加骨转换，从而导致骨形成增加。此外，PTH上调活化成骨细胞表面核因子κB配体受体激活因子(RANK-L)的表达，RANK-L结合附近破骨细胞前体细胞上的RANK，诱导其成熟为活化的破骨细胞。因此，PTH引起骨形成（通过对成骨细胞的直接作用）和骨吸收（通过对破骨细胞的旁分泌作用）。骨转换通常是平衡的，骨形成与骨吸收成比例。\n\n在甲状旁腺功能亢进状态下，持续暴露于高水平PTH会导致RANK-L表达增加以及骨保护素（一种反向调节诱饵受体）的抑制。这导致骨吸收大于骨形成，并导致净骨丢失。\n\n（选项 A 和 D）PTH上调肾脏中的1-α-羟化酶，这导致25-羟维生素D（钙二醇）转化为1,25-二羟维生素D（骨化三醇）增加（而非减少）。骨化三醇随后诱导肠道钙吸收增加（而非减少）。\n\n（选项B）PTH增加肾脏对钙的重吸收。尽管如此，高钙尿症在甲状旁腺功能亢进症中很常见，因为滤过的钙负荷可能超过肾脏重吸收能力。然而，骨骼中钙的局部浓度仍然升高，尿钙丢失不是骨质流失的主要原因。\n\n（选项 C）超生理剂量的糖皮质激素（例如，泼尼松）会导致骨质疏松症，部分原因是成骨细胞前体细胞的增殖和分化减少。PTH增加成骨细胞前体的分化：甲状旁腺功能亢进症中发生骨质疏松症是因为破骨细胞活性的比例增加。\n\n教育目标：\n甲状旁腺激素直接刺激成骨细胞，导致骨形成增加。成骨细胞上RANK-L的表达通过对附近破骨细胞的旁分泌作用诱导骨吸收增加。甲状旁腺功能亢进症会导致RANK-L表达增加和骨保护素表达减少，从而导致净骨丢失。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of osteoporosis in the setting of hyperparathyroidism. It requires understanding the effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on bone remodeling and the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the elevated PTH level and hypercalcemia, indicating hyperparathyroidism. Then, recall that chronic PTH elevation leads to increased bone resorption due to increased RANK-L expression and decreased osteoprotegerin, resulting in net bone loss.",
