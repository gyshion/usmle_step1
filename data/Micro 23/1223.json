    "en": "This patient with HIV has fever, headache, vomiting, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis results consistent with tuberculous meningitis. Cultures reveal the isolate has reduced activity of intracellular catalase-peroxidase, indicating the organism is likely resistant to isoniazid (INH).\n\nINH inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acid, a crucial lipid component of the mycobacterial cell wall. Reductions in mycolic acid availability impair cell wall development, leading to a bactericidal effect. However, INH is only active once it is processed by mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase. Therefore, mycobacteria can limit the effect of INH by reducing intracellular levels of catalase-peroxidase. Other common mechanisms of INH resistance are alteration in the target enzyme binding site and overexpression of the target enzyme.\n\n(Choice A) Ethambutol likely inhibits synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall. Resistance develops when the mycobacteria increase production of arabinosyl transferase (an enzyme in the pathway to arabinogalactan, a key constituent of the mycobacterial cell wall).\n\n(Choice C) Because pyrazinamide must be converted to an active form by the mycobacterial enzyme pyrazinamidase, drug resistance can occur when pyrazinamidase is altered or eliminated.\n\n(Choice D) Resistance to rifampin is primarily due to a mutation in the gene that codes for a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase necessary for transcription and RNA elongation.\n\n(Choice E) Streptomycin (used in some patients with tuberculosis) is an aminoglycoside that inhibits mycobacterial protein synthesis by disabling the bacterial ribosomal 30S subunit (which disrupts translation). Resistance to this drug is primarily achieved by a modification of the ribosomal protein.\n\nEducational objective:\nMycobacterial resistance to isoniazid (INH) is primarily mediated by reductions in the catalase-peroxidase enzyme or through genetic modification of the INH binding site on the mycolic acid synthesis enzyme.",
    "zh": "这名HIV阳性患者出现发热、头痛、呕吐，脑脊液分析结果与结核性脑膜炎一致。培养结果显示分离株的细胞内过氧化氢酶活性降低，表明该病原体很可能对异烟肼（INH）耐药。\n\nINH抑制分枝杆菌细胞壁的关键脂质成分分枝菌酸的合成。分枝菌酸的供应减少会损害细胞壁的发育，从而导致杀菌作用。然而，INH只有经过分枝杆菌过氧化氢酶处理后才具有活性。因此，分枝杆菌可以通过降低细胞内过氧化氢酶的水平来限制INH的作用。其他常见的INH耐药机制是靶酶结合位点的改变和靶酶的过度表达。\n\n（选项A）乙胺丁醇可能抑制分枝杆菌细胞壁的合成。当分枝杆菌增加阿拉伯糖基转移酶（参与阿拉伯半乳聚糖，分枝杆菌细胞壁的关键成分的合成途径中的一种酶）的产生时，就会产生耐药性。\n\n（选项C）由于吡嗪酰胺必须被分枝杆菌酶吡嗪酰胺酶转化为活性形式，当吡嗪酰胺酶发生改变或被消除时，就会发生耐药性。\n\n（选项D）利福平的耐药性主要源于编码转录和RNA延伸所必需的DNA依赖性RNA聚合酶的基因突变。\n\n（选项E）链霉素（用于一些结核病患者）是一种氨基糖苷类药物，通过禁用细菌核糖体30S亚基（干扰翻译）来抑制分枝杆菌的蛋白质合成。这种药物的耐药性主要通过核糖体蛋白的修饰来实现。\n\n教育目标：\n分枝杆菌对异烟肼（INH）的耐药性主要由过氧化氢酶的减少或通过对分枝菌酸合成酶上INH结合位点的基因修饰介导。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of tuberculosis meningitis and mechanisms of drug resistance, specifically isoniazid resistance related to catalase-peroxidase activity. It requires understanding the pathogenesis of tuberculosis and how specific enzymes affect drug efficacy.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation suggestive of tuberculous meningitis, note the reduced catalase-peroxidase activity, and recall that isoniazid requires this enzyme for activation. This leads to the conclusion that the organism is likely resistant to isoniazid.",
