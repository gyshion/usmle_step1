    "en": "An 11-month-old boy is brought to the office by his mother for a well-child visit. The mother reports that he has been crying and screaming when other people approach him. She is concerned that it has been occurring for the past few months and that it seems to be worsening. She says, \"He used to love being held by everyone but now wants to be with only me. He won't even let his grandma hold him anymore.\" The patient is crawling and can stand only with assistance. He babbles but does not say any clear words and uses hand gestures to communicate. Growth curves are tracking adequately. On physical examination, the patient clings to his mother and begins crying, turning his head away from the physician when he attempts to interact with him.",

    "en": "This patient's distress at interacting with unfamiliar people is typical of STRANGER ANXIETY, a normal part of development that begins around age 6 MONTHS. It is characterized by distress (expressed by CRYING, SCREAMING, clinging) when UNFAMILIAR PEOPLE approach and occurs even in the presence of the caregiver. The development of stranger anxiety at this age indicates that the infant has made a specific attachment to the primary caregiver (mother) and is able to distinguish her from a strange or less familiar individual.\n\nStranger anxiety typically peaks around age 9 months and resolves on its own by 2 years of age. Adjustment disorders are diagnosed when the response to a stressor is greater than would be expected and associated with impairment (Choice A). Stranger anxiety is a NORMAL and expected developmental milestone.\n\n(Choice B) It is normal for an 11-month-old infant to avoid contact with a stranger if distressed. If an infant persistently shows poor eye contact, lacks joint attention, and has no response to being called by name at age 12-15 months, this may represent early signs of an autism spectrum disorder and should be evaluated further.\n\n(Choice D) Reactive attachment disorder occurs in children exposed to neglect and abuse and is characterized by decreased emotional responsiveness and lack of response to adult comfort. This infant appears to be appropriately attached to his mother.\n\n(Choice E) Separation anxiety disorder is diagnosed in children who exhibit persistent and disabling anxiety about losing attachment figures at separation. It usually develops in childhood rather than infancy, typically in association with starting school. Stranger anxiety, in contrast to separation anxiety, occurs even when the caregiver is present.\n\nEducational objective: Stranger anxiety, which presents as crying or screaming when unfamiliar people approach, is a normal and expected part of childhood development. It typically begins around age 6 months and resolves by 2 years of age.",
    "zh": "该患者与不熟悉的人互动时的痛苦是典型地表现为生人焦虑，这是发育的正常部分，大约在6个月大时开始。它的特征是在不熟悉的人接近时表现出痛苦（表现为哭泣、尖叫、依偎），即使在看护人的存在下也会发生。在这个年龄出现生人焦虑表明婴儿已经与主要的看护人（母亲）建立了特定的依恋关系，并且能够将她与陌生或不太熟悉的人区分开来。\n\n生人焦虑通常在9个月大左右达到高峰，并在2岁时自行缓解。当对压力源的反应大于预期并伴有损害时，会被诊断为适应障碍（选项 A）。生人焦虑是一个正常且预期的发育里程碑。\n\n（选项 B）11个月大的婴儿如果感到痛苦，避免与陌生人接触是正常的。如果婴儿持续表现出目光接触不良、缺乏共同关注，并且在12-15个月大时对被称为名字没有反应，这可能代表自闭症谱系障碍的早期迹象，应进一步评估。\n\n（选项 D）反应性依恋障碍发生在遭受忽视和虐待的儿童中，其特征是情绪反应降低，对成人安慰缺乏反应。这个婴儿似乎适当地依恋着他的母亲。\n\n（选项 E）分离焦虑症被诊断为在分离时表现出持续且使人衰弱的焦虑，担心失去依恋对象的儿童。它通常在儿童时期而不是婴儿期发展，通常与开始上学有关。与分离焦虑相反，生人焦虑即使在看护人出现时也会发生。\n\n教育目标：当不熟悉的人接近时，表现为哭泣或尖叫的生人焦虑是儿童发育的正常且预期的部分。它通常在6个月左右开始，并在2岁时缓解。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of normal developmental milestones in infants, specifically stranger anxiety, and the ability to differentiate it from various childhood disorders.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully evaluating the patient's age, reported behaviors, and physical examination findings in the context of typical developmental progression, and then comparing these to the diagnostic criteria for the provided differential diagnoses.",
