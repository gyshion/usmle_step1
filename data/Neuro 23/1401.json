    "en": "A 40-year-old woman is evaluated for neck pain that has gradually worsened over the past several months. The patient reports a pulling sensation in her neck that causes difficulty in keeping her head straight. She has no history of neck trauma and has no other medical conditions. Physical examination shows a spastic and thickened sternocleidomastoid muscle causing head tilt. The patient is diagnosed with idiopathic torticollis. She is treated with injections of a bacterial product into the affected muscle, with significant relief of symptoms. The substance administered to this patient is derived from bacteria that most likely demonstrate which of the following characteristics?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Clostridium botulinum is a gram-positive, anaerobic bacillus that synthesizes botulinum toxin, an exotoxin that prevents presynaptic release of acetylcholine from the nerve terminal at the neuromuscular junction. This prevents both nicotinic and muscarinic activation, leading to skeletal muscle weakness and reduced glandular secretions, respectively. Foodborne botulism is a result of toxin ingestion and is characterized by cranial nerve deficits and descending symmetric paralysis. Spore formation, which occurs in the subterminal location (in between the middle and end of the cell), allows the bacteria to survive adverse conditions (eg, heat, high-oxygen environment). Focal dystonia is a localized, uncontrollable muscle contraction that can lead to pain and physical deformity. \nTorticollis is a common manifestation of dystonia and is due to involvement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Injection of botulinum toxin type B into the dystonic muscle results in muscular relaxation and relief of symptoms. Botulinum toxin can also be used to treat the muscle spasms of multiple sclerosis and Parkinson disease, to relax the lower esophageal sphincter in achalasia, and to reduce the appearance of facial wrinkles. The localized anticholinergic effect also makes it useful in the treatment of hyperhidrosis. Effects are temporary (approximately 3 months) due to the regeneration of the nerve terminal with time. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Hypervariable pili are characteristic of Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; antigenic heterogeneity aids in immune evasion and allows for repeat infections.\n\n(Choice B) The antiphagocytic capsule is a primary virulence factor for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis.\n\n(Choice C) Some obligate intracellular organisms (eg, Chlamydia, mycobacteria) reproduce by forming small, metabolically inactive elementary bodies that are phagocytized by host cells. Once inside, they evolve to the metabolically active reticulate body.\n\n(Choice D) Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) is a major virulence factor of gram-negative bacteria (eg, Escherichia coli). Endotoxin is released with destruction of the bacterial cell wall (eg, antibiotics) or during cell division, in contrast to exotoxins which are often secreted (some exotoxins are release by bacterial lysis). Clostridium species are gram-positive.",
    "zh": "肉毒梭菌是一种革兰氏阳性、厌氧杆菌，合成肉毒杆菌毒素，这是一种外毒素，可阻止神经肌肉接头处神经末梢释放乙酰胆碱。这会分别阻止烟碱型和毒蕈碱型受体激活，导致骨骼肌无力和腺体分泌减少。食源性肉毒中毒是摄入毒素的结果，其特征是脑神经功能障碍和下行对称性麻痹。孢子形成发生在亚末端位置（在细胞的中部和末端之间），这使得细菌能够在不利条件下（例如，高温、高氧环境）生存。局灶性肌张力障碍是一种局部的、不受控制的肌肉收缩，可导致疼痛和身体畸形。\n斜颈是肌张力障碍的常见表现，是由于胸锁乳突肌受累所致。将肉毒杆菌毒素B型注射到肌张力障碍肌肉中会导致肌肉松弛和症状缓解。肉毒杆菌毒素也可用于治疗多发性硬化症和帕金森病的肌肉痉挛，松弛贲门失弛缓症的下食管括约肌，并减少面部皱纹的出现。局部抗胆碱能作用也使其可用于治疗多汗症。由于神经末梢随时间再生，其作用是暂时的（约3个月）。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项A）高度可变菌毛是脑膜炎奈瑟菌和淋病奈瑟菌的特征；抗原异质性有助于免疫逃避并允许重复感染。\n\n（选项B）抗吞噬荚膜是肺炎链球菌、流感嗜血杆菌、肺炎克雷伯菌和脑膜炎奈瑟菌的主要毒力因子。\n\n（选项C）一些专性细胞内生物体（例如，衣原体、分枝杆菌）通过形成小的、代谢失活的原体进行繁殖，这些原体被宿主细胞吞噬。进入细胞后，它们演变成代谢活性的网状体。\n\n（选项D）内毒素（脂多糖）是革兰氏阴性细菌（例如，大肠杆菌）的主要毒力因子。内毒素在细菌细胞壁破坏（例如，抗生素）或细胞分裂期间释放，这与通常分泌的外毒素（一些外毒素通过细菌裂解释放）形成对比。梭菌属是革兰氏阳性。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Clostridium botulinum, its mechanism of action via botulinum toxin, and its clinical applications in treating conditions like torticollis. It also requires understanding of bacterial characteristics like spore formation.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that botulinum toxin is used to treat torticollis. Recall that Clostridium botulinum is a spore-forming bacterium, specifically forming subterminal spores, which is crucial for its survival and toxin production.",
