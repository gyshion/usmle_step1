    "en": "A 31-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a tonic-clonic seizure. The patient has no known medical conditions. He grew up in a rural part of Guatemala and immigrated to the United States 3 years ago. The patient works as an architect and owns a cat. He has no history of tuberculosis. On examination, the patient is afebrile and has no focal neurologic deficits or meningeal signs. HIV antibody test and interferon-gamma release assay are negative. Chest x-ray is normal. MRI of the head reveals a 1.5-cm cyst within the left sylvian fissure that has minimal enhancement and no associated edema. Which of the following is the most likely means of acquisition of the infection responsible for this patient's findings?",

    "en": "This patient from Guatemala with an adult-onset seizure and a cystic brain lesion likely has neurocysticercosis (NCC), an infection caused by Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) eggs. Although rare in the United States, T solium is endemic to rural areas of resource-poor nations (eg, Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Asia) where sanitation is poor and pigs roam freely.\n\nT solium causes 2 distinct infections in humans, as follows:\n\nTapworm infection occurs when humans ingest T solium larvae in undercooked pork. The larvae mature into adult worms in the digestive tract and secrete eggs into stool.\nCysticercosis occurs when humans ingest T solium eggs in feces-contaminated food or water. The eggs hatch into embryos in the gastrointestinal tract, invade the bowel wall, migrate through the bloodstream, and lodge in tissue (eg, brain, muscle, liver). In tissue, the embryos form cysticerci, fluid-filled larval cysts with an invaginated scolex (head of tapeworm with hooklets). Over months or years, the cysts degenerate, leading to inflammation, edema, and symptoms (eg, seizure).\n(Choice A) Strongyloides stercoralis is usually transmitted to humans when filariform larvae penetrate the skin of the feet. Manifestations include eosinophilia and gastrointestinal disease (among immunocompetent individuals) or hyperinfection (typically among immunocompromised patients). Brain cysts would be atypical.\n\n(Choice C) Cat feces may contain Toxoplasma gondii. Immunocompromised patients, particularly those with AIDS, can develop cerebral toxoplasmosis. However, this is marked by multiple ring-enhancing lesions, not a cystic lesion with minimal enhancement. In addition, toxoplasmosis is unlikely in this patient with negative HIV testing.\n\n(Choice D) Endemic dimorphic mycoses (eg, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis) are often transmitted by spore inhalation. However, neurologic manifestations are rare and would be very uncommon in the absence of pulmonary abnormalities.\n\n(Choice E) Catscratch disease, caused by Bartonella henselae, is most often associated with localized skin/soft tissue infection and proximal lymphadenitis.\n\n(Choice F) Herpes encephalitis may present with seizures, but patients are usually febrile, and imaging typically reveals temporal lobe edema or hemorrhage. Syphilis can present with neurologic manifestations, including meningitis, cranial nerve palsies, and tabes dorsalis. However, seizures and a cystic brain lesion in a patient from rural Guatemala are more suggestive of neurocysticercosis.\n\nEducational objective:\nNeurocysticercosis is a common cause of adult-onset seizures in patients from rural developing regions. Suspicion should be raised when brain imaging in these individuals shows cystic or calcified lesions.",
    "zh": "这位来自危地马拉的患者，出现成人起病的癫痫发作和脑部囊性病变，可能患有神经囊尾蚴病（NCC），这是一种由猪带绦虫（Taenia solium）卵引起的感染。虽然在美国很少见，但T. solium在卫生条件差且猪随意游荡的资源匮乏国家的农村地区（例如，中美洲和南美洲、撒哈拉以南非洲、亚洲）流行。\n\nT. solium在人类中引起2种不同的感染，如下：\n\n绦虫感染发生在人类摄入未煮熟的猪肉中的T. solium幼虫时。幼虫在消化道中成熟为成虫，并将虫卵分泌到粪便中。\n囊尾蚴病发生在人类摄入被粪便污染的食物或水中的T. solium卵时。卵在胃肠道中孵化成胚胎，侵入肠壁，通过血液循环迁移，并寄生在组织中（例如，大脑、肌肉、肝脏）。在组织中，胚胎形成囊尾蚴，即充满液体的幼虫囊肿，具有内陷的头节（带绦虫的头部，带有小钩）。数月或数年后，囊肿退化，导致炎症、水肿和症状（例如，癫痫发作）。\n（选项A）粪类圆线虫通常通过丝状幼虫穿透足部皮肤传播给人类。表现包括嗜酸性粒细胞增多症和胃肠道疾病（在免疫功能正常的个体中）或超级感染（通常在免疫功能低下患者中）。脑囊肿是不典型的。\n\n（选项C）猫粪便可能含有弓形虫。免疫功能低下的患者，特别是那些患有艾滋病的人，可能会发生脑弓形虫病。然而，这种疾病的特征是多发环形增强病灶，而不是轻度增强的囊性病灶。此外，该患者HIV检测结果阴性，不太可能患有弓形虫病。\n\n（选项D）地方性二态性真菌病（例如，组织胞浆菌病、芽生菌病）通常通过吸入孢子传播。然而，神经系统表现很少见，并且在没有肺部异常的情况下非常罕见。\n\n（选项E）猫抓病，由汉赛巴尔通体引起，最常与局部皮肤/软组织感染和近端淋巴结炎相关。\n\n（选项F）单纯疱疹脑炎可能表现为癫痫发作，但患者通常会发烧，影像学检查通常显示颞叶水肿或出血。梅毒可表现为神经系统表现，包括脑膜炎、颅神经麻痹和脊髓痨。然而，来自危地马拉农村地区的患者出现癫痫发作和脑部囊性病变，更提示神经囊尾蚴病。\n\n教育目标：\n神经囊尾蚴病是来自农村发展中地区的患者发生成人起病的癫痫发作的常见原因。当这些个体的脑部影像学检查显示囊性或钙化病灶时，应引起怀疑。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of neurocysticercosis, its etiology (Taenia solium), and the most common mode of transmission. It also requires differentiating neurocysticercosis from other causes of brain lesions. \n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's origin (Guatemala), the MRI findings (cystic lesion), and the negative HIV test.
