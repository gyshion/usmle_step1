    "en": "A 23-year-old man comes to the office with a 2-week history of malaise, loss of appetite, and vague abdominal pain. The patient has had no nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel habits, dysuria, urinary frequency, or hematuria. He had an appendectomy for acute appendicitis at age 15; medical history is otherwise unremarkable. The patient does not use tobacco or alcohol and has had no recent travel. Physical examination reveals normal bowel sounds and no guarding or rebound tenderness. Abdominal CT scan obtained as part of this patient's evaluation is shown in the image below: {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "The arrow on this patient's abdominal CT scan is pointing to the spleen, a large, wedge-shaped lymphatic organ in the left posterosuperior aspect of the abdominal cavity. By convention, CT scans are presented such that the patient's left is on the reader's right (imagine that the patient is supine with the feet directed toward the viewer).\n\nMost intraabdominal organs are derived from the endoderm and include the small and large intestines, liver, and pancreas (Choice B). However, the spleen is unique because it is derived from condensed mesenchymal tissue in the dorsal mesentery. Mesenchymal tissue arises from the mesoderm and is characterized by loosely associated cells surrounded by the extracellular matrix.\n\nOther derivatives of the mesoderm include muscle (skeletal, cardiac, smooth), bone, and kidney.\n\n(Choice A) The adrenal cortex is derived from the mesoderm, similar to the spleen. In contrast, the adrenal medulla arises from neural crest cells (derived from the ectoderm).\n\n(Choice C) Salivary glands are derived from the surface ectoderm.\n\n(Choice E) The thymus is derived from the endoderm.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe spleen is a large, wedge-shaped lymphatic organ in the left posterosuperior aspect of the abdominal cavity. In contrast to the endodermal origin of most other abdominal organs, the spleen is derived from the mesoderm in the dorsal mesentery. Other mesoderm-derived tissues include muscle, bone, and kidney.\n\n{{exhibit_2}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of embryological origins of different tissues and organs, specifically the spleen and its mesodermal origin.
