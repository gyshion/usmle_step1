    "en": "In order to answer this question, you must be able to recognize the characteristic histology, {{exhibit_2}}The two mirror-image nuclei of RS cells are often described as having the appearance of \"owl's eyes.\" \n\n(Choice A) The respiratory epithelium is a pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium that extends down to the level of the bronchioles. At the bronchioles, the epithelium gradually becomes cuboidal and then transitions to a flat, single-celled alveolar lining of Type I pneumocytes.\n\n(Choice B) A goiter may cause neck swelling. Histologically, Hashimoto thyroiditis has the appearance of lymphocytes infiltrating between thyroid follicles.\n\n(Choice D) Reed-Sternberg cells are not associated with leukemia. The classic finding in patients with leukemia is a peripheral blood smear with leukemic cells, leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia.\n\n(Choice E) Both melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma can metastasize from the skin causing lymphadenopathy. The cells on this tissue biopsy show no evidence of squamous or melanocytic differentiation, however.\n\nEducational Objective:\nReed-Sternberg cells are large binucleated cells with an \"owl's eyes\" appearance that appear on a background of lymphocytic infiltrates. Reed-Sternberg cells must be present histopathologically in order to make the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma.",
    "zh": "为了回答这个问题，你必须能够识别特征性组织学，{{exhibit_2}} RS细胞的两个镜像核通常被描述为具有“猫头鹰眼”的外观。\n\n(选项 A) 呼吸道上皮是一种假复层柱状纤毛上皮，延伸至细支气管水平。在细支气管处，上皮逐渐变为立方状，然后过渡到I型肺细胞的扁平、单细胞肺泡内壁。\n\n(选项 B) 甲状腺肿可能导致颈部肿胀。从组织学上看，桥本甲状腺炎的特征是在甲状腺滤泡之间浸润的淋巴细胞。\n\n(选项 D) Reed-Sternberg 细胞与白血病无关。白血病患者的经典发现是外周血涂片显示白血病细胞、白细胞增多和血小板减少。\n\n(选项 E) 黑色素瘤和鳞状细胞癌均可从皮肤转移，导致淋巴结病。然而，该组织活检中的细胞未显示鳞状或黑色素细胞分化的证据。\n\n教育目标：\nReed-Sternberg 细胞是大的双核细胞，具有“猫头鹰眼”外观，出现在淋巴细胞浸润的背景中。必须存在 Reed-Sternberg 细胞组织病理学上才能诊断霍奇金淋巴瘤。"
