  "explanation": {
    "en": "Lead-time bias should always be considered when evaluating any screening test. Lead-time bias is an apparent increase in survival time among patients undergoing screening when they actually have an unchanged prognosis. Patients screened with more sensitive tests may appear to live longer only because the disease was detected earlier than had it been diagnosed clinically. The overall length of time from disease onset to death actually remains the same with or without the earlier screening. To determine the actual effectiveness of the screening program, it is necessary to follow up patients for periods that are longer than the apparent increase in survival time, and then to estimate and compare mortality rates among patients who have undergone the additional screening and those who have not.\n\nIn this case, patients screened by the new test appeared to have increased their survival time by 3 months when compared to those diagnosed by conventional methods. However, there was no difference in 6-month mortality rate between the 2 groups, which indicates that there is no actual benefit to the screening program.\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Confounding distorts the relationship between risk factors and the disease of interest, and can wholly or partially account for the observed effect. Although the results of this study could be potentially confounded, there is no information on how potential confounders were treated during the design or analysis stage of the study.\n\n(Choice C) Length-time bias occurs when subjects with a rapidly progressive form of disease are less likely to be detected by screening compared to those with slowly progressive disease. This bias tends to overstate the beneficial effects of screening on length of survival and mortality. In this case, there is no indication that the patients identified by the new test have more benign forms of lung cancer.\n\n(Choices D and E) Measurement bias and observer bias refer to the misclassification of outcome and/or exposure (eg, labeling diseased as non-diseased and vice versa) and are related to poor study design. The scenario described does not mention how the study was conducted.\n\n(Choice F) Rare disease assumption refers to the practice of approximating the odds ratio and relative risk when conducting a case-control study for rare diseases. According to the assumption, the odds ratio approximates relative risk when disease incidence is low (eg, <10%).\n\nEducational objective:\nLead-time bias occurs when a new test diagnoses a condition earlier than conventional studies, causing an apparent increase in survival time despite no improvement in overall mortality. Long-term mortality rates, not survival times, should be considered for measuring the effect of early screening and treatment.",
    "zh": "在评估任何筛查试验时，应始终考虑提前期偏倚。提前期偏倚是指接受筛查的患者的生存时间出现明显增加，而实际上他们的预后没有改变。使用更敏感的测试进行筛查的患者可能看起来活得更长，这仅仅是因为疾病被比临床诊断更早地检测出来。从疾病发作到死亡的总时间实际上在有或没有早期筛查的情况下保持不变。为了确定筛查方案的实际有效性，有必要对患者进行比生存时间明显增加更长的时间随访，然后估计和比较接受额外筛查的患者与未接受筛查的患者的死亡率。\n\n在这种情况下，与通过传统方法诊断的患者相比，通过新测试筛查的患者似乎将他们的生存时间增加了 3 个月。然而，两组之间的 6 个月死亡率没有差异，这表明筛查方案实际上没有任何益处。\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项 A）混杂会扭曲风险因素与感兴趣疾病之间的关系，并且可以完全或部分解释观察到的影响。虽然这项研究的结果可能存在混杂，但在研究的设计或分析阶段，没有关于如何处理潜在混杂因素的信息。\n\n（选项 C）当患有快速进展型疾病的受试者比患有缓慢进展型疾病的受试者更不可能通过筛查被检测到时，就会发生长度时间偏倚。这种偏倚倾向于高估筛查对生存时间和死亡率的益处。在这种情况下，没有迹象表明通过新测试识别的患者患有更良性的肺癌。\n\n（选项 D 和 E）测量偏倚和观察者偏倚是指结果和/或暴露的错误分类（例如，将患病者标记为未患病者，反之亦然），这与不良的研究设计有关。所描述的情况没有提及研究是如何进行的。\n\n（选项 F）罕见疾病假设是指在对罕见疾病进行病例对照研究时，估算优势比和相对风险的做法。根据该假设，当疾病发病率较低（例如，<10%）时，优势比近似于相对风险。\n\n教育目标：\n当新测试比传统研究更早地诊断出一种疾病时，就会发生提前期偏倚，导致生存时间明显增加，尽管总死亡率没有改善。对于衡量早期筛查和治疗的效果，应考虑长期死亡率，而不是生存时间。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of lead-time bias, a common pitfall in interpreting the results of screening programs. It assesses the ability to recognize how earlier detection of a disease can falsely appear to prolong survival without actually changing the underlying course of the illness.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the discrepancy between the increased survival time and the unchanged mortality rates. Recognizing that the new test allows for earlier detection, consider how this might affect the perceived survival duration even if the disease progresses at the same rate.",
