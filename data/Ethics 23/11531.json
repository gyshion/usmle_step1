  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Nearly 20% of the United States population speaks languages other than English at home. It is therefore essential that physicians assess language proficiency when delivering care to immigrant populations. This patient's immigrant background and difficulty describing her pain should raise concern about limited English proficiency (LEP) and the need for a qualified medical interpreter. In the United States, patients with LEP experience a variety of health care disparities, including reduced clinical encounter time, substandard medical treatment, and higher rates of adverse events and preventable medical errors. The safety of LEP patients is particularly jeopardized in high-risk clinical situations such as emergency department care, surgical care, hospital discharge, and medical reconciliation.\n\nA useful screening technique to assess language proficiency is to ask the patient, \"How well do you speak English: Not at all, not well, well, or very well?\" An interpreter is appropriate for patients who cannot respond or respond \"not well.\" Recommended interventions to prevent adverse events include providing a qualified medical interpreter in high-risk clinical situations and providing translated educational materials. Using the \"teach back\" method (in which patients are asked to \"teach\" the physician what was just explained to them) can also serve to confirm understanding.\n\n(Choices A, B, and C) Understanding cultural and social factors and sensitivity in obtaining a sexual history are important components of patient-centered care. However, addressing a potential language barrier takes precedence.\n\n(Choice D) Contacting the patient's family is unlikely to be productive and may violate patient confidentiality.\n\nEducational objective:\nPhysicians must be able to identify patients with limited English proficiency and ensure that professional interpreters are made available in high-risk clinical situations.",
    "zh": "将近20%的美国人口在家中说英语以外的语言。因此，医生在向移民人群提供护理时评估语言能力至关重要。该患者的移民背景以及难以描述疼痛的情况应引起对英语水平有限（LEP）以及需要合格的医疗翻译的关注。在美国，LEP患者会经历各种医疗保健差异，包括减少的临床接触时间、不合格的医疗、以及更高的不良事件和可预防的医疗差错发生率。LEP患者的安全在急诊科护理、外科护理、出院和医疗调解等高风险临床情况下尤其受到威胁。\n\n评估语言能力的一种有用的筛查技术是询问患者：“您的英语说得怎么样：一点都不会，不太好，好，还是非常好？”对于无法回答或回答“不太好”的患者，需要配备翻译。推荐的干预措施包括在高风险临床情况下提供合格的医疗翻译，以及提供翻译的教育材料。使用“回教”方法（要求患者“教”医生刚刚向他们解释的内容）也可以用来确认理解。\n\n（选项A、B和C）了解文化和社会因素以及在获取性病史时的敏感性是患者中心护理的重要组成部分。然而，解决潜在的语言障碍更重要。\n\n（选项D）联系患者的家人不太可能富有成效，并且可能侵犯患者的保密性。\n\n教育目标：\n医生必须能够识别英语水平有限的患者，并确保在高风险临床情况下提供专业的翻译。"
