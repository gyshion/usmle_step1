    "en": "A 34-year-old man is being evaluated for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Two days ago, the patient was brought to the emergency department due to opioid and alcohol intoxication. While unconscious, he vomited profusely and then rapidly developed hypoxia and shortness of breath that has continued to worsen. Today, temperature is 38.4 C (101.1 F), blood pressure is 108/74 mm Hg, pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 26/min. Diffuse crackles are heard on auscultation. The extremities are warm, well perfused, and without edema. Chest x-ray reveals bilateral alveolar opacities. The results of arterial blood gas analysis on room air are as follows:\n\npH 7.25\nPartial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood 28 mm Hg\nPartial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood 52 mm Hg",

    "en": "This patient has acute hypoxemic respiratory failure following an episode of emesis while unconscious. He most likely developed ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS) due to the aspiration of gastric contents.\n\nAlveolar epithelial damage (eg, by gastric hydrochloric acid) causes release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (eg, mitochondrial DNA, extracellular histones) into the extracellular space. These DAMPs bind to pattern recognition receptors on innate immune cells, promoting the release of proinflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1, IL-6) that recruit neutrophils to the alveoli. The activated neutrophils then release proteases and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that further damage the alveolar membrane.\n\nThe cascade of lung damage leads to failure of alveolar tight junctions and exudation of fibrinous proteinaceous fluid into the airspaces, resulting in pulmonary edema. Therefore, the origin of pulmonary edema in ARDS is abnormal vascular permeability rather than hydrostatic congestion due to left ventricular dysfunction (ie, noncardiogenic). Surfactant is depleted and dysfunctional, leading to alveolar collapse (increased surface tension causes alveolar walls to cling together), further impairing lung inflation. The flooding and collapse of alveoli produce diffuse crackles on lung auscultation and bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray {{exhibit_1}}.\n\nSeveral important clinical entities can mimic ARDS: diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), and acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). Like ARDS, these conditions present with acute severe hypoxemia, diffuse bilateral infiltrates, and fever. However, the pathophysiologic bases of these conditions are fundamentally different from that of ARDS.\n\n(Choice A) DAH is characterized by widespread alveolar bleeding due typically to small-vessel vasculitis, which can be driven by autoantibodies (eg, against basement membrane collagen [anti-GBM disease]) causing pulmonary capillary necrosis with subsequent hemorrhage. ARDS is an innate immune response driven primarily by neutrophils rather than autoantibodies.\n\n(Choice B) AEP is an idiopathic form of pneumonia caused by eosinophilic invasion of the lung tissue, often with hyaline membranes, a nonspecific finding of inflammatory fibrinous edema. ARDS also features prominent hyaline membranes, but the inflammation is driven by neutrophils rather than eosinophils.\n\n(Choice C) HP is characterized by lymphocyte-driven granuloma formation in response to extrinsic antigens (eg, mold, bird dander). ARDS is characterized by neutrophilic, rather than granulomatous, inflammation.\n\nEducational objective:\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome involves acute neutrophilic lung inflammation with widespread alveolar damage due to proteases and reactive oxygen species, leading to failure of the vascular barrier and exudative pulmonary edema.",
    "zh": "该患者在失去意识时发生呕吐后出现急性低氧血症性呼吸衰竭。他很可能由于吸入胃内容物而发展为急性呼吸窘迫综合征（ARDS）。\n\n肺泡上皮损伤（例如，由胃盐酸引起）导致损伤相关分子模式（DAMPs）（例如，线粒体DNA、细胞外组蛋白）释放到细胞外空间。这些DAMPs与固有免疫细胞上的模式识别受体结合，促进促炎细胞因子（例如，肿瘤坏死因子-α、IL-1、IL-6）的释放，这些细胞因子将中性粒细胞募集到肺泡。活化的中性粒细胞随后释放蛋白酶和活性氧（ROS），进一步损伤肺泡膜。\n\n肺损伤的级联反应导致肺泡紧密连接失效，并将纤维蛋白性蛋白性液体渗出到气腔中，从而导致肺水肿。因此，ARDS中肺水肿的起源是血管通透性异常，而不是由于左心室功能障碍（即，非心源性）引起的静水压性充血。表面活性物耗尽和功能失调，导致肺泡塌陷（表面张力增加导致肺泡壁粘在一起），进一步损害肺膨胀。肺泡的充盈和塌陷导致肺部听诊时出现弥漫性爆裂音，胸部X光片上出现双侧浸润{{exhibit_1}}。\n\n一些重要的临床实体可以模仿ARDS：弥漫性肺泡出血（DAH）、急性嗜酸性粒细胞性肺炎（AEP）和急性超敏性肺炎（HP）。与ARDS一样，这些疾病表现为急性严重低氧血症、弥漫性双侧浸润和发热。然而，这些疾病的病理生理学基础与ARDS的基本不同。\n\n（选项A）DAH的特征是广泛的肺泡出血，这通常是由于小血管炎，可能由自身抗体（例如，针对基底膜胶原[抗GBM疾病]）驱动，导致肺毛细血管坏死，随后出血。ARDS是一种主要由中性粒细胞驱动的先天免疫反应，而不是自身抗体。\n\n（选项B）AEP是一种特发性肺炎，由嗜酸性粒细胞浸润肺组织引起，常伴有透明膜，这是炎症性纤维蛋白性水肿的非特异性发现。ARDS也具有显着的透明膜，但炎症是由中性粒细胞而不是嗜酸性粒细胞驱动的。\n\n（选项C）HP的特征是淋巴细胞驱动的肉芽肿形成，以响应外源性抗原（例如，霉菌、鸟类皮屑）。ARDS的特征是中性粒细胞性炎症，而不是肉芽肿性炎症。\n\n教育目标：\n急性呼吸窘迫综合征涉及急性中性粒细胞性肺部炎症，伴有广泛的肺泡损伤，这是由于蛋白酶和活性氧引起的，导致血管屏障的破坏和渗出性肺水肿。"
