  "explanation": {
    "en": "Medicare is a federal socialized medical insurance program that covers select individuals. It provides health insurance for patients age 65 and older who have worked and paid into the system (ie, have paid taxes). Individuals must also hold residence and citizenship in the United States. Medicare also covers younger individuals with disabilities, end-stage renal disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Medicare consists of several parts, with Part A covering inpatient hospital visits, Part B covering a select number of outpatient services and medical devices, Part C as an optional capitated plan with additional benefits (vision, dental), and Part D as an optional prescription drug plan. Medicare is different from Medicaid, a state-run medical insurance program that covers the homeless, undocumented immigrants, pregnant women, and low-income families.\n\nIn this situation, only the disabled son would be eligible for Medicare.\n\n(Choices A, B, C, and E) The pregnant woman, her boyfriend, and the child (when born) can be covered by Medicaid only, not Medicare.",
    "zh": "医疗保险（Medicare）是一项联邦社会医疗保险计划，涵盖特定人群。它为65岁及以上、已工作并向该系统缴纳过保费（即已纳税）的患者提供健康保险。个人还必须是美国的居民和公民。医疗保险还涵盖患有残疾、终末期肾病或肌萎缩侧索硬化症的年轻人。医疗保险包括几个部分，A部分涵盖住院病人就诊，B部分涵盖部分门诊服务和医疗设备，C部分作为一项可选的按人头付费计划，提供额外的福利（视力、牙科），D部分作为一项可选的处方药计划。医疗保险与医疗补助（Medicaid）不同，医疗补助是一项由州政府运营的医疗保险计划，涵盖无家可归者、无证移民、孕妇和低收入家庭。\n\n在这种情况下，只有残疾儿子才有资格获得医疗保险。\n\n（选项A、B、C和E）孕妇、她的男友和孩子（出生后）只能由医疗补助（Medicaid）承保，而不是医疗保险（Medicare）。"
