    "en": "Most patients infected with HIV develop mononucleosis-like symptoms (eg, fever, diffuse lymphadenopathy, malaise, myalgia, sore throat, and headache) 2-4 weeks after inoculation (ACUTE RETROVIRAL SYNDROME). The presence of OROPHARYNGEAL ULCERS and a diffuse MACULOPAPULAR RASH are important diagnostic clues.\n\nAcute retroviral syndrome is associated with extremely HIGH LEVELS OF VIRAL REPLICATION (~5 million copies/mL) as the cell-mediated and humoral antibody response against the virus is not yet fully activated. Therefore, laboratory results during this period usually show evidence of HIV in the plasma (positive viral load and p24 antigen) with a NEGATIVE SEROLOGIC RESPONSE (negative HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody). This is referred to as the \"WINDOW PERIOD,\" as patients are infected with HIV but HIV antibody screening tests may be negative (newer screening tests incorporate testing for HIV p24 antigen and are more sensitive in early infection).\n\nThe humoral response to HIV typically develops 6-8 weeks after initial infection. At this time, anti-HIV antibodies in the serum neutralize circulating virus, which reduces viral load and leads to resolution of acute retroviral symptoms. Most patients then enter a long asymptomatic period until diminished CD4 counts open the door to opportunistic infections.\n\n(Choice B) Antibodies against HIV surface glycoproteins (eg, gp120) help neutralize circulating virus and reduce viral load. However, HIV surface glycoproteins display a high degree of antigenic variation, which prevents the formation of a completely effective antibody response.\n\n(Choices C and E) Patients with HIV develop immunosuppression primarily due to impairments in the cell-mediated immune response. Although the humoral immune response is also impaired, patients are able to generate anti-HIV antibodies that partially neutralize the virus. It is very rare that a patient with HIV will be too immunodeficient to seroconvert.\n\n(Choice D) Acute retroviral syndrome is marked by an extremely high rate of viral replication. Although antibodies eventually form, the response is delayed because the humoral immune response takes several weeks to fully develop.\n\nEducational objective:\nInitial HIV infection is often associated with mononucleosis-like symptoms (eg, fever, lymphadenopathy, sore throat) 2-4 weeks after transmission. Important diagnostic clues are oropharyngeal ulcers and a diffuse maculopapular rash. As the humoral antibody response is not fully activated early in infection, laboratory results typically show HIV in the serum (positive viral load and p24 antigen) but negative HIV serology.",
    "zh": "大多数HIV感染患者在接种后2-4周出现单核细胞增多症样症状（例如，发热、弥漫性淋巴结病、不适、肌痛、咽喉痛和头痛）（急性逆转录病毒综合征）。口咽溃疡和弥漫性斑丘疹皮疹的存在是重要的诊断线索。\n\n急性逆转录病毒综合征与极高水平的病毒复制（约500万拷贝/mL）相关，因为针对该病毒的细胞介导和体液抗体反应尚未完全激活。因此，此期间的实验室结果通常显示血浆中存在HIV的证据（病毒载量和p24抗原阳性），但血清学反应阴性（HIV-1/HIV-2抗体阴性）。这被称为“窗口期”，因为患者已感染HIV，但HIV抗体筛查检测可能为阴性（较新的筛查检测包含HIV p24抗原检测，在早期感染中更敏感）。\n\n针对HIV的体液反应通常在初次感染后6-8周出现。此时，血清中的抗HIV抗体中和循环病毒，从而降低病毒载量并导致急性逆转录病毒症状消退。然后，大多数患者进入一个长的无症状期，直到CD4计数降低为机会性感染打开了大门。\n\n（选项B）针对HIV表面糖蛋白（例如，gp120）的抗体有助于中和循环病毒并降低病毒载量。然而，HIV表面糖蛋白表现出高度的抗原变异性，这阻碍了完全有效的抗体反应的形成。\n\n（选项C和E）HIV感染患者发生免疫抑制，这主要是由于细胞介导的免疫反应受损。尽管体液免疫反应也受损，但患者能够产生部分中和病毒的抗HIV抗体。HIV感染患者免疫缺陷到无法血清转化的可能性很小。\n\n（选项D）急性逆转录病毒综合征的特点是病毒复制率极高。尽管抗体最终形成，但由于体液免疫反应需要几周才能完全发展，因此反应会延迟。\n\n教学目标：\n初始HIV感染通常与单核细胞增多症样症状（例如，发热、淋巴结病、咽喉痛）有关，这些症状在传播后2-4周出现。重要的诊断线索是口咽溃疡和弥漫性斑丘疹皮疹。由于在感染早期，体液抗体反应尚未完全激活，实验室结果通常显示血清中存在HIV（病毒载量和p24抗原阳性），但HIV血清学检测阴性。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of HIV infection, specifically the acute retroviral syndrome and the interpretation of early HIV testing results during the window period. It assesses the understanding of the time course of viral replication and antibody development in early HIV infection. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the clinical presentation suggestive of acute retroviral syndrome and correlating it with the laboratory findings of positive HIV RNA and p24 antigen, but negative HIV antibody. This indicates a very early stage of infection before seroconversion.",
