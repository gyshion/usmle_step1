    "en": "A 19-year-old man comes to the emergency department after being stabbed in the right arm during a fight. The patient has no chronic medical conditions. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right upper extremity shows a 4-cm laceration oriented transversely over the volar (flexor) surface of the proximal forearm. The patient is taken to the operating room for surgical repair. While exploring the wound, a nerve that courses between the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus muscles is found to be transected.",
    "zh": "一名19岁男性在打架时右臂被刺伤后来到急诊科就诊。患者无慢性病史。生命体征在正常范围内。右侧上肢检查显示在近端前臂的掌侧（屈侧）面有一条4厘米的横向伤口。患者被送往手术室进行手术修复。在探查伤口时，发现一根走行于指浅屈肌和指深屈肌之间的神经被切断。"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The median nerve is formed from spinal nerves C5-T1 via the medial and lateral cords of the brachial plexus. It arises from the medial and lateral cords of the brachial plexus. In the forearm, the median nerve passes between the heads of the pronator teres before coursing between the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus muscles. It ultimately passes into the hand through the carpal tunnel beneath the flexor retinaculum.\n\nThe median nerve is most commonly injured by compression within the carpal tunnel (ie, carpal tunnel syndrome), leading to pain and numbness in the first 3 digits and lateral half of the fourth, along with WEAKNESS OF THUMB FLEXION AND OPPOSITION. However, the nerve can be injured more proximally by penetrating trauma to the upper forearm, supracondylar fracture, or entrapment between the heads of pronator teres. In addition to the above symptoms, proximal injury causes decreased sensation over the thenar eminence and weakness of flexion in the wrist and second and third digits (ie, preacher or benediction hand).\n\n(Choices A and B) The adductor pollicis muscle (adduction of the thumb) and palmar interossei (adduction of the third and fourth digits) are innervated by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve courses between the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor carpi ulnaris in the medial forearm.\n\n(Choices C and F) The extensor digitorum (extension of digits at metacarpophalangeal joints) and supinator (supination of forearm) are innervated by the deep branch of the radial nerve (posterior interosseous nerve). This nerve runs in the posterior forearm between the deep and superficial extensor muscles.\n\n(Choice D) Extension of the wrist is largely performed by extensor carpi ulnaris and extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis, which are innervated by the radial nerve. The radial nerve courses between the medial and lateral heads of the triceps brachii in the upper arm before splitting into deep and superficial branches.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe median nerve is most commonly injured within the carpal tunnel, leading to pain and numbness in the first 3 digits and lateral half of the fourth, as well as weakness of thumb flexion and opposition. More proximal injury (in the forearm) additionally causes decreased sensation over the thenar eminence and weakness of flexion in the wrist and second and third digits.",
    "zh": "正中神经由臂丛的内侧束和外侧束（C5-T1）组成。正中神经起源于臂丛的内侧束和外侧束。在前臂，正中神经在旋前圆肌的两个头之间通过，然后走行于指浅屈肌和指深屈肌之间。它最终通过腕管，经过屈肌支持带进入手部。\n\n正中神经最常因腕管内受压（即腕管综合征）而受损，导致前3个手指和第4指的桡侧半出现疼痛和麻木，以及拇指屈曲和对掌无力。然而，该神经也可能因穿透性上臂前臂损伤、肱骨髁上骨折或旋前圆肌头部之间的卡压而出现近端损伤。除了上述症状外，近端损伤还会导致鱼际感觉减退以及腕关节和第二、第三指屈曲无力（即传教士或祝福手）。\n\n（选项A和B）拇收肌（拇指内收）和掌侧骨间肌（第三和第四指内收）由尺神经的深支支配。尺神经在前臂内侧在指深屈肌和尺侧腕屈肌之间走行。\n\n（选项C和F）指伸肌（掌指关节伸展）和旋后肌（前臂旋后）由桡神经的深支（骨间后神经）支配。该神经在后臂深、浅伸肌之间走行。\n\n（选项D）腕关节伸展主要由尺侧腕伸肌和桡侧腕长、短伸肌完成，这些肌肉由桡神经支配。桡神经在上臂走行于肱三头肌的内侧头和外侧头之间，然后分为深支和浅支。\n\n教育目标：\n正中神经最常在腕管内受损，导致前3个手指和第4指的桡侧半出现疼痛和麻木，以及拇指屈曲和对掌无力。更近端的损伤（在前臂）还会导致鱼际感觉减退以及腕关节和第二、第三指屈曲无力。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the anatomy and function of the median nerve in the forearm and hand, specifically focusing on the motor deficits resulting from a transection injury. It requires knowledge of which muscles are innervated by the median nerve and their corresponding movements.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the nerve injured based on its anatomical location between the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus muscles in the volar forearm. Then, recall the motor functions mediated by the median nerve, particularly those involving the thumb and digits, and determine which of the provided options represents a movement primarily controlled by the median nerve and likely to be impaired by its transection.",
    "zh": "本题考察对前臂和手部正中神经的解剖结构和功能的理解，特别是关注由横断伤引起的运动功能障碍。它要求了解哪些肌肉由正中神经支配及其相应的运动。\n\n要解决这个问题，首先必须根据正中神经在前臂掌侧在指浅屈肌和指深屈肌之间的解剖位置来确定受损的神经。然后，回忆正中神经介导的运动功能，特别是那些涉及拇指和手指的功能，并确定所提供的选项中哪一项代表主要由正中神经控制且可能因其横断而受损的运动。"
