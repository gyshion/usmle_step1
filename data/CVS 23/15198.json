    "en": " A 35-year-old primigravid woman comes to the clinic during the second trimester. The patient reports that she has had some tiredness, which she attributes to pregnancy. She takes 1 nap during the day. She has no chest pain, cough, or lower extremity swelling. As a child, the patient was told that she has a murmur but does not know any details and says that she has felt well until recently. On physical examination, a 3/6 midsystolic murmur is heard at the left upper sternal border and S2 is widely split. {{exhibit_1}} Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "en": "This patient likely has PULMONIC VALVE STENOSIS (PS), which most commonly occurs as an isolated CONGENITAL defect and rarely occurs as an acquired defect (eg, rheumatic fever, carcinoid syndrome). Severe PS is typically diagnosed early in life due to development of right-sided heart failure, but patients with relatively mild PS often do not present with symptoms (eg, dyspnea, fatigue) until adulthood. The physiologic changes of pregnancy (eg, increased plasma volume) can unmask underlying PS.\n\nCardiac auscultation in PS reveals a pulmonic ejection click followed by a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border. The stenosis causes the pulmonic valve to close later than usual as it takes longer for the right ventricle to push blood through the narrowed valve. This results in widened splitting of the aortic and pulmonic components of S2. Inspiration draws additional blood into the right side of heart, which increases the intensity of the murmur and further widens the splitting of S2. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nPulmonary hypertension is another cause of widened splitting of S2 because more time is required for the right ventricle to overcome pulmonary arterial pressure (ie, the pulmonic valve opens later and closes later).\n\n(Choice A) A benign flow murmur can occur in patients with high cardiac output states (eg, pregnancy) due to increased flow across the aortic and pulmonic valves; however, the murmur is typically low grade (2/6 or less) and abnormal splitting of S2 is not present.\n\n(Choice B) A bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital heart defect seen in adults and can lead to aortic stenosis in relatively young patients (eg, those in their 50s). However, aortic stenosis causes delayed closure of the aortic valve, leading to narrowed or paradoxical splitting of S2.\n\n(Choice C) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can cause a systolic murmur that mimics that of aortic stenosis and is best heard at the mid-left sternal border. Aortic valve closure may be delayed due to prolonged ejection of blood through the left ventricular outflow tract.\n\n(Choice E) A small- or moderate-sized ventricular septal defect may present in adulthood with symptoms of heart failure. There is typically widened splitting of S2 due to early closure of the aortic valve (less blood is ejected into the aorta because some blood is ejected into the right ventricle). However, a holosystolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border is expected.\n\nEducational objective:\nPulmonic valve stenosis causes a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur (best heard at the left upper sternal border) and delays closure of the pulmonic valve, resulting in widened splitting of S2. Inspiration increases blood flow to the right side of the heart, causing increased intensity of the murmur and even later closure of the pulmonic valve. {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者可能患有肺动脉瓣狭窄（PS），这最常作为孤立的先天性缺陷发生，很少作为获得性缺陷发生（例如，风湿热、类癌综合征）。严重的PS通常在生命的早期被诊断出来，原因是右心衰竭的发展，但患有相对轻度PS的患者通常直到成年后才出现症状（例如，呼吸困难、疲劳）。怀孕的生理变化（例如，血浆容量增加）可以揭示潜在的PS。\n\nPS的听诊显示，肺动脉瓣喷射音后，在左上胸骨缘可听到粗糙的渐强-渐弱收缩期杂音。狭窄导致肺动脉瓣关闭比平时晚，因为右心室需要更长的时间才能将血液推过狭窄的瓣膜。这导致主动脉瓣和肺动脉瓣S2成分的分裂增宽。吸气将额外的血液吸入心脏右侧，这增加了杂音的强度，并进一步扩大了S2的分裂。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n肺动脉高压是S2分裂增宽的另一个原因，因为右心室需要更多的时间来克服肺动脉压力（即，肺动脉瓣开放得更晚，关闭得更晚）。\n\n（选项A）良性血流杂音可发生在心输出量高的患者中（例如，怀孕），这是由于血液流过主动脉瓣和肺动脉瓣的流量增加所致；但是，杂音通常为低级（2/6或更低），并且不存在S2的异常分裂。\n\n（选项B）二叶式主动脉瓣是成人中最常见的先天性心脏缺陷，并且可能导致相对年轻的患者（例如，50多岁的人）出现主动脉瓣狭窄。然而，主动脉瓣狭窄导致主动脉瓣关闭延迟，从而导致S2的分裂变窄或矛盾分裂。\n\n（选项C）肥厚型心肌病可引起收缩期杂音，类似于主动脉瓣狭窄的杂音，并且在左胸骨中缘最容易听到。由于血液通过左心室流出道长时间射出，主动脉瓣关闭可能会延迟。\n\n（选项E）小型或中型室间隔缺损可能会在成年时出现心力衰竭的症状。通常，由于主动脉瓣提前关闭，S2会分裂增宽（因为一些血液被射入右心室，因此射入主动脉的血液较少）。然而，预计在左下胸骨缘可听到全收缩期杂音。\n\n教育目标：\n肺动脉瓣狭窄会导致渐强-渐弱的收缩期杂音（在左上胸骨缘最容易听到），并延迟肺动脉瓣的关闭，导致S2分裂增宽。吸气增加流向心脏右侧的血流量，导致杂音强度增加，甚至使肺动脉瓣关闭得更晚。{{exhibit_3}}"
