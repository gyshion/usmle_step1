    "en": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office due to vision problems. Over the last 6 weeks, he has had several \"near-misses\" while driving, having been nearly hit by cars coming from both the right and left sides. He also reports frequent headaches. The patient has no prior medical conditions and takes no medications. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Physical examination reveals deficits in the bilateral temporal visual fields. Extraocular movements are bilaterally intact, and the remainder of the neurological examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be present in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient's symptoms are worrisome for a pituitary tumor. Large tumors can cause headaches due to mass effect, and compression of the optic chiasm by suprasellar extension of the tumor can cause bitemporal hemianopsia. These tumors can also cause loss of normal pituitary function by compression of surrounding cells. Pituitary adenomas typically arise from 1 of the 5 major cell types of the anterior pituitary; physiologic symptoms depend on the hormones produced by the tumor. The most common hormonally active (functional) adenomas are prolactin-secreting adenomas (prolactinomas). {{exhibit_1}} Prolactin is a peptide hormone whose primary action is maintenance of lactation in the postpartum period; prolactinomas classically cause galactorrhea in premenopausal women. Prolactin also suppresses GnRH production from the hypothalamus, which in women leads to amenorrhea and in men causes hypogonadism (eg, impotence, decreased libido, infertility). Because the symptoms of hyperprolactinemia in men and postmenopausal women are often mild and nonspecific, patients may not seek care until the tumors are large and cause mass effect symptoms.\n\n(Choices B, D, and F) Somatotroph (growth hormone-secreting) adenomas can present with gigantism (in children) or acromegaly in adults. Thyrotroph (TSH-secreting) adenomas cause central hyperthyroidism (eg, heat intolerance, tachycardia). Thinning of the skin, typically manifesting as abdominal stria, is a characteristic feature of Cushing syndrome; when hypercortisolism is due to a corticotroph (ACTH-producing) adenoma, it is referred to as Cushing disease. These tumors are significantly less common than prolactinomas.\n\n(Choice C) Mass lesions involving the pituitary stalk or posterior pituitary could cause headaches and bitemporal hemianopia in addition to central diabetes insipidus (due to decreased release of antidiuretic hormone [ADH] from the posterior pituitary). However, polyuria is typically only transient (lasting <6 weeks) because the hypothalamus is able to bypass the pituitary and directly release ADH into the circulation.\n\n(Choice E) Hyperpigmentation in the context of pituitary disease is typically due to hypersecretion of ACTH, either due to a corticotroph adenoma or in response to primary adrenal insufficiency.\n\nEducational objective:\nPituitary tumors can present with headaches, bitemporal hemianopsia, and hypopituitarism; the most common hormonally active (functional) adenomas are prolactin-secreting adenomas (prolactinomas). Prolactinomas can cause galactorrhea and amenorrhea in women. In men, they often present with hypogonadism.",
    "zh": "该患者的症状提示可能患有垂体肿瘤。大型肿瘤可因占位效应引起头痛，肿瘤的鞍上延伸压迫视交叉可导致双颞侧偏盲。这些肿瘤还可因压迫周围细胞而导致正常垂体功能的丧失。垂体腺瘤通常起源于垂体前叶的5种主要细胞类型之一；生理症状取决于肿瘤产生的激素。最常见的激素活性（功能性）腺瘤是泌乳素分泌腺瘤（催乳素瘤）。{{exhibit_1}} 催乳素是一种肽类激素，其主要作用是维持产后哺乳；催乳素瘤在绝经前妇女中典型地引起溢乳。催乳素还会抑制下丘脑释放促性腺激素释放激素（GnRH），这在女性中导致闭经，在男性中引起性腺功能减退（例如，阳痿、性欲减退、不育）。由于男性和绝经后妇女的高泌乳素血症症状通常较轻且非特异性，患者可能直到肿瘤很大并引起占位效应症状时才就诊。\n\n（选项B、D和F）生长激素分泌细胞（生长激素分泌）腺瘤可表现为巨人症（儿童）或肢端肥大症（成人）。促甲状腺素细胞（TSH分泌）腺瘤引起中枢性甲状腺功能亢进症（如，不耐热、心动过速）。皮肤变薄，通常表现为腹部条纹，是库欣综合征的特征；当皮质醇增多症是由于促肾上腺皮质激素（ACTH产生）腺瘤引起时，被称为库欣病。这些肿瘤的发生率明显低于催乳素瘤。\n\n（选项C）涉及垂体柄或垂体后叶的占位病变，除了中枢性尿崩症（由于垂体后叶释放抗利尿激素[ADH]减少）外，还可能引起头痛和双颞侧偏盲。然而，多尿通常仅是短暂的（持续<6周），因为下丘脑能够绕过垂体，直接将ADH释放到循环中。\n\n（选项E）在垂体疾病的背景下，色素沉着过度通常是由于ACTH分泌过多，这可能是由于促皮质素瘤或对原发性肾上腺皮质功能不全的反应。\n\n教学目标：\n垂体肿瘤可表现为头痛、双颞侧偏盲和垂体功能减退症；最常见的激素活性（功能性）腺瘤是泌乳素分泌腺瘤（催乳素瘤）。催乳素瘤可引起女性溢乳和闭经。在男性中，它们通常表现为性腺功能减退。"
