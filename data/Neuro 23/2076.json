She has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. The patient's father had a myocardial infarction at age 60. Physical examination shows loss of touch, temperature, and vibratory sensation affecting the entire right side of the body. Sensation is also diminished over the right side of the face. Muscle strength is 5/5 throughout. Speech, vision, and hearing tests are normal. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has had a stroke, resulting in hemisensory loss of the right arm, leg, and face. Strokes in many CNS locations can result in sensory loss and can be further localized according to the specific pattern.\n\n- Primary somatosensory cortex: Deficits are contralateral to the lesion. Based on the blood supply and the somatotopic organization of the somatosensory cortex, sensory deficits do not often impact the face, arm, and leg equally. Other deficits related to nearby cortical areas (eg, motor weakness, aphasia) are usually present (Choices B and E).\n\n- Thalamus: The thalamic ventral posterior lateral nucleus receives input from the spinothalamic tract and dorsal columns, and the ventral posterior medial nucleus receives input from the trigeminal pathway. Damage to these nuclei (eg, ischemia, hemorrhage) may result in contralateral complete sensory loss (eg, touch, pain/temperature, vibration/proprioception).\n\n- Lateral pons or medulla: Strokes in these areas can lead to contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation of the body (due to impact of the spinothalamic tract) and the ipsilateral face (due to impact of the spinal trigeminal nucleus). Patients often have vertigo, ataxia, and bulbar weakness (ie, lateral medullary syndrome).\n\n- Medial medulla: Damage to the medial lemniscus can result in contralateral loss of vibration and joint position sense. It is typically also associated with contralateral arm and/or leg weakness and ipsilateral tongue weakness (medial medullary syndrome).\n\n- Spinal cord: Damage to the spinal cord causes specific patterns of sensation loss that do not impact the face.\n\nIn addition to sensation loss of touch, vibration, and temperature, this patient's unsteady gait despite normal muscle strength suggests a severe proprioception deficit; her complete right-sided hemisensory loss with intact motor strength most likely indicates a lesion affecting the left thalamus.\n\n(Choices A and D) Stroke in the lateral pons typically leads to a classic combination of symptoms (lateral pontine syndrome) that includes loss of pain and temperature sensation of the contralateral body (spinothalamic tracts) and ipsilateral face (spinal trigeminal tract), ataxia (cerebellar trunks), facial weakness (lower motor neuron pattern), hearing loss and/or vertigo (vestibulocochlear nerve [CN VIII]), and contralateral hemiplegia (descending motor tracts).\n\n(Choice F) Sensory deficits due to a lesion in the thalamus are contralateral to the site of the lesion. Therefore, a lesion in the right thalamus would lead to left hemisensory loss.\n\nEducational objective:\nA stroke impacting the thalamus can lead to sensory loss affecting all tactile modalities (eg, touch, pain/temperature, vibration/proprioception) in the contralateral face, arm, and leg.",
    "zh": "该患者发生了卒中，导致右侧手臂、腿和面部的半身感觉丧失。许多中枢神经系统（CNS）部位的卒中可导致感觉丧失，并可根据特定模式进一步定位。\n\n- 主要躯体感觉皮层：缺陷与病变对侧。根据血液供应和躯体感觉皮层的躯体定位，感觉缺陷通常不会对面部、手臂和腿部产生同等影响。通常存在与其他皮质区域相关的其他缺陷（例如，运动无力、失语症）（选项 B 和 E）。\n\n- 丘脑：丘脑腹后外侧核接收来自脊髓丘脑束和后柱的输入，腹后内侧核接收来自三叉神经通路的输入。这些核的损伤（例如，缺血、出血）可能导致对侧完全感觉丧失（例如，触觉、疼痛/温度、振动/本体感觉）。\n\n- 外侧脑桥或延髓：这些区域的卒中可导致身体对侧疼痛和温度感觉丧失（由于脊髓丘脑束的影响）以及同侧面部（由于脊髓三叉神经核的影响）。患者常有眩晕、共济失调和延髓无力（即，外侧延髓综合征）。\n\n- 内侧延髓：内侧丘系受损可导致对侧振动和关节位置感觉丧失。它通常也与对侧手臂和/或腿部无力以及同侧舌无力相关（内侧延髓综合征）。\n\n- 脊髓：脊髓损伤会导致特定的感觉丧失模式，不会影响面部。\n\n除了触觉、振动和温度的感觉丧失外，该患者在肌肉力量正常的情况下步态不稳，提示严重的本体感觉缺陷；她右侧完全的半身感觉丧失，且运动力量完整，最有可能表明病变影响左侧丘脑。\n\n（选项 A 和 D）外侧脑桥的卒中通常会导致典型的症状组合（外侧脑桥综合征），包括对侧身体的疼痛和温度感觉丧失（脊髓丘脑束）和同侧面部（脊髓三叉神经束）、共济失调（小脑干）、面部无力（下运动神经元模式）、听力丧失和/或眩晕（前庭蜗神经[CN VIII]）以及对侧偏瘫（下行运动束）。\n\n（选项 F）丘脑病变引起的感觉缺陷与病变部位对侧。因此，右侧丘脑的病变将导致左侧半身感觉丧失。\n\n教育目标：\n影响丘脑的卒中可导致对侧面部、手臂和腿部所有触觉模式（例如，触觉、疼痛/温度、振动/本体感觉）的感觉丧失。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of stroke localization based on sensory deficits. Specifically, it assesses the ability to correlate the pattern of sensory loss (right-sided hemisensory loss affecting all modalities) with the affected brain structure. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that complete contralateral hemisensory loss, including the face, is characteristic of a thalamic lesion. Understanding the somatotopic organization of the sensory pathways and the typical presentations of lesions in other brainstem structures is also crucial.",
