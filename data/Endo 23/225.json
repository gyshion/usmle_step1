    "en": "A 50-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to a sudden, severe headache associated with nausea and vomiting that started earlier in the day. The patient has had mild headaches and decreased libido over the past 3 months. He has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. Physical examination reveals bilateral visual field deficits and impaired extraocular eye movements on the right side. Shortly after being admitted to the hospital, he becomes acutely hypotensive and loses consciousness. The patient dies despite aggressive resuscitation efforts. Which of the following is most likely to be found on autopsy? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "The patient's presentation is classic for pituitary apoplexy, which is characterized by acute hemorrhage into the pituitary gland. This can lead to severe headache, visual disturbances (due to compression of the optic chiasm), ophthalmoplegia (due to compression of cranial nerves), and hemodynamic instability. The pathogenesis involves acute pituitary hemorrhage, often occurring in a pre-existing pituitary adenoma. {{exhibit_2}} The clinical presentation includes severe headache, bitemporal hemianopia, ophthalmoplegia, and hemodynamic instability leading to severe hypotension and shock. {{exhibit_3}} This can result in coma and death. {{exhibit_4}} The other options are less likely. Bleeding into the putamen typically causes gradual neurological deficits. Carotid dissection usually presents with unilateral headache and Horner's syndrome. Ruptured intracranial aneurysms can cause sudden severe headache but are not typically associated with the specific visual and ophthalmoplegic findings seen here, nor the progression to pituitary apoplexy. Cavernous sinus thrombosis usually presents with progressive headaches, seizures, and ophthalmoplegia, but the sudden onset and severe hypotension are less characteristic.",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现是垂体卒中的典型表现，其特征是垂体内的急性出血。这可导致剧烈头痛、视力障碍（由于压迫视交叉）、眼肌麻痹（由于压迫脑神经）和血流动力学不稳定。发病机制涉及急性垂体出血，通常发生在先前存在的垂体腺瘤中。{{exhibit_2}} 临床表现包括剧烈头痛、双颞侧偏盲、眼肌麻痹和血流动力学不稳定，导致严重低血压和休克。{{exhibit_3}} 这可导致昏迷和死亡。{{exhibit_4}} 其他选项不太可能。壳核出血通常会导致逐渐出现的神经功能缺损。颈动脉夹层通常表现为单侧头痛和霍纳综合征。颅内动脉瘤破裂可引起突发剧烈头痛，但通常与此处所见的特定视觉和眼肌麻痹表现，以及进展为垂体卒中无关。海绵窦血栓形成通常表现为进行性头痛、癫痫发作和眼肌麻痹，但突然发作和严重低血压的特征较少。"

    "en": "A 50-year-old man with a history of mild headaches and decreased libido develops sudden severe headache, nausea, vomiting, visual field deficits, and impaired extraocular movements. He then becomes hypotensive and loses consciousness, ultimately dying despite resuscitation. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of pituitary apoplexy, which is caused by acute hemorrhage into the pituitary gland. Autopsy would most likely reveal acute hemorrhage in the pituitary gland.",
