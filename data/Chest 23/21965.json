    "en": "A 44-year-old man comes to the office due to excessive daytime sleepiness and loud snoring. He undergoes polysomnography for evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea. During the study, sensors are attached to monitor ocular movements, muscle electrical potentials, brain activity, airflow, and cardiac rhythm. Based on the ocular and muscle readings, the patient's sleep stages are classified into rapid eye movement (REM) or non-REM. In addition, the patient's body position is tracked by video. He tosses and turns throughout the night, sleeping on his back, side, and stomach. Frequent episodes of obstructive apnea and hypopnea are detected. The highest degree of obstructive apnea is likely to be seen during which of the following categories of sleep?",

    "en": "The gold standard for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a supervised in-lab polysomnography (sleep study). During the study, multiple channels of data are recorded, including eye movements, muscle activation, airflow, thoracic and abdominal motion, cardiac rhythm, and body position. OSA is present when there is decreased or absent airflow despite thoracoabdominal effort.\n\nEpisodes of obstruction are caused by repetitive collapse of the upper airway. RELAXATION of the tongue, oropharyngeal dilator (eg, genioglossus), and soft palatal musculature contributes to this collapse. Muscle tone and collapsibility are greatly influenced by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and body position:\n\n*   During REM, there is generalized tonic inhibition of all striated muscles except the diaphragm. REM-induced paralysis of upper airway muscles increases the propensity to obstruction (Choices A, B, and C). REM is identified during polysomnography by the simultaneous presence of ocular movements, suppressed skeletal muscle activity, and electroencephalogram showing high-frequency waves resembling wakefulness.\n*   During supine sleep, upper airway obstruction is more likely due to the effect of gravity promoting collapse of the upper airway. Conversely, airway patency is improved in the upright (eg, recliner), lateral, and prone positions (Choice D).\n\nTherefore, the severity of obstructive apnea is highest during REM supine sleep. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nEducational objective:\nObstructive sleep apnea is due to upper airway muscle relaxation leading to repetitive pharyngeal collapse. The degree of collapse is highest when muscle tone is globally inhibited during rapid eye movement sleep. Collapse is also greatest in the supine position due to the effect of gravity on the upper airway structures. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "诊断阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停（OSA）的金标准是在实验室进行的多导睡眠监测（睡眠研究）。在研究期间，会记录多个数据通道，包括眼球运动、肌肉激活、气流、胸腹运动、心律和身体姿势。当尽管有胸腹努力，气流减少或缺失时，则存在 OSA。\n\n阻塞事件是由上气道重复塌陷引起的。舌头、口咽扩张肌（如舌肌）和软腭肌肉的松弛导致这种塌陷。肌张力和塌陷性受快速眼动（REM）睡眠和身体姿势的很大影响：\n\n*   在 REM 期间，除了膈肌外，所有横纹肌都有普遍的强直性抑制。REM 引起的上气道肌肉麻痹增加了阻塞的倾向（选项 A、B 和 C）。REM 在多导睡眠监测期间通过同时存在眼球运动、骨骼肌活动受到抑制以及脑电图显示类似于清醒状态的高频波来识别。\n*   在仰卧位睡眠期间，上气道阻塞的可能性更大，这归因于重力促进上气道塌陷的作用。相反，气道通畅性在直立（例如，躺椅）、侧卧和俯卧位时有所改善（选项 D）。\n\n因此，阻塞性呼吸暂停的严重程度在 REM 仰卧位睡眠期间最高。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n教育目标：\n阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停是由于上气道肌肉松弛导致重复性咽部塌陷。当肌肉张力在快速眼动睡眠期间被全面抑制时，塌陷程度最高。由于重力对上气道结构的影响，塌陷在仰卧位时也最大。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the factors that exacerbate it, specifically the impact of REM sleep and body position on upper airway collapse. It requires understanding how muscle relaxation during REM sleep and gravitational forces in the supine position contribute to airway obstruction.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the combined effects of REM sleep (muscle atonia) and supine position (gravity). Recognize that both factors promote upper airway collapse, leading to the highest degree of obstructive apnea. Eliminate options that involve either non-REM sleep or non-supine positions.",
