    "en": "A 58-year-old man comes to the office for evaluation of a thyroid nodule. The patient first noticed a painless neck lump 2 months ago, which has progressively enlarged. He has had no heat or cold intolerance, recent weight changes, or difficulty breathing or swallowing. Medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension. The patient has no history of radiation exposure or family history of thyroid diseases. Physical examination shows a firm, nontender nodule in the right thyroid lobe. Serum TSH level is normal, and ultrasonography shows a 4-cm solid nodule in the right thyroid lobe. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy shows a large number of follicular cells dispersed in clusters and microfollicles. The patient undergoes right thyroid lobectomy. Which of the following histologic findings would confirm a diagnosis of follicular thyroid carcinoma in this patient?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This euthyroid patient has a slowly enlarging, firm, painless thyroid nodule and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) results indicative of a follicular neoplasm (eg, numerous follicular cells and microfollicles). Most follicular thyroid neoplasms are benign follicular adenomas, but 15%-30% can be malignant follicular carcinomas. Both types of follicular neoplasms have a similar appearance on ultrasound and FNA.\n\nDifferentiating between benign and malignant follicular lesions can only be accomplished by histologic examination of the entire tumor (eg, thyroidectomy).\n\n*   Follicular adenomas (the most common benign thyroid neoplasm) display numerous neoplastic follicular cells and microfollicles on histology but are completely encapsulated.\n*   In contrast, follicular thyroid carcinomas are characterized by invasion of the tumor capsule and/or surrounding blood vessels.\n\nThis propensity of follicular thyroid carcinomas to invade surrounding blood vessels accounts for their tendency to metastasize via hematogenous spread to distant tissues (eg, bone, lung).\n\n(Choice A) Medullary thyroid carcinomas can develop sporadically or in patients with an inherited RET proto-oncogene mutation (eg, multiple endocrine neoplasia 2a or 2b). In patients with this germline mutation, C-cell hyperplasia is often found as a precursor to a malignant lesion. Malignant C cells secrete calcitonin, which can form amyloid deposits within the tumor.\n\n(Choice B) Papillary thyroid carcinoma (the most common type of thyroid malignancy) has distinct cytologic and histologic features. These include laminar calcifications (psammoma bodies), large cells with pale, empty-appearing nuclei (Orphan Annie-eye or ground-glass nuclei) with nuclear inclusion bodies and nuclear grooves. Unlike FTC, papillary thyroid carcinoma can be diagnosed on FNA results.\n\n(Choice C) Hürthle cells are large, polygonal cells with granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm due to large quantities of mitochondria. They are a nonspecific finding seen in a wide variety of neoplastic and nonneoplastic thyroid lesions. Therefore, they would not be of benefit in differentiating between benign and malignant follicular lesions.\n\n(Choice D) Chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis typically presents with signs of primary hypothyroidism (eg, weight gain, cold intolerance, elevated TSH) due to autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland. Histology shows inflammation and lymphocytic germinal centers in the thyroid gland.\n\n(Choice E) Multinucleated giant cells are seen in many thyroid conditions, including thyroiditis, cystic degeneration, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. They are not typically seen in follicular lesions.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nFollicular neoplasms typically present as slowly enlarging, painless thyroid nodules. Differentiation between a follicular adenoma and follicular thyroid carcinoma is not possible using only fine-needle aspiration results. Histologic evidence of invasion of the tumor capsule and/or surrounding blood vessels is needed to diagnose follicular thyroid carcinoma. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "该甲状腺功能正常的患者出现缓慢增大的、质地坚硬的、无痛性甲状腺结节，细针穿刺(FNA)结果提示滤泡性肿瘤（如，大量滤泡细胞和微滤泡）。大多数滤泡性甲状腺肿瘤为良性滤泡腺瘤，但15%-30%可发展为恶性滤泡癌。两种类型的滤泡性肿瘤在超声和FNA上的表现相似。\n\n良性与恶性滤泡性病变的鉴别只能通过对整个肿瘤的组织学检查（例如，甲状腺切除术）来完成。\n\n*   滤泡腺瘤（最常见的良性甲状腺肿瘤）在组织学上显示出大量的新生滤泡细胞和微滤泡，但完全被包膜包裹。\n*   相比之下，滤泡性甲状腺癌的特征是侵犯肿瘤包膜和/或周围血管。\n\n滤泡性甲状腺癌具有侵犯周围血管的倾向，这解释了它们倾向于通过血行播散转移到远处组织（例如，骨、肺）。\n\n(选项A) 髓样甲状腺癌可散发发生，或发生在具有遗传性RET原癌基因突变的患者中（例如，多发性内分泌腺瘤病2a型或2b型）。在具有这种生殖系突变的患者中，C细胞增生常常被发现是恶性病变的先兆。恶性C细胞分泌降钙素，可在肿瘤内形成淀粉样蛋白沉积。\n\n(选项B) 乳头状甲状腺癌（最常见的甲状腺恶性肿瘤）具有独特的细胞学和组织学特征。这些特征包括层状钙化（砂粒体）、具有苍白、空泡样核（Orphan Annie眼或毛玻璃样核）的大细胞，并伴有核内包涵体和核沟。与FTC不同，乳头状甲状腺癌可以通过FNA结果诊断。\n\n(选项C) 嗜酸性细胞是具有颗粒状、嗜伊红性细胞质的大型多边形细胞，这归因于大量的线粒体。它们是非特异性的发现，可见于各种各样的肿瘤性和非肿瘤性甲状腺病变。因此，它们对鉴别良性和恶性滤泡性病变无益。\n\n(选项D) 慢性自身免疫性（桥本）甲状腺炎通常表现为原发性甲状腺功能减退的体征（例如，体重增加、怕冷、TSH升高），这归因于甲状腺的自身免疫破坏。组织学显示甲状腺炎症和淋巴细胞生发中心。\n\n(选项E) 多核巨细胞可见于许多甲状腺疾病，包括甲状腺炎、囊性变性和乳头状甲状腺癌。它们通常不在滤泡性病变中出现。\n\n教育目标：\n\n滤泡性肿瘤通常表现为缓慢增大的、无痛性甲状腺结节。仅使用细针穿刺结果无法区分滤泡腺瘤和滤泡性甲状腺癌。需要组织学证据表明肿瘤包膜和/或周围血管的侵犯才能诊断滤泡性甲状腺癌。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of follicular thyroid carcinoma diagnosis, specifically the histologic findings that differentiate it from follicular adenoma. The key differentiating feature is tumor capsular invasion, which is indicative of malignancy.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that follicular thyroid carcinoma requires histologic examination of the entire tumor to identify capsular or vascular invasion. Other histologic findings, such as C-cell hyperplasia or Hurthle cells, are not specific to follicular thyroid carcinoma.",
