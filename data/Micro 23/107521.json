    "en": "A 16-year-old previously healthy girl is brought to the emergency department due to intermittent episodes of high fever, chills, and rigors for the past 2 days. She reports drenching sweats when the fever resolves but has no other symptoms. The patient recently returned from a 2-week trip to Kenya. Temperature is 39.4 C (102.9 F), blood pressure is 114/68 mm Hg, and pulse is 118/min. Physical examination shows a normal oropharynx, clear lungs, no heart murmurs, and a nontender abdomen. Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears demonstrates the suspected pathogen.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's febrile illness and positive Giemsa-stained blood smear shortly after returning from Kenya suggest malaria. The infection is transmitted when an infected female Anopheles mosquito injects Plasmodium sporozoites during a bite. The sporozoites travel through the bloodstream to the liver, infect hepatocytes, and mature to schizonts over 1-4 weeks. This period is asymptomatic (Choices B and C). Once the hepatic schizonts are mature, they rupture the hepatocyte, releasing thousands of merozoites into the bloodstream. The merozoites rapidly infect circulating erythrocytes and mature over 24 hours from ring forms → trophozoites → mature schizonts. The lysis of infected erythrocytes by mature schizonts triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines, which cause the fever and other systemic symptoms of malaria.\n\nInitially, most patients have periods of high fever that occur at irregular intervals; over time, the intervals become more regular (every 24 - 48 hr) due to synchronized rupture of erythrocytes by schizonts. Most patients also have nonspecific symptoms such as diaphoresis, cough, headache, abdominal pain, and myalgia. Examination often demonstrates splenomegaly due to pooling of damaged and infected erythrocytes in the splenic sinusoids. Laboratory evaluation usually shows anemia and mild hyperbilirubinemia.\n\n(Choice A) A small minority of merozoites released from infected erythrocytes mature into gametocytes, which cause no symptoms. Gametocytes circulate in the bloodstream until they are taken up by a feeding female Anopheles mosquito, which begins the life cycle anew.\n\n(Choice D) Plasmodium species do not harbor a toxin that is released when they are destroyed. Gram-negative bacteria release endotoxin (eg, lipopolysaccharide) when they are lysed, which can cause septic shock.\n\nEducational objective: \nMalaria is generally asymptomatic for 1-4 weeks after transmission. Manifestations arise once the pathogen lyses erythrocytes, which releases inflammatory cytokines. Initial manifestations typically include periods of high fever and nonspecific, flu-like symptoms.",
    "zh": "该患者在从肯尼亚返回后不久出现的发热性疾病和吉姆萨染色血涂片阳性结果提示疟疾。当受感染的雌性按蚊在叮咬过程中注入疟原虫子孢子时，就会发生感染。子孢子通过血液流向肝脏，感染肝细胞，并在1-4周内成熟为裂殖子。这一时期没有症状（选项B和C）。一旦肝裂殖子成熟，它们就会破裂肝细胞，释放数千个裂殖子进入血液。裂殖子迅速感染循环红细胞，并在24小时内从环状体→滋养体→成熟裂殖子成熟。成熟裂殖子裂解受感染的红细胞会触发炎症细胞因子的释放，从而引起发烧和其他疟疾全身症状。\n\n最初，大多数患者的发烧时间不规律；随着时间的推移，由于裂殖子同步性地使红细胞破裂，间隔变得更加规律（每24-48小时）。大多数患者也有非特异性症状，如出汗、咳嗽、头痛、腹痛和肌痛。检查通常显示脾肿大，这是由于受损和受感染的红细胞聚集在脾窦中。实验室评估通常显示贫血和轻度高胆红素血症。\n\n（选项A）一小部分从受感染红细胞中释放的裂殖子会成熟为配子体，这不会引起任何症状。配子体在血液中循环，直到被正在取食的雌性按蚊吸收，从而开始了新的生命周期。\n\n（选项D）疟原虫属物种不含其被破坏时释放的毒素。革兰氏阴性细菌在溶解时会释放内毒素（例如脂多糖），这可能导致感染性休克。\n\n教育目标：\n疟疾在传播后通常1-4周内无症状。一旦病原体裂解红细胞并释放炎症细胞因子，就会出现表现。最初的表现通常包括高烧和非特异性的、类似流感的症状。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of malaria, specifically the mechanism by which the Plasmodium parasite causes fever. It requires understanding the parasite's life cycle and the host's immune response.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the patient's travel history to an endemic area, the symptoms of fever and sweats, and the microscopic examination findings suggestive of malaria. Understanding that fever in malaria is caused by the release of cytokines during erythrocyte lysis leads to the correct answer.",
    "zh": "本题考察对疟疾病理生理学的了解，特别是疟原虫引起发烧的机制。它需要理解寄生虫的生命周期和宿主的免疫反应。\n\n解决此问题的关键是认识到患者前往流行地区的旅行史、发烧和出汗的症状以及提示疟疾的显微镜检查结果。理解疟疾中的发烧是由红细胞溶解过程中细胞因子的释放引起的，这会导致正确的答案。"
