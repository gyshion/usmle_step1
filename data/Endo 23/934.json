    "en": "A 66-year-old man comes to the office due to progressive vision impairment over the last year that has begun to affect his ability to drive. He has difficulty reading road signs at night and reports excessive glare from the headlights of oncoming cars. The patient has a long history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Funduscopy reveals a diminished red reflex bilaterally with obscuration of retinal detail. It is determined that the patient's condition is in part due to intracellular accumulation of sorbitol. In healthy cells, this sugar alcohol is normally metabolized into which of the following substances to facilitate excretion?",

    "en": "This patient has cataracts, a vision-impairing opacification of the lens that causes loss of the red reflex with decreased visualization of retinal details on ophthalmoscopic evaluation. The incidence of cataracts increases with age; other risk factors include smoking, excessive sunlight exposure, diabetes mellitus, and glucocorticoid use. In this patient, long-term hyperglycemia most likely contributed to cataract formation by causing oversaturation of the polyol pathway.\n\nThe first step in the polyol pathway (an alternative route of glucose metabolism) is the conversion of glucose into sorbitol by aldose reductase. Sorbitol cannot readily cross cell membranes and is therefore trapped inside the cells where it forms. The second enzyme in the pathway, sorbitol dehydrogenase, is able to convert sorbitol into fructose at a sufficient rate to prevent accumulation when glucose levels are normal. However, the process is slow; in long-standing hyperglycemia, sorbitol accumulates in tissues with lower sorbitol dehydrogenase activity, such as the retina, lens, kidney, and peripheral nerves.\n\nSorbitol accumulation increases cellular osmotic and oxidative stress and contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. In lens cells, the increased stress leads to the development of hydropic lens fibers that degenerate, eventually resulting in lens opacification and cataract formation. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices B and C) Another function of aldose reductase is the conversion of galactose into galactitol (ie, this enzyme converts sugars into their corresponding sugar alcohols). Galactitol production via this pathway is normally insignificant. In galactosemia (galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency), an increased amount of galactitol is produced, resulting in congenital cataracts.\n\n(Choice D) The end product of sorbitol metabolism in most cells is fructose (not glucose), which is then excreted by the cells and taken up by the liver to produce glucose and triglycerides.\n\n(Choice E) Xylulose is an intermediate in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is used to generate NADPH (for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis) and ribose 5-phosphate (for nucleotide synthesis).\n\nEducational objective:\nIn the polyol pathway, aldose reductase converts glucose into sorbitol, which is slowly metabolized into fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase. Chronic hyperglycemia overwhelms this pathway, causing intracellular sorbitol accumulation and increased osmotic/oxidative stress. This accelerates cataract development in patients with diabetes, and contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有白内障，这是一种导致视力受损的晶状体混浊，会导致红光反射消失，眼底镜检查时视网膜细节的可见度降低。白内障的发病率随着年龄的增长而增加；其他危险因素包括吸烟、过度暴露于阳光、糖尿病和糖皮质激素的使用。在该患者中，长期的血糖过高很可能通过导致多元醇通路的过度饱和而促成白内障的形成。\n\n多元醇通路（一种葡萄糖代谢的替代途径）的第一步是醛糖还原酶将葡萄糖转化为山梨醇。山梨醇不能轻易穿过细胞膜，因此被困在细胞内形成。该通路的第二个酶，山梨醇脱氢酶，能够以足够的速率将山梨醇转化为果糖，以防止在葡萄糖水平正常时发生积累。然而，这个过程很慢；在长期高血糖症中，山梨醇会积聚在山梨醇脱氢酶活性较低的组织中，例如视网膜、晶状体、肾脏和周围神经。\n\n山梨醇的积累会增加细胞的渗透性和氧化应激，并导致糖尿病性视网膜病变、神经病变和肾病的病理生理学。在晶状体细胞中，增加的应激会导致水肿的晶状体纤维发生变性，最终导致晶状体混浊和白内障的形成。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项B和C）醛糖还原酶的另一个功能是将半乳糖转化为半乳糖醇（即，该酶将糖转化为它们相应的糖醇）。通过此途径产生的半乳糖醇通常可以忽略不计。在半乳糖血症（半乳糖-1-磷酸尿苷酰转移酶缺乏症）中，会产生增加量的半乳糖醇，导致先天性白内障。\n\n（选项D）大多数细胞中山梨醇代谢的最终产物是果糖（而不是葡萄糖），然后由细胞排出，并被肝脏吸收以产生葡萄糖和甘油三酯。\n\n（选项E）木酮糖是磷酸戊糖途径中的一个中间体，用于生成NADPH（用于胆固醇和脂肪酸合成）和核糖-5-磷酸（用于核苷酸合成）。\n\n教育目标：\n在多元醇通路中，醛糖还原酶将葡萄糖转化为山梨醇，山梨醇脱氢酶将其缓慢代谢成果糖。慢性高血糖症会使该通路不堪重负，导致细胞内山梨醇积累和渗透/氧化应激增加。这加速了糖尿病患者白内障的发展，并促成了糖尿病性视网膜病变、神经病变和肾病的病理生理学。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the polyol pathway and its role in the development of diabetic complications, specifically cataracts. It requires understanding how hyperglycemia leads to sorbitol accumulation and subsequent osmotic stress in lens cells.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the steps of the polyol pathway and the enzymes involved. Remember that sorbitol is converted to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase, and this process is overwhelmed in chronic hyperglycemia, leading to sorbitol accumulation.",
