    "en": "A 20-year-old woman comes to the physician because of multiple burns on her hands. She says that she gets burned quite often when she cooks, particularly while operating the oven. She also has burned herself when picking up her morning cup of coffee and when testing the water temperature in the shower. The patient is concerned because she cannot feel when objects are \"really hot\" and often does not notice that she has burns until she looks at her hands. She has no significant past medical history, no recent illnesses, and no sick contacts. Her surgical history is significant only for removal of impacted wisdom teeth 1 year ago. The patient has never smoked, drinks alcohol occasionally, and does not use illicit drugs. Her family history is significant for multiple sclerosis in her mother. Examination shows diminished pinprick and temperature sensation across the upper back, shoulders, and arms bilaterally. Light touch, position, and vibration sense are preserved. Examination of the lower extremities is unremarkable. Damage to which of the following spinal cord areas is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms? {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "一名20岁的女性因手部多处烧伤前来就诊。她说她在做饭时经常被烧伤，尤其是在使用烤箱时。她还在拿起早晨的咖啡和测试淋浴水温时被烧伤。患者担心她无法感觉到物体是否“真的热”，并且经常在看到手部之前没有注意到自己被烧伤。她没有重要的既往病史，近期没有患病，也没有接触过病人。她的手术史仅为一年前拔除智齿。患者从未吸烟，偶尔饮酒，并且不使用违禁药物。她的家族史提示其母亲患有多发性硬化症。检查显示，患者双侧上背部、肩部和手臂的针刺觉和温度觉减退。轻触觉、位置觉和振动觉完好。下肢检查无特殊发现。以下哪一个脊髓区域的损伤最有可能导致患者出现这些症状？{{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "This patient most likely has syringomyelia, which classically presents with disproportionate loss of pain and temperature sensation (dissociated anesthesia) involving the ARMS AND HANDS. In syringomyelia, a cerebrospinal fluid-filled cavity called a syrinx usually forms in the cervical region of the spinal cord. These cavities can enlarge over time and destroy adjacent portions of the spinal cord. The areas most commonly damaged are the ventral white commissure and ventral horns.\n\nThe ventral white commissure is located just anterior to the gray commissure. It is the area of decussation for the fibers of the lateral spinothalamic tract, which transmits pain and temperature sensation from peripheral receptors to the somatosensory cortex. Destruction of the ventral white commissure leads to loss of pain and temperature sensation bilaterally over the affected dermatomes (starting 1 to 2 levels below the lesion, as the axons briefly ascend in the zone of Lissauer before decussating). Touch, vibration, and position senses are preserved as the dorsal columns remain intact.\n\n(Choice B) The ventral horns contain lower motor neurons that receive impulses from the lateral corticospinal tract. Damage to the ventral horn can occur in syringomyelia, but would cause flaccid paralysis and atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles (not loss of pain and temperature sensation).\n\n(Choice C) The ventral spinothalamic tract is located in this area and transmits crude touch and pressure sensation. It should not be confused with the lateral spinothalamic tract, which carries pain and temperature sensation.\n\n(Choice D) After decussating in the ventral white commissure, axons of the lateral spinothalamic tract ascend to the brain in the lateral funiculus. Damage to this area would cause contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation distally, beginning 1 to 2 segments below the lesion. However, bilateral sensory loss would not occur with damage to this area.\n\n(Choice E) The dorsal horn contains first order axons and second order neurons that transmit sensory input from peripheral receptors. Damage to the dorsal horn would likely result in unilateral loss of all sensation over the affected dermatomes.\n\n(Choice F) The dorsal column contains both the gracile and cuneate fasciculi. They are formed by axons of first-order neurons of the dorsal column pathway. This tract is the primary mediator of proprioception, vibration, and tactile sensation.\n\nEducational objective: Syringomyelia is characterized by the formation of a cavity (syrinx) in the cervical region of the spinal cord. The syrinx damages the ventral white commissure, leading to bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation that is limited to the affected levels (typically the arms and hands); distal sensation is preserved. Destruction of the motor neurons in the ventral horns (due to extension of the syrinx) results in flaccid paralysis and atrophy of the intrinsic muscles of the hand.",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有脊髓空洞症，其典型表现为涉及手臂和手部的疼痛和温度感觉的非对称性丧失（分离性感觉缺失）。在脊髓空洞症中，一个充满脑脊液的空腔（称为脊髓空洞）通常形成于脊髓的颈椎区域。这些空腔会随着时间的推移而增大并破坏脊髓的相邻部分。最常受损的区域是前白连合和腹侧角。\n\n前白连合位于灰质连合的正前方。它是侧束脊髓丘脑束纤维的交叉区域，该纤维将疼痛和温度感觉从周围感受器传递到体感皮层。破坏前白连合会导致受累皮节双侧的疼痛和温度感觉丧失（从病变下方 1 到 2 个水平开始，因为轴突在交叉前短暂地在 Lissauer 区上升）。触觉、振动觉和位置觉得以保留，因为后索保持完整。\n\n（选项 B）腹侧角包含来自侧皮质脊髓束的冲动传导的低级运动神经元。脊髓空洞症中可能发生腹侧角的损伤，但会导致手部固有肌的弛缓性麻痹和萎缩（而不是疼痛和温度感觉的丧失）。\n\n（选项 C）腹侧脊髓丘脑束位于该区域，并传递粗略的触觉和压力感觉。它不应与传递疼痛和温度感觉的侧束脊髓丘脑束相混淆。\n\n（选项 D）在前白连合交叉后，侧束脊髓丘脑束的轴突在侧索中上升到大脑。该区域的损伤将导致病变下方 1 到 2 个节段开始的对侧远端疼痛和温度感觉丧失。然而，该区域的损伤不会导致双侧感觉丧失。\n\n（选项 E）背角包含传递来自周围感受器的感觉输入的初级轴突和二级神经元。背角的损伤可能会导致受累皮节单侧所有感觉的丧失。\n\n（选项 F）后索包含薄束和楔束。它们由后索通路的初级神经元的轴突形成。该束是本体感觉、振动觉和触觉的主要介质。\n\n教学目标：脊髓空洞症的特征是在脊髓颈椎区域形成一个空腔（脊髓空洞）。脊髓空洞会损伤前白连合，导致双侧疼痛和温度感觉丧失，这种感觉丧失仅限于受累水平（通常是手臂和手部）；远端感觉得以保留。腹侧角运动神经元的破坏（由于脊髓空洞的扩展）导致手部固有肌的弛缓性麻痹和萎缩。"
