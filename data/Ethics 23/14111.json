    "en": "A 26-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 0, at 38 weeks gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. Twelve hours after admission, she has a spontaneous vaginal delivery of a baby boy who weighs 3.8 kg (8.4 lb) and has Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The patient did not receive routine prenatal care. She has no chronic medical conditions and no medication allergies. After delivery, the patient is informed that her son will require erythromycin ointment to prevent an eye infection and possible blindness that can be caused by untreated gonorrhea. The patient says her son does not need treatment because she has never had a sexually transmitted infection.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient is declining recommended treatment for her newborn based on the reasoning that she has not had a sexually transmitted infection (STI). This may reflect a lack of understanding that STIs may be asymptomatic and/or lack of knowledge that preventive treatment is recommended for all newborns. The patient should be counseled that prophylactic erythromycin is recommended for all newborns to prevent blindness from *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*. \n\nAs part of the process of informed consent, all necessary information about indications for treatment as well as risks and benefits of accepting and refusing treatment should be provided, and the patient should be encouraged to ask questions. Whenever a patient declines or is hesitant to accept treatment, the initial step is for the physician to assess the patient's knowledge, provide clarification when needed (as in this case), listen to concerns, and understand the specific reasons for the refusal. The process of obtaining informed consent should be conducted in a nonjudgmental and noncoercive way.\n\n(Choices A and E) These statements automatically accept or reject the patient's decision without determining her level of understanding, providing needed clarification, and addressing concerns. Responding to treatment refusal should first involve assessing the patient's understanding of the indications, risks, and benefits of treatment.\n\n(Choice C) The patient has already asserted that she does not have a sexually transmitted illness, and further discussion on this point is likely to be perceived as condescending, which could undermine trust. Treatment is recommended for all newborns, regardless of the patient's history of being treated for an STI.\n\n(Choice D) Although this statement makes a medically valid point, it blames the patient for a worst outcome. Using parental fear and guilt as a coercive tactic should be avoided.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe process of informed consent involves discussing the indications, risks, and benefits of treatment. Assessing a patient's understanding of the discussion and responding to specific concerns or confusion is essential to obtaining valid consent.",
    "zh": "该患者拒绝为她的新生儿进行推荐的治疗，理由是她没有患过性传播感染（STI）。这可能反映出她对性传播感染可能无症状的缺乏了解，和/或对所有新生儿都推荐预防性治疗的知识不足。应告知患者，建议所有新生儿使用预防性红霉素，以预防由*淋病奈瑟菌*引起的失明。\n\n作为知情同意过程的一部分，应提供有关治疗指征以及接受和拒绝治疗的风险和益处的所有必要信息，并鼓励患者提问。每当患者拒绝或犹豫接受治疗时，医生的初步步骤是评估患者的知识水平，在需要时提供澄清（如本例），倾听担忧，并了解拒绝的具体原因。获得知情同意的过程应以一种不带偏见和非强制的方式进行。\n\n（选项A和E）这些陈述自动接受或拒绝了患者的决定，而没有确定她的理解水平，提供必要的澄清和解决担忧。对拒绝治疗的回应应首先涉及评估患者对治疗的指征、风险和益处的理解。\n\n（选项C）患者已经断言她没有性传播疾病，关于这一点的进一步讨论很可能被认为是居高临下的，这可能会破坏信任。建议对所有新生儿进行治疗，无论患者是否有接受性传播感染治疗的病史。\n\n（选项D）虽然这一说法在医学上是正确的，但它将最坏的结果归咎于患者。应避免使用父母的恐惧和内疚感作为胁迫手段。\n\n教育目标：\n知情同意的过程包括讨论治疗的指征、风险和益处。评估患者对讨论的理解并回应特定的担忧或困惑对于获得有效的同意至关重要。"
