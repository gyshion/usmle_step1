    "en": "A normal (Gaussian) distribution is defined as a symmetrical, bell-shaped distribution curve. One of the most important attributes of the normal distribution is the \"68/95/99 rule,\" which states that 68% of all observations lie within 1 standard deviation (SD) of the mean, 95% within 2 SDs of the mean, and 99.7% within 3 SDs of the mean. The SD is a measure of dispersion or variance (how far the measurements are from one another). In this example, the mean folate level is 5.0 ng/mL with a SD of 0.5 ng/mL. Therefore:\n\n*   4.5-5.5 ng/mL is the range within +/- 1 SD of 5.0 ng/mL (given that 5.0 − 1*0.5 = 4.5 ng/mL and 5 + 1*0.5 = 5.5 ng/mL);\n*   4.0-6.0 ng/mL is the range within +/- 2 SDs of 5.0 ng/mL (given that 5.0 − 2*0.5 = 4.0 ng/mL and 5.0 + 2*0.5 = 6.0 ng/mL)\n*   3.5-6.5 ng/mL is the range within +/- 3 SDs of 5.0 ng/mL (given that 5.0 − 3*0.5 = 3.5 ng/mL and 5.0 + 3*0.5 = 6.5 ng/mL)\n\nBased on the 68/95/99 rule, approximately 95% of observations lie within 2 SDs of the mean, so between 4.0 and 6.0 ng/mL in this case. These are helpful approximations; to be more precise, 95% of the observations lie within 1.96 SDs of the mean and 95.45% of the observations lie within 2 SDs of the mean.\n\nNote that SD is used to describe individual observations in a dataset. A closely related measure called standard error (SE) is used to show how closely sample means are related to population means: SE = SD / √ n, where n is the sample size. In this example, if SE had been given instead of SD, investigators would be 95% confident that the true mean folate level in the underlying population lies within the mean +/- 2 SE (which is also the range that would include 95% of sample means calculated from repeated samples of the same size taken from that population).\n\n(Choices A and D) These limits are asymmetric and are therefore inconsistent with a normal distribution curve around the mean.\n\n(Choice B) Approximately 99.7% of all observations lie within 3 SDs of the mean (3.5-6.5 ng/mL).\n\n(Choice E) Approximately 68% of all observations lie within 1 SD of the mean (4.5-5.5 ng/mL).",
    "zh": "正态（高斯）分布定义为对称的钟形分布曲线。正态分布最重要的特征之一是“68/95/99法则”，该法则指出，68%的观测值位于均值的一个标准差（SD）内，95%的观测值位于均值的两个标准差内，99.7%的观测值位于均值的三个标准差内。标准差是衡量离散度或方差的指标（测量值彼此之间的距离）。在本例中，叶酸的平均水平为5.0 ng/mL，标准差为0.5 ng/mL。因此：\n\n*   4.5-5.5 ng/mL 是在 5.0 ng/mL 的 +/- 1 个标准差内的范围（因为 5.0 − 1*0.5 = 4.5 ng/mL 且 5 + 1*0.5 = 5.5 ng/mL）；\n*   4.0-6.0 ng/mL 是在 5.0 ng/mL 的 +/- 2 个标准差内的范围（因为 5.0 − 2*0.5 = 4.0 ng/mL 且 5.0 + 2*0.5 = 6.0 ng/mL）；\n*   3.5-6.5 ng/mL 是在 5.0 ng/mL 的 +/- 3 个标准差内的范围（因为 5.0 − 3*0.5 = 3.5 ng/mL 且 5.0 + 3*0.5 = 6.5 ng/mL）\n\n根据 68/95/99 法则，大约 95% 的观测值位于均值的 2 个标准差内，因此在本例中介于 4.0 和 6.0 ng/mL 之间。这些是有用的近似值；更精确地说，95% 的观测值位于均值的 1.96 个标准差内，95.45% 的观测值位于均值的 2 个标准差内。\n\n请注意，标准差用于描述数据集中各个观测值。一个密切相关的指标称为标准误 (SE)，用于显示样本均值与总体均值的接近程度：SE = SD / √ n，其中 n 是样本量。在本例中，如果给出的不是标准差而是标准误，研究人员将有 95% 的信心认为，潜在总体中叶酸的真实平均水平位于均值 +/- 2 SE 范围内（这也就是包含从该总体中重复抽取的相同大小的样本计算得出的 95% 样本均值的范围）。\n\n（选项 A 和 D） 这些范围是不对称的，因此与均值周围的正态分布曲线不符。\n\n（选项 B）大约 99.7% 的所有观测值位于均值的 3 个标准差内（3.5-6.5 ng/mL）。\n\n（选项 E）大约 68% 的所有观测值位于均值的 1 个标准差内（4.5-5.5 ng/mL）。"
