    "en": "An infant is evaluated at the office after developing prominent oral thrush, interstitial pneumonia, and severe lymphopenia during the first year of life. The patient was born full-term to a 25-year-old woman who received no prenatal care and has substance use disorder with intravenous drug use. She breastfed her son for the first month but then switched to formula feedings. The mother is currently unwilling to undergo any kind of testing. She tells the health care provider, \"Just take care of my son.\" Which of the following prenatal interventions would have most likely prevented this infant's condition?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Oral thrush, interstitial pneumonia, and severe lymphopenia during the first year of life are consistent with mother-to-child vertical transmission of HIV-1. The risk of HIV infection occurring in an infant born to an HIV-positive mother who received no prenatal antiretroviral therapy (ART) can be as high as 35%. ART during pregnancy reduces the risk of perinatal transmission to 1%-2%. All pregnant women with HIV should take ART, regardless of their CD4 cell count or viral load.\n\nTriple combination therapy is recommended for HIV-positive pregnant women (as it is for all HIV-positive adults) and most commonly has a backbone of 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors along with a third drug (protease inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or integrase inhibitor). Drugs that are associated with a teratogenic risk (eg, efavirenz in first 8 weeks) or for which there is insufficient evidence during pregnancy are to be avoided. ART should be continued as long as women are breastfeeding. Infants generally receive several weeks of prophylaxis (zidovudine).\n\n(Choice B) Interferon-α is used for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, condyloma acuminata, hepatitis B virus infection, and Kaposi sarcoma.\n\n(Choices C, D, F, and G) There are no vaccines available to prevent HIV. Infants whose mothers are HBsAg-positive should receive the hepatitis B vaccine and immunoglobulin within hours of birth to prevent perinatal transmission. There is no effective prevention for mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C.\n\n(Choice E) Folic acid in prenatal vitamins (PNVs) can help prevent neural tube defects. Other important PNV components include iron (for hemoglobin synthesis), calcium (for bone growth), and iodine (for thyroid function). PNV intake does not prevent vertical transmission of HIV.\n\nEducational objective:\nAntiretroviral therapy during pregnancy reduces the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV to 1%-2% and is recommended for all pregnant women with HIV.",
    "zh": "在出生后第一年出现口腔鹅口疮、间质性肺炎和严重的淋巴细胞减少，这与母婴垂直传播 HIV-1 一致。HIV 感染发生在未接受产前抗逆转录病毒治疗 (ART) 的 HIV 阳性母亲所生婴儿中的风险可能高达 35%。妊娠期间 ART 可将围产期传播的风险降低至 1%-2%。所有 HIV 感染的孕妇均应接受 ART，无论其 CD4 细胞计数或病毒载量如何。\n\n建议对 HIV 阳性孕妇（与所有 HIV 阳性成人一样）进行三联疗法，通常包括 2 种核苷/核苷酸逆转录酶抑制剂和第三种药物（蛋白酶抑制剂、非核苷逆转录酶抑制剂或整合酶抑制剂）。应避免使用与致畸风险相关的药物（例如，前 8 周的依非韦伦）或妊娠期间证据不足的药物。只要女性仍在母乳喂养，就应继续使用 ART。婴儿通常接受数周的预防（齐多夫定）。\n\n(选项 B) 干扰素-α 用于治疗毛细胞白血病、尖锐湿疣、乙型肝炎病毒感染和卡波西肉瘤。\n\n(选项 C、D、F 和 G) 没有可用于预防 HIV 的疫苗。母亲 HBsAg 阳性的婴儿应在出生后数小时内接种乙型肝炎疫苗和免疫球蛋白，以预防围产期传播。没有有效的预防乙型肝炎母婴传播的方法。\n\n(选项 E) 产前维生素 (PNV) 中的叶酸有助于预防神经管缺陷。其他重要的 PNV 成分包括铁（用于血红蛋白合成）、钙（用于骨骼生长）和碘（用于甲状腺功能）。PNV 摄入不能预防 HIV 的垂直传播。\n\n教育目标：\n妊娠期间的抗逆转录病毒治疗可将 HIV 的围产期传播风险降低至 1%-2%，建议所有 HIV 感染的孕妇都进行此治疗。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of vertical transmission of HIV and the importance of prenatal antiretroviral therapy (ART) in reducing the risk of transmission from mother to child. It also assesses understanding of other prenatal interventions and their roles in preventing various conditions.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the clinical presentation suggestive of HIV infection in the infant and linking it to the mother's risk factors (IV drug use, lack of prenatal care). Then, identify the intervention that directly addresses the risk of vertical HIV transmission.",
    "zh": "本题考察对 HIV 垂直传播的认识，以及产前抗逆转录病毒治疗 (ART) 在降低母婴传播风险方面的重要性。它还评估对其他产前干预措施及其在预防各种疾病中的作用的理解。\n\n解决此问题的关键是认识到婴儿中提示 HIV 感染的临床表现，并将其与母亲的危险因素（静脉吸毒、缺乏产前护理）联系起来。然后，确定直接解决 HIV 垂直传播风险的干预措施。"
