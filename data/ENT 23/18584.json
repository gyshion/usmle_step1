    "en": "A 26-year-old woman comes to the office due to pain in her right jaw that is deep, achy, and worse in the morning. It radiates to her temple and is associated with headaches. The patient also has neck pain and stiffness, especially on the right side. When she chews, she hears a clicking noise in her right ear. The patient is in a competitive graduate study program and has been under significant stress. Her roommate says that she has been grinding her teeth at night. Physical examination will likely reveal spasms of which of the following muscles?",
    "zh": "一名26岁的女性因右侧下颌疼痛就诊，疼痛深层、酸痛，且在早上加重。疼痛放射至颞部，并伴有头痛。患者还伴有颈部疼痛和僵硬，尤其是在右侧。咀嚼时，她听到右耳有咔哒声。患者正在攻读竞争激烈的研究生课程，并承受着巨大的压力。她的室友说她晚上一直在磨牙。体格检查可能会显示以下哪些肌肉痉挛？"

    "en": "This patient has jaw pain, a clicking noise when she chews, and associated headaches and neck stiffness, which is suggestive of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome. The underlying etiology of TMJ syndrome is multifactorial and includes TMJ derangement (eg, jaw misalignment, trauma), and hypersensitivity of the mandibular nerve (CN V3). Mechanical derangement of the TMJ can result in irritation and hypersensitivity of CN V3, leading to pathologic contraction of the masseter and pterygoid muscles (which worsens jaw pain and dysfunction). Spasms of these muscles can sometimes be palpated along the mandibular ramus.\n\nRepetitive jaw motions (eg, gum chewing, teeth grinding) are thought to contribute to the development of TMJ syndrome due to increased workload and strain on the joint. Similar to some other musculoskeletal pain disorders (eg, tension headache), TMJ pain also seems to be related to psychiatric conditions and emotional distress.\n\n(Choice A) The buccinator muscle underlies the cheek and holds it close to the teeth to control the food bolus when chewing. It is innervated by a branch of the facial nerve (CN VII).\n\n(Choice B) The levator veli palatini elevates the soft palate during swallowing to prevent food from refluxing into the nasopharynx. It is innervated by the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve (CN X).\n\n(Choice D) The mylohyoid runs from the mandible to the hyoid bone, forming the floor of mouth. Although it is innervated by a branch of CN V3, it does not help close the jaw. It acts during swallowing to elevate the tongue and hyoid bone, which propels the food bolus into the posterior oral cavity and oropharynx.\n\n(Choice E) The omohyoid muscle travels from the hyoid bone to the clavicle and helps depress the hyoid during speech or swallowing. It is innervated by the ansa cervicalis, a branch of the cervical plexus.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nTemporomandibular joint disorder is associated with dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint and hypersensitivity of the mandibular nerve (CN V3). This can result in pathologic contraction of the muscles of mastication, including the masseter and pterygoids.",
    "zh": "该患者出现下颌疼痛，咀嚼时有咔哒声，并伴有头痛和颈部僵硬，提示颞下颌关节 (TMJ) 综合征。 TMJ 综合征的根本病因是多因素的，包括 TMJ 紊乱（例如，下颌错位、创伤）和下颌神经 (CN V3) 的过敏。 TMJ 的机械紊乱可导致 CN V3 受刺激和过度敏感，从而导致咬肌和翼肌的病理性收缩（加重下颌疼痛和功能障碍）。 有时可以在下颌支处触诊到这些肌肉的痉挛。\n\n重复的下颌运动（例如，嚼口香糖、磨牙）被认为会导致 TMJ 综合征的发展，原因是关节的负荷增加和压力增加。 与其他一些肌肉骨骼疼痛疾病（例如，紧张性头痛）一样，TMJ 疼痛似乎也与精神疾病和情绪困扰有关。\n\n（选项 A）颊肌位于脸颊下方，并将其贴近牙齿，以控制咀嚼时的食物团。它由面神经 (CN VII) 的一个分支支配。\n\n（选项 B）腭帆提肌在吞咽时提起软腭，以防止食物反流到鼻咽部。它由迷走神经 (CN X) 的咽支支配。\n\n（选项 D）下颌舌骨肌从下颌骨延伸到舌骨，形成口腔底部。虽然它由 CN V3 的一个分支支配，但它无助于闭合下颌。它在吞咽时起作用，抬高舌头和舌骨，将食物团推入后口腔和口咽部。\n\n（选项 E）肩胛舌骨肌从舌骨延伸到锁骨，并有助于在说话或吞咽时压低舌骨。它由颈丛的一个分支颈袢支配。\n\n教育目标：\n\n颞下颌关节疾病与颞下颌关节功能障碍和下颌神经 (CN V3) 过敏有关。这可能导致咀嚼肌的病理性收缩，包括咬肌和翼肌。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome and the muscles involved in mastication. It requires understanding the pathophysiology of TMJ syndrome and the role of the masseter muscle in jaw pain and dysfunction.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's symptoms (jaw pain, clicking, teeth grinding) and the muscles involved in chewing. Recall that the masseter and pterygoid muscles are the primary muscles of mastication and are often affected in TMJ disorders.",
