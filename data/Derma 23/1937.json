She was diagnosed with right breast carcinoma 12 years ago and treated with radical mastectomy. Extensive axillary lymph node dissection performed at that time revealed no lymph node metastases; the patient developed postoperative chronic lymphedema involving her right arm.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The firm, violaceous nodules on this patient's right upper arm in the setting of chronic lymphedema are consistent with angiosarcoma, a highly aggressive malignancy. Angiosarcomas involving the breast, axilla, or upper extremity classically occur after treatment of breast cancer due to either radiation exposure (resulting in lymph node sclerosis) or extensive lymph node dissection causing chronic lymphedema.\n\nDuring breast cancer treatment, the disruption of lymphatic channels can result in decreased drainage of the upper extremity, causing persistent lymphatic buildup and chronic lymphedema. Angiosarcoma develops in patients with chronic lymphedema, likely due to a combination of increased lymphatic proliferation, which increases the likelihood of malignant cells, and a decreased number of lymph nodes, which decreases the ability to remove the malignant cells.\n\nSymptoms often occur 10 years after breast cancer treatment, with the lymphatic arm or axilla developing firm, purple nodules or a poorly healing eschar that rapidly enlarges and coalesces. Because of the highly aggressive nature of angiosarcoma, patients typically have metastatic disease and a poor prognosis.\n\n(Choice B) Distant metastatic breast cancer is most likely to travel to bone, liver, and lung tissue. Although breast cancer can spread to the skin, this is more likely to occur over the anterior chest wall as erythema and a possible peau d'orange appearance.\n\n(Choice C) In most adults, neurofibromas typically present as a single, soft, rubbery, asymptomatic, cutaneous nodule that commonly appears during the second and third decades of life.\n\n(Choice D) Pyogenic granulomas, or lobular capillary hemangiomas, are benign vascular tumors composed of abnormal capillaries and granulation tissue. These tumors are usually solitary and often appear as red, friable lesions that bleed easily with trauma.\n\n(Choice E) In patients with malignancy, acute venous thrombosis can present as unilateral limb swelling, erythema, and, occasionally, a palpable cord (enlarged vein from thrombus); however, it does not cause violaceous nodules. In addition, the swelling in this patient's extremity is chronic, making this diagnosis less likely.\n\nEducational objective:\nAngiosarcomas classically occur after the treatment of breast cancer from either radiation exposure or chronic lymphedema with firm, violaceous nodules on the ipsilateral extremity.",
    "zh": "该患者右臂上在慢性淋巴水肿背景下出现的坚硬、紫红色结节与血管肉瘤相符，血管肉瘤是一种高度侵袭性的恶性肿瘤。涉及乳房、腋窝或上肢的血管肉瘤通常发生在乳腺癌治疗后，原因可能是放射线照射（导致淋巴结硬化）或广泛的淋巴结清扫术引起慢性淋巴水肿。\n\n在乳腺癌治疗期间，淋巴管的破坏会导致上肢引流减少，引起持续的淋巴液积聚和慢性淋巴水肿。血管肉瘤发生在慢性淋巴水肿患者中，这可能是由于淋巴管增生增加，增加了恶性细胞的可能性，以及淋巴结数量减少，降低了清除恶性细胞的能力。\n\n症状通常在乳腺癌治疗后10年出现，淋巴手臂或腋窝出现坚硬的紫色结节或愈合不良的焦痂，迅速增大和融合。由于血管肉瘤的高度侵袭性，患者通常有转移性疾病和不良预后。\n\n(选项 B) 远处转移性乳腺癌最有可能转移到骨、肝和肺组织。虽然乳腺癌可以扩散到皮肤，但这更有可能发生在胸前壁，表现为红斑和可能的橘皮样外观。\n\n(选项 C) 在大多数成年人中，神经纤维瘤通常表现为单个、柔软、橡胶状、无症状的皮肤结节，通常出现在生命的第二和第三个十年。\n\n(选项 D) 化脓性肉芽肿，或小叶毛细血管血管瘤，是良性血管肿瘤，由异常毛细血管和肉芽组织组成。这些肿瘤通常是孤立的，并且经常表现为红色、易碎的病变，受到创伤后容易出血。\n\n(选项 E) 在恶性肿瘤患者中，急性静脉血栓形成可表现为单侧肢体肿胀、红斑，偶尔可触及索条（血栓形成的静脉增大）；然而，它不会引起紫红色结节。此外，该患者肢体肿胀是慢性的，使得该诊断不太可能。\n\n教学目标：\n血管肉瘤通常发生在乳腺癌治疗后，原因可能是放射线照射或慢性淋巴水肿，在同侧肢体上出现坚硬的紫红色结节。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of angiosarcoma development in the setting of chronic lymphedema following breast cancer treatment. It requires recognizing the typical presentation of angiosarcoma as firm, violaceous nodules in the affected limb. \n\nThe best approach is to consider the patient's history of breast cancer and lymphedema. Then, recall the association between chronic lymphedema and the development of angiosarcoma, which presents with characteristic skin lesions.",
