    "en": "A 28-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 1, is seen in the clinic a week after spontaneous vaginal delivery. The delivery was performed under epidural analgesia and complicated by a prolonged second stage of labor. Since delivery, the patient has had frequent episodes of fecal incontinence, as well as mild perineal pain that is relieved by ibuprofen and opioid analgesics. She reports no other medical conditions, and her pregnancy was otherwise uncomplicated. On examination, a healing perineal laceration shows no signs of infection. Digital anorectal examination reveals decreased anal sphincter tone and loss of the anal wink reflex. Bilateral lower extremity reflexes are 2+ with normal tone.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This postpartum patient has fecal incontinence consistent with pudendal nerve injury, which compromises motor and sensory innervation to the perineal region. The pudendal nerve originates from the ventral rami of S2-S4 and passes between the piriformis and coccygeus muscles as it exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. It then reenters the pelvis near the ischial spine through the lesser sciatic foramen before dividing into its terminal branches. Sensory branches innervate the external genitalia and skin around the anus and perineum. Motor branches innervate the pelvic floor muscles and external urethral and anal sphincters.\n\nThe pudendal nerve is vulnerable to stretch injury because of its curved course around the ischial spine. Labor and delivery (particularly active pushing during a prolonged second stage of labor) place excess tension on the pudendal nerve, increasing the likelihood of injury. Injury may result in denervation and weakness of the voluntary perineal musculature, including the external anal sphincter, which can present as new-onset fecal incontinence and decreased anal sphincter tone on digital anorectal examination. Because perianal skin sensation is compromised, patients also have loss of the anal wink reflex.\n\n(Choice A) Cauda equina syndrome results from the compression of spinal nerve roots below the level of the conus medullaris. Patients present with severe unilateral or bilateral radicular pain, saddle anesthesia, and lower extremity weakness and hyporeflexia. Bowel and bladder incontinence are typically late manifestations.\n\n(Choice B) Lumbosacral plexopathy can occur due to direct compression of the lumbosacral trunk during fetal descent. Patients typically have transient footdrop and numbness of the lateral leg and dorsal foot.\n\n(Choice C) An adverse effect of opioids is constipation, not fecal incontinence, due to decreased intestinal motility from the activation of gastrointestinal mu-opioid receptors. Opioids do not affect anal sphincter tone or the anal wink reflex.\n\n(Choice E) Epidural hematoma is a rare complication of epidural analgesia that usually presents within hours to days, not weeks. Patients typically have sudden-onset back pain or radicular pain with progression to complete or partial paralysis of the lower extremities.\n\nEducational objective:\nPudendal nerve injury can occur due to excessive stress on the pelvic floor during labor and delivery (eg, prolonged second stage). Nerve injury leads to denervation and weakness of the perineal musculature (eg, external anal sphincter), which can present as new-onset fecal incontinence.",
    "zh": "这位产后患者的大便失禁与阴部神经损伤一致，这损害了会阴区域的运动和感觉神经支配。阴部神经起源于S2-S4的腹侧支，并穿过梨状肌和 coccygeus 肌肉之间，从大坐骨孔穿出骨盆。然后，它在坐骨棘附近通过小坐骨孔重新进入骨盆，然后分为其末端分支。感觉分支支配外生殖器以及肛门和会阴周围的皮肤。运动分支支配盆底肌肉以及尿道外括约肌和肛门括约肌。\n\n由于阴部神经围绕坐骨棘的弯曲走行，因此容易受到牵张损伤。产程和分娩（尤其是在产程第二产程延长期间的主动用力）会对阴部神经施加过大的张力，从而增加损伤的可能性。损伤可能导致自愿会阴肌肉的去神经支配和无力，包括肛门外括约肌，其表现可能为新发大便失禁和直肠指检时肛门括约肌张力下降。由于肛周皮肤感觉受损，患者也会丧失肛门反射。\n\n(选项A) 马尾综合征是由于圆锥髓以下水平的脊神经根受压所致。患者表现为严重的单侧或双侧神经根痛、马鞍区麻木以及下肢无力和反射减弱。肠和膀胱失禁通常是晚期表现。\n\n(选项B) 腰骶丛神经病变可由于胎儿下降过程中腰骶干的直接压迫而发生。患者通常出现短暂的足下垂和腿外侧及足背的麻木。\n\n(选项C) 阿片类药物的不良反应是便秘，而不是大便失禁，这是由于胃肠道μ-阿片受体激活导致肠蠕动减弱。阿片类药物不影响肛门括约肌张力或肛门反射。\n\n(选项E) 硬膜外血肿是硬膜外镇痛的罕见并发症，通常在数小时到数天内出现，而不是数周。患者通常会出现突发性背痛或神经根痛，并进展为下肢完全或部分瘫痪。\n\n教学目标：\n阴部神经损伤可由于分娩期间骨盆底过度应力而发生（例如，产程第二产程延长）。神经损伤导致会阴肌肉的去神经支配和无力（例如，肛门外括约肌），其表现可能为新发大便失禁。"

    "en": "This question tests the etiology of fecal incontinence in the postpartum period, specifically focusing on pudendal nerve injury as a result of prolonged labor. It requires knowledge of the anatomy of the pudendal nerve and its vulnerability to stretch injury during childbirth.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key findings of fecal incontinence, decreased anal sphincter tone, and loss of the anal wink reflex in the context of a prolonged second stage of labor. Consider the anatomical course of the pudendal nerve and its susceptibility to injury during childbirth.",
