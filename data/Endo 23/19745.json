    "en": "This patient has euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS) (also known as low T3 syndrome), characterized by a low T3 level, normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and normal T4. Thyroid hormone is released primarily in the form of T4, with conversion to T3 (the more active form) by 5'-deiodinase (types I and II) in peripheral tissues. In severe illness, high levels of cortisol, inflammatory cytokines, and free fatty acids suppress deiodination of T4, resulting in lower circulating levels of T3. Concurrently, upregulation of 5'-deiodinase type III leads to increased conversion of T4 to reverse T3 (inactive form).\n\nESS is thought to be a form of mild, transient central hypothyroidism, intended to decrease maladaptive catabolism in severe illness; treatment with exogenous thyroid hormone does not improve outcomes and is not indicated. With increasing duration and severity of illness, central production of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and TSH are also suppressed, leading to lower circulating TSH and T4 levels.\n\n(Choice B) Thyroglobulin is iodinated by thyroperoxidase (TPO) in follicular colloid. TPO activity is increased by TSH and suppressed by thioamides (eg, methimazole, propylthiouracil). Although TSH (and therefore iodination of thyroglobulin) falls in later ESS, this patient's TSH is normal, and his normal T4 level suggests adequate iodination.\n\n(Choice C) Although a small amount of T3 is produced in the thyroid (from T4 via 5'-deiodinase type II), most is produced in peripheral tissues. The fall in circulating T3 levels in ESS is primarily due to suppression of peripheral conversion.\n\n(Choice D) Iodine deficiency is rare in developed countries. When it occurs, it presents chronically with goiter and primary hypothyroidism (ie, elevated TSH, low T4). This patient has a normal TSH level, making iodine deficiency unlikely.\n\n(Choice E) Proinflammatory cytokines decrease TSH levels by reducing secretion of TRH in the hypothalamus. In patients with ESS, TSH increases normally following administration of exogenous TRH, suggesting an intact pituitary response to TRH.\n\nEducational objective:\nEuthyroid sick syndrome (ESS) is a common pattern of thyroid function markers seen in severely ill patients. It is characterized by decreased conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues. Initial findings include a low T3 level, but later, T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels may also decrease. ESS may represent a mild central hypothyroidism state, which functions to minimize catabolism in severe illness. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有甲状腺功能正常疾病综合征 (ESS)（也称为低T3综合征），其特征是低T3水平、促甲状腺激素 (TSH) 正常和T4正常。甲状腺激素主要以T4的形式释放，并通过外周组织中的5'-脱碘酶（I型和II型）转化为T3（活性更高）。在严重疾病中，高水平的皮质醇、炎症细胞因子和游离脂肪酸会抑制T4的脱碘，导致循环T3水平降低。同时，5'-脱碘酶III型上调导致T4向反T3（非活性形式）的转化增加。\n\nESS被认为是轻度、短暂的中枢性甲状腺功能减退症，旨在减少严重疾病中的适应不良分解代谢；外源性甲状腺激素治疗并不能改善预后，也没有指征。随着疾病持续时间和严重程度的增加，促甲状腺激素释放激素 (TRH) 和TSH的中枢产生也会受到抑制，导致循环TSH和T4水平降低。\n\n（选项B）甲状腺球蛋白由甲状腺过氧化物酶 (TPO) 在滤泡胶体中碘化。TPO活性受TSH升高和硫代酰胺（例如，甲硫咪唑、丙硫氧嘧啶）抑制。尽管ESS后期TSH（因此甲状腺球蛋白的碘化）会下降，但该患者的TSH是正常的，并且其T4水平正常表明碘化充足。\n\n（选项C）尽管甲状腺中会产生少量T3（由T4通过5'-脱碘酶II型产生），但大多数是在外周组织中产生的。ESS中循环T3水平下降的主要原因是外周转化的抑制。\n\n（选项D）发达国家很少发生碘缺乏症。当发生时，它会长期表现为甲状腺肿和原发性甲状腺功能减退症（即，TSH升高，T4降低）。该患者的TSH水平正常，因此碘缺乏的可能性不大。\n\n（选项E）促炎细胞因子通过减少下丘脑中TRH的分泌来降低TSH水平。在ESS患者中，在给予外源性TRH后，TSH会正常升高，这表明垂体对TRH的反应完整。\n\n教育目标：\n甲状腺功能正常疾病综合征 (ESS) 是在重症患者中常见的甲状腺功能标志物模式。其特征是外周组织中T4向T3的转化减少。初步发现包括低T3水平，但随后，T4和促甲状腺激素水平也可能下降。ESS可能代表一种轻度中枢性甲状腺功能减退症，其功能是尽量减少严重疾病中的分解代谢。{{exhibit_2}}"
