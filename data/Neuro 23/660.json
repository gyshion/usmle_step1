    "en": "A new inhaled anesthetic under development by a pharmaceutical company is tested in a series of experiments to determine its pharmacokinetic properties. During one of the experiments, the anesthetic agent is administered at a constant partial pressure while arterial and venous concentrations are monitored. The study results show that the anesthetic has a very large arteriovenous concentration gradient shortly after beginning inhalation. Which of the following best describes the properties of the new anesthetic?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Before gas anesthetics can reach the target organ (brain), they must move through a number of compartments (inhaled air → lungs → blood → brain). The onset of anesthesia occurs when a sufficient quantity of anesthetic is transferred to the brain. The factors shown in the table influence the rate of transfer of anesthetic through the compartments and determine the onset of action.\n\nThe arteriovenous concentration gradient is the difference between the concentration of a gas anesthetic in arterial and venous blood. The solubility of the anesthetic in the peripheral tissues is a major factor in determining the size of the arteriovenous gradient. If tissue solubility is high, a large amount of anesthetic is taken up from arterial blood, which results in low venous concentration. As a result, saturation of the blood requires further absorption of anesthetic in order to replace that which is absorbed by the peripheral tissues. Because blood saturation takes longer, brain saturation is also delayed and onset of action is slower.\n\nIn contrast, anesthetic gases with low peripheral tissue solubility have smaller arteriovenous gradients as there is less peripheral tissue uptake (Choices B and C). Less anesthetic is required to replace the amount absorbed by the peripheral tissue and so blood saturation occurs quickly, allowing concentrations in the brain to equilibrate faster (Choice A).\n\n(Choice D) Potency of the anesthetic is defined by the minimal alveolar concentration (MAC), the alveolar concentration that prevents movement in 50% of patients exposed to noxious stimuli. Potent anesthetics have low MACs. The arteriovenous concentration gradient influences the rate of induction, not anesthetic potency.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe arteriovenous concentration gradient reflects the overall tissue solubility of an anesthetic. Anesthetics with high tissue solubility are characterized by large arteriovenous concentration gradients and slower onsets of action.",
    "zh": "在气体麻醉药到达靶器官（大脑）之前，它们必须通过多个隔室（吸入空气 → 肺 → 血液 → 大脑）。当足够量的麻醉药转移到大脑时，麻醉开始。表中显示的因素影响麻醉药通过隔室的转移速率，并决定起效时间。\n\n动静脉浓度梯度是动脉血和静脉血中气体麻醉药浓度之间的差异。麻醉药在外周组织中的溶解度是决定动静脉梯度大小的一个主要因素。如果组织溶解度高，大量麻醉药会从动脉血中被吸收，导致静脉血浓度降低。因此，血液饱和需要进一步吸收麻醉药以取代被外周组织吸收的麻醉药。由于血液饱和所需时间更长，大脑饱和也会延迟，起效也会更慢。\n\n相反，外周组织溶解度低的麻醉气体具有较小的动静脉梯度，因为外周组织摄取较少（选项B和C）。只需要较少的麻醉药来补充被外周组织吸收的量，因此血液饱和会很快发生，从而使大脑中的浓度更快地达到平衡（选项A）。\n\n（选项D）麻醉药的效力由最小肺泡浓度（MAC）定义，MAC是在暴露于有害刺激的50％的患者中阻止活动的肺泡浓度。高效麻醉药具有较低的MAC。动静脉浓度梯度影响诱导速率，而不是麻醉效力。\n\n教育目标：\n动静脉浓度梯度反映麻醉药的总体组织溶解度。组织溶解度高的麻醉药的特征是具有大的动静脉浓度梯度和较慢的起效。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pharmacokinetic principles governing the onset of action of inhaled anesthetics, specifically the relationship between tissue solubility, the arteriovenous concentration gradient, and the rate of induction.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recognize that a large arteriovenous concentration gradient indicates significant uptake of the anesthetic by peripheral tissues. This high uptake leads to slower equilibration of the anesthetic in the blood and subsequently the brain, resulting in a slower onset of action. Therefore, a large gradient implies high peripheral tissue solubility and a slow onset.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试了对控制吸入麻醉药起效的药代动力学原理的理解，特别是组织溶解度、动静脉浓度梯度和诱导速率之间的关系。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须认识到大的动静脉浓度梯度表明外周组织对麻醉药的显着吸收。这种高摄取导致麻醉药在血液中以及随后的脑中平衡速度较慢，从而导致起效较慢。因此，大的梯度意味着外周组织溶解度高且起效慢。"
