    "en": "A 29-year-old woman comes to the office for treatment of anxiety that has worsened over the past year. She finds herself worrying all the time and fears that she may not complete her graduate studies in time to meet requirements for her degree. The patient is also worried about her son's health and anxiously obsesses about him all the time. She says, \"My anxiety just comes out of the blue; one way or another, I'm anxious all the time.\" The patient has no history of medical problems. Physical examination is unremarkable; complete blood count, chemistry panel, and TSH and B12 levels are normal. An anxiety disorder is diagnosed and fluoxetine is prescribed. The patient's anxiety begins to improve over the next 4-6 weeks. The physician explains that the medication inhibits the reuptake of a neurotransmitter released by a specific set of neurons. These neurons are most likely part of which of the following structures?",
    "zh": "一位29岁的女性来诊所治疗过去一年来恶化的焦虑症。她发现自己一直担心，并担心她可能无法及时完成研究生学业以满足其学位的要求。患者还担心她儿子的健康，并时刻焦虑地关注他。她说：“我的焦虑症突然出现；无论如何，我一直很焦虑。”患者没有病史。体格检查无特殊发现；全血细胞计数、化学检查、TSH 和 B12 水平正常。诊断为焦虑症并开具氟西汀处方。患者的焦虑在接下来的 4-6 周内开始好转。医生解释说，这种药物抑制了由一组特定神经元释放的神经递质的再摄取。这些神经元最有可能属于以下哪种结构？"

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "In the central nervous system (CNS), serotonergic (serotonin-releasing) neurons are primarily found in the raphe nuclei of the brainstem. The raphe nuclei are located in the midbrain, pons, and medulla, and axons from these cell bodies project widely throughout the CNS to synapse on structures such as the cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus, and spinal cord. These neurons play a role in the sleep-wake cycle, anxiety, mood, psychosis, sexuality, eating behavior, and impulsivity.\n\nMedications that target serotonin neurons are widely used in psychiatric disorders. Serotonergic antidepressants are the primary pharmacotherapy for most depressive and anxiety disorders. Antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs [eg, fluoxetine]), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants work by prolonging the amount of time that serotonin spends in the synaptic clefts of these neurons before being taken up by presynaptic neurons.\n\n(Choice A) The caudate nucleus and putamen form the striatum, which functions in motor activities. In Huntington disease, there is loss of cholinergic and GABA-releasing neurons in the striatum.\n\n(Choice B) The locus ceruleus houses norepinephrine-secreting neurons that participate in activation of the \"fight or flight\" response to physical and emotional stressors. It is located in the dorsal pons. These neurons are implicated in some anxiety symptoms, but they are not serotonergic and not affected by SSRIs.\n\n(Choice C) The nucleus basalis of Meynert houses the cell bodies of cholinergic neurons. In Alzheimer disease, these neurons secrete decreased amounts of acetylcholine.\n\n(Choice E) The red nucleus is located in the anterior midbrain. Its neurons participate in motor coordination of the upper extremities.\n\n(Choice F) The substantia nigra contains dopaminergic neurons. In Parkinson disease, these neurons are depleted.\n\nEducational objective:\nSerotonin-releasing neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) are located in the raphe nuclei. These neurons disseminate widely to synapse on numerous structures in the CNS. Antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants inhibit serotonin reuptake at these synapses.",
    "zh": "在中枢神经系统 (CNS) 中，血清素能（释放血清素）神经元主要位于脑干的中缝核。中缝核位于中脑、脑桥和延髓，这些细胞体的轴突广泛投射到整个中枢神经系统，并突触于诸如大脑皮层、丘脑、下丘脑、小脑、海马和脊髓等结构。这些神经元在睡眠-觉醒周期、焦虑、情绪、精神病、性行为、饮食行为和冲动方面起作用。\n\n靶向血清素神经元的药物广泛用于精神疾病。血清素能抗抑郁药是大多数抑郁症和焦虑症的主要药物治疗方法。抗抑郁药，如选择性血清素再摄取抑制剂 (SSRIs [例如，氟西汀])、血清素-去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂和三环类抗抑郁药，通过延长血清素在这些神经元的突触间隙中停留的时间（在被突触前神经元摄取之前）来发挥作用。\n\n(选项 A) 尾状核和壳核形成纹状体，其功能在于运动活动。在亨廷顿病中，纹状体中的胆碱能和 GABA 释放神经元会丧失。\n\n(选项 B) 蓝斑包含释放去甲肾上腺素的神经元，这些神经元参与激活对身体和情绪压力的“战斗或逃跑”反应。它位于脑桥背侧。这些神经元与某些焦虑症状有关，但它们不是血清素能神经元，并且不受 SSRIs 的影响。\n\n(选项 C) Meynert 基底核包含胆碱能神经元的胞体。在阿尔茨海默病中，这些神经元分泌的乙酰胆碱减少。\n\n(选项 E) 红核位于中脑前部。其神经元参与上肢的运动协调。\n\n(选项 F) 黑质包含多巴胺能神经元。在帕金森病中，这些神经元会耗竭。\n\n教育目标：\n在中枢神经系统 (CNS) 中，释放血清素的神经元位于中缝核。这些神经元广泛传播，并在 CNS 的多个结构上发生突触。抗抑郁药，如选择性血清素再摄取抑制剂、血清素-去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂和三环类抗抑郁药，可抑制这些突触处的血清素再摄取。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the neuroanatomical location of serotonergic neurons in the brain and their role in anxiety and mood regulation. It also assesses understanding of how SSRIs work by inhibiting serotonin reuptake in the synaptic cleft.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that serotonergic neurons are primarily located in the raphe nuclei of the brainstem. Understanding the mechanism of action of SSRIs and their effect on serotonin levels can also help identify the correct answer.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对大脑中血清素能神经元神经解剖学位置的了解以及它们在焦虑和情绪调节中的作用。它还评估了对 SSRIs 如何通过抑制突触间隙中血清素再摄取来发挥作用的理解。\n\n要解决这个问题，请回忆血清素能神经元主要位于脑干的中缝核。了解 SSRIs 的作用机制及其对血清素水平的影响也有助于确定正确的答案。"
