    "en": "A 60-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up of type 2 diabetes mellitus. His treatment regimen includes oral medications and a once-daily injection of long-acting subcutaneous insulin. The patient is adherent with treatment and has modified his lifestyle. Review of home glucose measurements shows that his postprandial glucose levels are frequently elevated; however, fasting levels are normal. He has no other medical conditions and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Hemoglobin A1c is 8.3%. Additional insulin therapy 3 times a day before each meal is planned to improve glycemic control.",

    "en": "The beta cells of the pancreas produce basal insulin continuously at a low level to suppress on-going hepatic gluconeogenesis. After meals, insulin secretion increases briefly to control the postprandial rise in blood glucose. Commercial insulin analogues with different pharmacokinetics can be given subcutaneously to replicate physiologic insulin secretion:\n\n*   **Long-acting insulins** (eg, glargine) mimic basal insulin secretion; they have an extended duration of action and little or no peak effect. They are typically given once daily and suppress fasting hyperglycemia, which is predominantly caused by inappropriate hepatic gluconeogenesis.\n*   **Rapid-acting insulins** (eg, lispro, aspart) are given to mimic the effects of postprandial insulin; they peak quickly and are then rapidly cleared. They are given prior to meals so that the peak effect coincides with postmeal glucose excursions; they control postprandial hyperglycemia. Because they are quickly cleared, they have minimal effect on fasting glucose levels. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nThis patient has normal fasting glucose levels, suggesting that his long-acting basal insulin regimen is appropriate but that he has elevated postprandial glucose. His postprandial hyperglycemia is best treated with a rapid-acting premeal insulin analogue, such as aspart, lispro, or glulisine. Regular insulin also can be given before mealtimes but has a more delayed peak onset and a longer duration of action compared to rapid-acting insulin analogues (which have amino acid changes that accelerate hexamer dissociation compared to regular insulin).\n\n(Choices B, C, and D) Insulins degludec, detemir, and glargine have long durations of action due to structural modifications (eg, polymerizing residues, fatty acid side chains) that delay absorption and distribution. They have minimal peak effect and are used as basal insulin substitutes.\n\n(Choice E) NPH, an intermediate-acting crystalline suspension of insulin with zinc/protamine, can be given twice daily when used as basal insulin. However, unlike other basal insulins, it has a noticeable peak effect and can lead to hypoglycemia if the peak does not correspond to a meal (eg, nocturnal hypoglycemia), making it a less preferable option for this use.",
    "zh": "胰腺的β细胞以低水平持续产生基础胰岛素，以抑制持续的肝脏糖异生。餐后，胰岛素分泌短暂增加以控制餐后血糖升高。具有不同药代动力学的商业胰岛素类似物可以通过皮下注射来复制生理性胰岛素分泌：\n\n*   **长效胰岛素**（如甘精胰岛素）模拟基础胰岛素分泌；它们具有延长的作用时间，峰值效应很小或没有。它们通常每天注射一次，并抑制空腹高血糖，空腹高血糖主要由不适当的肝脏糖异生引起。\n*   **速效胰岛素**（如赖脯胰岛素、门冬胰岛素）用于模拟餐后胰岛素的作用；它们迅速达到峰值，然后迅速清除。它们在餐前给予，以便峰值效应与餐后血糖升高同时发生；它们控制餐后高血糖。因为它们很快被清除，所以它们对空腹血糖水平的影响很小。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n该患者空腹血糖水平正常，表明他的长效基础胰岛素方案是合适的，但他的餐后血糖升高。他的餐后高血糖最好用速效餐前胰岛素类似物治疗，如门冬胰岛素、赖脯胰岛素或谷赖胰岛素。也可以在餐前给予普通胰岛素，但与速效胰岛素类似物相比，其峰值出现较晚，作用持续时间更长（速效胰岛素类似物具有氨基酸变化，加速六聚体解离）。\n\n（选项B、C和D）地特胰岛素、甘精胰岛素和赖脯胰岛素由于结构修饰（例如，聚合残基、脂肪酸侧链）而具有较长的作用时间，这会延迟吸收和分布。它们几乎没有峰值效应，用作基础胰岛素的替代品。\n\n（选项E）NPH是一种中效胰岛素，是含锌/鱼精蛋白的结晶悬液，当用作基础胰岛素时，可以每天注射两次。然而，与其他基础胰岛素不同的是，它具有明显的峰值效应，如果峰值与用餐时间不对应（例如，夜间低血糖），则可能导致低血糖，这使其成为不太可取的选择。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of insulin types and their appropriate use in managing postprandial hyperglycemia in a patient with type 2 diabetes. The question requires understanding the different pharmacokinetic profiles of insulin analogs and their suitability for addressing specific glycemic excursions.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the patient's specific glycemic pattern (elevated postprandial glucose with normal fasting glucose) and then select the insulin type that best addresses this pattern. Rapid-acting insulin analogs are ideal for controlling postprandial glucose spikes due to their rapid onset and short duration of action.",
