    "en": " A 45-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to 2 weeks of chest pain and cough. He has a history of advanced HIV and has taken his antiretroviral medications inconsistently over the past few months. Temperature is 38.1 C (100.6 F). Crackles are heard on pulmonary examination. CD4 cell count is 98/mm³. Chest x-ray reveals lung nodules and hilar lymphadenopathy. A bronchoscopy is performed. Mucicarmine staining of the patient's bronchoalveolar fluid reveals budding yeast forms with thick capsules. {{exhibit_1}} The microorganism responsible for this patient's pulmonary infection most frequently causes which of the following?",

    "en": "Budding yeasts with thick capsules that stain with mucicarmine are characteristic of Cryptococcus neoformans, which typically affects immunocompromised patients (ie, opportunistic pathogen). C neoformans is present in soil and pigeon droppings; it is transmitted by the respiratory route but not acquired via person-to-person contact. Inhaled yeast forms enter the lungs, and in immunocompetent persons, they are cleared by a macrophage response directed by T cells. In individuals with an impaired cellular immune response, C neoformans can disseminate and cause symptomatic disease, most commonly meningoencephalitis.\n\nCryptococcal meningoencephalitis is typically seen in patients with HIV, sarcoidosis, or leukemia and in those on high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Headache, nausea, vomiting, and confusion are common symptoms. Diagnosis can be made by examining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which shows round, budding, encapsulated yeasts. With India ink staining, the thick polysaccharide capsules classically appear as peripheral clearings or halos. Serologic testing (latex agglutination) is used to detect the C neoformans capsular antigen in CSF.\n\n(Choices A and D) Esophagitis in a patient with HIV is most commonly caused by Candida infection; it presents with odynophagia and is diagnosed by endoscopy with biopsy. Oral thrush due to Candida, which manifests as white oral plaques, is associated with diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression (eg, HIV), and treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids.\n\n(Choice B) Although C neoformans enters the body through the lungs, pulmonary symptoms are often not prominent. Some patients may develop cough, dyspnea, or pleuritic chest pain, but pulmonary cryptococcosis is a less common manifestation than cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. In contrast, Pneumocystis jirovecii is a frequent cause of pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals, but microscopy would show cup- or crescent-shaped organisms (not budding yeast with thick, mucicarmine-positive capsules).\n\n(Choice E) Mucormycosis, which classically affects the paranasal sinuses, occurs in immunocompromised patients and is strongly associated with diabetes mellitus and diabetic ketoacidosis. Aspergillus fumigatus is another fungus that may cause sinusitis.\n\n(Choice F) Cutaneous cryptococcal disease (eg, papules, pustules) is rare. Dimorphic fungi Blastomyces and Histoplasma may cause cutaneous lesions, but the yeast forms do not have mucicarmine-positive capsules.\n\nEducational objective:\nMeningoencephalitis is the most common symptomatic presentation of Cryptococcus neoformans infection and typically occurs in immunocompromised patients. Microscopically, C neoformans appears as budding yeasts with thick polysaccharide capsules, which can be demonstrated using mucicarmine or India ink staining. {{exhibit_2}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of opportunistic infections in HIV patients, specifically Cryptococcus neoformans, and its most common presentation as meningoencephalitis. It also assesses the ability to interpret staining results and correlate them with clinical findings.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key findings: HIV patient with low CD4 count, lung nodules, and mucicarmine-positive budding yeast with thick capsules. This points to Cryptococcus, and given the patient's immunocompromised state, meningoencephalitis is the most likely manifestation.",
