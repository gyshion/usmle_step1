    "en": "The mother of a 2-year-old boy calls the office for guidance regarding his recent illness. He has passed 4-6 stools daily over the last 2 days. The feces are liquid and contain no blood or mucus. His highest temperature reading at home was 37.8 C (100 F). He is eating, drinking, and being playful as usual. The patient has no prior medical problems and is up to date with vaccinations. He recently began going to day care. The mother is advised to bring the patient to the office for further evaluation. While awaiting medical evaluation, which of the following oral fluids is most effective to prevent dehydration in this patient?",

    "en": "Humans consume approximately 2 L of fluid each day and secrete an additional 7 L of fluid from upper digestive organs (eg, salivary glands, stomach, pancreas, gallbladder). Nearly all of this fluid is reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal lumen by the small intestine epithelium. The OSMOTIC GRADIENT for water reabsorption is largely established by the ACTIVE COTRANSPORT OF SODIUM into the apical end of enterocytes coupled with chloride, glucose, or amino acids. Sodium is then transported out of the basolateral end of the enterocyte (sodium/potassium ATPase), which pulls water down its osmotic gradient from the gastrointestinal lumen through the tight junctions between enterocytes and into the lamina propria (and ultimately the bloodstream).\n\nThis young patient who recently began going to day care likely has ACUTE INFECTIOUS DIARRHEA of a viral etiology (eg, rotavirus, norovirus). Infections that target the small intestine cause watery diarrhea by blocking the active transport of sodium chloride into the enterocyte or by increasing chloride excretion into the gastrointestinal lumen (mediated by elevated intracellular cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, or calcium). In this setting, oral rehydration with a hypotonic, EQUIMOLAR SODIUM-GLUCOSE SOLUTION maximizes water and sodium reabsorption by the remaining functional enterocytes, and is the most effective oral therapy for maintaining volume and electrolyte status in children with acute infectious diarrhea.\n\n(Choice A) Chicken broth with added salt is a hyperosmolar solution that can cause hypernatremia and is, therefore, not recommended.\n\n(Choice B) Diluted or undiluted cow's milk is not an effective rehydration solution during acute diarrhea due to impaired digestion of milk components, which can promote osmotic diarrhea.\n\n(Choice C) Filtered water alone is not usually sufficient to prevent dehydration in patients with acute infectious diarrhea due to the increased solute load in the gastrointestinal lumen, which causes most of the free water to be retained in the intestine and excreted in the feces.\n\n(Choices D and F) Although sports drinks and sugary fruit juices contain glucose, they often have significantly lower sodium concentrations and high osmolality. This ultimately reduces water reabsorption and may promote osmotic diarrhea.",
    "zh": "人类每天大约摄入2升液体，并从上消化器官（如唾液腺、胃、胰腺、胆囊）分泌额外的7升液体。几乎所有这些液体都通过小肠上皮从胃肠腔中重新吸收。水的再吸收的渗透梯度主要由钠主动共转运到肠细胞的顶端，并与氯离子、葡萄糖或氨基酸偶联。然后，钠从肠细胞的基底外侧端（钠/钾ATP酶）转运出来，这会将水沿着其渗透梯度从胃肠腔通过肠细胞之间的紧密连接拉入固有层（并最终进入血液）。\n\n这位最近开始上日托的年轻患者可能患有病毒病因的急性感染性腹泻（如轮状病毒、诺如病毒）。靶向小肠的感染通过阻断氯化钠主动转运进入肠细胞或通过增加氯离子排泄到胃肠腔（由细胞内环磷酸腺苷、环磷酸鸟苷或钙升高介导）引起水样腹泻。在这种情况下，使用低渗、等摩尔钠-葡萄糖溶液进行口服补液，可最大限度地促进剩余功能性肠细胞对水和钠的重吸收，是维持急性感染性腹泻患儿容量和电解质状态最有效的口服疗法。\n\n（选项A）加盐的鸡汤是一种高渗溶液，可引起高钠血症，因此不推荐。\n\n（选项B）稀释或未稀释的牛奶在急性腹泻期间不是有效的补液溶液，因为牛奶成分的消化受损，这可能促进渗透性腹泻。\n\n（选项C）由于胃肠腔内的溶质负荷增加，单靠过滤水通常不足以防止急性感染性腹泻患者脱水，这会导致大部分游离水保留在肠道中并随粪便排出。\n\n（选项D和F）尽管运动饮料和含糖果汁含有葡萄糖，但它们的钠浓度通常显着较低，渗透压较高。这最终会减少水的再吸收并可能促进渗透性腹泻。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of appropriate oral rehydration solutions for children with acute infectious diarrhea, focusing on the importance of sodium and glucose balance for optimal water absorption in the gut. The key is to recognize that hypotonic, equimolar sodium-glucose solutions are most effective for rehydration in this setting due to their ability to maximize water and sodium reabsorption by the remaining functional enterocytes.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the pathophysiology of diarrhea and the mechanisms of fluid and electrolyte loss. Evaluate each option based on its sodium and glucose content, and select the solution that best promotes water reabsorption while avoiding hypernatremia or osmotic diarrhea.",
