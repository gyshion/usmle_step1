She has no significant medical history but takes oral contraceptives. Examination shows decreased right upper extremity strength and expressive aphasia. Cardiac auscultation is normal. MRI of the brain reveals acute infarction in the left frontal lobe. Further evaluation to determine an etiology is performed.

    "en": "This young patient had a CRYPTOGENIC STROKE, which is evaluated with echocardiography with a “bubble study” to identify right-to-left intracardiac shunts. This study is performed by injecting agitated normal saline intravenously and observing for microbubbles in the left heart. Shunt detection is improved by having the patient release a sustained Valsalva maneuver, which increases right atrial pressure. Cryptogenic stroke is frequently associated with atrial septal abnormalities such as PATENT FORAMEN OVALE (PFO) and atrial septal defect (ASD). During fetal development, the foramen ovale shunts oxygenated fetal blood across from the right to the left atrium. After delivery, umbilical cord clamping and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance lower right atrial pressure and raise left atrial pressure. This pushes the SEPTUM PRIMUM against the SEPTUM SECUNDUM, closing the foramen ovale. Over time, fibrosis and tissue remodeling fuse the flap closed. INCOMPLETE FUSION occurs in approximately 25% of normal adults, resulting in a PFO. PFO usually remains functionally closed and asymptomatic after birth as left atrial pressure is greater than right atrial pressure. However, conditions that raise right atrial pressure above left atrial pressure (eg, Valsalva release) produce a transient right-to-left shunt across the PFO. This is particularly concerning in patients with hypercoagulability (eg, oral contraceptive use) as they are at increased risk for venous thrombosis and PARADOXICAL BRAIN EMBOLISM. Chronically elevated right heart pressure (eg, Eisenmenger syndrome) is not necessary for paradoxical embolism.\n\n(Choice A) ASD results from aplasia of the septum primum or septum secundum during development. Although ASD may lead to paradoxical embolism, it is much less common than PFO and characterized by fixed splitting of S2. Unrepaired ASDs may lead to heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or Eisenmenger syndrome.\n\n(Choice B) Incomplete development of the aorticopulmonary septum results in truncus arteriosus, which causes cyanosis in newborns and requires early surgical repair.\n\n(Choice C) Incomplete closure of the interventricular foramen results in ventricular septal defect (VSD), which causes a holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border. Large VSDs can cause significant left-to-right shunting, leading to heart failure in infancy; however, VSDs infrequently lead to paradoxical embolism.\n\n(Choice E) The ductus arteriosus functionally closes within 24 hours after delivery. Persistent patent ductus arteriosus causes a continuous murmur and may eventually result in heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or Eisenmenger syndrome. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "这位年轻患者患有隐源性卒中，通过超声心动图和“气泡试验”进行评估，以识别右向左的心内分流。该研究通过静脉注射激动的生理盐水，观察左心内的微气泡来进行。让患者进行持续的瓦尔萨瓦动作可提高分流检测的准确性，这会增加右心房压力。隐源性卒中常与心房间隔异常有关，如卵圆孔未闭 (PFO) 和房间隔缺损 (ASD)。在胎儿发育过程中，卵圆孔将含氧胎儿血液从右心房分流到左心房。分娩后，脐带结扎和肺血管阻力降低会降低右心房压力并升高左心房压力。这会将原发隔推向继发隔，从而关闭卵圆孔。随着时间的推移，纤维化和组织重塑会将瓣膜融合关闭。约25%的正常成年人发生不完全融合，导致PFO。PFO在出生后通常保持功能性关闭且无症状，因为左心房压力大于右心房压力。然而，当右心房压力高于左心房压力时（例如，瓦尔萨瓦释放），会通过PFO产生短暂的右向左分流。这对于患有高凝状态的患者（例如，服用口服避孕药）来说尤其令人担忧，因为他们患静脉血栓形成和反常性脑栓塞的风险增加。慢性升高的右心压力（例如，艾森门格综合征）对于反常性栓塞不是必需的。\n\n(选项 A) ASD由发育期间原发隔或继发隔发育不全引起。虽然ASD可能导致反常性栓塞，但它比PFO少见得多，其特征是S2固定分裂。未经修复的ASD可能导致心力衰竭、肺动脉高压或艾森门格综合征。\n\n(选项 B) 主动脉肺间隔发育不全导致动脉干，这会导致新生儿发绀，需要早期手术修复。\n\n(选项 C) 室间隔孔闭合不全导致室间隔缺损 (VSD)，这会导致在左下胸骨缘出现全收缩期杂音。大的VSD可引起明显的左向右分流，导致婴儿期心力衰竭；然而，VSD很少导致反常性栓塞。\n\n(选项 E) 动脉导管在出生后24小时内功能性关闭。持续性动脉导管未闭会导致连续性杂音，并可能最终导致心力衰竭、肺动脉高压或艾森门格综合征。 {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"
