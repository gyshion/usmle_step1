    "en": "A 65-year-old man with benign prostatic hyperplasia comes to the office for a follow-up appointment. He has a history of obstructive urinary symptoms that were unrelieved with tamsulosin, and a new medication was prescribed at his last visit 8 months ago. Since starting the new medication, the patient has experienced gradual improvement in urinary hesitancy and strength of urinary stream. However, he also has noticed a significant increase in the size of his breasts. The patient reports no pain or changes in weight. Glandular tissue, approximately 2 cm in diameter, is palpated under the nipples and is mildly tender to palpation. There is no nipple discharge, breast asymmetry, or rash. This patient's breast findings are most likely due to which of the following drug effects?",

    "en": "Gynecomastia is the abnormal development of glandular breast tissue in males. It is characterized by ductal epithelial hyperplasia with fibrosis of the surrounding stroma. Breast growth is inhibited by androgens and promoted by estrogens; conditions that cause increased estrogen/androgen ratio can lead to gynecomastia. This patient, who did not respond to first-line therapy (ie, tamsulosin, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist) for benign prostatic hyperplasia, has likely been prescribed a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (eg, finasteride, dutasteride). These medications block conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which has a higher affinity for the testosterone receptor and mediates most testosterone effects (including prostatic hyperplasia). However, the excess testosterone is then converted to estrogen (eg, estradiol) by aromatase in various tissues (eg, adipose, bone), leading to gynecomastia. Both the beneficial effects and potential gynecomastia of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors develop slowly and are generally not apparent in the first several months of therapy. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Androgen receptor antagonists (eg, flutamide, bicalutamide) are competitive inhibitors that block the binding of androgens in target tissues; these agents are widely used in metastatic prostate cancer but not for treating BPH.\n\n(Choices B and C) Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent that inhibits enzymes in the steroid hormone biosynthetic pathway, reducing testosterone synthesis. Spironolactone is an aldosterone receptor antagonist that also decreases testosterone synthesis in addition to cross-inhibition of the androgen receptor. Both drugs also can displace estrogen from plasma binding proteins and raise free estrogen levels, but neither is used in BPH.\n\n(Choice E) Pituitary prolactin secretion is under negative regulation by dopamine. Dopamine receptor antagonists (eg, antipsychotic medications) facilitate increased prolactin release and can occasionally cause galactorrhea. The resulting hyperprolactinemia can also suppress release of FSH and LH, leading to central hypogonadism (and rarely gynecomastia).\n\nEducational objective:\n5-alpha reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride, dutasteride) are used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. They block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone; the excess testosterone is then available for conversion to estrogens (eg, estradiol) by aromatase, which can lead to gynecomastia. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "男性乳房发育症是男性腺体乳房组织的异常发育。其特征是导管上皮增生伴有周围间质的纤维化。雄激素抑制乳房生长，雌激素促进乳房生长；导致雌激素/雄激素比例增加的情况可导致男性乳房发育症。该患者对一线治疗（即坦索罗辛，一种α-肾上腺素能受体拮抗剂）良性前列腺增生症无效，很可能被开了5-α还原酶抑制剂（如非那雄胺、度他雄胺）。这些药物可阻断睾酮向二氢睾酮的转化，二氢睾酮对睾酮受体的亲和力更高，并介导大多数睾酮作用（包括前列腺增生）。然而，过量的睾酮随后会被芳香化酶在各种组织（如脂肪、骨骼）中转化为雌激素（如雌二醇），从而导致男性乳房发育症。5-α还原酶抑制剂的有益作用和潜在的男性乳房发育症都是缓慢发展的，通常在治疗的最初几个月内不明显。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项A) 雄激素受体拮抗剂（如氟他胺、比卡鲁胺）是竞争性抑制剂，可阻断雄激素在靶组织中的结合；这些药物广泛用于转移性前列腺癌，但不用于治疗BPH。\n\n(选项B和C) 酮康唑是一种抗真菌剂，可抑制类固醇激素生物合成途径中的酶，从而减少睾酮的合成。螺内酯是一种醛固酮受体拮抗剂，除了交叉抑制雄激素受体外，还可以减少睾酮的合成。两种药物还可以从血浆结合蛋白中置换雌激素并提高游离雌激素水平，但均不用于BPH。\n\n(选项E) 垂体催乳素的分泌受多巴胺的负向调节。多巴胺受体拮抗剂（如抗精神病药物）促进催乳素释放增加，偶尔可引起溢乳。由此产生的催乳素血症也可抑制FSH和LH的释放，导致中枢性性腺功能减退症（很少出现男性乳房发育症）。\n\n教学目标：\n5-α还原酶抑制剂（如非那雄胺、度他雄胺）用于治疗良性前列腺增生症。它们可阻断睾酮向二氢睾酮的转化；过量的睾酮随后可通过芳香化酶转化为雌激素（如雌二醇），这可导致男性乳房发育症。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of medication-induced gynecomastia, specifically the mechanism by which 5-alpha reductase inhibitors can lead to increased estrogen levels and subsequent breast enlargement in men. It also requires understanding of the hormonal pathways involved in benign prostatic hyperplasia treatment. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that 5-alpha reductase inhibitors block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, leading to an accumulation of testosterone. This excess testosterone is then aromatized into estradiol, resulting in gynecomastia. Understanding the mechanism of action of the medication is crucial.",
