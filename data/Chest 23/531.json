    "en": "This patient has cough, shortness of breath, fever, and a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray, indicating lobar pneumonia likely due to a community-acquired pathogen (eg, *Streptococcus pneumoniae*). Lobar pneumonia is characterized by a step-wise inflammatory response, as follows:\n\n1.  Congestion (day 0-2) – Neutrophils respond to bacterial components (eg, peptidoglycan) by releasing cytokines that increase the permeability of the pulmonary capillary endothelium, which allows circulating immune cells to more easily migrate to the area. Increased capillary permeability also leads to the accumulation of erythrocytes and abundant proteinaceous fluid in the alveolar space, resulting in the affected lobe becoming heavy and red.\n2.  Red hepatization (day 2-4) – The proteinaceous fluid transforms into fibrin strands, resulting in a confluent exudate of fibrin, neutrophils, and erythrocytes. On gross examination, the lobe appears liver-like: Red, firm, and airless.\n3.  Gray hepatization (day 4-7) – Red cell disintegration along with increased leukocyte infiltration causes the lung to appear gray rather than red. Neutrophils begin to be replaced by macrophages that begin the repair process.\n4.  Resolution (>7 days) – Macrophages secrete digestive enzymes that liquefy the fibrinous exudate, which is reabsorbed, expectorated, or phagocytized by macrophages. The lung parenchyma regains its normal appearance by approximately 3 weeks.\n\nBesides lobar pneumonia, there are 2 other major morphologic categories of pneumonia. **Bronchopneumonia** is an infection of the terminal bronchioles that results in patchy consolidation of a number of lobules. Interstitial pneumonia is an infection of the interstitial tissue of the lung with minimal or no alveolar infiltrate; atypical pneumonias (eg, *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*, *Chlamydia pneumoniae*) are often associated with an interstitial infiltrate.\n\n(Choice A) Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the alveoli due to elevations in hydrostatic pressure within the pulmonary capillaries. Examination often reveals bibasilar crackles and chest x-ray typically shows perihilar alveolar edema with cephalization of the pulmonary vessels {{exhibit_2}}.\n\n(Choice B) Asthma is characterized by smooth muscle inflammation of the airways leading to intermittent bronchoconstriction and airflow obstruction. Although cough and shortness of breath can occur during asthma exacerbations, fever and a lobar infiltrate are not typical {{exhibit_3}}.\n\n(Choice C) Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is associated with pulmonary fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition leading to progressive destruction of the pulmonary architecture. Patients typically present with slowly worsening dyspnea, nonproductive cough, and bilateral \"Velcro\"-sounding crackles. Fever is uncommon and chest x-ray usually reveals increased reticular (interstitial) markings {{exhibit_4}}.\n\n(Choice E) Chronic bronchitis is associated with goblet cell metaplasia and inflammation in the large airways. The hypersecretion of mucous can lead to chronic productive cough, dyspnea, and wheezes on examination. Lobar infiltrate is uncommon as the alveoli are not primarily affected {{exhibit_5}}.\n\nEducational objective:\nLobar pneumonia is marked by the cytokine-mediated accumulation of neutrophils and proteinaceous material in the alveoli. Over several days, the proteinaceous material becomes fibrinous, neutrophils are replaced by macrophages, and macrophages digest the fibrinous exudate, thereby restoring normal lung histology.",
    "zh": "该患者出现咳嗽、呼吸困难、发热，胸片显示右下肺浸润，提示可能由社区获得性病原体（如肺炎链球菌）引起的肺叶性肺炎。肺叶性肺炎的特征是分阶段的炎症反应，如下所示：\n\n1.  充血期（0-2天）——中性粒细胞通过释放细胞因子来响应细菌成分（如肽聚糖），这些细胞因子会增加肺毛细血管内皮的通透性，从而使循环免疫细胞更容易迁移到该区域。毛细血管通透性增加也会导致红细胞和丰富的蛋白质样液体在肺泡腔内积聚，导致受累肺叶变得沉重且呈红色。\n2.  红肝变期（2-4天）——蛋白质样液体转化为纤维蛋白链，导致纤维蛋白、中性粒细胞和红细胞的融合性渗出物。肉眼检查时，肺叶呈肝样：红色、坚实、无气。\n3.  灰肝变期（4-7天）——红细胞崩解以及白细胞浸润增加导致肺部呈现灰色而不是红色。中性粒细胞开始被巨噬细胞取代，巨噬细胞开始修复过程。\n4.  消散期（>7天）——巨噬细胞分泌消化酶，使纤维蛋白性渗出物液化，然后被巨噬细胞吸收、咳出或吞噬。肺实质在约3周内恢复正常外观。\n\n除了肺叶性肺炎外，还有另外两个主要的肺炎形态学类别。**支气管肺炎**是终末细支气管的感染，导致多个小叶出现斑片状实变。间质性肺炎是肺间质组织的感染，肺泡浸润极少或没有肺泡浸润；非典型肺炎（如肺炎支原体、肺炎衣原体）通常与间质浸润有关。\n\n（选项A）心源性肺水肿的特征是由于肺毛细血管内静水压升高导致液体在肺泡中积聚。检查通常显示双肺底啰音，胸片通常显示肺门周围肺泡水肿伴肺血管头化 {{exhibit_2}}。\n\n（选项B）哮喘的特征是气道平滑肌炎症导致间歇性支气管收缩和气流阻塞。虽然哮喘加重期间可能出现咳嗽和呼吸困难，但发热和肺叶浸润并不典型 {{exhibit_3}}。\n\n（选项C）特发性肺纤维化与肺成纤维细胞增殖和细胞外基质沉积相关，导致肺结构进行性破坏。患者通常表现为逐渐恶化的呼吸困难、干咳和双侧“Velcro”样啰音。发热不常见，胸片通常显示网状（间质）纹理增加 {{exhibit_4}}。\n\n（选项E）慢性支气管炎与大气道杯状细胞化生和炎症相关。黏液过度分泌可导致慢性咳痰、呼吸困难和检查时出现喘息。肺叶浸润不常见，因为肺泡未受到主要影响 {{exhibit_5}}。\n\n教学目标：\n肺叶性肺炎的特征是细胞因子介导的中性粒细胞和蛋白质样物质在肺泡中的积聚。经过几天，蛋白质样物质变成纤维蛋白，中性粒细胞被巨噬细胞取代，巨噬细胞消化纤维蛋白性渗出物，从而恢复正常的肺组织学。"
