    "en": "A 15-year-old boy develops severe cardiomyopathy following myocarditis from Coxsackie virus and is placed on the cardiac transplant list. Two weeks following his cardiac transplantation from a matched donor, he develops dyspnea on exertion. Extensive evaluation is undertaken including cardiac catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy to assess for acute allograft rejection. Which of the following histologic findings is most consistent with this diagnosis?",

    "en": "Acute cardiac transplant rejection typically occurs within 6 months of transplantation and can be diagnosed via endomyocardial biopsy. Acute rejection can be cell-mediated (ie, acute cellular rejection [ACR]) or, less commonly, antibody-mediated (ie, acute antibody-mediated rejection). {{exhibit_1}}\n\nIn ACR, host T-lymphocytes are sensitized against foreign human leukocyte antigens (HLA) in the cardiac allograft, which leads to inflammation and injury to the transplanted organ. Microscopic features of ACR include an interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate (primarily T-lymphocytes) and damaged myocytes.\n\nSymptoms consistent with progressive rejection include those found in systolic dysfunction (eg, dyspnea on exertion). However, cardiac transplant recipients undergo close surveillance with regular endomyocardial biopsies, and acute rejection is often diagnosed before patients become symptomatic.\n\n(Choice A) Concentric intimal thickening of the coronary arteries can be seen in cardiac allograft vasculopathy, an important cause of ischemic damage and long-term graft dysfunction. The pathogenesis is complex and includes the release of cytokines that cause smooth muscle cell proliferation in the vessel wall.\n\n(Choice C) Patchy necrosis with granulation tissue is indicative of ischemic damage to the donor heart. Ischemia in a donor heart can occur in a variety of situations including during attempted resuscitation of the donor patient, during transport of the organ from the donor to the recipient, and acutely during initial perfusion of the organ after transplantation.\n\n(Choice D) Perivascular infiltrate with abundant eosinophils is a histopathologic feature of hypersensitivity myocarditis. Hypersensitivity myocarditis often represents an immunologic response to a newly initiated drug.\n\n(Choice E) Interstitial fibrosis with scant inflammation can be seen in chronic rejection of solid organ transplants. Chronic rejection is mediated by host T-lymphocytes as well as antibodies and classically occurs months to years following transplantation.\n\nEducational objective:\nAcute cardiac transplant rejection usually occurs weeks to months following transplantation and is primarily a cell-mediated process. In acute cellular rejection, endomyocardial biopsy shows an interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate with myocyte damage.",
    "zh": "急性心脏移植排斥反应通常发生在移植后的6个月内，可以通过心内膜心肌活检进行诊断。急性排斥反应可以是细胞介导的（即，急性细胞排斥反应[ACR]），或者，不太常见的是，抗体介导的（即，急性抗体介导的排斥反应）。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n在ACR中，宿主T淋巴细胞对心脏同种异体移植中的异源人类白细胞抗原（HLA）敏感，这会导致炎症并损伤移植器官。ACR的显微特征包括间质淋巴细胞浸润（主要是T淋巴细胞）和受损的心肌细胞。\n\n与进行性排斥反应一致的症状包括在收缩功能障碍中发现的那些症状（例如，劳力性呼吸困难）。然而，心脏移植受者接受密切监测，定期进行心内膜心肌活检，并且通常在患者出现症状之前诊断出急性排斥反应。\n\n（选项A）冠状动脉的同心性内膜增厚可见于心脏同种异体血管病，这是缺血性损伤和长期移植功能障碍的重要原因。发病机制很复杂，包括细胞因子的释放，导致血管壁平滑肌细胞增生。\n\n（选项C）斑片状坏死伴肉芽组织表明供体心脏的缺血性损伤。供体心脏的缺血可发生在多种情况下，包括在尝试复苏供体患者期间、器官从供体运输到受者期间以及移植后器官的初始灌注期间。\n\n（选项D）血管周围浸润伴大量嗜酸性粒细胞是超敏反应性心肌炎的组织病理学特征。超敏反应性心肌炎通常代表对新开始的药物的免疫反应。\n\n（选项E）间质纤维化伴少量炎症可见于实体器官移植的慢性排斥反应。慢性排斥反应由宿主T淋巴细胞和抗体介导，并且通常发生在移植后的几个月到几年。\n\n教育目标：\n急性心脏移植排斥反应通常发生在移植后数周到数月，主要是一个细胞介导的过程。在急性细胞排斥反应中，心内膜心肌活检显示间质淋巴细胞浸润伴心肌细胞损伤。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of acute cardiac transplant rejection, specifically the histologic findings associated with cell-mediated rejection. It requires understanding the timeline of rejection and the immune mechanisms involved.\n\nThe best approach is to recall that acute cellular rejection is primarily T-cell mediated and manifests as lymphocytic infiltration and myocyte damage on biopsy.
