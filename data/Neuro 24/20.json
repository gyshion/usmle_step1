    "en": "A 56-year-old man dies in the hospital due to aspiration-related complications. The patient was admitted 5 days ago with right-sided weakness, sensory loss, and difficulty with speech and swallowing. A CT scan revealed an area of hypodensity in the left frontoparietal region. Autopsy examination is performed, and a section of loose, spongy tissue from the abnormal brain area is obtained. Histologic findings after staining for lipids are shown below. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient developed acute-onset neurologic deficits (eg, hemiparesis, dysphagia, dysarthria) secondary to an ischemic stroke, which was confirmed by CT scan and autopsy findings. An ischemic infarct results from regional hypoperfusion (eg, thrombosis, embolism) or a global decline in cerebral blood flow. Characteristic CT findings are evident 6-12 hours after the onset of ischemic injury and include hypoattenuation of the tissue and loss of grey-white matter differentiation within the affected region. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nMicroscopically, neurons in the necrotic area display signs of irreversible damage during the first 24 hours after injury (red neurons). Neutrophils initially move into the area in the first 1-2 days, followed by microglia (derived from yolk-sac monocytes) 3-7 days after the onset of ischemia. As the neurons disintegrate, their fragments are phagocytized by microglia, and myelin breakdown products accumulate in the cytoplasm of microglia as foamy lipids. Infiltration of the brain tissue by microglia (arrow) is seen on light microscopy in the photo and is consistent with the expected histology findings 5 days post-infarction. {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(Choices A and C) In peripheral tissues, fibroblasts migrate to the area of injury to participate in tissue repair. However, in the central nervous system, repair is instead performed by astrocytes that migrate to the area of necrosis within 2 weeks of injury to begin forming a glial scar.\n\n(Choices B and F) Although both ependymal cells and Schwann cells process lipids and would be prominent on lipid stain, neither type of cell participates in central nervous system repair after ischemic infarction.\n\n(Choice E) Neutrophils are the predominant type of inflammatory cell 1-2 days after cerebral infarction and release inflammatory mediators that contribute to the hydrolysis of cells in liquefactive necrosis. They would not be prominent on lipid stain.\n\nEducational objective:\nMicroglia are the predominant cell in the necrotic area 3-7 days after the onset of ischemia and phagocytize the fragments of neurons, myelin, and necrotic debris. {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "该患者出现急性起病的神经功能缺损（如，偏瘫、吞咽困难、构音障碍），继发于缺血性卒中，这已通过CT扫描和尸检结果证实。缺血性梗死是由局部灌注不足（如，血栓形成、栓塞）或脑血流量的整体下降引起的。特征性的CT表现可在缺血性损伤发生后6-12小时内显现，包括组织低衰减以及受影响区域内灰质和白质分界的消失。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n在显微镜下，坏死区域的神经元在损伤后的最初24小时内表现出不可逆损伤的迹象（红染神经元）。中性粒细胞最初在最初1-2天内进入该区域，随后是小胶质细胞（来源于卵黄囊单核细胞），在缺血发生后3-7天。随着神经元的瓦解，它们的碎片被小胶质细胞吞噬，并且髓磷脂分解产物以泡沫脂质的形式在小胶质细胞的细胞质中积累。在照片的光学显微镜下可见小胶质细胞（箭头）浸润脑组织，这与预期梗死后5天的组织学发现一致。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n（选项A和C）在外周组织中，成纤维细胞迁移到损伤区域以参与组织修复。然而，在中枢神经系统中，修复是由星形胶质细胞进行的，星形胶质细胞在损伤后2周内迁移到坏死区域，开始形成神经胶质瘢痕。\n\n（选项B和F）尽管室管膜细胞和许旺细胞都能处理脂质，并且会在脂质染色中显着出现，但两种细胞类型均不参与缺血性梗死后中枢神经系统的修复。\n\n（选项E）中性粒细胞是脑梗死后1-2天主要的炎症细胞类型，并释放炎症介质，这些介质有助于液化性坏死中细胞的水解。它们在脂质染色中不会很突出。\n\n教育目标：\n小胶质细胞是缺血发生后3-7天坏死区域的主要细胞，并吞噬神经元、髓磷脂和坏死碎片的碎片。{{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the cellular response to ischemic stroke in the central nervous system, specifically the role and appearance of microglia during the subacute phase of infarction. It assesses the ability to correlate histological findings with the temporal progression of tissue damage and cellular infiltration.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recognize the clinical presentation of an ischemic stroke and the characteristic pathological changes that occur in the brain over time. Identifying the lipid-laden cells in the histological specimen as microglia is key, understanding that these cells are responsible for phagocytosing debris in the subacute phase of infarction.",
