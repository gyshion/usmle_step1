    "en": "The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve {{exhibit_1}} describes the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood and the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin. The partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated (P₅₀) is a value used as a conventional measure of hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. The P₅₀ is about 26 mm Hg in normal individuals. A P₅₀ shift from 26 to 20 mm Hg indicates that the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is increased (left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve).\n\nMutations that cause production of hemoglobin with high oxygen affinity (eg, hemoglobins Chesapeake and Kempsey) reduce the ability of hemoglobin to release oxygen within the peripheral tissues. Low oxygen levels stimulate the kidneys to increase erythropoietin synthesis, which results in a compensatory ERYTHROCYTOSIS that helps maintain normal oxygen delivery. Therefore, patients with high oxygen affinity hemoglobins are typically asymptomatic.\n\n(Choice B) Sickle cell disease can result in hypoxia-induced hemolysis due to the ability of deoxygenated hemoglobin S to polymerize and cause excessive erythrocyte sickling and irreversible cell membrane damage. The oxygen dissociation curve for hemoglobin S is shifted to the right (↓ oxygen affinity) due to the stabilizing effects of polymerization on the deoxygenated form.\n\n(Choice C) Hereditary spherocytosis results from a variety of molecular defects involving erythrocyte structural proteins responsible for linking the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton (eg, spectrin, ankyrin). The resulting membrane instability leads to the formation of spherocytes – small, rounded erythrocytes with increased susceptibility to lyse in hypotonic solutions.\n\n(Choice D) Megaloblastic erythrocyte changes (↑ MCV) are characteristically seen in vitamin B₁₂ and folic acid deficiency due to impaired DNA synthesis.\n\n(Choice E) Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency develop rapid hemolysis during periods of increased oxidant stress, such as when taking antimalarials or sulfonamides or after ingestion of fava beans.\n\nEducational objective:\nP₅₀ refers to the partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated. Hemoglobins with high oxygen affinity have a decreased P₅₀ that is represented by a leftward shift of the oxygen dissociation curve. The reduced ability to release oxygen within the peripheral tissues leads to renal hypoxia, increased erythropoietin synthesis, and compensatory erythrocytosis.",
    "zh": "氧-血红蛋白解离曲线{{exhibit_1}}描述了血液中氧分压与血红蛋白氧饱和度之间的关系。血红蛋白50%饱和时的氧分压 (P₅₀) 是衡量血红蛋白对氧的亲和力的一个常用值。正常个体的P₅₀约为26 mmHg。P₅₀从26 mmHg变为20 mmHg表明血红蛋白对氧的亲和力增加（氧解离曲线左移）。\n\n导致产生高氧亲和力血红蛋白的突变（例如，切萨皮克和坎普西血红蛋白）会降低血红蛋白在周围组织内释放氧气的能力。低氧水平刺激肾脏增加促红细胞生成素的合成，这导致代偿性红细胞增多症，有助于维持正常的氧气供应。因此，具有高氧亲和力血红蛋白的患者通常没有症状。\n\n(选项B) 镰状细胞病可导致低氧诱导的溶血，这是由于脱氧血红蛋白S能够聚合，引起红细胞过度镰变和不可逆的细胞膜损伤。由于聚合对脱氧形式的稳定作用，血红蛋白S的氧解离曲线右移（↓ 氧亲和力）。\n\n(选项C) 遗传性球形红细胞增多症是由涉及将质膜与细胞骨架连接的红细胞结构蛋白的各种分子缺陷引起的（例如，血影蛋白，锚蛋白）。由此产生的膜不稳定导致球形红细胞的形成——小的、圆形的红细胞，在低渗溶液中更容易溶解。\n\n(选项D) 巨幼红细胞改变（↑ MCV）通常见于维生素B₁₂和叶酸缺乏症，这是由于DNA合成受损所致。\n\n(选项E) 葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶缺乏症患者在氧化应激增加期间会发生快速溶血，例如服用抗疟药或磺胺类药物或摄入蚕豆后。\n\n教育目标：\nP₅₀是指血红蛋白50%饱和时的氧分压。具有高氧亲和力的血红蛋白的P₅₀降低，这表现为氧解离曲线左移。周围组织内释放氧气能力降低导致肾脏低氧血症，促红细胞生成素合成增加，以及代偿性红细胞增多症。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve and the compensatory mechanisms that occur when hemoglobin has an increased affinity for oxygen. Specifically, it assesses the understanding of how a left shift in the curve (increased oxygen affinity) leads to erythrocytosis. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize that a lower P50 value indicates higher oxygen affinity. This leads to less oxygen delivery to tissues, stimulating erythropoietin production and resulting in compensatory erythrocytosis. Rule out other options by understanding the pathophysiology of hemolysis, spherocytosis, megaloblastic anemia, and G6PD deficiency.",
