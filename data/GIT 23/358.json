    "en": "An 18-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with cough, fever, and hypoxemia. Despite multiple intravenous antibiotics and frequent chest physiotherapy, the patient decompensates and is transferred to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation. Sputum cultures grow >100,000 colony-forming units of a non-lactose-fermenting gram-negative rod. After several days, the patient dies of overwhelming pneumonia complicated by respiratory failure. Since age 1, he had been hospitalized for recurrent episodes of multi-lobar pneumonia, sinusitis, and poor growth. On autopsy, both vas deferens are absent. Which of the following findings is also likely to be present on autopsy?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The most common gastrointestinal manifestation of CF is pancreatic insufficiency (PI). Pancreatic duct obstruction and distension due to viscous mucus and subsequent inflammation develop in utero, eventually leading to fibrosis. PI is present from birth in most patients with CF. The loss of pancreatic tissue prevents these patients from developing pancreatitis. PI results in inability to absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins (ADEK), leading to steatorrhea and failure to thrive. Patients with PI require pancreatic enzyme supplementation.\n\n(Choice B) Bronchopulmonary sequestration is a congenital malformation characterized by extra, nonfunctional lung tissue without communication to the tracheobronchial tree. The extra tissue can be within a lung lobe or outside of the lungs and can present as recurrent pneumonia in the same focal site.\n\n(Choice C) Lymphocytic infiltration of pancreatic islet cells is seen in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. One or more autoantigens within these cells serves as a target for autoimmune attack, eventually leading to destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic cells.\n\n(Choice D) Nodular lymphoid hyperplasia of the intestine is classically seen in common variable immunodeficiency syndrome (CVID), a disorder of low immunoglobulin and B lymphocyte levels that predisposes to recurrent sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal infections. Congenital absence of the vas deferens is not associated with CVID.\n\n(Choice E) Situs inversus refers to transposition of the major internal organs (eg, dextrocardia). It is associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (or Kartagener syndrome), in which inefficient cilia in multiple organs fail to beat synchronously and clear mucus. Recurrent sinopulmonary infections and bronchiectasis result, but absence of the vas deferens does not occur.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe most common gastrointestinal disorder in patients with cystic fibrosis is pancreatic insufficiency. Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene lead to thick, viscous secretions in the lumens of the pancreas, resulting in obstruction, inflammation, and subsequent fibrosis. Clinical manifestations include steatorrhea, failure to thrive, and deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins.",
    "zh": "囊性纤维化 (CF) 最常见的胃肠道表现是胰腺功能不全 (PI)。由于粘稠的粘液导致胰管阻塞和扩张，进而发生炎症，在子宫内发展，最终导致纤维化。PI 几乎存在于所有 CF 患者出生时。胰腺组织的缺失阻止了这些患者发生胰腺炎。PI 导致无法吸收脂肪和脂溶性维生素 (ADEK)，导致脂肪泻和生长迟缓。患有 PI 的患者需要补充胰酶。\n\n(选项 B) 支气管肺隔离是一种先天性畸形，其特征是存在额外的、无功能的肺组织，且与气管树没有交通。额外的组织可以位于肺叶内或肺外，并可表现为在同一病灶部位反复发生肺炎。\n\n(选项 C) 胰岛淋巴细胞浸润见于 1 型糖尿病的病理生理学。这些细胞内的一个或多个自身抗原充当自身免疫攻击的靶标，最终导致产生胰岛素的胰腺细胞的破坏。\n\n(选项 D) 肠道结节性淋巴样增生常见于常见可变免疫缺陷综合征 (CVID)，这是一种免疫球蛋白和 B 淋巴细胞水平低的疾病，易患反复发生的鼻窦肺和胃肠道感染。先天性输精管缺失与 CVID 无关。\n\n(选项 E) 内脏反位是指主要内脏器官的转位 (例如，右位心)。它与原发性纤毛运动障碍 (或 Kartagener 综合征) 相关，在这种综合征中，多个器官中无效的纤毛不能同步跳动和清除粘液。结果导致反复的鼻窦肺感染和支气管扩张，但不会发生输精管缺失。\n\n教育目标：\n囊性纤维化患者最常见的胃肠道疾病是胰腺功能不全。囊性纤维化跨膜电导调节基因的突变导致胰腺腔内出现粘稠的粘液分泌物，导致阻塞、炎症和随后的纤维化。临床表现包括脂肪泻、生长迟缓和脂溶性维生素缺乏。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the common manifestations of cystic fibrosis, specifically the gastrointestinal complications like pancreatic insufficiency. It requires recognizing the association between congenital absence of the vas deferens and other typical findings in CF patients.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's history of recurrent sinopulmonary infections, poor growth, and absence of the vas deferens, which are suggestive of cystic fibrosis. Then, identify the answer choice that represents a common gastrointestinal manifestation of CF, such as pancreatic insufficiency leading to distension and obstruction of pancreatic ducts.",
