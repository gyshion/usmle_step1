    "en": "{{exhibit_1}}\nAccording to the World Health Organization, health promotion is \"the process of enabling people to increase control over their health and its determinants, and thereby improve their health\". Examples include improving dietary habits (limiting fat intake, consuming fruits and vegetables), exercising regularly, abstaining from smoking, and losing weight if needed. Health promotion typically falls under primary prevention, which is preventing a disease process from getting established.\n\nSecondary prevention refers to interrupting the disease process before symptoms develop. An example is case finding, which is looking for disease that may be present but asymptomatic in patients receiving medical care (eg, age- and gender-appropriate screening) (Choice A). Community screening is an analogous intervention at the community level (eg, measuring hypertension at a state fair). Tertiary prevention corresponds to treating an established condition with the goal of minimizing its progression or complications (Choice G).\n\n(Choice B) Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a standardized psychotherapeutic modality focusing on identifying and addressing persistent maladaptive thought patterns. It is used as monotherapy or in combination with medication to treat a variety of mental illnesses (eg, anxiety, mood, personality, somatic symptom, eating disorders).\n\n(Choice C) Interventions such as imposing taxes on cigarettes or soda or mandating smoke-free establishments can be implemented at the community level to improve the health of the public.\n\n(Choice E) Health risk assessments rely on questionnaires that use demographic, medical, lifestyle, and family history information to calculate a patient's \"risk age\". A patient whose risk age is greater than chronological age has a higher risk of death than the average individual of that chronological age.\n\n(Choice F) The \"stages of change\" model (originally developed to help patients quit smoking) assesses an individual's readiness to change a problem behavior. The precontemplative stage is when a patient does not believe there is a problem (eg, smoking) and is unwilling to contemplate a change (eg, quitting). The subsequent stages are contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance.",
    "zh": "{{exhibit_1}}\n根据世界卫生组织的定义，健康促进是“使人们能够增强对自身健康及其决定因素的控制，从而改善其健康状况的过程”。例子包括改善饮食习惯（限制脂肪摄入，食用水果和蔬菜），定期锻炼，戒烟以及在需要时减肥。健康促进通常属于一级预防，即防止疾病过程的建立。\n\n二级预防是指在症状出现之前中断疾病过程。一个例子是病例发现，即寻找可能存在但无症状的疾病，这些疾病存在于接受医疗护理的患者中（例如，与年龄和性别相符的筛查）（选项A）。社区筛查是在社区层面采取的类似干预措施（例如，在州博览会上测量高血压）。三级预防对应于治疗已确诊的疾病，目的是尽量减少其进展或并发症（选项G）。\n\n（选项B）认知行为疗法是一种标准化的心理治疗模式，侧重于识别和解决持续的适应不良思维模式。它被用作单一疗法或与药物联合使用，以治疗各种精神疾病（例如，焦虑症、情绪障碍、人格障碍、躯体症状障碍、饮食失调）。\n\n（选项C）可以在社区层面实施干预措施，例如对香烟或苏打水征税或强制实行无烟场所，以改善公众健康。\n\n（选项E）健康风险评估依赖于问卷调查，这些问卷使用人口统计学、医疗、生活方式和家族史信息来计算患者的“风险年龄”。风险年龄大于实际年龄的患者，其死亡风险高于同年龄组的平均水平。\n\n（选项F）“改变阶段”模型（最初用于帮助患者戒烟）评估个人改变问题行为的意愿。前沉思阶段是患者不认为存在问题（例如，吸烟），并且不愿意考虑改变（例如，戒烟）。随后的阶段是沉思、准备、行动和维持。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of different levels of disease prevention: primary, secondary, and tertiary, and the specific definition of health promotion.\n\nThe key to answering this question correctly is to recognize that health promotion focuses on enabling people to increase control over their health through lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise. It addresses modifiable risk factors before a disease has established itself.",
