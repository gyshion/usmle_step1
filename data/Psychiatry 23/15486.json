The patient has had a long-standing interest in fashion and a preference for having girls as friends, and his parents noticed that he recently bought women's underwear and shoes and went out to meet friends wearing makeup. They worry that he is being bullied since moving to a new high school last year.

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's persistent desire to be female and significant distress at developing male secondary sexual characteristics are most consistent with GENDER DYSPHORIA (GD). Individuals with GD experience discomfort from the incongruence between their GENDER IDENTITY (eg, an internal sense of what one's gender is) and their ASSIGNED GENDER at birth (either boy or girl based on external sexual anatomy). They often have a strong desire to live and be treated as another gender and become preoccupied with changing primary and secondary sexual characteristics. Preferences for playmates or friends of another gender and for the attire and typical interests and activities of another gender are characteristic.\n\nIndividuals with GD typically describe IDENTIFYING WITH ANOTHER GENDER since childhood or adolescence and frequently encounter bullying and discrimination. Gender-diverse adolescents struggling with these issues benefit from early identification and support to promote positive outcomes.\n\n(Choice A) Bisexuality is a form of sexual orientation defined as being attracted (sexually, romantically, and/or emotionally) to more than one gender. Gender identity and expression (eg, behavior, clothing, hairstyle, makeup) are independent of an individual's sexual orientation.\n\n(Choice B) Body dysmorphic disorder is characterized by preoccupation with slight to nonexistent defects in physical appearance. It is not diagnosed in patients who are preoccupied with changing only their primary and secondary sexual characteristics and who meet other diagnostic criteria for GD.\n\n(Choice C) Fetishistic disorder involves sexual urges, fantasies, or behaviors that are focused on a non-genital body part or inanimate object, not including articles of clothing used in cross-dressing.\n\n(Choice E) Transvestic disorder involves sexual arousal from cross-dressing. Unlike in GD, individuals with transvestic disorder do not typically report a desire to be another gender.\n\nEducational objective:\nGender dysphoria is characterized by a strong and persistent desire to live and be treated as another gender, which causes distress or impairment. It is often accompanied by a desire to change one's primary or secondary sexual characteristics.",
    "zh": "该患者持续希望成为女性，并且对男性第二性征的发育感到显著的痛苦，这与性别焦虑症（GD）最为一致。患有GD的个体会因其性别认同（例如，对自身性别的内在感受）与其出生时被指定的性别（基于外部性解剖结构为男孩或女孩）之间的不一致而感到不适。他们通常强烈希望以另一种性别生活和被对待，并专注于改变第一性和第二性征。喜欢与其他性别的玩伴或朋友交往，以及喜欢其他性别的穿着、典型兴趣和活动是其特征。\n\n患有GD的个体通常描述自童年或青春期以来就认同另一种性别，并且经常遭遇欺凌和歧视。正在与这些问题作斗争的性别多样化青少年受益于早期识别和支持，以促进积极的结果。\n\n（选项A）双性恋是一种性取向，定义为被多个性别吸引（性、浪漫和/或情感）。性别认同和表达（例如，行为、穿着、发型、化妆）与个体的性取向无关。\n\n（选项B）躯体变形障碍的特征是对外观上轻微或不存在的缺陷的关注。对于仅关注改变其第一性和第二性征，并且符合GD其他诊断标准的患者，不诊断此病。\n\n（选项C）恋物障碍涉及性冲动、幻想或行为，这些行为集中于非生殖器身体部位或无生命物体，不包括用于异装的衣物。\n\n（选项E）异装癖涉及由异装引起的性唤起。与GD不同，患有异装癖的个体通常不会报告希望成为另一种性别。\n\n教育目标：\n性别焦虑症的特征是强烈而持续的希望以另一种性别生活和被对待，这会导致痛苦或损害。它通常伴随着改变个体第一或第二性征的愿望。"
