  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Herpes simplex virus is a common, sexually transmitted infection marked by the formation of painful genital ulcers. Tzanck smear {{exhibit_2}} can reveal the characteristic cytopathic effects of the virus, including multinucleated giant cells, ground-glass intranuclear inclusions, acantholytic cells, keratinocyte ballooning, and nuclear molding.\n\nOral antiviral agents such as acyclovir, a competitive inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase, help speed symptom resolution.\n\n(Choice B) Azithromycin can be used to treat chancroid, which is characterized by the formation of a papule that evolves into a pustule and then an ulcer. However, it is very rare in the United States and is caused by the gram-negative organism *Haemophilus ducreyi*; multinucleated giant cells would not be seen.\n\n(Choice C) Doxycycline can treat lymphogranuloma venereum, a genital infection caused by certain serotypes of *Chlamydia trachomatis*. This disease is marked by the formation of a small genital ulcer, followed by significant lymph node inflammation and pain in the inguinal or femoral region. *C trachomatis* appears as intravacuolar organisms in macrophages.\n\n(Choice D) Fluconazole can treat *Candida* balanitis, which is typically marked by a painful, pruritic, erythematous rash. Yeasts and pseudohyphae can often be seen on microscopy.\n\n(Choice E) Penicillin can be used to treat syphilis, a spirochetal infection caused by *Treponema pallidum* that begins with the formation of a chancre (painless ulcer with heaped-up borders and a clean base) at the site of inoculation. Diagnosis is generally made with serologic testing because *T pallidum* cannot be cultured; multiple ulcers and multinucleated giant cells are not typically seen.\n\n(Choice F) Permethrin can be used to treat pubic lice, which are associated with significant pruritus of hairy genital areas. Lice can generally be visualized on the hair shaft.",
    "zh": "单纯疱疹病毒（HSV）是一种常见的性传播感染，其特征是形成疼痛的生殖器溃疡。Tzanck涂片 {{exhibit_2}} 可以揭示病毒的特征性细胞病变效应，包括多核巨细胞、毛玻璃样核内包涵体、棘解细胞、角质形成细胞膨胀和核塑形。\n\n口服抗病毒药物，如阿昔洛韦（一种病毒DNA聚合酶的竞争性抑制剂），有助于加速症状缓解。\n\n（选项B）阿奇霉素可用于治疗软下疳，其特征是形成丘疹，丘疹演变成脓疱，然后是溃疡。然而，它在美国非常罕见，是由革兰氏阴性生物*杜克雷嗜血杆菌*引起的；不会看到多核巨细胞。\n\n（选项C）多西环素可用于治疗淋巴肉芽肿性病，这是一种由某些血清型沙眼衣原体*引起的生殖器感染。这种疾病的特征是形成小的生殖器溃疡，然后是腹股沟或股部淋巴结的明显炎症和疼痛。沙眼衣原体*在巨噬细胞中表现为细胞内生物。\n\n（选项D）氟康唑可用于治疗*念珠菌*包皮龟头炎，其典型特征是出现疼痛、瘙痒、红斑性皮疹。通常可以在显微镜下看到酵母菌和假菌丝。\n\n（选项E）青霉素可用于治疗梅毒，这是一种由梅毒螺旋体*引起的螺旋体感染，始于在接种部位形成硬下疳（无痛溃疡，边缘隆起，底部干净）。诊断通常通过血清学检测进行，因为无法培养梅毒螺旋体*；通常不会看到多个溃疡和多核巨细胞。\n\n（选项F）苄氯菊酯可用于治疗阴虱，阴虱与毛发生殖器区域的严重瘙痒有关。通常可以在毛干上看到虱子。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize the presentation of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection and the appropriate treatment. It requires knowledge of the characteristic findings on Tzanck smear and the mechanism of action of antiviral medications like acyclovir.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the multinucleated giant cells and ground-glass intranuclear inclusions on the Tzanck smear, which are pathognomonic for HSV infection. Once HSV is suspected, the appropriate treatment is an antiviral medication like acyclovir.",
