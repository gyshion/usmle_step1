    "en": "An 89-year-old man is brought to a geriatric clinic by family members who are concerned that he is developing dementia due to recent worsening of his memory. The attending physician uses a new cognitive test (test X) to help rule out the possibility of dementia. The patient's test result is negative. A study evaluating the efficacy of test X in a sample of 200 individuals age ≥85, in which the prevalence of dementia is 50%, has determined that the test has a specificity of 80% and a sensitivity of 90%. Assuming that this patient's pretest probability of having dementia is equivalent to the disease prevalence in the study population, what is the probability that this patient truly does not have dementia?",

    "en": "The **negative predictive value (NPV)** of a diagnostic test is the probability that a patient truly **does not have the disease** when the patient receives a **negative test** result. It can be calculated from study data as follows:\n\nNPV = number of true negatives / total number of negative tests\n\nTo determine the NPV in this case, it helps to summarize the results of the efficacy study in a 2 × 2 table. The study evaluated 200 individuals in a population with a 50% prevalence of dementia (ie, 100 patients had dementia while 100 did not). Knowing that specificity (ie, true negatives/total disease negatives) and sensitivity (ie, true positives/total disease positives) are 80% and 90%, respectively, the following 2 × 2 table can be created:\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\nThe NPV can now be estimated as follows:\n\nNPV = number of true negatives (d) / total number of negative tests (c + d)\nNPV = d / (c + d) = 80 / (10 + 80) = 0.889 ≈ ~ 89%.\n\nUnlike sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values vary based on the prevalence of the disease. In fact, the NPV is inversely proportional to the prevalence of a disease (eg, NPV ↘ as disease prevalence ⬈). For the NPV to be applicable to an individual patient, that patient's pretest probability (eg, probability of having the disease before testing) must be **similar to the prevalence of disease** in the population where the study was conducted. The question says to **assume** that the patient's pretest probability is equivalent to the disease prevalence in the study population, so the NPV calculated in the study is generalizable to this patient.\n\nEducational objective:\nNegative predictive value (NPV) represents the probability of not having a disease given a negative test result. NPV is inversely proportional to the prevalence of a disease. When a patient has characteristics similar to the overall population (eg, age, sex, risk factor status), the disease prevalence is a valid estimate of the pretest probability of disease.",
    "zh": "诊断性测试的**阴性预测值（NPV）**是指当患者的**测试结果为阴性**时，患者确实**未患病**的概率。它可以根据研究数据计算如下：\n\nNPV = 真阴性例数 / 阴性测试总数\n\n为了确定本例中的NPV，将疗效研究的结果总结成2 × 2表格会有所帮助。该研究评估了200名个体，其人群中痴呆症的患病率为50%（即，100名患者患有痴呆症，而100名患者未患痴呆症）。已知特异性（即，真阴性例数/疾病阴性例数总和）和敏感性（即，真阳性例数/疾病阳性例数总和）分别为80%和90%，可以创建以下2 × 2表格：\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\n现在可以估计NPV如下：\n\nNPV = 真阴性例数 (d) / 阴性测试总数 (c + d)\nNPV = d / (c + d) = 80 / (10 + 80) = 0.889 ≈ ~ 89%。\n\n与敏感性和特异性不同，阳性和阴性预测值根据疾病的患病率而变化。事实上，NPV与疾病的患病率成反比（例如，随着疾病患病率⬈，NPV ↘）。为了使NPV适用于个体患者，该患者的测试前概率（例如，在测试前患病的概率）必须**类似于疾病在研究进行人群中的患病率**。问题要求**假设**患者的测试前概率与研究人群中的疾病患病率相当，因此研究中计算出的NPV可以推广到该患者。\n\n教育目标：\n阴性预测值（NPV）代表在阴性测试结果下未患病的概率。NPV与疾病的患病率成反比。当患者的特征与总体人群相似（例如，年龄、性别、危险因素状况）时，疾病的患病率是疾病测试前概率的有效估计。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of negative predictive value (NPV) and its relationship to disease prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity. It requires constructing a 2x2 contingency table to calculate NPV from provided data. \n\nTo solve this question, create the 2x2 table using the given sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.
