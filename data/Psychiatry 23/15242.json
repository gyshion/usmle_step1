    "en": "A resident physician is finishing up her shift when she receives a page that reads, \"Patient in Room 121 asking to leave.\" The patient was admitted 2 hours ago for worsening dyspnea. On entering the room, the resident attempts to engage in a discussion about why the patient is requesting to leave. In response, the patient pulls out his nasal cannula and breathlessly says, \"You don't know anything; you're not even a real doctor!\" The resident is reminded of her father, who has frequently belittled her accomplishments. She angrily informs the patient, \"You can't leave and I'm ordering haloperidol to calm you down.\"",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The resident's response to the patient is illustrative of COUNTERTRANSFERENCE, which consists of the physician or therapist's conscious and unconscious REACTION TOWARD a patient (eg, attitudes, thoughts, feelings, behaviors) that is BASED ON PAST PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS. Countertransference reactions can be positive (eg, physician takes extra time with a patient who resembles a beloved grandmother) or negative (eg, physician avoids a patient who resembles a critical parent).\n\nCountertransference can INTERFERE WITH MEDICAL JUDGMENT. In this case, the resident's negative emotions toward her father are activated when the patient dismisses her training and credentials. The resident acts on her negative countertransference reaction and adopts an inappropriately authoritarian approach by terminating the conversation and ordering a medication. Awareness of countertransference may prevent responses and behaviors (eg, yelling at a patient, ordering unnecessary medications/restraints, cutting an interview short) that could be harmful to patient care.\n\n(Choice B) PASSIVE AGGRESSION is a defense mechanism in which anger is expressed in a nonconfrontational manner. Examples of passive aggressive behaviors include sarcasm, procrastination, and purposeful inefficiency.\n\n(Choice C) PROJECTION is a defense mechanism that involves misattributing one's own unacceptable feelings to another person (eg, a woman who is angry with her mother accuses her mother of being angry with her).\n\n(Choice D) REACTION FORMATION is a defense mechanism in which uncomfortable feelings are unconsciously transformed into their extreme opposites (eg, if this resident was excessively gracious to the patient to defend against underlying anger).\n\n(Choice E) REGRESSION is a defense mechanism that involves returning to an earlier level of functioning to alleviate psychological distress (eg, a child starts sucking his thumb after a sibling is born).\n\n(Choice F) TRANSFERENCE refers to the redirection of a patient's emotions from a significant person in the past to that patient's current physician or therapist. It may explain some patients' emotional responses to their physicians (eg, an elderly patient who feels an immediate sense of comfort and familiarity with a physician who resembles her daughter), whereas countertransference refers to the provider's reaction to the patient.\n\nEducational objective:\nCountertransference consists of a provider's response (eg, attitudes, thoughts, feelings, behaviors) toward a patient based on past personal relationships. Countertransference can be positive or negative, conscious or unconscious; if unrecognized, it may have detrimental effects on patient care.",
    "zh": "住院医师对患者的反应是反移情的例证，反移情是指医生或治疗师对患者（例如，态度、想法、感觉、行为）的有意识和无意识的反应，这种反应是基于过去的个人关系。反移情反应可以是积极的（例如，医生会花更多时间与长相像她心爱的祖母的患者交谈），也可以是消极的（例如，医生会避开长相像严厉的父母的患者）。\n\n反移情会干扰医疗判断。在这种情况下，当患者否定她的培训和资历时，住院医师对她父亲的负面情绪就会被激活。住院医师对她的负面反移情反应采取行动，并通过终止谈话和开药采取了不恰当的专制方式。 意识到反移情可以防止可能对患者护理有害的反应和行为（例如，对患者大喊大叫、开具不必要的药物/约束、缩短访谈）。\n\n（选项 B）被动攻击是一种防御机制，在这种机制中，愤怒以一种非对抗性的方式表达。 被动攻击行为的例子包括讽刺、拖延和故意的效率低下。\n\n（选项 C）投射是一种防御机制，涉及将自己不可接受的感觉错误地归因于另一个人（例如，一个对母亲感到愤怒的女人指责她的母亲对她感到愤怒）。\n\n（选项 D）反向形成是一种防御机制，其中不舒服的感觉被无意识地转化为其极端对立面（例如，如果这位住院医师对患者过于亲切，以抵御潜在的愤怒）。\n\n（选项 E）退行是一种防御机制，涉及恢复到较早的功能水平以减轻心理困扰（例如，孩子在兄弟姐妹出生后开始吸吮拇指）。\n\n（选项 F）移情是指患者将过去重要人物的情感转移到患者当前的医生或治疗师身上。它可以解释一些患者对其医生的情绪反应（例如，一位老年患者对长相像她女儿的医生感到立即的舒适感和熟悉感），而反移情是指提供者对患者的反应。\n\n教育目标：\n反移情包括提供者对患者的反应（例如，态度、想法、感觉、行为），这种反应基于过去的个人关系。反移情可以是积极的或消极的，有意识的或无意识的；如果未被识别，它可能对患者护理产生不利影响。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of countertransference, a crucial concept in physician-patient relationships. It assesses the ability to differentiate this phenomenon from other defense mechanisms and to recognize its potential impact on clinical judgment and patient care.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully analyzing the resident's emotional and behavioral response to the patient's challenging statement. Identifying the trigger for the resident's reaction (her father's belittling behavior) and her subsequent actions (anger, authoritarianism, ordering medication) is key to recognizing the manifestation of her own unresolved feelings projected onto the patient.",
