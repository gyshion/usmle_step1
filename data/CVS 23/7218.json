    "en": "A 41-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to 3 days of fever, chills, and nonproductive cough. The patient has also felt tired and weak during this period. He has a history of injection drug use and has been hospitalized several times for injection site cellulitis. Temperature is 38.3 C (101 F), blood pressure is 125/72 mm Hg, and pulse is 112/min and regular. Cardiopulmonary auscultation reveals scattered rhonchi and a cardiac murmur, which were not previously present. Laboratory evaluation shows leukocytosis, and chest x-ray reveals nodular opacities.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Injection drug use is associated with the concurrent injection of abrasive particulate matter and microorganisms into the bloodstream. Over time, injected particulate material denudes the surface of the heart valves, thereby creating a variegated surface for microorganism attachment. This dramatically increases the risk of INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS (IE). The right-sided valves are at greatest risk because pulmonary capillaries prevent large particulate matter from reaching the left side of the heart; the TRICUSPID VALVE is involved in >90% of cases.\n\nCommon manifestations of tricuspid valve IE include right-sided heart failure (eg, jugular venous distension, ascites, lower extremity edema) and/or SEPTIC PULMONARY EMBOLI (eg, multiple pulmonary nodules on chest x-ray). Cardiopulmonary evaluation usually reveals a blowing, holosystolic murmur heard best along the left lower sternal border that is intensified during inspiration and reduced with standing. Crackles and rhonchi are often present (in the setting of septic emboli). Echocardiography will show valvular vegetations, which frequently result in REGURGITATION due to incomplete valve closure.\n\n(Choices A and D) Aortic and mitral valve IE is less common in injection drug users than tricuspid valve IE because the pulmonary vasculature filters out particulate matter and microorganisms. In addition, septic emboli from the left-side of the heart usually lodge in capillary beds (eg, cutaneous) prior to returning to the right-side of the heart; therefore, septic pulmonary emboli are less common.\n\n(Choice B) Aortic stenosis is common in older adults and usually causes dyspnea, angina, or syncope. Stenosis is not typically seen in IE, and left-sided IE does not usually present with pulmonary septic emboli.\n\n(Choice C) An interventricular septal defect (VSD) can cause a left-to-right cardiac shunt, which can limit systemic blood flow and result in pulmonary hypertension. A VSD is less likely in this patient with intravenous drug use, signs of infection, and likely septic pulmonary emboli.\n\n(Choice E) Pulmonary valve IE sometimes occurs in injection drug users; however, it generally causes pulmonary valve regurgitation (not stenosis) due to incomplete valvular valvular closure. Patients with pulmonary stenosis often have signs of right-sided heart failure (eg, edema, ascites, elevated jugular venous distension) or dyspnea.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients who inject drugs are at high risk for infective endocarditis (IE) due to the concurrent injection of abrasive particulate material and microorganisms. Most cases arise on the tricuspid valve. Patients with tricuspid valve IE often present with right-sided heart failure or septic pulmonary emboli. Echocardiography generally reveals valvular vegetations and incomplete valve closure (regurgitation).",
    "zh": "注射毒品与将磨料颗粒物和微生物同时注射到血流中有关。随着时间的推移，注射的颗粒物质会破坏心脏瓣膜的表面，从而为微生物的附着创造一个多样化的表面。这会显着增加感染性心内膜炎 (IE) 的风险。右侧瓣膜的风险最高，因为肺毛细血管可防止大颗粒物质到达心脏的左侧；三尖瓣受累病例 >90%。\n\n三尖瓣IE的常见表现包括右心衰竭（例如，颈静脉扩张、腹水、下肢水肿）和/或脓毒性肺栓塞（例如，胸片上的多个肺结节）。心肺评估通常显示在左侧胸骨下缘听到的吹风样全收缩期杂音，吸气时增强，站立时减弱。通常存在爆裂音和啰音（在脓毒性栓塞的情况下）。超声心动图将显示瓣膜赘生物，这通常由于瓣膜关闭不全而导致反流。\n\n（选项 A 和 D）主动脉瓣和二尖瓣 IE 在注射毒品使用者中不如三尖瓣 IE 常见，因为肺血管系统会过滤掉颗粒物和微生物。此外，来自心脏左侧的脓毒性栓子通常在返回心脏右侧之前滞留在毛细血管床（例如，皮肤）；因此，脓毒性肺栓塞不太常见。\n\n（选项 B）主动脉瓣狭窄在老年人中很常见，通常会导致呼吸困难、心绞痛或晕厥。狭窄通常在 IE 中未见，左侧 IE 通常不会出现肺脓毒性栓塞。\n\n（选项 C）室间隔缺损 (VSD) 可导致左向右心内分流，这会限制体循环血流并导致肺动脉高压。在这种静脉注射毒品、有感染迹象且可能发生脓毒性肺栓塞的患者中，VSD 的可能性较小。\n\n（选项 E）肺动脉瓣 IE 有时发生在注射毒品使用者中；然而，它通常会导致肺动脉瓣反流（而不是狭窄），这是由于瓣膜关闭不全所致。肺动脉瓣狭窄患者通常有右心衰竭的迹象（例如，水肿、腹水、颈静脉扩张）或呼吸困难。\n\n教育目标：\n由于同时注射磨料颗粒物和微生物，注射毒品的患者发生感染性心内膜炎 (IE) 的风险很高。大多数病例发生在三尖瓣上。三尖瓣 IE 患者通常表现为右心衰竭或脓毒性肺栓塞。超声心动图通常显示瓣膜赘生物和瓣膜关闭不全（反流）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of infective endocarditis (IE) in intravenous drug users, specifically the common involvement of the tricuspid valve and associated clinical findings. It assesses the ability to recognize the typical presentation and complications of right-sided IE. \n\nThe best approach is to consider the patient's history of injection drug use and the presenting symptoms (fever, murmur, pulmonary findings). Recognize that right-sided IE is more common in this population and that tricuspid regurgitation is the most likely echocardiographic finding.",
