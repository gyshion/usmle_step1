The patient has also had ongoing vaginal bleeding after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery of her son 9 weeks ago. She has no bleeding elsewhere, and she has not resumed sexual intercourse. On physical examination, the patient's uterus is enlarged and the adnexa are normal. Laboratory studies show markedly increased β-hCG levels. Chest radiograph shows multiple bilateral lung nodules. {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms highly suggestive of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD), specifically choriocarcinoma, given the hemoptysis, lung nodules, markedly increased β-hCG, and uterine enlargement following a pregnancy. Choriocarcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the trophoblast and is characterized by abnormal proliferation of cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. The tumor can spread hematogenously, with the lungs being the most common site of metastasis, explaining the hemoptysis and lung nodules. The markedly increased β-hCG levels are a hallmark of GTD. Endometrial curettage in a patient with choriocarcinoma would reveal abnormal proliferation of mononuclear cytotrophoblasts (red arrows) and multinuclear syncytiotrophoblasts (green arrows). No villi are present in choriocarcinoma. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}\n\n(Choice A) Myomas (eg, uterine fibroids) are benign tumors of the uterine myometrium characterized by bundles of smooth muscle cells. Common symptoms include menstrual irregularities and pelvic pressure/pain. This is not consistent with the patient's presentation.\n\n(Choice B) Diffusely hydropic chorionic villi are characteristic of a complete hydatidiform mole, a benign form of GTD. While a complete mole can sometimes precede choriocarcinoma, the presence of hemoptysis and lung nodules points towards a malignant process.\n\n(Choice C) Fetal tissue with a triploid karyotype is characteristic of a partial hydatidiform mole, another benign form of GTD. Similar to complete mole, this is less likely given the metastatic signs.\n\n(Choice D) Glands lined by atypical columnar epithelial cells are indicative of endometrial hyperplasia or adenocarcinoma, not GTD. Endometrial hyperplasia is associated with prolonged exposure to high estrogen levels and can present as abnormal vaginal bleeding, but it does not cause elevated β-hCG or lung metastases.",
    "zh": "该患者出现了一系列高度提示妊娠滋养细胞疾病 (GTD) 的症状，特别是绒毛膜癌，这与咯血、肺结节、β-hCG 显著升高以及妊娠后子宫增大有关。绒毛膜癌是一种源自滋养细胞的恶性肿瘤，其特征是滋养细胞和合体滋养细胞异常增生。肿瘤可通过血行播散，肺是转移最常见的部位，这解释了咯血和肺结节。β-hCG 水平的显著升高是 GTD 的一个标志。绒毛膜癌患者的子宫内膜刮除术将显示单核滋养细胞（红色箭头）和多核合体滋养细胞（绿色箭头）的异常增生。绒毛膜癌中没有绒毛。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}\n\n(选项 A) 肌瘤（例如，子宫肌瘤）是子宫肌层良性肿瘤，其特征是平滑肌细胞束。常见症状包括月经不规律和盆腔压迫/疼痛。这与患者的临床表现不符。\n\n(选项 B) 弥漫性水肿绒毛是葡萄胎的特征，葡萄胎是 GTD 的一种良性形式。虽然完全性葡萄胎有时可以先于绒毛膜癌，但咯血和肺结节的存在指向恶性过程。\n\n(选项 C) 三倍体核型的胎儿组织是部分性葡萄胎的特征，部分性葡萄胎是 GTD 的另一种良性形式。与完全性葡萄胎类似，考虑到转移迹象，这种情况不太可能。\n\n(选项 D) 由非典型柱状上皮细胞覆盖的腺体表明子宫内膜增生或腺癌，而不是 GTD。子宫内膜增生与长期暴露于高水平雌激素有关，并可表现为异常阴道出血，但不会引起β-hCG升高或肺转移。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the histopathology of gestational trophoblastic disease, specifically differentiating between benign and malignant forms, and recognizing the characteristic findings of choriocarcinoma. It assesses the ability to correlate clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging with microscopic pathology.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical vignette, which includes symptoms of hemoptysis, lung nodules, elevated β-hCG, and recent pregnancy. This strongly suggests choriocarcinoma. Then, recall or refer to the histological features of choriocarcinoma, which include proliferation of cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts without villi, and contrast these with the histological findings of other differential diagnoses presented in the options.",
