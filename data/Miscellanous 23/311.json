    "en": "A 46-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to recurrent nosebleeds. When interviewed for additional history, he becomes belligerent and uncooperative. A review of medical records shows that the patient has a history of alcohol use disorder; he has been placed in homeless shelters on multiple occasions but has not remained there for any prolonged periods. Physical examination shows swollen gums, scattered ecchymoses, and follicular hyperkeratosis. He also has a chronic ulcer on the left lower extremity that does not appear to be infected.",
    "zh": "一名46岁男性因反复鼻出血来到急诊科就诊。在询问病史时，他变得好斗且不配合。回顾病历显示，该患者有酒精使用障碍病史；他曾多次被安置在收容所，但未在那里停留任何长时间。体格检查显示牙龈肿胀、散在的瘀斑和毛囊过度角化。他左下肢还有一个慢性溃疡，似乎并未感染。"

    "en": "This patient has easy bleeding/bruising, gingivitis, and follicular hyperkeratosis, findings indicative of VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY (scurvy). This condition is rare in resource-rich regions but can be seen in patients who are at risk for malnutrition (eg, alcohol use disorder, anorexia), as in this case.\n\nVitamin C is a required cofactor for the HYDROXYLATION of PROLINE and LYSINE by prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases, respectively, during collagen synthesis. The hydroxylated residues (hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine) are essential for the formation of a stable triple helix collagen structure as well as the cross-linking of collagen molecules, both of which contribute to the tensile strength of collagen.\n\nImpaired hydroxylation in vitamin C deficiency compromises collagen's tensile strength, increasing capillary fragility and causing petechiae/ecchymoses, MUCOSAL BLEEDING (eg, nosebleeds), and perifollicular hemorrhages. Periodontal disease (gingival erythema/edema/bleeding) and hyperkeratotic follicles (due to keratin plugging) with coiled/corkscrew hairs are also common features. In addition, defective collagen production is associated with POOR WOUND HEALING, as seen in this patient with a chronic, noninfected ulcer.\n\n(Choice A) Thiamine (vitamin B1) is a cofactor in several decarboxylation reactions that are catalyzed by dehydrogenase enzymes (eg, pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A) in the citric acid cycle. Deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy (dry beriberi), heart failure (wet beriberi), and central nervous system dysfunction (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome).\n\n(Choice C) Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is a cofactor in several reactions that involve amino acids (eg, transamination, decarboxylation, deamination). In contrast to this case, pyridoxine deficiency manifests with cheilosis, glossitis, and peripheral neuropathy.\n\n(Choices D and E) Folate deficiency causes decreased purine and thymidine synthesis, which manifests with megaloblastic anemia (eg, fatigue, pallor, irritability). Vitamin B12 is a cofactor for the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine and for synthesis of succinyl coenzyme A from methylmalonyl coenzyme A; deficiency also presents with megaloblastic anemia in addition to neurologic dysfunction.\n\nEducational objective:\nVitamin C is a required cofactor for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues during collagen synthesis. Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), primarily seen in patients with malnutrition (eg, alcohol use disorder), leads to capillary bleeding (eg, epistaxis), poor wound healing, follicular hyperkeratosis, and periodontal disease.",
    "zh": "该患者容易出血/瘀伤、牙龈炎和毛囊过度角化，这些发现表明存在维生素C缺乏症（坏血病）。这种情况在资源丰富的地区很少见，但可能发生在有营养不良风险的患者中（例如，酒精使用障碍、厌食症），如本例所示。\n\n维生素C是胶原蛋白合成过程中脯氨酸和赖氨酸分别被脯氨酰和赖氨酰羟化酶羟化所需的辅助因子。羟化残基（羟脯氨酸和羟赖氨酸）对于稳定三螺旋胶原结构的形成以及胶原分子的交联至关重要，这两者都有助于胶原蛋白的抗张强度。\n\n维生素C缺乏症导致羟化受损，从而损害胶原蛋白的抗张强度，增加毛细血管脆性，并引起瘀点/瘀斑、黏膜出血（例如，鼻出血）和毛囊周围出血。牙周病（牙龈红斑/水肿/出血）和毛囊过度角化（由于角蛋白阻塞）以及卷曲/螺旋状毛发也是常见特征。此外，胶原蛋白产生缺陷与伤口愈合不良有关，如本例患者的慢性、未感染的溃疡。\n\n(选项A) 硫胺素（维生素B1）是柠檬酸循环中几种脱羧反应的辅助因子，这些反应由脱氢酶催化（例如，丙酮酸转化为乙酰辅酶A）。缺乏症可引起周围神经病变（干性脚气病）、心力衰竭（湿性脚气病）和中枢神经系统功能障碍（Wernicke-Korsakoff综合征）。\n\n(选项C) 维生素B6（吡哆醇）是几种涉及氨基酸的反应的辅助因子（例如，转氨、脱羧、脱氨）。与本例相反，吡哆醇缺乏症表现为唇炎、舌炎和周围神经病变。\n\n(选项D和E) 叶酸缺乏导致嘌呤和胸苷合成减少，表现为巨幼红细胞性贫血（例如，疲劳、苍白、易怒）。维生素B12是同型半胱氨酸合成甲硫氨酸以及甲基丙二酰辅酶A合成琥珀酰辅酶A的辅助因子；缺乏症也表现为巨幼红细胞性贫血以及神经功能障碍。\n\n教育目标：\n维生素C是胶原蛋白合成过程中脯氨酸和赖氨酸残基羟化所需的辅助因子。维生素C缺乏症（坏血病），主要见于营养不良患者（例如，酒精使用障碍），导致毛细血管出血（例如，鼻出血）、伤口愈合不良、毛囊过度角化和牙周病。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), its clinical manifestations, and the underlying biochemical mechanism. It assesses the ability to link symptoms like bleeding, bruising, and hyperkeratosis to impaired collagen synthesis due to a lack of vitamin C.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the constellation of symptoms suggestive of scurvy. Recall the role of vitamin C as a cofactor in collagen synthesis, specifically the hydroxylation of proline and lysine. Then, match this biochemical defect to the provided options.",
