  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's neoplastic cells stain negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and positive for synaptophysin. GFAP is a marker for glial cells, including astrocytes, ependymal cells, and oligodendrocytes. Synaptophysin is a marker for neurons and neuroendocrine cells. Therefore, cells that are negative for GFAP and positive for synaptophysin are likely neurons.\n\n(Choice A) Astrocytes are glial cells and would typically stain positive for GFAP. They do not normally express synaptophysin.\n(Choice B) Ependymal cells are glial cells and would typically stain positive for GFAP. They do not normally express synaptophysin.\n(Choice C) Meningothelial cells are derived from arachnoid mater and are not glial cells. They do not typically express GFAP or synaptophysin.\n(Choice E) Oligodendrocytes are glial cells and would typically stain positive for GFAP. They do not normally express synaptophysin.\n\nEducational objective: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is normally found in glia, and tumors of glial lineage are often positive for GFAP. Synaptophysin is normally found in neurons and neuroendocrine cells; tumors with neuronal or neuroendocrine differentiation are typically positive for synaptophysin.",
    "zh": "该患者的肿瘤细胞对神经胶质纤维酸性蛋白（GFAP）呈阴性染色，对突触素呈阳性染色。GFAP是胶质细胞的标志物，包括星形胶质细胞、室管膜细胞和少突胶质细胞。突触素是神经元和神经内分泌细胞的标志物。因此，GFAP阴性且突触素阳性的细胞很可能是神经元。\n\n（选项A）星形胶质细胞是胶质细胞，通常对GFAP呈阳性染色。它们通常不表达突触素。\n（选项B）室管膜细胞是胶质细胞，通常对GFAP呈阳性染色。它们通常不表达突触素。\n（选项C）脑膜细胞源自蛛网膜下腔，不是胶质细胞。它们通常不表达GFAP或突触素。\n（选项E）少突胶质细胞是胶质细胞，通常对GFAP呈阳性染色。它们通常不表达突触素。\n\n教育目标：神经胶质纤维酸性蛋白（GFAP）通常存在于神经胶质中，胶质细胞谱系的肿瘤通常对GFAP呈阳性。突触素通常存在于神经元和神经内分泌细胞中；具有神经元或神经内分泌分化的肿瘤通常对突触素呈阳性。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of immunohistochemical markers used in neuropathology to differentiate between various cell types and tumors within the central nervous system. Specifically, it assesses knowledge of GFAP as a marker for glial cells and synaptophysin as a marker for neurons and neuroendocrine cells.\n\nTo solve this question, one must correlate the given immunohistochemical findings (negative GFAP, positive synaptophysin) with the known expression patterns of the provided cell types. By eliminating options that express GFAP and considering which cell type expresses synaptophysin, the correct answer can be identified.",
    "zh": "此题考察对神经病理学中用于区分中枢神经系统中各种细胞类型和肿瘤的免疫组化标志物的理解。具体来说，它评估了对GFAP作为胶质细胞标志物和突触素作为神经元和神经内分泌细胞标志物的了解。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须将给定的免疫组化结果（GFAP阴性，突触素阳性）与所提供的细胞类型的已知表达模式相关联。通过排除表达GFAP的选项并考虑哪种细胞类型表达突触素，可以确定正确答案。"
