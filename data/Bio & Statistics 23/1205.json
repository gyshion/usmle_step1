The study found that 20 patients out of 90 who took a beta-blocker during the week prior to developing an MI had a major arrhythmia event during hospitalization. The study also determined that 30 patients out of 70 who did not take any beta-blocker developed a major arrhythmia.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The odds ratio (OR) is a measure of association that compares the odds of an outcome occurring based on exposure status. In this case, it represents the odds that the outcome (eg, major arrhythmia) occurred in the presence of the exposure (eg, beta blocker use) compared with the odds that the outcome occurred in the absence of that exposure. The OR can be calculated using a standard CONTINGENCY TABLE (with exposures in the rows and outcomes in the columns). Odds of developing major arrhythmia in exposed group = 20/70. Odds of developing major arrhythmia in unexposed group = 30/40. Therefore, the OR of developing a major arrhythmia in patients who took beta blockers compared with those who did not is as follows: (a/b) / (c/d) = (20/70) / (30/40) = (20 × 40) / (70 × 30) = 0.38",
    "zh": "优势比（OR）是衡量关联程度的指标，用于比较基于暴露状态发生结果的几率。在这种情况下，它表示在存在暴露（例如，使用β受体阻滞剂）的情况下发生结果（例如，主要心律失常）的几率，与在不存在暴露的情况下发生结果的几率进行比较。OR可以使用标准的列联表计算（暴露位于行中，结果位于列中）。暴露组发生主要心律失常的几率= 20/70。未暴露组发生主要心律失常的几率= 30/40。因此，与未服用β受体阻滞剂的患者相比，服用β受体阻滞剂的患者发生主要心律失常的OR如下：（a/b）/（c/d）=（20/70）/（30/40）=（20 × 40）/（70 × 30）= 0.38"
