    "en": "A 55-year-old woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoes breast-sparing mastectomy. The tumor margin did not show any invasion, and sentinel axillary lymph node biopsy was negative for nodal metastasis. The tumor was estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positive but HER-2 negative. After discussion of management options, the patient is started on tamoxifen. While on this medication, she experiences hot flashes that come and go in waves and affect her sleep significantly. Which of the following conditions is the patient also likely to experience as a result of this therapy?",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Tamoxifen and raloxifene are selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). They interact with the estrogen receptor and have agonist or antagonist activity depending on the tissue. In breast tissue, tamoxifen has an anti-estrogenic effect, and it is used for adjuvant treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen reduces the risk of recurrent cancer as well as estrogen-dependent benign breast lesions (eg, fibroadenoma, cystic changes) (Choice D).\n\nIn endometrial tissue, however, tamoxifen has a stimulatory effect and can lead to development of ENDOMETRIAL HYPERPLASIA and endometrial cancer. This risk is not seen with raloxifene.\n\n(Choice A) Tamoxifen and raloxifene act as partial estrogen receptor agonists in bone and can cause an increase in bone mineral density after menopause.\n\n(Choices B and E) Tamoxifen has a favorable effect on serum lipids, with a decrease in total and LDL cholesterol and no significant change in HDL. Serum triglycerides may increase in some patients.",
    "zh": "他莫昔芬和雷洛昔芬是选择性雌激素受体调节剂 (SERMs)。它们与雌激素受体相互作用，并根据组织的不同具有激动剂或拮抗剂活性。在乳腺组织中，他莫昔芬具有抗雌激素作用，用于雌激素受体阳性乳腺癌的辅助治疗。他莫昔芬降低了复发性癌症以及雌激素依赖性良性乳腺病变（如纤维腺瘤、囊性改变）（选项D）的风险。\n\n然而，在子宫内膜组织中，他莫昔芬具有刺激作用，可导致子宫内膜增生和子宫内膜癌的发生。这种风险在雷洛昔芬中未见。\n\n（选项A）他莫昔芬和雷洛昔芬在骨骼中充当部分雌激素受体激动剂，可在绝经后导致骨矿物质密度的增加。\n\n（选项B和E）他莫昔芬对血脂有有利影响，可降低总胆固醇和低密度脂蛋白胆固醇，对高密度脂蛋白影响不明显。某些患者的血清甘油三酯可能会增加。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the side effects of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen, specifically focusing on its effects on the endometrium.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that tamoxifen has both anti-estrogenic and estrogenic effects depending on the tissue. In the endometrium, it acts as an estrogen agonist, increasing the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.",
