    "en": "A 17-year-old girl comes to the office due to worsening acne. The patient's acne had been well controlled with oral doxycycline therapy. However, over the past month, the acne has worsened on her face and back. The patient was recently diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia due to abnormal uterine bleeding and began taking a combined oral contraceptive and an iron supplement. Physical examination shows comedones and pustules on her face and upper back. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.",

    "en": "This young patient with acne had a good initial response to tetracycline (e.g., doxycycline) therapy. However, after the initiation of new medications, she experienced a significant loss of effectiveness, suggesting a possible drug-drug interaction. In this case, it is likely that the new iron supplement is interacting with tetracycline to cause decreased absorption of the antibiotic.\n\nChelation drug interactions:\nMechanism:\n* Formation of insoluble compounds with polyvalent cations in the gastrointestinal tract\n* Decreased absorption of drug\nCommonly involved drugs:\n* Tetracyclines\n* Fluoroquinolones\n* Levothyroxine\nChelation cations:\n* Iron\n* Calcium\n* Magnesium\n* Aluminum\n\nTetracyclines interact with polyvalent cations to form nonabsorbable chelate complexes in the gastrointestinal tract. This effect is prominently seen with iron and is also common with other polyvalent metals (eg, aluminum, calcium, magnesium) found in widely used over-the-counter preparations (eg, antacids). Other drugs susceptible to chelation include fluoroquinolones and thyroxine.\n\nThe extent of chelation is influenced by gastric pH; the introduction of medications that raise gastric pH (eg, H2-blockers [eg, famotidine], proton pump inhibitors [eg, omeprazole]) can sometimes lead to increased chelation and loss of drug effect. Chelation can often be avoided by taking the medications at different times of the day.\n\n(Choice A) Combination oral contraceptives suppress androgenic activity and reduce production of sebum. This typically leads to improvement, rather than worsening, of acne.\n\n(Choice B) Clinically significant resistance to tetracyclines is uncommon in acne and unlikely to occur abruptly. In addition, besides antimicrobial effects, tetracyclines have anti-inflammatory effects in acne that would likely provide residual benefit.\n\n(Choice D) Tetracyclines such as doxycycline and tigecycline are eliminated by hepatic excretion. Neither iron nor oral contraceptives would increase drug elimination.\n\n(Choice E) Estrogens increase the synthesis of sex hormone-binding globulin, which can affect plasma levels of certain steroid hormones and related agents (eg, danazol, levonorgestrel). Tetracyclines are not significantly affected.\n\nEducational objective:\nTetracyclines interact with polyvalent cations (eg, iron, calcium, aluminum, magnesium) to form nonabsorbable chelate complexes in the gastrointestinal tract. This can lead to significantly decreased drug absorption and therapeutic effect. Fluoroquinolones and thyroxine are also susceptible to chelation.",
    "zh": "这位年轻的痤疮患者对四环素（如多西环素）治疗的初始反应良好。然而，在开始使用新药后，她经历了显著的疗效丧失，这表明可能存在药物相互作用。在这种情况下，很可能新的铁补充剂与四环素相互作用，导致抗菌药物的吸收减少。\n\n螯合药物相互作用：\n机制：\n* 在胃肠道中与多价阳离子形成不溶性化合物\n* 药物吸收减少\n常见涉及的药物：\n* 四环素类\n* 氟喹诺酮类\n* 左甲状腺素\n螯合阳离子：\n* 铁\n* 钙\n* 镁\n* 铝\n\n四环素与多价阳离子相互作用，在胃肠道中形成不可吸收的螯合物。这种效应在铁中最为明显，在其他多价金属（例如，铝、钙、镁）中也很常见，这些金属存在于广泛使用的非处方制剂（例如，抗酸剂）中。其他易于螯合的药物包括氟喹诺酮和甲状腺素。\n\n螯合的程度受胃pH值的影响；引入升高胃pH值的药物（例如，H2受体阻滞剂[例如，法莫替丁]，质子泵抑制剂[例如，奥美拉唑]）有时会导致螯合增加和药物疗效丧失。通常可以通过在一天中的不同时间服用药物来避免螯合。\n\n（选项A）复方口服避孕药抑制雄激素活性并减少皮脂的产生。这通常会导致痤疮改善，而不是恶化。\n\n（选项B）对四环素的临床意义重大的耐药性在痤疮中并不常见，也不太可能突然发生。此外，除了抗菌作用外，四环素在痤疮中具有抗炎作用，这可能会提供残留益处。\n\n（选项D）多西环素和替加环素等四环素通过肝脏排泄。铁和口服避孕药都不会增加药物的消除。\n\n（选项E）雌激素增加性激素结合球蛋白的合成，这会影响某些类固醇激素和相关药物（例如，达那唑、左炔诺孕酮）的血浆水平。四环素受到的影响并不显著。\n\n教育目标：\n四环素与多价阳离子（例如，铁、钙、铝、镁）相互作用，在胃肠道中形成不可吸收的螯合物。这会导致药物吸收显著减少和治疗效果降低。氟喹诺酮和甲状腺素也易于螯合。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of drug-drug interactions, specifically the chelation of tetracycline antibiotics by divalent and trivalent cations, leading to decreased absorption and therapeutic efficacy. It highlights the importance of considering new medications when a patient's condition worsens despite previous treatment.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the patient's current medications and the antibiotic being used. Recognize that iron supplements are known to chelate with tetracyclines, forming insoluble complexes that impair oral absorption. Evaluate the other options for their likelihood of causing worsening acne in this context.",
