    "en": "A 56-year-old woman comes to the office due to a pigmented lesion on her back. She first noted the lesion a year ago and says it has enlarged. Past medical history is unremarkable. The patient has worked as a forest service ranger for the last 30 years and has spent much of her time outdoors. On examination, there is a large irregular pigmented lesion on the upper back, as shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}, as well as scattered patches of erythema and telangiectasias. Excisional biopsy of the lesion shows malignant melanoma.",

    "en": "Malignant melanoma most often arises in the skin, although it may occur wherever there are pigmented cells, such as the eye and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract. Sunlight exposure appears to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of dermal melanoma, as are hereditary factors and a history of preexisting dysplastic nevi. Light-skinned individuals are at greatest risk.\n\nOn gross inspection, melanomas are characterized by asymmetric shape, irregular or jagged border, variability of color (brown, black, red, blue, or unpigmented), diameter >0.5 cm, and evolution in size and appearance over time (ABCDE criteria). Histologically, melanoma cells congregate in poorly formed nests and are large with irregular nuclei, clumped chromatin, and prominent nucleoli.\n\nIn early development, many melanomas exhibit a radial growth phase. This superficial, horizontal growth within the epidermis and superficial dermis carries a very low risk of metastatic spread (Choice A). In contrast, melanomas in the vertical growth phase contain melanoma cells that travel downward into the deeper dermal layers, increasing metastatic risk. Vertical growth often corresponds to a palpable nodularity of the lesion. The Breslow depth (distance from the epidermal granular cell layer to the deepest visible melanoma cells) is the most important prognostic indicator in malignant melanoma {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}.\n\n(Choice C) A dense lymphocytic infiltration of the tumor suggests a robust immune response and is thought to improve prognosis.\n\n(Choice D) Multinucleated giant melanocytes are a characteristic finding in lentigo maligna melanoma. Lentigo maligna are common pigmented lesions in elderly patients and are considered to be a type of melanoma in-situ. When melanoma develops in lentigo maligna, the prognosis is similar to other melanomas of the same stage.\n\n(Choice E) Prominent cellular atypia is a classic finding of malignant melanoma, but it is not considered the most important risk factor for metastatic disease.\n\nEducational objective:\nMelanoma often has an early horizontal growth phase with low metastatic potential followed by a nodular, vertical growth phase with a significantly increased risk of metastasis. Depth of invasion (Breslow thickness) is the most important prognostic indicator in malignant melanoma.",
    "zh": "恶性黑色素瘤最常发生在皮肤上，尽管它也可能发生在任何有色素细胞的地方，例如眼睛和胃肠道的黏膜。阳光照射似乎是皮肤黑色素瘤发病机制中的一个重要因素，遗传因素和既往存在的不典型痣病史也是如此。浅肤色个体风险最高。\n\n在肉眼检查中，黑色素瘤的特征是形状不对称、边缘不规则或锯齿状、颜色多变（棕色、黑色、红色、蓝色或无色素）、直径>0.5厘米，以及随时间推移的大小和外观变化（ABCDE标准）。组织学上，黑色素瘤细胞聚集在形态不良的巢中，且体积较大，具有不规则的核、凝集的染色质和突出的核仁。\n\n在早期发展中，许多黑色素瘤表现出径向生长阶段。这种在表皮和浅真皮内的浅表水平生长具有非常低的转移扩散风险（选项A）。相反，垂直生长期的黑色素瘤包含向下进入更深层真皮层的黑色素瘤细胞，从而增加了转移风险。垂直生长通常对应于病变的触诊结节。Breslow深度（从表皮颗粒细胞层到最深可见黑色素瘤细胞的距离）是恶性黑色素瘤中最重要的预后指标 {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}。\n\n（选项C）肿瘤的密集淋巴细胞浸润提示免疫反应强烈，并且被认为可以改善预后。\n\n（选项D）多核巨黑素细胞是老年患者中雀斑样恶性黑色素瘤的特征性发现。雀斑样恶性黑色素瘤是老年患者常见的色素沉着病变，被认为是原位黑色素瘤的一种。当黑色素瘤在雀斑样恶性黑色素瘤中发展时，预后与其他相同分期的黑色素瘤相似。\n\n（选项E）显著的细胞异型性是恶性黑色素瘤的经典发现，但它不被认为是转移性疾病最重要的风险因素。\n\n教育目标：黑色素瘤通常有一个早期水平生长阶段，转移潜能较低，随后是一个结节性垂直生长阶段，转移风险显着增加。浸润深度（Breslow厚度）是恶性黑色素瘤中最重要的预后指标。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the prognostic factors in malignant melanoma, specifically the association between vertical growth phase and increased risk of metastasis. It also assesses understanding of Breslow depth as the most important prognostic indicator.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that vertical growth phase indicates deeper invasion and a higher likelihood of metastasis compared to horizontal growth. Understanding the significance of Breslow depth further reinforces the importance of invasion depth in melanoma prognosis.",
