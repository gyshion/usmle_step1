    "en": "A 17-year-old boy who was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus is found unresponsive at home. His family reports that the patient did not feel good last night and skipped dinner, but he still took his usual dose of insulin. Paramedics find that his fingerstick blood glucose is 32 mg/dL and immediately administer intramuscular glucagon. Glucagon binds to a transmembrane receptor in hepatocytes, which promotes binding of intracellular GTP to a specific receptor-associated protein. This leads to further downstream signaling and rapid metabolic changes within hepatocytes, including a rapid decrease in intracellular glycogen stores and release of glucose into the blood. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "Glucagon exerts its effects through G protein-coupled receptors using the adenylate cyclase second messenger system. Glucagon binds to a G protein-coupled receptor on hepatocytes. Activation of the G protein leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase, which converts ATP to cAMP. cAMP then activates protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates specific serine/threonine residues in various enzymes, leading to their activation or deactivation. PKA also phosphorylates proteins that bind to the regulatory regions of genes on DNA. These downstream effects of PKA activation include the breakdown of glycogen to glucose (glycogenolysis) and the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors (gluconeogenesis), leading to an increase in blood glucose levels. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) cGMP-dependent protein kinase is activated by cGMP, not cAMP. cGMP is involved in other signaling pathways, such as smooth muscle relaxation and platelet activation.\n\n(Choice B) Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) is a cytoplasmic protein activated by ligand binding to non-G protein-coupled transmembrane receptors that lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. JAKs are involved in signaling pathways for growth hormone, erythropoietin, and cytokines.\n\n(Choice C) Phosphodiesterase is an enzyme that breaks down cyclic nucleotides like cAMP and cGMP. It is involved in terminating the signaling cascade, not mediating the effects of glucagon.\n\n(Choice E) Tyrosine-specific protein kinase is activated by ligands that bind to receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, such as those for insulin and epidermal growth factor. Glucagon signaling does not involve tyrosine kinases.\n\nEducational objective: Protein kinase A is responsible for the intracellular effects of the G protein-mediated adenylate cyclase second messenger system. Hormone receptors that use this system include the TSH, glucagon, and PTH receptors.",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the intracellular signaling pathway activated by glucagon in hepatocytes, specifically identifying the key enzyme responsible for mediating the metabolic effects of glucagon. It assesses knowledge of second messenger systems and protein kinase activation.\n\nTo solve this question, one must trace the glucagon signaling cascade from receptor binding to downstream effects. Recognizing that glucagon activates the adenylate cyclase system, leading to cAMP production, is crucial. Subsequently, identifying cAMP-dependent protein kinase A as the enzyme that phosphorylates target proteins to induce glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis is the key to selecting the correct answer.",
