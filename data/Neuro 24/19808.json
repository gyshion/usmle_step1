    "en": "The patient presents with headaches and seizures, and the MRI {{exhibit_1}} shows multiple flow voids in the left temporoparietal lobe, consistent with a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM). AVMs are vascular malformations in which blood courses directly from arteries to veins, without passing through an intervening capillary bed. These tangled vessels with turbulent flow can lead to aneurysm development, bleeding, and damage to the surrounding brain. Microscopy of AVMs shows abnormal vessels, including irregular arteries and large veins with thickened walls, and gliotic brain tissue. AVMs frequently present in children and young adults with headaches and seizures as well as intracranial hemorrhage (eg, intraparenchymal, subarachnoid hemorrhage). Some patients are initially asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally by imaging. A nest of abnormal vessels with \"bag of worms\" appearance may be seen on angiography. MRI may reveal prior hemorrhage and multiple dark flow voids, indicative of swift blood flow.\n\n(Choice A) Dense perivascular aggregates of atypical lymphoid cells are a histologic feature of primary CNS lymphoma, which is typically a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Although clinical symptoms may include seizures, it usually presents in older adults or immunocompromised patients. MRI would likely reveal an enhancing mass {{exhibit_2}}.\n\n(Choice B) Lipid-laden macrophages with phagocytized myelin debris are seen in the demyelinating plaques of multiple sclerosis. Symptoms are variable but commonly include unilateral visual disturbance (eg, optic neuritis) and focal sensory and motor deficits. MRI typically reveals periventricular white matter lesions {{exhibit_3}}.\n\n(Choice C) Histologic findings in cerebral Toxoplasma gondii infection include necrotic debris with surrounding inflammation, tachyzoites, and pseudocysts of bradyzoites. Although seizures and headaches are a frequent manifestation, CNS toxoplasmosis usually occurs in immunocompromised patients. Imaging would likely reveal ring-enhancing lesions {{exhibit_4}}.\n\n(Choice D) Necrosis surrounded by malignant cells (pseudopalisading necrosis) and microvascular proliferation are features of glioblastoma, a high-grade infiltrating astrocytoma. It commonly presents with seizures, headache, and neurologic deficits in middle-aged or older adults (rather than children). MRI would likely reveal a mass with central hemorrhagic necrosis, vasogenic edema, and possible extension to the contralateral hemisphere {{exhibit_5}}.\n\nEducational objective: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are vascular malformations histologically characterized by a tangle of abnormal vessels, including large veins with thickened walls and irregular arteries. AVMs may present with intracranial hemorrhage, headache, and/or seizures. Radiologic findings include abnormal vasculature with a \"bag of worms\" appearance and multiple dark flow voids {{exhibit_6}}.",
    "zh": "患者表现为头痛和癫痫发作，MRI {{exhibit_1}} 显示左侧颞顶叶多发血流空虚，与脑动静脉畸形（AVM）一致。AVM 是一种血管畸形，血液从动脉直接流向静脉，而没有通过中间的毛细血管床。这些紊乱的血管伴有湍流，可导致动脉瘤形成、出血并损害周围脑组织。AVM 的显微镜检查显示异常血管，包括不规则的动脉和具有增厚壁的大静脉，以及神经胶质增生脑组织。AVM 经常发生在儿童和年轻人中，表现为头痛和癫痫发作，以及颅内出血（例如，脑实质内出血、蛛网膜下腔出血）。有些患者最初无症状，通过影像学检查偶然诊断。血管造影可能显示外观呈“蠕虫包”状的异常血管簇。MRI 可能会显示既往出血和多发暗流空虚，表明血流迅速。\n\n（选项 A）非典型淋巴样细胞的致密血管周围聚集是原发性中枢神经系统淋巴瘤的组织学特征，通常为弥漫性大 B 细胞淋巴瘤。虽然临床症状可能包括癫痫发作，但通常发生在老年人或免疫功能低下患者中。MRI 可能会显示增强病灶 {{exhibit_2}}。\n\n（选项 B）富含脂质的巨噬细胞，具有吞噬的髓鞘碎片，见于多发性硬化的脱髓鞘斑块中。症状各异，但通常包括单侧视力障碍（例如，视神经炎）和局灶性感觉和运动功能障碍。MRI 通常显示脑室周围白质病变 {{exhibit_3}}。\n\n（选项 C）脑弓形虫病感染的组织学发现包括坏死碎片伴周围炎症、速殖子和缓殖子假包囊。虽然癫痫发作和头痛是常见的表现，但中枢神经系统弓形虫病通常发生在免疫功能低下患者中。影像学检查可能会显示环形增强病灶 {{exhibit_4}}。\n\n（选项 D）被恶性细胞（假栅状坏死）包围的坏死和微血管增生是胶质母细胞瘤（一种高级别浸润性星形细胞瘤）的特征。它通常在中年或老年人（而不是儿童）中出现癫痫发作、头痛和神经功能缺损。MRI 可能会显示具有中央出血性坏死、血管源性水肿以及可能延伸至对侧半球的肿块 {{exhibit_5}}。\n\n教育目标：脑动静脉畸形 (AVM) 是一种血管畸形，其组织学特征是异常血管的缠结，包括具有增厚壁的大静脉和不规则动脉。AVM 可能表现为颅内出血、头痛和/或癫痫发作。放射学发现包括外观呈“蠕虫包”状的异常血管和多发暗流空虚 {{exhibit_6}}。"
