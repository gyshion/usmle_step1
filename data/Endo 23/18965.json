    "en": "A 48-year-old woman comes to the office for follow-up of type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has had diabetes for 10 years with gradually worsening glycemic control despite taking multiple oral antidiabetic agents. Three months ago, the patient discontinued her oral medications (except for metformin) and started a daily injection of insulin glargine; she has had multiple visits with the diabetes educator since then to review injection technique and titrate up the dose. However, the patient reports a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight gain since starting insulin. She says, \"I feel like I need to eat more. If that's how insulin is going to be, then I don't want to continue it.\"",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Insulin therapy for diabetes mellitus commonly causes weight gain due to increased peripheral glucose uptake, increased adipose lipid deposition, and reduced renal glucose loss (due to normalization of blood glucose, which reduces the filtered glucose load). Behavioral factors, including snacking and less rigorous adherence to dietary recommendations, can also contribute. Weight gain is especially pronounced in patients with type 2 diabetes who typically have high circulating levels of insulin and preexisting obesity.\n\nThis patient has experienced weight gain after initiating a long-acting insulin analogue (ie, insulin glargine). Insulin normally suppresses appetite, but this patient reports increased need to eat, which suggests that the weight gain may not be simply due to the metabolic effects of insulin. Specifically, this patient may be eating more to suppress feelings of hypoglycemia.\n\nTo address this patient's insulin-induced weight gain, the clinician should obtain additional history to elicit the patient's perspective on appetite, recent changes in dietary patterns, and associated hypoglycemic symptoms. Once the causes are better understood, several strategies, including dietary modification and changes to the insulin regimen, can mitigate insulin-induced weight gain.\n\n(Choice A) Periodic review of exercise habits is recommended for patients with diabetes. However, this patient has already stated that appetite is her primary concern, so this should be explored first.\n\n(Choice C) Patients can gain weight due to a variety of factors. In addition to physiologic factors, stress often alters diet and exercise habits, leading to weight gain. However, this patient's weight gain is temporally associated with the initiation and titration of insulin, which makes insulin the most reasonable culprit. If the issue is not resolved after addressing the patient's insulin regimen, other factors can be explored.\n\n(Choice D) Although the benefits of improved glycemic control with insulin generally outweigh the negative effects of weight gain, this statement does not address the patient's concerns and could miss an opportunity to improve the insulin program.\n\nEducational objective:\nInsulin can cause weight gain due to physiologic (eg, increased peripheral glucose uptake, reduced renal loss of glucose) and behavioral (eg, increased snacking in response to hypoglycemia, less rigorous attention to diet) factors. Counseling should elicit the patient's perspective on appetite, changes in dietary patterns, and hypoglycemic symptoms.",
    "zh": "糖尿病的胰岛素治疗通常会导致体重增加，这归因于外周葡萄糖摄取增加、脂肪组织脂质沉积增加以及肾脏葡萄糖丢失减少（由于血糖正常化，从而减少了过滤的葡萄糖负荷）。行为因素，包括吃零食和不严格遵守饮食建议，也可能导致体重增加。体重增加在2型糖尿病患者中尤为明显，这些患者通常具有高循环胰岛素水平和已有的肥胖症。\n\n这位患者在开始使用长效胰岛素类似物（即甘精胰岛素）后经历了体重增加。胰岛素通常会抑制食欲，但这位患者报告需要吃更多东西，这表明体重增加可能不仅仅是由于胰岛素的代谢影响。具体来说，这位患者可能吃得更多是为了抑制低血糖的感觉。\n\n为了解决这位患者的胰岛素引起的体重增加，临床医生应获取额外的病史，以引出患者对食欲的看法、最近饮食模式的变化以及相关的低血糖症状。一旦更好地了解了原因，就可以采取几种策略，包括饮食调整和改变胰岛素方案，以减轻胰岛素引起的体重增加。\n\n（选项A）建议糖尿病患者定期回顾运动习惯。然而，这位患者已经表示食欲是她主要关注的问题，因此应该首先对此进行探讨。\n\n（选项C）患者可能会由于各种因素而增加体重。除了生理因素外，压力通常会改变饮食和运动习惯，从而导致体重增加。然而，这位患者的体重增加与开始和滴定胰岛素在时间上相关，这使得胰岛素成为最合理的罪魁祸首。如果解决了患者的胰岛素方案后问题仍未解决，可以探讨其他因素。\n\n（选项D）虽然使用胰岛素改善血糖控制的好处通常大于体重增加的负面影响，但这种说法没有解决患者的担忧，并可能错失改善胰岛素方案的机会。\n\n教育目标：\n胰岛素会导致体重增加，这归因于生理（例如，外周葡萄糖摄取增加，肾脏葡萄糖丢失减少）和行为（例如，对低血糖的反应而增加吃零食，对饮食不太严格）因素。 咨询应该引出患者对食欲的看法、饮食模式的变化和低血糖症状。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of insulin-induced weight gain and the importance of addressing patient concerns in diabetes management. It requires understanding the physiological and behavioral factors contributing to weight gain with insulin therapy.\n\nThe best approach is to consider the patient's specific concerns and symptoms.

Address the patient's immediate concerns to build trust and improve adherence.",
