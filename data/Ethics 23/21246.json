    "en": "A 59-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up. The patient had an acute myocardial infarction 1 month ago, and a drug-eluting stent was placed successfully. He has no cardiovascular symptoms, but he does have hypertension and hyperlipidemia and a 40-pack-year smoking history. Blood pressure is 132/86 mm Hg and pulse is 68/min. BMI is 30.8 kg/m². Physical examination is unremarkable. The patient says, \"I can't wait to get back to work, but at the same time, I'm concerned about having another heart attack. I have a high-pressure job, but I need to find time to exercise. Plus, I know I should stop smoking and lose at least 20 pounds.\"",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient recently experienced a myocardial infarction and expresses concern about having another one. He identifies a number of issues he feels he should address to reduce his risk (eg, stop smoking, lose weight, start exercising). Like many patients, he faces multiple health challenges and has specific life circumstances that influence his priorities (eg, high-pressure job). Rather than developing an exhaustive list of changes, helping the patient focus on 1 or 2 specific behaviors he feels most ready to change is more productive. In motivational interviewing, this is referred to as the process of focusing.\n\nA patient-centered, collaborative approach is important; the physician should elicit the patient's thoughts and feelings about what to focus on. Rather than giving advice without permission, unilaterally setting the agenda, or overwhelming the patient with a long list of changes, the physician can help the patient focus on realistic changes he is more likely to pursue.\n\n(Choice A) This statement prematurely assumes the patient is internally motivated to change. It describes the patient as committed to these goals when he said only that he \"should\" do all those things. This response also may overwhelm the patient because it fails to help him focus on realistic goals.\n\n(Choice B) This is an example of noncollaborative agenda-setting. It is less likely to be effective than eliciting the patient's perspective.\n\n(Choice C) Encouraging the patient to make a long list of changes is rarely helpful. It is likely to overwhelm him and may actually decrease his motivation.\n\n(Choice D) This question fails to consider the patient's perspective about his job (ie, \"I can't wait to get back to work\") and reflects a premature suggestion. Exploring the patient's thoughts and feelings about his work is a better approach, eliciting his suggestions about how to best integrate his health goals into his schedule.\n\nEducational objective:\nWhen counseling a patient who has multiple unhealthy behaviors, the best approach is to focus on 1 or 2 specific behaviors the patient feels most ready to change. This improves the likelihood of change by focusing on realistic goals the patient is more likely to pursue.",
    "zh": "该患者最近经历了心肌梗死，并表达了对再次发生心肌梗死的担忧。他指出了他认为应该解决的许多问题以降低风险（例如，戒烟、减肥、开始锻炼）。像许多患者一样，他面临着多种健康挑战，并且有影响其优先事项的特定生活环境（例如，高压工作）。与其制定详尽的改变清单，帮助患者专注于他最准备好改变的1到2种特定行为更有效。在动机性访谈中，这被称为聚焦过程。\n\n以患者为中心的协作方法很重要；医生应引导患者说出他关于重点的思考和感受。与其未经许可就给出建议、单方面设定议程或用一长串改变清单压倒患者，医生可以帮助患者专注于他更有可能追求的现实改变。\n\n（选项A）这种说法过早地假设患者有内在的改变动力。它将患者描述为致力于这些目标，而他只是说他“应该”做所有这些事情。这种回应也可能压倒患者，因为它未能帮助他专注于现实目标。\n\n（选项B）这是一个非协作性议程设定的例子。它不如引出患者的观点有效。\n\n（选项C）鼓励患者制定一长串改变清单很少有帮助。它可能会让他不知所措，实际上可能会降低他的动力。\n\n（选项D）这个问题未能考虑患者对工作的看法（即，“我迫不及待地想回去工作”），并反映了过早的建议。探索患者对工作的想法和感受是一种更好的方法，引出他对如何最好地将他的健康目标融入他的日程安排的建议。\n\n教育目标：\n当为有多种不健康行为的患者提供咨询时，最好的方法是专注于患者最准备好改变的1或2种特定行为。这通过关注患者更有可能追求的现实目标来提高改变的可能性。"
