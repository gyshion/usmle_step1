    "en": "A 2-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with intermittent pain in the abdomen that began several hours ago. The patient also had a bowel movement that appeared tinged with blood. Ultrasound shows an area along the ileum in which the proximal small intestine is telescoped into the distal small intestine. Reduction via enema is unsuccessful, and the patient undergoes laparotomy with resultant resection of the involved intestine. The pathologic finding at the lead point is shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}. Which of the following is the most likely underlying diagnosis in this patient?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "** Intusussception** occurs when a proximal segment of intestine telescopes into a distal segment, causing episodes of severe abdominal pain. Progressive intestinal obstruction can also lead to bowel wall ischemia and bloody, currant jelly stools. Most cases are idiopathic in young children; however, 25% have a **pathologic lead point** for bowel invagination. The lead point is generally an anatomic abnormality (eg, polyp, mass) within the intestinal lumen that is entrapped during peristalsis and forced into distal bowel.\n\n**Meckel diverticulum** is the **most common** pathologic lead point for intussusception and is a congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract caused by incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct. Most Meckel diverticula are clinically silent; symptomatic diverticula often contain **ectopic gastric mucosa**, which causes ulceration and painless lower GI bleeding. Patients can also have complications such as diverticulitis, bowel obstruction, perforation, and intussusception.\n\nIn some cases, Meckel diverticulum may be identified incidentally during laparotomy based on histologic evidence of gastric tissue within the small intestine. Distinct features of gastric mucosa include gastric pits and glands with chief cells and parietal cells. Meckel scan is a nuclear study that can be used to detect the presence of ectopic gastric mucosa and diagnose Meckel diverticulum. The histologic finding of normal gastric oxyntic mucosa {{exhibit_2}} supports the diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum.\n\n(Choice A) Burkitt lymphoma can serve as a pathologic lead point for intussusception, but microscopy would show a lymphoid infiltrate in a starry sky pattern {{exhibit_3}}.\n\n(Choice B) Intestinal edema and hemorrhage associated with Henoch-Schönlein purpura can trigger intussusception; however, leukocytoclastic vasculitis (perivascular neutrophils with fibrin deposits and nuclear debris) would be expected on microscopy {{exhibit_4}}.\n\n(Choices C and E) Inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn disease) and pseudomembranous colitis (ie, *Clostridioides difficile* infection) cause GI tract inflammation that could trigger intussusception, but the incidence is rare, particularly in a child age 2. In addition, microscopic findings of Crohn disease include transmural inflammation with noncaseating granulomas {{exhibit_5}}, and pseudomembranous colitis is characterized by pseudomembranes composed of fibrin, neutrophils, and cellular debris {{exhibit_6}}.\n\nEducational objective:\nMeckel diverticulum is the most common pathologic lead point for intussusception, a condition in which a portion of the intestine telescopes into itself. Meckel diverticula frequently contain ectopic gastric mucosa, which can aid in diagnosis.",
    "zh": "** 肠套叠**是指近端肠段套叠入远端肠段，引起严重的腹痛发作。进行性肠梗阻也可导致肠壁缺血和血性、果酱样便。大多数病例在幼儿中是特发性的；然而，25% 的病例有肠套叠的**病理性病灶**。病灶通常是肠腔内的解剖学异常（例如，息肉、肿块），这些异常在蠕动过程中被捕获并被迫进入远端肠道。\n\n**麦克尔憩室**是肠套叠的**最常见**病理性病灶，是由卵黄管未完全闭锁引起的胃肠道 (GI) 先天性异常。大多数麦克尔憩室在临床上是静止的；有症状的憩室通常含有**异位胃粘膜**，这会导致溃疡和无痛性下消化道出血。患者还可能出现憩室炎、肠梗阻、穿孔和肠套叠等并发症。\n\n在某些情况下，麦克尔憩室可能在剖腹探查术中偶然被发现，这基于小肠内胃组织的组织学证据。胃粘膜的独特特征包括胃小凹和具有主细胞和壁细胞的腺体。麦克尔扫描是一种核研究，可用于检测异位胃粘膜的存在并诊断麦克尔憩室。正常胃泌酸性粘膜的组织学发现 {{exhibit_2}} 支持麦克尔憩室的诊断。\n\n（选项 A）伯基特淋巴瘤可作为肠套叠的病理性病灶，但显微镜下会显示星空状模式的淋巴细胞浸润 {{exhibit_3}}。\n\n（选项 B）与亨-施紫癜相关的肠水肿和出血可引发肠套叠；然而，显微镜下预计会出现白细胞碎裂性血管炎（血管周围中性粒细胞伴有纤维蛋白沉积物和核碎屑） {{exhibit_4}}。\n\n（选项 C 和 E）炎症性肠病（例如，克罗恩病）和假膜性结肠炎（即，*艰难梭菌*感染）引起胃肠道炎症，可能引发肠套叠，但发生率很低，尤其是在 2 岁的儿童中。此外，克罗恩病的显微镜下发现包括具有非干酪性肉芽肿的透壁性炎症 {{exhibit_5}}，并且假膜性结肠炎的特征是假膜，由纤维蛋白、中性粒细胞和细胞碎片组成 {{exhibit_6}}。\n\n教育目标：\n麦克尔憩室是肠套叠最常见的病理性病灶，在这种情况下，一部分肠管会套叠到自身内部。麦克尔憩室经常包含异位胃粘膜，这有助于诊断。"
