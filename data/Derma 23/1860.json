    "en": "A 63-year-old woman comes to the office for a routine preventive examination. She has no significant medical problems and takes no medications. The patient consumes a balanced diet; gets regular exercise; and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. She is up to date on breast, colon, cervical, and lipid screenings. Her physical examination findings are unremarkable. The patient expresses concern about wrinkles around her eyes that make her \"look old.\" ",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Multiple environmental factors, especially exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, contribute to aging of the skin. UVB wavelengths are predominantly absorbed in the upper dermis and contribute to sunburn and increased risk of malignancy. UVA wavelengths penetrate deeper into skin and cause photoaging. UVA produces reactive oxygen species, which activate multiple inflammatory cell-surface receptors and nuclear transcription factors. This leads to decreased collagen fibril production, along with upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (including collagenases) that subsequently degrade type I and III collagen and elastin (Choices C and D).\n\nPhotoaging may be visible by age 30-35. Gradual thinning of the epidermis is seen, with reduction in subcutaneous fat, blood vessels, hair follicles, sweat ducts, and sebaceous glands. Rete ridges at the dermoepidermal junction become flattened. This loss of subcutaneous tissue causes the skin to become atrophic and more vulnerable to damage. In addition, there is increased crosslinking of collagen (Choice A), with deposition of collagen breakdown products. The atrophic dermis and increased collagen crosslinking, along with desiccation of the stratum corneum, produce the characteristic wrinkling of photoaged skin.\n\n(Choice E) Post-translational hydroxylation of proline residues contributes to the stability of the collagen triple helix. This reaction requires ascorbic acid (vitamin C); deficiency of vitamin C leads to scurvy, which is characterized by impaired production and reduced tensile strength of collagen.",
    "zh": "多种环境因素，尤其是暴露于紫外线 (UV) 下，会导致皮肤老化。 UVB 波长主要被上层真皮吸收，导致晒伤并增加恶性肿瘤的风险。 UVA 波长穿透皮肤更深层，引起光老化。 UVA 产生活性氧，激活多种炎症细胞表面受体和核转录因子。 这会导致胶原纤维生成减少，以及基质金属蛋白酶（包括胶原酶）的上调，随后降解 I 型和 III 型胶原蛋白和弹性蛋白（选项 C 和 D）。\n\n光老化可能在 30-35 岁时可见。 表皮逐渐变薄，皮下脂肪、血管、毛囊、汗腺导管和皮脂腺减少。 真皮表皮交界处的钉突变平坦。 这种皮下组织的损失导致皮肤萎缩，更容易受到损伤。 此外，胶原蛋白的交联增加（选项 A），并沉积胶原蛋白分解产物。 萎缩的真皮和增加的胶原交联，以及角质层的干燥，产生了光老化皮肤的特征性皱纹。\n\n（选项 E）脯氨酸残基的翻译后羟化有助于胶原三螺旋的稳定性。 这种反应需要抗坏血酸（维生素 C）； 维生素 C 缺乏会导致坏血病，其特征是胶原蛋白的产生受损和抗张强度降低。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of skin aging, specifically the role of collagen and elastin in wrinkle formation. It assesses understanding of how UV radiation affects collagen production and degradation.\n\nThe best approach is to consider the factors that contribute to skin aging and identify the process most directly related to wrinkle formation. Decreased collagen fibril production is the key factor in this scenario.",
