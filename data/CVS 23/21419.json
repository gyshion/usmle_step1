    "en": " A 68-year-old woman comes to the office due to recurrent syncope episodes. The most recent incident occurred 3 days ago while she was walking to her car and lasted about 1 minute. She was able to resume her normal activities afterward although she felt tired. She had no preceding chest pain or palpitations. The patient has had 2 similar syncope episodes in the past 2 months, along with frequent episodes of intermittent dizziness. Medical history includes hypertension and chronic kidney disease. She takes lisinopril, amlodipine, and clonidine daily. Blood pressure is 155/85 mm Hg and pulse is 44/min. Heart and lung sounds are normal. After the offending medication is discontinued, she has no further syncope episodes.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's syncope episodes are due to bradycardia and decreased peripheral vascular resistance caused by clonidine. Clonidine is used in the treatment of severe or refractory hypertension. It exerts its effects on both heart rate and blood pressure by stimulating presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (area responsible for basal and reflex control of sympathetic activity). This effect results in a subsequent decrease in presynaptic release of norepinephrine and decreased sympathetic outflow causing both bradycardia and a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nNormally, to maintain cerebral perfusion while standing, a baroreceptor-mediated increase in sympathetic drive causes vasoconstriction to increase peripheral resistance and increased heart rate and contractility to aid cardiac output. These changes facilitate a corrective increase in blood pressure to prevent a drop in cerebral perfusion. However, when an orthostatic stress is applied (eg, upright posture) to this patient with attenuated sympathetic outflow due to clonidine, she is unable to maintain cerebral perfusion and syncope results.\n\nLisinopril and amlodipine can also contribute to orthostatic syncope by impairing peripheral vasoconstriction, but their effects are not as profound as those of clonidine because they do not affect heart rate; in fact, they may result in reflex tachycardia.\n\n(Choice A) Decreased presynaptic release of acetylcholine occurs with certain toxins (eg, botulinum) and some medications (eg, aminoglycoside antibiotics). This effect leads to muscle weakness and does not contribute to syncope.\n\n(Choice C) Beta blockers (eg, atenolol) block beta-1 adrenoreceptors in the sinoatrial node, which can lead to bradycardia and contribute to orthostatic syncope. Clonidine does not block adrenoreceptors; it reduces central sympathetic output.\n\n(Choice D) Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem, verapamil) block calcium channels in the atrioventricular node and ventricular myocardium, resulting in slowed cardiac conduction (ie, heart rate) and decreased contractility, which can contribute to orthostatic syncope. Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, has minimal effect on the heart and functions primarily as a direct vasodilator.\n\n(Choice E) Class III antiarrhythmics (eg, dofetilide) bind to and block the potassium channels responsible for phase 3 repolarization of the cardiac action potential. This effect does not contribute to orthostatic syncope, but it can prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (ie, torsade de pointes), a serious cause of cardiac syncope.\n\nEducational objective:\nClonidine, an antihypertensive agent, stimulates central alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, causing a decrease in presynaptic release of norepinephrine and a decrease in sympathetic outflow. This prevents the normal baroreceptor-mediated increase in peripheral vascular resistance and heart rate during standing and can cause orthostatic syncope.",
    "zh": "该患者的晕厥发作是由于可乐定引起的心动过缓和外周血管阻力降低所致。可乐定用于治疗严重或难治性高血压。它通过刺激延髓腹外侧吻侧区（负责交感神经活性基础和反射控制的区域）的突触前α-2肾上腺素能受体，对心率和血压发挥作用。这种作用导致随后突触前去甲肾上腺素的释放减少，交感神经输出减少，从而导致心动过缓和外周血管阻力降低。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n通常，为了在站立时维持脑灌注，压力感受器介导的交感神经驱动力增加会导致血管收缩以增加外周阻力，并增加心率和收缩力以帮助心脏输出。这些变化有助于血压的修正性升高，以防止脑灌注下降。然而，当对由于可乐定导致交感神经输出减弱的该患者施加直立性应激（例如，直立姿势）时，她无法维持脑灌注，从而导致晕厥。\n\n赖诺普利和氨氯地平也可以通过损害外周血管收缩来导致直立性晕厥，但它们的作用不如可乐定那么明显，因为它们不影响心率；事实上，它们可能会导致反射性心动过速。\n\n（选项A）突触前乙酰胆碱释放减少发生在某些毒素（例如，肉毒杆菌毒素）和一些药物（例如，氨基糖苷类抗生素）的作用下。这种作用导致肌肉无力，不会导致晕厥。\n\n（选项C）β受体阻滞剂（例如，阿替洛尔）阻断窦房结中的β-1肾上腺素受体，这可能导致心动过缓并导致直立性晕厥。可乐定不阻断肾上腺素受体；它减少中枢交感神经输出。\n\n（选项D）非二氢吡啶类钙通道阻滞剂（例如，地尔硫卓、维拉帕米）阻断房室结和心室心肌中的钙通道，导致心脏传导减慢（即，心率）和收缩力降低，这可能导致直立性晕厥。氨氯地平（一种二氢吡啶类钙通道阻滞剂）对心脏的影响很小，主要作用是直接扩张血管。\n\n（选项E）III类抗心律失常药（例如，多非利特）与负责心肌动作电位第3相复极化的钾通道结合并阻断它们。这种作用不会导致直立性晕厥，但它会延长QT间期，并增加多形性室性心动过速（即，尖端扭转型室速）的风险，后者是心脏性晕厥的严重原因。\n\n教育目标：\n可乐定是一种降压药，可刺激中枢α-2肾上腺素受体，导致突触前去甲肾上腺素释放减少，交感神经输出减少。这会阻止在站立时正常的压力感受器介导的外周血管阻力和心率的增加，并可能导致直立性晕厥。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of clonidine and its potential to cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. It also requires understanding of baroreceptor reflexes and how they maintain blood pressure during postural changes. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the patient's symptoms resolved after discontinuing clonidine. Recall that clonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that decreases sympathetic outflow, leading to bradycardia and vasodilation, which can impair the body's ability to compensate for postural changes.",
