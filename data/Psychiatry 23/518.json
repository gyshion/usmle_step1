  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient initially had symptoms of major depressive disorder (ie, loss of interest, low energy, weight loss, insomnia, impaired concentration) and was most likely prescribed an antidepressant (eg, sertraline) as first-line therapy. Three weeks later in the emergency department, she exhibits symptoms of mania (ie, decreased need for sleep, increased energy, reckless spending, and grandiosity). All ANTIDEPRESSANTS carry a RISK OF INDUCING MANIA in susceptible patients. Antidepressant-induced mania can occur early in the first few days or weeks of starting the medication (even before the time frame normally expected for an antidepressant to take effect).\n\nIn this case, the mother's history of severe mood swings suggests a FAMILY HISTORY OF BIPOLAR DISORDER that places the patient at increased risk for developing this disorder. If a patient becomes manic or hypomanic on antidepressant therapy, the antidepressant should be stopped.\n\n(Choices A, C, and F) Carbamazepine, lithium, and valproate are mood stabilizers used in acute episodes and maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. This patient presented with depression, with no known history of bipolar disorder at that time. A mood stabilizer would not have been the initial first-line treatment.\n\n(Choice B) Lamotrigine, an anticonvulsant mood stabilizer, is effective in the depressed phase of bipolar disorder and is also used in the maintenance phase. Its use would have been appropriate if the patient had a known bipolar disorder at initial presentation. Lamotrigine is associated with a risk of benign rash that can progress to serious rash (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome) in rare cases.\n\n(Choice D) Olanzapine is a second-generation antipsychotic with mood-stabilizing properties that can be used in bipolar disorder. It is associated with weight gain and metabolic side effects.\n\nEducational objective:\nAntidepressant monotherapy can induce mania in susceptible patients, especially those with unrecognized bipolar disorder.",
    "zh": "这名患者最初有重度抑郁症的症状（即，对事物失去兴趣、低能量、体重减轻、失眠、注意力不集中），最有可能被开具抗抑郁药（例如，舍曲林）作为一线治疗。三周后，她在急诊科表现出躁狂症的症状（即，睡眠需求减少、精力增加、鲁莽消费和夸大妄想）。所有抗抑郁药都存在导致易感患者躁狂症的风险。抗抑郁药诱发的躁狂症可能发生在开始用药的最初几天或几周内（甚至在抗抑郁药通常起效的时间之前）。\n\n在这种情况下，母亲的严重情绪波动史提示有双相情感障碍的家族史，这使得患者患上这种疾病的风险增加。如果患者在抗抑郁药治疗期间出现躁狂或轻躁狂，则应停用抗抑郁药。\n\n（选项A、C和F）卡马西平、锂和丙戊酸盐是用于双相情感障碍急性发作和维持治疗的情绪稳定剂。该患者以抑郁症就诊，当时并无双相情感障碍的已知病史。情绪稳定剂不应作为最初的一线治疗。\n\n（选项B）拉莫三嗪是一种抗惊厥药，也是一种情绪稳定剂，对双相情感障碍的抑郁期有效，也可用于维持期。如果患者在最初就诊时已知患有双相情感障碍，则使用拉莫三嗪是合适的。拉莫三嗪与良性皮疹的风险相关，在罕见情况下，良性皮疹可能进展为严重皮疹（包括史蒂文斯-约翰逊综合征）。\n\n（选项D）奥氮平是一种具有情绪稳定特性的第二代抗精神病药，可用于双相情感障碍。它与体重增加和代谢副作用有关。\n\n教育目标：\n单药抗抑郁药可诱发易感患者的躁狂症，尤其是那些未被识别出双相情感障碍的患者。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of antidepressant-induced mania in patients with undiagnosed bipolar disorder. It assesses the ability to recognize the signs of mania following antidepressant initiation and consider the risk factors, such as family history, for bipolar disorder.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the patient's initial depressive symptoms, recognizing the subsequent manic symptoms, and understanding that antidepressants can precipitate mania in susceptible individuals, particularly those with underlying bipolar disorder. The correct answer is the medication most likely prescribed for depression that could lead to this outcome.",
    "zh": "本题考察对未确诊双相情感障碍患者中抗抑郁药诱发的躁狂症的理解。它评估了识别启动抗抑郁药后躁狂症的迹象，并考虑双相情感障碍的风险因素（例如家族史）的能力。\n\n解决此问题的方法包括识别患者最初的抑郁症状，识别随后的躁狂症状，并了解抗抑郁药可诱发易感个体的躁狂症，特别是那些患有潜在双相情感障碍的个体。正确答案是最有可能被处方治疗抑郁症并可能导致这种结果的药物。"
