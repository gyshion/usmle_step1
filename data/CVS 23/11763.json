    "en": "An 82-year-old woman is sent to the hospital from a nursing home after 2 days of fever, confusion, and lethargy. The patient has a history of mild dementia, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. Her temperature is 38.8 C (102 F), blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, and pulse is 116/min. She has mild suprapubic and right costovertebral angle tenderness. Her leukocyte count is 18,000/mm³, and urinalysis is consistent with acute cystitis. A femoral venous access is planned for administration of intravenous fluids and antibiotics. The femoral artery pulsation is palpable immediately below the inguinal ligament. Which of the following describes the optimal cannulation site for the femoral vein? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "Femoral vein catheter placement is usually done in patients with unavailable preferred access sites (eg, subclavian, jugular vein) or those at increased risk of complications (eg, emergency access, uncooperative patient). The femoral vein is the major deep vein of the lower extremity and passes through the femoral triangle beneath the inguinal ligament before entering the pelvis as the external iliac vein. The femoral triangle is a subfascial space in the upper thigh that is bordered by the inguinal ligament (superiorly), adductor longus muscle (medially), and sartorius muscle (laterally). \n\nWithin the femoral triangle lies (lateral to medial) the femoral nerve, femoral artery, femoral vein, and deep inguinal nodes/lymphatic vessels. The femoral artery is located at the midinguinal point (midway between the pubic symphysis and anterior superior iliac spine), and the femoral vein lies immediately medial to the artery. Cannulation of the femoral vein should occur approximately 1 cm below the inguinal ligament and 0.5-1.0 cm medial to the femoral artery pulsation (Choices C, D, and E).\n\n(Choice A) The femoral nerve is approximately 1 cm lateral to the femoral artery pulsation and could be damaged by needle insertion at this site.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe femoral triangle (lateral to medial) consists of the femoral nerve, femoral artery, femoral vein, and deep inguinal nodes/lymphatic vessels. Cannulation of the femoral vein should occur approximately 1 cm below the inguinal ligament and just medial to the femoral artery pulsation.",
    "zh": "股静脉导管置入术通常在无法使用首选通路部位（如锁骨下静脉、颈静脉）或有并发症风险增加的患者（如急诊通路、不配合的患者）中进行。股静脉是下肢的主要深静脉，穿过腹股沟韧带下方的股三角，然后作为髂外静脉进入盆腔。股三角是大腿上部的筋膜下间隙，其边界为腹股沟韧带（上方）、内收长肌（内侧）和缝匠肌（外侧）。\n\n在股三角内，从外侧到内侧依次为股神经、股动脉、股静脉和腹股沟深淋巴结/淋巴管。股动脉位于腹股沟中点（耻骨联合和髂前上棘之间），股静脉紧邻动脉内侧。股静脉的插管应发生在腹股沟韧带下方约1 cm处，并位于股动脉搏动内侧0.5-1.0 cm处（选项C、D和E）。\n\n（选项A）股神经位于股动脉搏动外侧约1 cm处，在该部位插入针头可能会损伤股神经。\n\n教育目标：\n股三角（从外侧到内侧）由股神经、股动脉、股静脉和腹股沟深淋巴结/淋巴管组成。股静脉的插管应发生在腹股沟韧带下方约1 cm处，并在股动脉搏动内侧。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the anatomy of the femoral triangle and the relative positions of the femoral nerve, artery, and vein, specifically in the context of femoral vein catheter placement. It requires understanding the spatial relationships of these structures to avoid complications during the procedure.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the mnemonic for the femoral triangle contents (lateral to medial): NAVEL (Nerve, Artery, Vein, Empty space, Lymphatics). Remember that the femoral vein lies immediately medial to the femoral artery, and cannulation should occur just below the inguinal ligament.",
