    "en": "A 30-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to left eye pain after being involved in a street fight. He received a fist blow to the left eye and has since had pain and diplopia. Past medical history is notable for 2 previous gunshot wounds. The patient does not smoke cigarettes but has a history of heavy alcohol intake and frequent marijuana use. On examination, there is significant soft tissue swelling around the left eye. Visual acuity is normal, but extraocular motility of the left eye is limited. Pupillary reflexes are normal. Coronal CT scan of the orbits is shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The orbit is bound superiorly by the thick orbital plate of the frontal bone and laterally by the thick bone of the zygoma and greater and lesser sphenoid wings. In contrast, the orbital floor is composed of a very thin layer of bone that separates the orbit from the air-filled maxillary sinus. Similarly, the orbit's medial wall is composed of the thin ethmoid and lacrimal bones, which separate it from the ethmoid air cells.\n\nBlunt trauma to the eye causes a rapid increase in pressure that typically does not rupture the globe but is transmitted posteriorly into the orbit. The weakest plates of bone in the orbit, the medial and inferior walls, are common sites of fracture. Fracture is typically evident on radiographic imaging, and fluid (eg, blood) or herniation of the orbital contents can often be visualized in the adjacent normally air-filled sinuses.\n\n(Choice A) The ethmoid air cells are medial to the orbit. They are unaffected in this patient, but they can be affected in blowout fractures of the orbit's medial wall.\n\n(Choice B) The frontal sinus is not pictured above. It lies in the medial part of the supraorbital frontal bone.\n\n(Choice C) The inferior nasal conchae form part of the nasal turbinate system. They are not air-filled sinuses.\n\n(Choice E) The sphenoid sinuses (not pictured above) lie anterior to the optic chiasm and are not in close relation to the orbit. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nEducational objective:\nBlunt trauma to the globe can cause orbital blowout fractures. These fractures most commonly involve the medial or inferior orbital walls due to the thin bone bordering the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses.",
    "zh": "眶的上缘由额骨的厚眶板构成，侧面由颧骨以及蝶骨大翼和小翼的厚骨构成。相比之下，眶底由一层非常薄的骨组成，将眶与充气的上颌窦分隔开。 同样，眶的内侧壁由薄的筛骨和泪骨组成，将眶与筛窦分隔开。\n\n眼部钝性创伤会导致压力迅速升高，这通常不会导致眼球破裂，而是向后传导到眶内。眶内最薄弱的骨板（内侧壁和下壁）是常见的骨折部位。 骨折通常在影像学检查中可见，液体（例如血液）或眶内容物的疝出通常可以在相邻的、正常充气的窦中被观察到。\n\n(选项A) 筛窦位于眶的内侧。 在该患者中，它们不受影响，但它们可能受到眶内侧壁的爆裂性骨折的影响。\n\n(选项B) 上方的图中未显示额窦。它位于眶上额骨的内侧部分。\n\n(选项C) 下鼻甲构成鼻甲系统的一部分。它们不是充气的窦。\n\n(选项E) 蝶窦（上图中未显示）位于视交叉的前方，与眶的关系不密切。 {{exhibit_2}}\n\n教育目标：\n眼球的钝性创伤可引起眶爆裂性骨折。 这些骨折最常累及内侧或下眶壁，因为与筛窦和上颌窦相邻的骨很薄。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of orbital anatomy and the pathophysiology of orbital blowout fractures following blunt trauma. It assesses the ability to identify the most likely site of herniation of orbital contents based on the relative weakness of the orbital walls.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the anatomical structure of the orbit, specifically the bones forming the orbital floor and medial wall. Remember that the maxillary sinus is inferior to the orbit and the ethmoid air cells are medial, making these the most common sites for herniation in blowout fractures.",
    "zh": "此题考察对眶部解剖结构的知识以及钝性创伤后眶爆裂性骨折的病理生理学知识。 它评估了根据眶壁的相对薄弱来确定眶内容物疝出最可能部位的能力。\n\n要解决这个问题，请回忆眶的解剖结构，特别是构成眶底和内侧壁的骨骼。 请记住，上颌窦位于眶的下方，筛窦位于内侧，这使得它们成为爆裂性骨折中最常见的疝出部位。"
