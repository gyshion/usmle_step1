    "en": "A 43-year-old man is being evaluated for occasional retrosternal chest pressure that develops with moderate exertion and sometimes occurs when resting. He does not use alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. The patient has an extensive family history of coronary artery disease. His temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 124/72 mm Hg, pulse is 81/min, and respirations are 14/min. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Coronary angiography shows mild luminal irregularities but no significant obstructive lesions. Acetylcholine infusion during the procedure results in dilation of epicardial coronary vessels.",

    "en": "Endothelium-dependent vasodilation {{exhibit_1}}\nThe vascular endothelium plays an important role in vasodilation mediated by acetylcholine, bradykinin, serotonin, substance P, and shear forces. These stimuli activate specific membrane receptors present on endothelial cells, leading to an increase in cytosolic calcium levels. This causes activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which synthesizes nitric oxide from arginine, NADPH, and O2. Nitric oxide then diffuses into the adjacent smooth muscle cells, where it activates guanylyl cyclase and increases formation of cyclic GMP. High levels of cyclic GMP activate protein kinase G, which causes a reduction in cytosolic calcium levels and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells.\nThe availability of arginine for synthesizing nitric oxide depends on several factors, including exogenous food intake, endogenous synthesis, intracellular storage and degradation, and the presence of asymmetrical dimethylarginine (an endogenous analog of arginine that works as a competitive inhibitor of eNOS).\nEducational objective:\nNitric oxide is synthesized from arginine by nitric oxide synthase. As a precursor of nitric oxide, arginine supplementation may play an adjunct role in the treatment of conditions that improve with vasodilation, such as stable angina. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "内皮依赖性血管舒张{{exhibit_1}}\n血管内皮在乙酰胆碱、缓激肽、血清素、P物质和剪切力介导的血管舒张中起重要作用。这些刺激激活内皮细胞上存在的特定膜受体，导致胞质钙水平升高。这会激活内皮型一氧化氮合酶（eNOS），该酶从精氨酸、NADPH和O2合成一氧化氮。然后，一氧化氮扩散到邻近的平滑肌细胞中，在那里激活鸟苷酸环化酶并增加环状GMP的形成。高水平的环状GMP激活蛋白激酶G，这会导致胞质钙水平降低，并使血管平滑肌细胞舒张。\n用于合成一氧化氮的精氨酸的可用性取决于几个因素，包括外源性食物摄入、内源性合成、细胞内储存和降解，以及不对称二甲基精氨酸（一种内源性精氨酸类似物，可作为eNOS的竞争性抑制剂）的存在。\n教育目标：\n一氧化氮由一氧化氮合酶从精氨酸合成。作为一氧化氮的前体，精氨酸补充剂可能在治疗血管舒张可改善的疾病（如稳定型心绞痛）中发挥辅助作用。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of endothelium-dependent vasodilation and the role of arginine in nitric oxide synthesis. It assesses understanding of the biochemical pathways involved in vascular smooth muscle relaxation.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator, is synthesized from arginine by nitric oxide synthase. Acetylcholine stimulates endothelial cells to produce nitric oxide, leading to vasodilation. Therefore, the amino acid involved in this process is arginine.",
