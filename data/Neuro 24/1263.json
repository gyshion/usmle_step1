    "en": "An 11-month-old boy is brought to the office due to irregular jerking movements. His mother states that for 2 weeks he has looked pale and tired, and he has been more fussy and less playful than usual. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, pulse is 114/min, and respirations are 16/min. Physical examination reveals spontaneous bursts of nonrhythmic conjugate eye movements in various directions. The patient also has myoclonus involving the trunk and limbs as well as generalized hypotonia. A right-sided, nontender, immobile abdominal mass is palpated. There is no hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds are normal. Complete blood count reveals anemia, and urine is positive for elevated levels of catecholamine breakdown products. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "en": "The patient's presentation of opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (nonrhythmic conjugate eye movements and involuntary jerking movements of the trunk and limbs) in conjunction with an abdominal mass, anemia, and elevated catecholamine breakdown products in a young child is highly suggestive of NEUROBLASTOMA. Neuroblastoma is a tumor that arises from NEURAL CREST cells and commonly involves the adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia. It is the most common EXTRACRANIAL solid neoplasm of childhood. The opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome is a PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROME that is strongly associated with neuroblastoma. The abdominal mass is a common presenting feature, and bone marrow infiltration can lead to ANEMIA or pancytopenia. The elevated catecholamine metabolites (eg, HVA, VMA) in the urine are a hallmark diagnostic finding of neuroblastoma due to the tumor's origin from catecholamine-producing cells.\n\n(Choice A) Carcinoid tumors are rare in children and typically present with flushing, diarrhea, and bronchospasm due to serotonin secretion. While they can produce 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (a serotonin metabolite) in the urine, they are not associated with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome or abdominal masses in this manner.\n\n(Choice B) Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that typically affects older children and adolescents and presents with pain and swelling over the affected bone. It is not associated with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome or elevated catecholamines.\n\n(Choice C) Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children, arising in the cerebellum and causing ataxia. While it can present with paraneoplastic syndromes, opsoclonus-myoclonus is not a typical association, and it does not present with an abdominal mass or elevated catecholamines.\n\n(Choice E) Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can present as an abdominal mass in children, but it is rare in infants and is not typically associated with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome or elevated urine catecholamines.\n\n(Choice F) Pheochromocytoma is a tumor of the adrenal medulla that secretes catecholamines. However, it occurs more commonly in adults and is not typically associated with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome. While it can cause hypertension, the patient's blood pressure is within normal limits for an 11-month-old.\n\n(Choice G) Wilms tumor is a renal cancer that typically presents in early childhood (median age 3-4) with an abdominal mass. However, it does not cause opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome or result in elevated catecholamines in the urine.\n\nKEY PEARLS:\n- OPSOCLONUS-MYOCLONUS SYNDROME in a child with an abdominal mass and elevated catecholamines strongly suggests NEUROBLASTOMA.\n- Neuroblastoma arises from NEURAL CREST cells.\n- Elevated urine catecholamine metabolites (HVA, VMA) are characteristic of neuroblastoma.\n- Other paraneoplastic syndromes can be associated with neuroblastoma.",
    "zh": "患者出现眼阵挛-肌阵挛综合征（躯干和四肢的非节律性共轭眼球运动和不自主抽搐运动），并伴有腹部肿块、贫血以及年轻儿童的儿茶酚胺分解产物升高，高度提示神经母细胞瘤。神经母细胞瘤是一种起源于神经嵴细胞的肿瘤，通常涉及肾上腺髓质或交感神经节。它是儿童最常见的颅外实体肿瘤。眼阵挛-肌阵挛综合征是一种副肿瘤综合征，与神经母细胞瘤密切相关。腹部肿块是常见的表现特征，骨髓浸润可导致贫血或全血细胞减少。尿液中儿茶酚胺代谢物升高（例如，HVA，VMA）是神经母细胞瘤的典型诊断发现，这源于肿瘤起源于儿茶酚胺产生细胞。\n\n（选项A）类癌肿瘤在儿童中很少见，通常表现为潮红、腹泻和由于血清素分泌引起的支气管痉挛。虽然它们可以在尿液中产生5-羟吲哚乙酸（一种血清素代谢物），但它们不会以这种方式与眼阵挛-肌阵挛综合征或腹部肿块相关联。\n\n（选项B）尤因肉瘤是一种恶性骨肿瘤，通常影响年龄较大的儿童和青少年，并表现为受影响骨骼的疼痛和肿胀。它与眼阵挛-肌阵挛综合征或儿茶酚胺升高无关。\n\n（选项C）髓母细胞瘤是儿童最常见的恶性脑肿瘤，起源于小脑，引起共济失调。虽然它可以出现副肿瘤综合征，但眼阵挛-肌阵挛并不是典型的相关性，而且它不会表现为腹部肿块或儿茶酚胺升高。\n\n（选项E）非霍奇金淋巴瘤可表现为儿童的腹部肿块，但在婴儿中很少见，并且通常与眼阵挛-肌阵挛综合征或尿液儿茶酚胺升高无关。\n\n（选项F）嗜铬细胞瘤是肾上腺髓质的肿瘤，可分泌儿茶酚胺。然而，它更常见于成人，并且通常与眼阵挛-肌阵挛综合征无关。虽然它可以引起高血压，但患者的血压在11个月大儿童的正常范围内。\n\n（选项G）肾母细胞瘤是一种肾癌，通常在幼儿时期（平均年龄3-4岁）出现腹部肿块。然而，它不会引起眼阵挛-肌阵挛综合征，也不会导致尿液中儿茶酚胺升高。\n\n关键要点：\n- 患有腹部肿块和儿茶酚胺升高的儿童出现眼阵挛-肌阵挛综合征强烈提示神经母细胞瘤。\n- 神经母细胞瘤起源于神经嵴细胞。\n- 尿液儿茶酚胺代谢物升高（HVA，VMA）是神经母细胞瘤的特征。\n- 其他副肿瘤综合征可与神经母细胞瘤相关。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of neuroblastoma, a common childhood malignancy, and its association with paraneoplastic syndromes like opsoclonus-myoclonus. It requires integrating clinical findings such as neurological symptoms, abdominal mass, anemia, and biochemical markers (elevated catecholamines) to arrive at the correct diagnosis.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the constellation of symptoms: opsoclonus-myoclonus, abdominal mass, and elevated catecholamines in a young child. Consider the differential diagnoses for each finding and look for the diagnosis that encompasses all these features. Recall the characteristic associations of neuroblastoma, particularly its link to opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome and catecholamine production.",
