  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's bone marrow aspirate has numerous plasma cells, which are distinguished by the presence of abundant basophilic cytoplasm, perinuclear paleness (large Golgi apparatus), and nuclei with \"clock-face\" (peripheral) chromatin. The presence of >10% plasma cells in the bone marrow raises strong suspicion for multiple myeloma (MM).\n\nIn multiple myeloma, neoplastic plasma cells crowd the bone marrow, leading to impairments in normal hematopoiesis. B-cell development is particularly affected, which reduces plasma cell diversity and limits the generation of targeted immunoglobulins against infectious agents. Therefore, patients with multiple myeloma have increased risk of recurrent bacterial infections, particularly of the urinary tract, lungs, and sinuses. Although patients with multiple myeloma have high levels of circulating monoclonal immunoglobulin, monoclonal immunoglobulin does not provide immunity against a diverse range of pathogens.\n\nMultiple myeloma is also associated with normocytic anemia (due to ineffective erythropoiesis), bone pain (due to osteolytic lesions), hypercalcemia, and renal insufficiency (due to clogging of the tubules with immunoglobulin light chains).\n\n(Choice A) Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that causes abnormal lysosomal fusion and transport. Although it is associated with recurrent bacterial infections and hematologic malignancies, most cases are identified in early childhood, and patients generally have hypopigmentation and progressive neurologic dysfunction.\n\n(Choice C) Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is an inherited disorder associated with defective adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes from the vasculature to tissues. Patients typically have recurrent bacterial infections that begin in early childhood. It is not associated with excessive plasma cells in the bone marrow.\n\n(Choice D) Terminal complement deficiency (C5-C9) prevents the formation of the membrane attack complex and dramatically increases the risk of recurrent infection with Neisseria species; patients are usually healthy otherwise and have no abnormalities in the bone marrow.\n\n(Choice E) Chronic granulomatous disease is a genetic disorder associated with severe bacterial and fungal infections due to impaired ability of phagocytes to generate reactive oxygen species (oxidative burst). Most cases present in early childhood, and plasma cell effacement of the bone marrow would not be seen.",
    "zh": "该患者的骨髓穿刺物中有大量浆细胞，其特征是存在丰富的嗜碱性细胞质、核周苍白（大的高尔基体）和具有“钟面” (外周) 染色质的核。骨髓中 >10% 的浆细胞提示高度怀疑多发性骨髓瘤 (MM)。\n\n在多发性骨髓瘤中，肿瘤性浆细胞拥挤在骨髓中，导致正常造血功能受损。B细胞发育受到的影响尤其大，这降低了浆细胞的多样性，并限制了针对病原体的靶向免疫球蛋白的产生。因此，多发性骨髓瘤患者发生反复细菌感染的风险增加，尤其是泌尿道、肺和鼻窦感染。尽管多发性骨髓瘤患者循环单克隆免疫球蛋白水平很高，但单克隆免疫球蛋白并不能提供针对多种病原体的免疫力。\n\n多发性骨髓瘤还与正细胞性贫血（由于无效的红细胞生成）、骨痛（由于溶骨性病变）、高钙血症和肾功能不全（由于免疫球蛋白轻链堵塞肾小管）有关。\n\n(选项A) Chediak-Higashi综合征是一种罕见的常染色体隐性遗传病，可导致溶酶体融合和转运异常。虽然它与反复细菌感染和血液系统恶性肿瘤有关，但大多数病例是在儿童早期确诊的，并且患者通常有色素减退和进行性神经功能障碍。\n\n(选项C) 白细胞粘附缺陷是一种遗传性疾病，与白细胞从血管到组织的粘附和迁移缺陷有关。患者通常在儿童早期开始反复发生细菌感染。它与骨髓中过多的浆细胞无关。\n\n(选项D) 末端补体缺陷 (C5-C9) 阻止膜攻击复合物的形成，并显着增加奈瑟菌属感染的复发风险；患者通常健康，骨髓中也没有异常。\n\n(选项E) 慢性肉芽肿病是一种遗传性疾病，由于吞噬细胞产生活性氧（氧化爆发）的能力受损，与严重的细菌和真菌感染有关。大多数病例在儿童早期出现，并且不会出现骨髓浆细胞的清除。"
