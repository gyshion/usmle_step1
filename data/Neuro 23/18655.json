    "en": "A 42-year-old, previously healthy man comes to the office for evaluation of an enlarging mole. The mole has been on his forearm for several years but has rapidly increased in size over the past 4 months. Physical examination shows an 8-mm raised lesion with variegated pigmentation and ill-defined borders on the right forearm. An excisional biopsy is performed. During the procedure, local anesthesia is achieved with an infiltrating injection of lidocaine mixed with epinephrine. {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Lidocaine is a local anesthetic that blocks pain transmission from free nerve endings. It is often mixed with epinephrine, which causes profound VASOCONSTRICTION when injected subcutaneously (alpha-1 agonist effect). This effect results in the following:\n\n*   Decreased local bleeding, making the procedure easier to complete\n*   Decreased systemic absorption of lidocaine, reducing the potential for serious adverse effects (eg, arrhythmia, seizure)\n*   Prolonged duration of action, because decreased blood flow allows more lidocaine to remain at the injection site\n\n(Choice A) Although epinephrine acts as a catecholamine neurotransmitter in the CNS, it mediates autonomic functions in the peripheral nervous system. Glutamate and substance P are the main neurotransmitters of pain sensation in the peripheral nervous system.\n\n(Choices B and D) Local anesthetics are weak bases that exist in charged and uncharged forms; the uncharged form is promoted by increased tissue pH and allows the anesthetic to diffuse through the cell membrane and bind the inside portion of sodium channels to prevent depolarization. Sodium bicarbonate is often added to lidocaine injections to increase tissue pH, which increases the potency of lidocaine.\n\n(Choice C) Medications that interact synergistically produce a greater cumulative effect than if the effects of the 2 agents alone were added together (eg, pain relief with an opioid + acetaminophen). Epinephrine does not produce anesthesia, so although it prolongs the duration of anesthesia, it does not act synergistically to increase the anesthetic effect.\n\nEducational objective:\nEpinephrine is often added to lidocaine to produce vasoconstriction, which prolongs the duration of action of lidocaine, decreases bleeding during a procedure, and reduces systemic lidocaine absorption.",
    "zh": "利多卡因是一种局部麻醉剂，可阻断来自游离神经末梢的疼痛传递。它经常与肾上腺素混合使用，肾上腺素皮下注射后会引起严重的血管收缩（α-1 激动剂效应）。这种效应导致以下结果：\n\n*   减少局部出血，使手术更容易完成\n*   减少利多卡因的全身吸收，降低发生严重不良反应（如心律失常、癫痫发作）的可能性\n*   延长作用时间，因为血流量减少使更多的利多卡因保留在注射部位\n\n（选项 A）尽管肾上腺素在中枢神经系统中充当儿茶酚胺神经递质，但它在周围神经系统中介导自主神经功能。谷氨酸和 P 物质是周围神经系统中疼痛感觉的主要神经递质。\n\n（选项 B 和 D）局部麻醉剂是弱碱，以带电和不带电形式存在；不带电形式受组织 pH 值升高促进，并允许麻醉剂通过细胞膜扩散并结合钠通道的内部部分以防止去极化。碳酸氢钠经常被添加到利多卡因注射液中以增加组织 pH 值，从而增加利多卡因的效力。\n\n（选项 C）协同作用的药物产生的累积效应大于单独添加 2 种药物的效应（例如，阿片类药物 + 对乙酰氨基酚的止痛作用）。肾上腺素不产生麻醉作用，因此，虽然它可以延长麻醉持续时间，但它不会协同作用以增加麻醉效果。\n\n教育目标：\n肾上腺素经常被添加到利多卡因中以产生血管收缩，从而延长利多卡因的作用时间，减少手术期间的出血，并减少利多卡因的全身吸收。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of local anesthetics and the rationale for adding epinephrine to lidocaine injections. It assesses understanding of vasoconstriction and its effects on local anesthetic duration and systemic absorption.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that epinephrine causes vasoconstriction, which prolongs the duration of action of lidocaine by decreasing blood flow and systemic absorption. Understanding the effects of vasoconstriction on local anesthetic properties is crucial.",
