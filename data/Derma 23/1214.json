    "en": "This patient's atopic dermatitis has been successfully treated with a topical corticosteroid, leading to suppression of the typical inflammatory features (eg, pruritis, papules, vesicles, scales). However, chronic daily use of topical corticosteroids can cause cutaneous atrophy due to the inhibition of epidermal keratinocyte proliferation and fibroblast function.\n\nFibroblasts synthesize dermal collagens 1 and 3 as well as hyaluronic acid. When these components are diminished in the extracellular matrix of the dermis, indentations, striae, tightening, and thinning of the skin result, making dermal capillaries more visible. In addition, corticosteroids induce nitric oxide release, leading to capillary dilation (ie, telangiectasia). Corticosteroids can also cause degradation and extrusion of follicular epithelium, resulting in corticosteroid-induced acne.\n\nHigh-potency topical corticosteroids can cause adverse effects within 2-3 weeks of daily usage, with less potent corticosteroids taking longer to cause similar effects. Areas with thin skin (eg, flexural surfaces, intertriginous areas, face, genitalia) are more susceptible. Recovery can be expected within weeks to months after cessation of therapy.\n\n(Choice A) Chronic topical corticosteroid therapy can cause atrophy, not hyperplasia, of subcutaneous adipose tissue and muscle layers.\n\n(Choices C and F) Dermal perivascular lymphocytosis is characteristic of the initial stage of acute atopic dermatitis. Epidermal intercellular edema (ie, spongiosis) is also seen in acute atopic dermatitis and manifests clinically as small vesicles. However, given that the patient is asymptomatic with treatment, these findings would not be expected.\n\n(Choices D and E) Epidermal hyperkeratosis (ie, thickening of the stratum corneum) and epidermal hyperplasia (ie, increased cellularity in the stratum spinosum) are characteristic of chronic atopic dermatitis, which manifests with scales and lichenification. Neither finding is present in this patient.\n\nEducational objective:\nLocal adverse effects of chronic topical corticosteroid therapy include cutaneous atrophy, telangiectasia, and corticosteroid-induced acne. Effects are more pronounced with high-potency corticosteroids and in areas of thin skin (eg, flexural areas). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者的特应性皮炎已通过局部皮质类固醇成功治疗，从而抑制了典型的炎症特征（例如，瘙痒、丘疹、水疱、鳞屑）。然而，长期每日使用局部皮质类固醇会导致皮肤萎缩，因为它可以抑制表皮角质形成细胞增殖和成纤维细胞功能。\n\n成纤维细胞合成真皮胶原蛋白1和3以及透明质酸。当这些成分在真皮的细胞外基质中减少时，会导致皮肤出现凹陷、条纹、紧绷和变薄，使真皮毛细血管更加明显。此外，皮质类固醇诱导一氧化氮释放，从而导致毛细血管扩张（即毛细血管扩张）。皮质类固醇还会导致毛囊上皮退化和外溢，从而导致皮质类固醇诱导的痤疮。\n\n高效局部皮质类固醇可在每日使用2-3周内引起不良反应，而药效较低的皮质类固醇则需要更长的时间才能产生类似的效果。皮肤较薄的区域（例如，屈侧表面、间擦区域、面部、生殖器）更容易受到影响。停药后数周至数月内可望恢复。\n\n(选项A) 长期局部皮质类固醇治疗可导致皮下脂肪组织和肌肉层萎缩，而非增生。\n\n(选项C和F) 真皮血管周围淋巴细胞增多是急性特应性皮炎初期的特征。表皮细胞间水肿（即海绵状变性）也见于急性特应性皮炎，临床表现为小水疱。然而，鉴于该患者在治疗中无症状，因此不会出现这些发现。\n\n(选项D和E) 表皮过度角化（即角质层增厚）和表皮增生（即棘层细胞增多）是慢性特应性皮炎的特征，表现为鳞屑和苔藓样变。该患者未出现任何一种发现。\n\n教育目标：\n长期局部皮质类固醇治疗的局部不良反应包括皮肤萎缩、毛细血管扩张和皮质类固醇诱导的痤疮。高效皮质类固醇和皮肤较薄的区域（例如，屈侧区域）的效果更为明显。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the adverse effects of chronic topical corticosteroid use, specifically cutaneous atrophy. It requires understanding the mechanism of action of corticosteroids on dermal fibroblasts and collagen synthesis.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that long-term topical corticosteroid use leads to skin thinning (atrophy) due to decreased collagen production. Eliminate options related to acute atopic dermatitis or hyperplasia, as the patient's condition is well-controlled with treatment.",
