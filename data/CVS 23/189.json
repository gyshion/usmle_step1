    "en": "A 46-year-old man with a 30-pack-year smoking history develops right leg pain and swelling after returning from an overseas trip. He is diagnosed with a lower extremity deep venous thrombosis and is started on intravenous heparin. Shortly after being hospitalized, he develops right-sided weakness and facial droop. CT scan of the head reveals a left middle cerebral artery stroke. Which of the following physical examination findings is most likely to be present in this patient?",

    "en": "A cerebrovascular event (eg, transient ischemic attack, stroke) in the setting of known venous thromboembolic disease is suspicious for PARADOXICAL EMBOLISM. Paradoxical emboli originate in the systemic venous circulation (lower or upper extremities) and enter the systemic arterial circulation via an intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunt. They can occur in patients with PATENT FORAMEN OVALE, ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECTS, ventricular septal defects, or large pulmonary arteriovenous malformations.\n\nAtrial septal defects with left-to-right shunting typically cause WIDE AND FIXED SPLITTING (no change with respiration) of the second heart sound (S2). Patients may also have a mid-systolic ejection murmur over the left upper sternal border resulting from increased flow across the pulmonic valve and a mid-diastolic rumble due to increased flow across the tricuspid valve. Importantly, a paradoxical embolism can occur even in patients with net left-to-right shunting due to TRANSIENT REVERSAL of the shunt during periods of elevated right-sided pressure (eg, early ventricular systole, straining during coughing or defecation).\n\n(Choice A) An early diastolic decrescendo murmur is characteristic of aortic regurgitation. Inhaled amyl nitrite produces marked vasodilatation, which reduces systemic arterial pressure and regurgitant flow (lessening the murmur).\n\n(Choice B) A systolic ejection murmur that increases in intensity with standing can be heard in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a decrease in left ventricular outflow tract size). In contrast, the murmur of valvular aortic stenosis decreases in intensity upon standing.\n\n(Choice C) Mitral or tricuspid valve stenosis can cause a diastolic murmur with presystolic accentuation due to atrial contraction. With mild stenosis, the murmur may only be audible during the accentuation phase in late diastole; atrial fibrillation may cause the murmur to disappear completely.\n\n(Choice D) The midsystolic click of mitral valve prolapse occurs earlier with inspiration due to the reduced left ventricular volume caused by decreased venous return to the left heart.\n\nEducational objective:\nParadoxical embolism occurs when a thrombus from the venous system crosses into the arterial circulation via an abnormal connection between the right and left cardiac chambers (eg, patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defect, or ventricular septal defect). Atrial left-to-right shunts cause wide and fixed splitting of S2 and can facilitate paradoxical embolism due to periods of transient shunt reversal (eg, during straining or coughing).",
    "zh": "在已知静脉血栓栓塞性疾病的情况下发生脑血管事件（例如，短暂性脑缺血发作、卒中），提示存在反常栓塞的可能性。反常栓子起源于体循环静脉（下肢或上肢），通过心内或肺内分流进入体循环动脉。它们可发生在卵圆孔未闭、房间隔缺损、室间隔缺损或大型肺动静脉畸形的患者中。\n\n伴有左向右分流的房间隔缺损通常会导致第二心音（S2）的宽而固定分裂（不随呼吸变化）。患者还可能在左上胸骨缘出现收缩中期喷射性杂音，这是由于跨肺动脉瓣的血流增加所致，并且由于跨三尖瓣的血流增加而出现舒张中期隆隆声。重要的是，即使在有净左向右分流的患者中，也可能发生反常栓塞，这是由于在右侧压力升高的时期（例如，早期心室收缩期、咳嗽或排便时的用力）分流的瞬时逆转。\n\n（选项A）早期舒张期减弱型杂音是主动脉瓣关闭不全的特征。吸入亚硝酸异戊酯会产生明显的血管扩张，从而降低体循环动脉压和反流血流（减轻杂音）。\n\n（选项B）站立时强度增加的收缩期喷射性杂音可在肥厚型心肌病患者中听到（由于左心室流出道尺寸减小）。相比之下，瓣膜性主动脉瓣狭窄的杂音在站立时强度降低。\n\n（选项C）二尖瓣或三尖瓣狭窄可引起舒张期杂音，并在收缩前期因心房收缩而增强。轻度狭窄时，杂音可能仅在舒张晚期的增强期可闻及；心房颤动可能导致杂音完全消失。\n\n（选项D）二尖瓣脱垂的收缩中期喀喇音在吸气时发生得更早，这是由于回流到左心的静脉回流减少导致左心室容积减小。\n\n教育目标：\n当来自静脉系统的血栓通过右心房和左心房之间的异常连接（例如，卵圆孔未闭、房间隔缺损或室间隔缺损）进入动脉循环时，就会发生反常栓塞。房间隔左向右分流会导致S2宽而固定的分裂，并且由于短暂的分流逆转时期（例如，用力或咳嗽期间），可促进反常栓塞的发生。"
