    "en": "A 39-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after an end-to-end motor vehicle collision. She was a restrained passenger and did not hit her head or lose consciousness. She has had abdominal pain and nausea since the collision. Blood pressure is 115/55 mm Hg and pulse is 96/min and regular. On examination, she has ecchymosis over the area of the seat belt and abdominal tenderness. CT scan of the abdomen reveals a retroperitoneal hematoma. ",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Retroperitoneal hematomas {{exhibit_1}} are commonly associated with blunt abdominal trauma and typically reflect injury to one of the retroperitoneal organs. PANCREATIC INJURY is a frequent cause, and may result from blunt abdominal trauma that rapidly compresses the pancreas against the vertebral column, as may occur from a high-riding seat belt or a steering wheel during a motor vehicle collision.\n\nPancreatic injury with retroperitoneal hematoma may initially cause only mild symptoms or be asymptomatic, but it can lead to life-threatening blood loss. Therefore, an abdominal CT scan is usually performed in patients with blunt abdominal trauma to rule out retroperitoneal hematoma as well as other intraabdominal injuries.\n\n(Choices B, C, D, and E) The spleen, liver, stomach, and transverse colon are intraperitoneal organs. Lacerations or rupture of these organs can occur in blunt abdominal trauma, but these injuries would lead to hemoperitoneum (free blood in the peritoneal space), not retroperitoneal hematoma.\n\nEducational objective:\nRetroperitoneal hematoma is a common complication of blunt abdominal trauma. The pancreas is a retroperitoneal organ, and pancreatic injury is frequently a source of retroperitoneal bleeding.",
    "zh": "腹膜后血肿{{exhibit_1}}通常与钝性腹部外伤有关，并且通常反映了对腹膜后器官之一的损伤。胰腺损伤是常见原因，可能由钝性腹部外伤引起，钝性腹部外伤会快速压迫胰腺，使其与脊柱相撞，这可能发生在车祸中高位安全带或方向盘的情况下。\n\n胰腺损伤伴腹膜后血肿最初可能仅引起轻微症状或无症状，但可能导致危及生命的失血。因此，通常对患有钝性腹部外伤的患者进行腹部CT扫描，以排除腹膜后血肿以及其他腹腔内损伤。\n\n（选项 B、C、D 和 E）脾脏、肝脏、胃和横结肠是腹膜内器官。这些器官的撕裂或破裂可能发生在钝性腹部外伤中，但这些损伤会导致血腹（腹膜腔内的游离血液），而不是腹膜后血肿。\n\n教育目标：\n腹膜后血肿是钝性腹部外伤的常见并发症。胰腺是腹膜后器官，胰腺损伤通常是腹膜后出血的来源。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the causes and presentation of retroperitoneal hematoma following blunt abdominal trauma. It requires understanding of the anatomical location of abdominal organs and the mechanism of injury.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that retroperitoneal hematomas are typically caused by injury to retroperitoneal organs. Identifying the pancreas as a retroperitoneal organ and the mechanism of injury (seatbelt compression) leads to the correct answer.",
