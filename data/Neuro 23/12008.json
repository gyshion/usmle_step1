    "en": "A 55-year-old, right-handed man comes to the emergency department due to persistent right arm tingling and numbness for the past several hours. The patient has no headache, muscle weakness, slurred speech, or difficulty ambulating. Medical history includes hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and prior ischemic stroke without residual symptoms. Anticoagulation was discontinued 2 months ago after he developed a gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg, and pulse is 92/min and regular. During the evaluation, the right arm paresthesia spreads to the entire right side of the body, and the patient develops right-sided convulsions, followed by a bilateral tonic-clonic seizure. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient with atrial fibrillation no longer takes anticoagulation medication because of gastrointestinal bleeding and now likely has a recurrent embolic stroke complicated by seizure. Stroke is one of the most common causes of seizure, which occurs due to the release of excitotoxic neurotransmitters in the ischemic brain region.\n\nInitial manifestations of a seizure vary based on the brain region affected. The primary somatosensory cortex is responsible for processing all somatic sensory input from the contralateral side of the body; therefore, a seizure in this area of the cortex would result in contralateral sensory disturbances. This patient's initial right arm numbness and paresthesia were likely caused by a focal-onset seizure originating in the left primary somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus). {{exhibit_2}}\n\nThe patient subsequently developed right-sided convulsions due to spread of the seizure to the primary motor strip (precentral gyrus) (Choice C). Shortly thereafter, the seizure activity spread to both cerebral hemispheres, resulting in generalized tonic-clonic convulsions (eg, secondary generalization).\n\n(Choice A) The frontal eye field is the region of the cerebral cortex that controls horizontal eye movement. Excitation of the left frontal eye field during a seizure would cause the eyes to deviate horizontally to the right.\n\n(Choice B) The motor speech (Broca) area is located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant (usually left) hemisphere and is responsible for controlling expressive speech/language. A lesion involving this area of the brain would likely result in uncontrolled vocalization or expressive aphasia.\n\n(Choice E) The sensory speech (Wernicke) area is located in the posterior superior temporal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere and is responsible for language comprehension. A lesion in this area of the temporal lobe would likely result in fluent aphasia with impaired comprehension or auditory auras.\n\n(Choice F) The primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe is responsible for processing visual information from the contralateral homonymous visual fields. A seizure originating from the left primary visual cortex would likely result in visual hallucinations affecting the right homonymous visual fields.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe primary somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus) is responsible for processing all somatic sensory input from the contralateral side of the body. A focal-onset seizure originating in this region of the cerebral cortex often results in contralateral sensory disturbance (eg, numbness, paresthesia).",
