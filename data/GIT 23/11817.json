    "en": "A 58-year-old man is being evaluated for constipation and weight loss over the last several months. During the past 2 weeks, he has had several episodes of rectal bleeding. The patient has never had a screening colonoscopy. Examination shows a soft and nontender abdomen without masses or organomegaly. Digital rectal examination reveals a firm palpable mass in the rectal vault. Flexible rectosigmoidoscopy shows a large ulcerative mass in the middle third of the rectum extending to the rectosigmoid junction. He undergoes surgical resection of the rectosigmoid colon. Frozen section analysis reveals clear margins of the colon specimen with metastases in the pararectal lymph nodes. Which of the following lymph node groups should be sampled in this patient for further assessment of metastatic disease? {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "一名58岁男性因近几个月便秘和体重减轻就诊。在过去的2周内，他曾发生过几次直肠出血。患者从未进行过筛查性结肠镜检查。检查显示腹部柔软，无压痛，无肿块或脏器肿大。直肠指检显示直肠壶腹内有一个坚硬的可触及肿块。乙状结肠镜检查显示直肠中三分之一处有一个大的溃疡性肿块，延伸至直乙状结肠交界处。他接受了直乙状结肠切除术。冰冻切片分析显示结肠标本边缘清晰，伴有直肠旁淋巴结转移。该患者应取哪些淋巴结组进行进一步的转移性疾病评估？ {{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "Lymphatic drainage of the colon generally follows the arterial supply. Lymph nodes are located on the bowel wall (epicolic nodes), inner bowel margins along the arterial arcades (paracolic nodes), around the corresponding mesenteric vessels (intermediate nodes), and at the origin of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries (principal nodes). The sentinel lymph nodes (first 1-4 lymph nodes draining a specific colonic segment) are usually the first site for colon cancer metastasis.\n\nLymphatic channels proximal to the anal dentate line drain into the inferior mesenteric and internal iliac lymph nodes. The upper rectum and superior part of the middle rectum follow the superior rectal nodes along the superior rectal artery into the inferior mesenteric lymph nodes. The middle to lower third of the rectum can drain upward into the inferior mesenteric nodes or follow the middle rectal nodes along the middle rectal artery to the internal iliac lymph nodes. Areas distal to the anal dentate line drain primarily into the inguinal nodes, although some lymph can also reach the inferior mesenteric and internal iliac nodes.\n\n(Choice A) The celiac lymph nodes are located around the celiac trunk and drain lymph from the gastric, hepatic, and splenic nodes. These in turn drain their respective organ systems (not the colon).\n\n(Choice C) The left colic lymph nodes and their branches are located along the left colic artery and drain the left colonic flexure and upper descending colon.\n\n(Choice D) The right colic lymph nodes are found along the right colic artery and primarily drain the upper ascending colon.\n\n(Choice E) The superficial inguinal lymph nodes lie below the inguinal ligament and are bordered by the sartorius and adductor longus muscles. They drain parts of the genitalia (eg, penis, scrotum, perineum, and vulva), buttocks, anus below the dentate line, and abdominal wall below the umbilicus.\n\n(Choice F) The superior mesenteric lymph nodes (mesenteric, ileocolic, and mesocolic) mainly drain the ileum, jejunum, vermiform process, and parts of the ascending and transverse colon.\n\n(Choice G) Lymph node metastasis typically occurs sequentially through the epicolic/paracolic, intermediate, and paraaortic lymph node. Later in the disease course, the cancer can spread via the thoracic duct to the supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow node).\n\nEducational objective:\nLymphatic drainage of the rectum proximal to the anal dentate line occurs via the inferior mesenteric and internal iliac lymph nodes. Areas distal to the dentate line drain primarily into the inguinal nodes.",
    "zh": "结肠的淋巴引流通常遵循动脉供应。淋巴结位于肠壁上（肠旁淋巴结），动脉弓旁的肠内缘（结肠旁淋巴结），相应肠系膜血管周围（中间淋巴结），以及肠系膜上动脉和肠系膜下动脉的起始处（主淋巴结）。前哨淋巴结（引流特定结肠段的前1-4个淋巴结）通常是结肠癌转移的第一个部位。\n\n肛门齿状线近端的淋巴管引流入肠系膜下淋巴结和髂内淋巴结。直肠上部和中段上部沿直肠上动脉的直肠上淋巴结引流入肠系膜下淋巴结。直肠中下三分之一可以向上引流入肠系膜下淋巴结，或沿直肠中动脉的直肠中淋巴结引流入髂内淋巴结。肛门齿状线远端的区域主要引流入腹股沟淋巴结，尽管一些淋巴液也可以到达肠系膜下淋巴结和髂内淋巴结。\n\n(选项A) 腹腔淋巴结位于腹腔干周围，引流来自胃、肝和脾的淋巴液。这些淋巴结又引流各自的器官系统（不是结肠）。\n\n(选项C) 左结肠淋巴结及其分支位于左结肠动脉旁，引流左结肠弯曲和降结肠上部。\n\n(选项D) 右结肠淋巴结位于右结肠动脉旁，主要引流升结肠上部。\n\n(选项E) 腹股沟浅淋巴结位于腹股沟韧带下方，由缝匠肌和内收长肌围成。它们引流生殖器（例如，阴茎、阴囊、会阴和外阴）、臀部、齿状线以下的肛门以及脐以下的腹壁。\n\n(选项F) 肠系膜上淋巴结（肠系膜、回结肠和结肠系膜）主要引流回肠、空肠、阑尾和升结肠和横结肠的部分。\n\n(选项G) 淋巴结转移通常通过肠旁/结肠旁、中间和主动脉旁淋巴结依次发生。在疾病后期，癌症可以通过胸导管扩散到锁骨上淋巴结（Virchow淋巴结）。\n\n教育目标：\n肛门齿状线近端的直肠淋巴引流通过肠系膜下淋巴结和髂内淋巴结发生。齿状线远端的区域主要引流入腹股沟淋巴结。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of lymphatic drainage patterns of the rectum and colon, specifically which lymph node groups are most likely to be involved in metastasis from a rectal tumor. Understanding the anatomical relationships and lymphatic pathways is crucial for staging and surgical planning in colorectal cancer.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to recognize that the tumor is located in the middle third of the rectum, proximal to the anal dentate line. Therefore, the lymphatic drainage will primarily involve the inferior mesenteric and internal iliac lymph nodes. Knowing the lymphatic drainage patterns helps narrow down the options to the correct answer.",
    "zh": "此问题测试对直肠和结肠淋巴引流模式的了解，特别是哪个淋巴结组最有可能参与直肠肿瘤的转移。了解解剖关系和淋巴通路对于结直肠癌的分期和手术计划至关重要。\n\n解决此问题的关键是认识到肿瘤位于直肠中三分之一处，靠近肛门齿状线。因此，淋巴引流将主要涉及肠系膜下淋巴结和髂内淋巴结。了解淋巴引流模式有助于将选项缩小到正确答案。"
