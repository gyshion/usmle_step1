    "en": "A 43-year-old woman comes to the office for an initial appointment due to ongoing abdominal pain, general weakness, decreased appetite, and dizziness. She says the pain is ruining her life and is worried that her previous physicians may have missed something. Over the past several years, the patient has been hospitalized 3 times with similar symptoms. No etiology for the pain has been identified despite extensive workups, including several abdominal CT scans and an exploratory laparotomy. The patient describes chronic abdominal pain since adolescence and is concerned as the nonprescription analgesics she takes are ineffective. She has no history of psychiatric diagnoses or substance abuse. Physical examination, vital signs, and laboratory tests (including chemistry panel, complete blood count, and urinalysis) are within normal limits.",
    "zh": "一名43岁的女性因持续性腹痛、全身乏力、食欲下降和头晕前来就诊。她说疼痛正在毁掉她的生活，并担心之前的医生可能遗漏了什么。在过去的几年里，该患者曾因类似症状住院3次。尽管进行了广泛的检查，包括几次腹部CT扫描和一次探查性剖腹手术，但仍未确定疼痛的病因。该患者描述了自青春期以来就患有慢性腹痛，并担心她服用的非处方止痛药无效。她没有精神病学诊断或药物滥用的病史。体格检查、生命体征和实验室检查（包括化学检查、全血细胞计数和尿液分析）均在正常范围内。"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's preoccupation with unexplained medical symptoms and excessive health care use are characteristic of SOMATIC SYMPTOM DISORDER. The best approach is to schedule REGULAR VISITS with her primary care provider, who can monitor her condition and AVOID UNNECESSARY DIAGNOSTIC TESTING and specialist referrals (Choices B and C).\n\nIn contrast to symptom-driven visits, regular visits provide patients with an opportunity to discuss their concerns without the need to have new or worsening symptoms. This may decrease the use of emergency services and encourage formation of a therapeutic alliance. Rather than focusing on symptom elimination, office visits should emphasize a return to occupational and social activities (functional improvement) and promotion of stress reduction and healthy behaviors (eg, diet, exercise).\n\n(Choices A and F) This patient currently has no insight into the psychological nature of her disorder and would likely feel invalidated and unreceptive to being told that her condition is psychogenic and/or by getting referred to a psychiatrist for treatment. Once a physician-patient relationship is established, she may be able to accept that psychological distress plays a role in her condition and be more receptive to psychiatric referral.\n\n(Choice D) Use of potentially addictive pain medication should be avoided.\n\n(Choice E) Reassurance alone is rarely effective in managing somatic symptom disorder. Optimal management consists of regularly scheduled visits so that the patient does not have to justify a visit.",
    "zh": "该患者对无法解释的医学症状的关注和过度使用医疗保健是躯体症状障碍的特征。最好的方法是安排与她的初级保健医生进行定期复诊，医生可以监测她的病情，并避免不必要的诊断检查和专科医生转诊（选项B和C）。\n\n与以症状为导向的复诊不同，定期复诊为患者提供了讨论他们担忧的机会，而无需出现新的或恶化的症状。这可能会减少急诊服务的使用，并鼓励形成治疗联盟。办公室复诊不应侧重于消除症状，而应强调恢复职业和社会活动（功能改善）以及促进减压和健康行为（例如饮食、锻炼）。\n\n（选项A和F）该患者目前对她的疾病的心理本质没有洞察力，并且可能会感到无效，并且不愿意被告知她的病情是心理性的和/或被转诊给精神科医生治疗。一旦建立了医患关系，她可能能够接受心理困扰在她的病情中起作用，并且更容易接受精神科转诊。\n\n（选项D）应避免使用可能成瘾的止痛药。\n\n（选项E）单独的安慰很少能有效地管理躯体症状障碍。最佳管理包括定期复诊，这样患者就不必证明复诊的合理性。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the management principles for patients with somatic symptom disorder, emphasizing the importance of a structured, ongoing therapeutic relationship over further diagnostic testing or immediate psychiatric referral.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the pattern of somatic symptom disorder and applying the recommended management strategy, which prioritizes regular primary care visits to build trust and focus on functional improvement rather than symptom elimination.",
