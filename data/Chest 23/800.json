    "en": "Surfactant is an essential lipoprotein complex that decreases alveolar surface tension and facilitates alveolar expansion. Quantity and quality of surfactant increases throughout gestation and correlates with greater fetal lung maturity. Assessment of fetal lung maturity is not often indicated because infants of gestational age <32 weeks can be presumed to have immature lungs while those who are full term typically do not. However, a subset of patients may benefit from an evaluation of lung maturity to weigh the risks and benefits to the mother and fetus of preterm delivery versus continuing a medically complex pregnancy.\n\nSeveral markers of surfactant production and quality within amniotic fluid can help guide estimations of fetal lung maturity:\n\n*   Lamellar bodies are organelles within type 2 pneumocytes that store, transport, and secrete surfactant into the air-liquid interface of the alveoli. Increased lamellar body counts within the amniotic fluid are associated with increased surfactant production and lung maturity.\n*   Phosphatidylcholine (also known as lecithin [L]) and sphingomyelin (S) are lipid components of surfactant. They are produced in approximately equal amounts until the middle of the third trimester, at which point the phosphatidylcholine concentration increases sharply while the sphingomyelin level remains low, as represented by curves 1 and 2, respectively (Choices C and E). This change in composition (L/S >2) later in gestation reflects production of a more mature surfactant. {{exhibit_2}}\n*   Phosphatidylglycerol is a phospholipid component of surfactant that increases late in the third trimester, and its presence suggests advanced lung maturity.\n\n(Choices A and D) Amniotic fluid albumin concentrations normally decrease from mid-gestation to term. Albumin is not a clinically significant marker of fetal development.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nFetal lung maturity correlates with increased quantity and improved quality of surfactant production. Amniotic fluid markers of maturity during late gestation include increased phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) and phosphatidylglycerol and low sphingomyelin.",
    "zh": "表面活性物质是一种必需的脂蛋白复合物，可降低肺泡表面张力并促进肺泡扩张。表面活性物质的数量和质量在整个妊娠过程中增加，并与胎儿肺部成熟度相关。评估胎儿肺部成熟度通常不是必需的，因为妊娠年龄<32周的婴儿可以被推定为肺部未成熟，而足月儿通常不会。然而，一部分患者可能受益于肺部成熟度的评估，以权衡早产相对于继续复杂妊娠对母亲和胎儿的风险和益处。\n\n羊水中几种表面活性物质的产生和质量的标志物可以帮助估算胎儿肺部成熟度：\n\n*   板层小体是II型肺泡细胞内的细胞器，储存、运输并将表面活性物质分泌到肺泡的气-液界面。羊水中板层小体计数增加与表面活性物质产生增加和肺部成熟度有关。\n*   磷脂酰胆碱（也称为卵磷脂[L]）和鞘磷脂（S）是表面活性物质的脂质成分。它们产生的量大致相等，直到妊娠中期，此时磷脂酰胆碱浓度急剧增加，而鞘磷脂水平保持较低，分别由曲线1和2表示（选项C和E）。这种成分变化（L/S >2）在妊娠后期反映了更成熟的表面活性物质的产生。{{exhibit_2}}\n*   磷脂酰甘油是表面活性物质的磷脂成分，在妊娠晚期增加，其存在提示肺部高度成熟。\n\n（选项A和D）羊水白蛋白浓度通常从妊娠中期到足月下降。白蛋白不是胎儿发育的临床重要标志物。\n\n教育目标：\n\n胎儿肺部成熟度与表面活性物质产生数量增加和质量提高相关。妊娠晚期成熟度的羊水标志物包括磷脂酰胆碱（卵磷脂）和磷脂酰甘油增加，以及鞘磷脂降低。"
