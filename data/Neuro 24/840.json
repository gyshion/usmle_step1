    "en": "A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of involuntary movements and behavioral disturbance. The patient has frequent, jerky, irregular movements of his upper extremities that have progressively worsened over the past month. His family and friends also say that he has become increasingly irritable over the past year. Genetic testing shows a mutation affecting the huntingtin protein that results in transcriptional repression of several other genes. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for this transcriptional repression?",

    "en": "Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by an increased number of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein. Expansion of the protein's polyglutamine region results in a gain-of-function mutation that leads to pathologic interaction with other proteins, including various transcription factors.\n\nTranscriptional repression (silencing) is one of the mechanisms by which mutated huntingtin is thought to cause disease. Regulation of transcription occurs in part due to histones. Small proteins that complex with DNA to help compact the strands. Histones can undergo a variety of modifications (eg, methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation) that affect the accessibility of the genome for transcription. Acetylation of histones (via histone acetyltransferase) enhances gene transcription by weakening DNA-histone bonding (ie, relaxed chromatin) and making DNA segments more accessible for transcription factors and RNA polymerases.\n\nIn Huntington disease, abnormal huntingtin reduces functioning of histone acetyltransferase. The resulting hypoacetylation increases DNA-histone bonding, leading to a relative increase in compact chromatin. Decreased DNA accessibility reduces transcription of genes that code for neurotrophic (ie, survival) factors, thus contributing to impaired neuronal survival. Increased neuron death in the striatum leads to classic features of Huntington disease in adulthood, including chorea, behavioral abnormalities (eg, irritability), and progressive dementia.\n\n(Choice A) Chromatin relaxation allows portions of DNA to be accessible for transcription. In contrast, the pathophysiology of Huntington disease involves chromatin that is excessively compact and inaccessible to transcription due to histone deacetylation.\n\n(Choice B) DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that inhibits gene transcription. Hypermethylation of the promoter region of a gene results in transcriptional silencing, as in fragile X syndrome; hypomethylation improves gene expression and is not involved in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease.\n\n(Choice D) Homeodomain (homeobox) genes are critical for the sequential development of organs and tissues along the body axis during embryogenesis. Mutations affecting these genes alter body structure, leading to congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion.\n\n(Choice E) Thymidine dimerization is a mechanism of DNA damage induced by ultraviolet radiation.\n\nEducational objective:\nHuntington disease is caused by a pathologic gain-of-function mutation that promotes histone deacetylation. The resulting increase in DNA-histone bonding makes the chromatin less accessible for transcription, which limits expression of neurotrophic (ie, survival) factors. Increased neuron death within the striatum leads to classic features of Huntington disease in adulthood (eg, chorea, behavioral abnormalities, progressive dementia).",
    "zh": "亨廷顿病是一种常染色体显性神经退行性疾病，由编码亨廷顿蛋白的基因中CAG三核苷酸重复次数增加引起。该蛋白多聚谷氨酰胺区域的扩张导致功能获得性突变，从而导致与其他蛋白质（包括各种转录因子）的病理性相互作用。\n\n转录抑制（沉默）是突变的亨廷顿蛋白被认为导致疾病的机制之一。转录的调节部分是由于组蛋白引起的。组蛋白是一种与DNA结合的小蛋白，有助于压缩链。组蛋白可以经历各种修饰（例如，甲基化、乙酰化、磷酸化），这些修饰会影响基因组的转录可及性。组蛋白乙酰化（通过组蛋白乙酰转移酶）通过削弱DNA-组蛋白结合（即，松弛的染色质）并使DNA片段更容易被转录因子和RNA聚合酶接近来增强基因转录。\n\n在亨廷顿病中，异常的亨廷顿蛋白会降低组蛋白乙酰转移酶的功能。由此产生的低乙酰化作用增加了DNA-组蛋白结合，导致相对增加的紧密染色质。DNA可及性的降低会减少编码神经营养（即，存活）因子的基因的转录，从而导致神经元存活受损。纹状体中神经元死亡的增加导致成年亨廷顿病的典型特征，包括舞蹈症、行为异常（如易怒）和进行性痴呆。\n\n(选项A) 染色质松弛使部分DNA可用于转录。相比之下，亨廷顿病的病理生理学涉及染色质过度紧密，并且由于组蛋白去乙酰化而无法转录。\n\n(选项B) DNA甲基化是一种表观遗传修饰，可抑制基因转录。基因启动子区域的过度甲基化导致转录沉默，如脆性X综合征；低甲基化改善基因表达，并且不参与亨廷顿病的发生。\n\n(选项D) 同源结构域（同源异形盒）基因对于胚胎发生过程中沿身体轴的器官和组织的顺序发育至关重要。影响这些基因的突变会改变身体结构，导致先天性畸形或自然流产。\n\n(选项E) 胸腺嘧啶二聚体是紫外线辐射诱导的DNA损伤机制。\n\n教育目标：\n亨廷顿病是由一种促进组蛋白去乙酰化的病理性功能获得性突变引起的。由此导致的DNA-组蛋白结合增加使染色质更难接近转录，从而限制了神经营养（即，存活）因子的表达。纹状体内神经元死亡的增加导致成年亨廷顿病的典型特征（例如，舞蹈症、行为异常、进行性痴呆）。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional repression in Huntington disease, specifically focusing on epigenetic modifications of chromatin structure. It assesses the knowledge of how mutations in the huntingtin protein lead to altered histone acetylation and subsequent gene silencing.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the core pathology of Huntington disease as described in the stem, which involves a mutation affecting the huntingtin protein leading to transcriptional repression. Recall the role of histone acetylation in regulating gene transcription and how its dysregulation, particularly deacetylation, leads to chromatin condensation and reduced gene expression, which is the key mechanism in this disease.",
