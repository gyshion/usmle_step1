    "en": "A 55-year-old man with a history of chronic pancreatitis and alcohol abuse is investigated for recent onset weight loss, decreased appetite, and worsening of chronic abdominal pain. Physical examination is significant for diffuse muscle atrophy, temporal wasting, and a mildly enlarged liver without ascites. Serum lipase and amylase are normal, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is mildly elevated. Abdominal imaging shows a malignant mass in the pancreas. The patient subsequently undergoes an uncomplicated subtotal pancreatectomy and returns for a postoperative nutritional assessment following hospital discharge.",
    "zh": "一名55岁男性，有慢性胰腺炎和酗酒史，因近期出现的体重减轻、食欲下降和慢性腹痛加重而接受检查。体格检查显示弥漫性肌肉萎缩、颞肌消瘦以及轻度肝脏肿大，无腹水。血清脂肪酶和淀粉酶正常，天冬氨酸氨基转移酶 (AST) 轻度升高。腹部影像学检查显示胰腺内有恶性肿块。随后，患者接受了无并发症的胰腺次全切除术，并在出院后返回进行术后营养评估。"

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The exocrine pancreas has a significant secretory reserve, and ≥90% of the glandular tissue must be destroyed before a patient will develop clinical malabsorption. However, this patient likely has significant loss of pancreatic tissue at baseline due to chronic pancreatitis and is at increased risk for EXOCRINE INSUFFICIENCY. Following partial pancreatic resection, he may develop clinically significant deficiency in any of the pancreatic digestive enzymes normally secreted into the duodenum.\n\nPancreatic amylases, along with salivary and brush border amylases, are required for the degradation of polysaccharides into monosaccharides, as polysaccharides cannot be absorbed by the intestinal mucosa. In contrast, monosaccharides (eg, glucose, galactose) are taken up directly by the epithelial cells of the small intestine through either sodium-dependent cotransport or facilitated diffusion. D-xylose is a monosaccharide that is absorbed directly without the action of pancreatic enzymes, and can be used to test for brush border absorptive function independent of pancreatic function. Intestinal D-xylose absorption can also decrease with bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine.\n\n(Choices A and B) Patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency will have decreased secretion of trypsin and lipase into the duodenum following cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulation.\n\n(Choice D) Trypsinogen is a proenzyme secreted by the exocrine pancreas into the small intestine. Small quantities are also detectable in serum. Serum trypsinogen levels are increased in acute pancreatitis but often decreased in patients with chronic pancreatitis or other forms of chronic pancreatic insufficiency.\n\n(Choice E) The stool neutral fat (triglyceride) content is increased after pancreatic resection due to deficiency of pancreatic lipase.",
    "zh": "外分泌胰腺具有显著的分泌储备，在患者出现临床吸收不良之前，必须破坏≥90%的腺体组织。然而，由于慢性胰腺炎，该患者可能在基线时就已出现大量胰腺组织丢失，并且发生外分泌功能不全的风险增加。在部分胰腺切除术后，他可能会出现任何通常分泌到十二指肠中的胰腺消化酶的临床显著缺乏。\n\n胰淀粉酶与唾液淀粉酶和刷状缘淀粉酶一起，是将多糖降解为单糖所必需的，因为多糖不能被肠粘膜吸收。相反，单糖（如葡萄糖、半乳糖）通过钠依赖性协同转运或易化扩散直接被小肠上皮细胞摄取。D-木糖是一种单糖，无需胰酶的作用即可直接吸收，可用于检测独立于胰腺功能的刷状缘吸收功能。肠道D-木糖吸收也可能因小肠细菌过度生长而降低。\n\n（选项A和B）患有外分泌胰腺功能不全的患者在胆囊收缩素 (CCK) 刺激后，十二指肠中胰蛋白酶和脂肪酶的分泌会减少。\n\n（选项D）胰酶原是一种由外分泌胰腺分泌到小肠中的酶原。在血清中也可以检测到少量。血清胰酶原水平在急性胰腺炎中升高，但在患有慢性胰腺炎或其他形式的慢性胰腺功能不全的患者中通常会降低。\n\n（选项E）由于胰脂肪酶缺乏，胰腺切除术后粪便中性脂肪（甘油三酯）含量增加。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pancreatic exocrine function and the impact of pancreatectomy on nutrient absorption. Specifically, it assesses understanding of which nutrients require pancreatic enzymes for absorption versus those that are absorbed directly.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that D-xylose is a monosaccharide absorbed directly by the intestinal mucosa, independent of pancreatic enzyme function. Therefore, intestinal D-xylose absorption will likely be normal even after pancreatectomy.",
    "zh": "此问题测试对胰腺外分泌功能的了解以及胰腺切除术对营养吸收的影响。具体而言，它评估对哪些营养物质需要胰酶才能吸收，以及哪些营养物质被直接吸收的理解。\n\n解决此问题的关键是认识到D-木糖是一种单糖，由肠粘膜直接吸收，独立于胰酶功能。因此，即使在胰腺切除术后，肠道D-木糖的吸收也可能正常。"
