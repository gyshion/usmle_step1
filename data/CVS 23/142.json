    "en": "Around-the-clock nitrate administration (in any form) rapidly results in development of tolerance to nitrates. This is why a nitrate-free interval must be provided every day in patients that are using daily long acting nitrates. The mechanism by which this occurs has not been fully demonstrated, but it is theorized that it is due to a decreased vascular sensitivity to nitrates and an increased sensitivity to endogenous vasoconstricting agents. Usually the nitrate-free period is timed to occur during the night when the patient is sleeping and cardiac work is the least.\n\n(Choice A) A pharmacokinetic drug interaction refers to how drugs that are used together in a patient affect the absorption and elimination of each other. An example of this is the ability of rifampin to increase the metabolism and elimination of warfarin by inducing cytochrome P-450. This is not the reason for providing a nitrate-free interval.\n\n(Choice B) Pharmacodynamic drug antagonism refers to the ability of a drug, as part of its mechanism of action, to antagonize, or prevent, the effect of another drug or endogenous substance. An example of this is the effect that labetalol has on alpha-1 and beta adrenergic receptors – it prevents the binding of catecholamines to these receptors.\n\n(Choice C) Effect potentiation refers to one drug’s ability to increase the pharmacologic effect of another agent. The drugs mentioned in this question stem do not potentiate the effects of each other, and this is not the reason for providing a nitrate-free period. Beta-adrenergic blockers are often prescribed along with nitrates to prevent reflex tachycardia as well as to provide decreased cardiac work by a mechanism different from that of nitrates.\n\n(Choice E) Withdrawal symptoms occur when a patient forms a physiologic dependence on a drug or medication and that drug or medication is then discontinued. This is common in patients using alcohol, opiates, benzodiazepines, stimulants and some antidepressants. This is not the reason for providing a nitrate-free period in patients taking nitrates.\n\n(Choice F) Drug noncompliance is a problem where patients do not take the medications prescribed to them properly or at all. It is frequent among patients who do not understand their disease, can not afford medications, or simply can not remember to take them. The latter becomes much more frequent when patients are taking multiple medications with many times-per-day dosing schedules. This is also not the reason for providing a nitrate-free period every day in patients taking long-term nitrates.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients taking daily maintenance nitrates need to have a nitrate-free period every day to avoid tolerance to the drug.",
    "zh": "全天候使用硝酸盐（任何形式）会导致对硝酸盐产生耐药性。 这就是为什么对于每天使用长效硝酸盐的患者，每天必须提供无硝酸盐间隔。 发生这种情况的机制尚未完全阐明，但理论上是由于血管对硝酸盐的敏感性降低以及对内源性血管收缩剂的敏感性增加。 通常，无硝酸盐期安排在患者睡眠且心脏做功最少时进行。\n\n(选项 A) 药代动力学药物相互作用是指在患者中一起使用的药物如何影响彼此的吸收和消除。 例如，利福平通过诱导细胞色素 P-450 来增加华法林的代谢和消除。 这不是提供无硝酸盐间隔的原因。\n\n(选项 B) 药效学药物拮抗作用是指药物作为其作用机制的一部分，拮抗或阻止另一种药物或内源性物质的作用。 例如，拉贝洛尔对 α-1 和 β 肾上腺素能受体的影响——它阻止儿茶酚胺与这些受体的结合。\n\n(选项 C) 效应增强是指一种药物能够增强另一种药物的药理作用。 本题干中提到的药物不会相互增强作用，这也不是提供无硝酸盐期period的原因。 β-肾上腺素阻滞剂通常与硝酸盐一起开具，以防止反射性心动过速，并通过与硝酸盐不同的机制降低心脏负荷。\n\n(选项 E) 当患者对某种药物或药物产生生理依赖性，然后停用该药物或药物时，就会出现戒断症状。 这在饮酒、使用阿片类药物、苯二氮卓类药物、兴奋剂和一些抗抑郁药的患者中很常见。 这不是为服用硝酸盐的患者提供无硝酸盐期的原因。\n\n(选项 F) 药物依从性差是指患者没有正确或根本没有服用处方药。 这在不了解其疾病、无力负担药物或根本不记得服药的患者中很常见。 当患者服用多种药物，并且每天多次给药时，后者会变得更加频繁。 这也不是为每天服用长期硝酸盐的患者提供无硝酸盐期的原因。\n\n教育目标：\n每天服用维持性硝酸盐的患者需要每天有无硝酸盐期，以避免对该药物产生耐药性。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of nitrate tolerance and the importance of nitrate-free intervals in patients taking long-acting nitrates for angina. It also tests the understanding of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interactions.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that continuous exposure to nitrates leads to tolerance. Therefore, a nitrate-free interval is necessary to maintain the drug's effectiveness and prevent tolerance development.",
