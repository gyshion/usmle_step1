    "en": "Patients with β thalassemia have decreased β globin synthesis, which causes hypochromic, microcytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume <80 μm3). Reduced β globin synthesis also results in the precipitation of unpaired α chains within red cells, causing membrane damage. This subsequently leads to the death of red cell precursors in the bone marrow (ineffective erythropoiesis) and lysis of circulating erythrocytes (hemolysis).\n\nNormal erythrocytes have an area of central pallor that typically measures 1/3 of the cell diameter. Patients with β thalassemia classically have blood smears showing small red cells with an increased area of central pallor, as seen in the image {{exhibit_1}} above. Other common findings include anisopoikilocytosis (variation in size and shape), target cells, nucleated red cell precursors, and basophilic stippling.\n\n(Choices A and E) Hyperchromia is characterized by reduced central pallor due to increased hemoglobin concentration and is usually associated with spherocytosis. Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by a variety of molecular defects in the genes that encode certain red cell membrane proteins (eg, spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, protein 4.2).\n\n(Choice B) Iron deficiency often leads to hypochromic, microcytic anemia and is commonly caused by chronic, asymptomatic bleeding (eg, slow gastrointestinal bleed, abnormal menstruation). In contrast, patients with thalassemia often have iron overload, not iron deficiency.\n\n(Choice D) Red blood cell sickling occurs in sickle cell anemia, which is caused by an A to T mutation in the β globin gene that results in glutamate being substituted with valine at position 6.",
    "zh": "β地中海贫血患者β珠蛋白合成减少，导致低色素性、小细胞性贫血（平均红细胞体积<80 μm3）。β珠蛋白合成减少还会导致红细胞内未配对的α链沉淀，引起细胞膜损伤。这随后导致骨髓中红细胞前体死亡（无效红细胞生成）和循环红细胞溶解（溶血）。\n\n正常红细胞具有中央淡染区，通常测量为细胞直径的1/3。β地中海贫血患者通常血涂片显示小红细胞，中央淡染区增大，如上图{{exhibit_1}}所示。其他常见发现包括大小和形状不一、靶形细胞、有核红细胞前体和嗜碱性点彩。\n\n（选项A和E）高色素症的特征是由于血红蛋白浓度增加而导致中央淡染区减少，通常与球形红细胞增多症相关。遗传性球形红细胞增多症是由编码某些红细胞膜蛋白（例如，血影蛋白、锚蛋白、带3、蛋白4.2）的基因中的各种分子缺陷引起的。\n\n（选项B）缺铁常导致低色素性、小细胞性贫血，通常由慢性、无症状性出血（例如，缓慢的胃肠道出血、月经不调）引起。相比之下，地中海贫血患者通常有铁超载，而不是缺铁。\n\n（选项D）镰状红细胞病发生于镰状细胞性贫血，镰状细胞性贫血是由β珠蛋白基因中的A到T突变引起的，该突变导致谷氨酸在第6位被缬氨酸取代。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of beta thalassemia and its characteristic laboratory findings, specifically microcytic anemia. The key to answering this question is recognizing that decreased beta globin chain synthesis leads to microcytosis.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the pathophysiology of beta thalassemia and its impact on red blood cell production. Remember that beta thalassemia results in decreased beta globin chain synthesis, leading to hypochromic, microcytic anemia.",
    "zh": "此题考察对β地中海贫血及其特征性实验室检查结果的了解，特别是小细胞性贫血。回答此题的关键是认识到β珠蛋白链合成减少会导致小细胞症。\n\n要解决此问题，请回忆β地中海贫血的病理生理学及其对红细胞生成的影响。请记住，β地中海贫血会导致β珠蛋白链合成减少，从而导致低色素性、小细胞性贫血。"
