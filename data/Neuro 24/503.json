    "en": "A 20-year-old woman comes to the physician because of multiple burns on her hands. She says that she gets burned quite often when she cooks, particularly while operating the oven. She also has burned herself when picking up her morning cup of coffee and when testing the water temperature in the shower. The patient is concerned because she cannot feel when objects are \"really hot\" and often does not notice that she has burns until she looks at her hands. She has no significant past medical history, no recent illnesses, and no sick contacts. Her surgical history is significant only for removal of impacted wisdom teeth 1 year ago. The patient has never smoked, drinks alcohol occasionally, and does not use illicit drugs. Her family history is significant for multiple sclerosis in her mother. Examination shows diminished pinprick and temperature sensation across the upper back, shoulders, and arms bilaterally. Light touch, position, and vibration sense are preserved. Examination of the lower extremities is unremarkable. Damage to which of the following spinal cord areas is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?",
    "zh": "一名20岁的女性来看医生，因为她的双手有多处烧伤。她说她在做饭时经常被烧伤，尤其是在使用烤箱时。她还在拿起早晨的咖啡杯和测试淋浴的水温时烧伤了自己。患者很担心，因为她感觉不到物体“真的很热”，并且经常在看到自己的手之前没有注意到自己已经烧伤了。她没有重要的既往病史，没有近期疾病，也没有接触过病人。她的手术史仅限于1年前拔除了阻生智齿。患者从不吸烟，偶尔饮酒，不使用违禁药物。她的家族史中有她母亲患多发性硬化症。检查显示双侧上背部、肩部和手臂的针刺和温度感觉减弱。轻触、位置和振动觉保留。下肢检查无异常。以下脊髓区域的损伤最有可能导致该患者的症状？"

    "en": "This patient most likely has SYRINGOMYELIA, which classically presents with disproportionate loss of PAIN and TEMPERATURE SENSATION (dissociated anesthesia) involving the ARMS and HANDS. In syringomyelia, a cerebrospinal fluid-filled cavity called a syrinx usually forms in the cervical region of the spinal cord. These cavities can enlarge over time and destroy adjacent portions of the spinal cord. The areas most commonly damaged are the ventral white commissure and ventral horns.\n\nThe VENTRAL WHITE COMMISSURE is located just anterior to the gray commissure. It is the area of decussation for the fibers of the LATERAL SPINOTHALAMIC TRACT, which transmits PAIN and TEMPERATURE SENSATION from peripheral receptors to the somatosensory cortex. Destruction of the VENTRAL WHITE COMMISSURE leads to loss of pain and temperature sensation bilaterally over the affected dermatomes (starting 1 to 2 levels below the lesion), as the axons briefly ascend in the zone of Lissauer before decussating. Touch, vibration, and position senses are preserved as the dorsal columns remain intact.\n\n(Choice B) The ventral horns contain lower motor neurons that receive impulses from the lateral corticospinal tract. Damage to the ventral horn can occur in syringomyelia, but would cause flaccid paralysis and atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles (not loss of pain and temperature sensation).\n\n(Choice C) The ventral spinothalamic tract is located in this area and transmits crude touch and pressure sensation. It should not be confused with the lateral spinothalamic tract, which carries pain and temperature sensation.\n\n(Choice D) After decussating in the ventral white commissure, axons of the lateral spinothalamic tract ascend to the brain in the lateral funiculus. Damage to this area would cause contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation distally, beginning 1 to 2 segments below the lesion. However, bilateral sensory loss would not occur with damage to this area.\n\n(Choice E) The dorsal horn contains first order axons and second order neurons that transmit sensory input from peripheral receptors. Damage to the dorsal horn would likely result in unilateral loss of all sensation over the affected dermatomes.\n\n(Choice F) The dorsal column contains both the gracile and cuneate fasciculi. They are formed by axons of first-order neurons of the dorsal column pathway. This tract is the primary mediator of proprioception, vibration, and tactile sensation.\n\nEducational objective:\nSyringomyelia is characterized by the formation of a cavity (syrinx) in the cervical region of the spinal cord. The syrinx damages the ventral white commissure, leading to bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation that is limited to the affected levels (typically the arms and hands); distal sensation is preserved. Destruction of the motor neurons in the ventral horns (due to extension of the syrinx) results in flaccid paralysis and atrophy of the intrinsic muscles of the hand.",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有脊髓空洞症，其典型表现为疼痛和温度感觉的比例性丧失（分离性麻醉），涉及手臂和手。在脊髓空洞症中，一个充满脑脊液的空腔称为空洞，通常形成于脊髓的颈椎区域。这些空腔会随着时间的推移而增大并破坏脊髓的相邻部分。最常受损的区域是前白质连合和前角。\n\n前白质连合位于灰质连合的前方。它是侧脊髓丘脑束纤维的交叉区域，该束将疼痛和温度感觉从周围感受器传递到体感皮层。破坏前白质连合会导致双侧受累皮节（从病变下方 1 到 2 个水平开始）的疼痛和温度感觉丧失，因为轴突在交叉前短暂地向上到达 Lissauer 区。触觉、振动觉和位置觉得以保留，因为后索保持完整。\n\n（选项 B）前角包含来自侧皮质脊髓束的冲动的下运动神经元。脊髓空洞症可能发生前角的损伤，但会导致手部固有肌肉的弛缓性麻痹和萎缩（而不是疼痛和温度感觉的丧失）。\n\n（选项 C）前脊髓丘脑束位于该区域，并传递粗略的触觉和压力感觉。它不应与传递疼痛和温度感觉的侧脊髓丘脑束混淆。\n\n（选项 D）在前白质连合交叉后，侧脊髓丘脑束的轴突在侧索中上升到大脑。该区域的损伤将导致病变远端对侧的疼痛和温度感觉丧失，从病变下方 1 到 2 个节段开始。但是，该区域的损伤不会发生双侧感觉丧失。\n\n（选项 E）后角包含传递来自周围感受器的感觉输入的第一个轴突和第二个神经元。后角的损伤可能会导致受累皮节的所有感觉单侧丧失。\n\n（选项 F）后索包含薄束和楔束。它们由后索通路的第一个神经元的轴突形成。该束是本体感觉、振动觉和触觉的主要介质。\n\n教学目标：\n脊髓空洞症的特征是脊髓颈椎区域形成一个空腔（空洞）。空洞会损害前白质连合，导致双侧疼痛和温度感觉丧失，仅限于受影响的水平（通常是手臂和手）；远端感觉保留。前角运动神经元的破坏（由于空洞的延伸）会导致手部固有肌肉的弛缓性麻痹和萎缩。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of syringomyelia, specifically focusing on the sensory deficits caused by damage to different spinal cord tracts. It requires correlating the patient's symptoms of dissociated sensory loss with the specific anatomical location of the lesion within the spinal cord.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the classic \"cape-like\" distribution of pain and temperature loss in the upper extremities, suggestive of syringomyelia. Then, by recalling the sensory pathways and their decussation points, the student can identify the ventral white commissure as the most likely site of damage responsible for the bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation while preserving other sensory modalities.",
