Blood pressure is 104/72 mm Hg and pulse is 88/min. ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion, and troponin levels are elevated. The patient is diagnosed with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and admitted for management, with coronary angiography scheduled the following morning. That evening, telemetry monitoring shows a new Mobitz type 1 second-degree atrioventricular block. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "Low-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, including first-degree and Mobitz type I second-degree, usually involves conduction disruption within the AV node. This patient's development of Mobitz type I second-degree AV block in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (MI) suggests obstruction of the right coronary artery (RCA). In approximately 90% of patients, the RCA supplies blood to the AV node while coursing around the right side of the heart to perfuse the right ventricle and inferior portion of the left ventricle. Because the RCA also usually supplies blood to the sinoatrial node, sinus bradycardia is also commonly seen with MI involving the RCA.\n\nIn contrast, the left anterior descending (LAD) artery (Choice A), which courses down the anterior left ventricle, typically supplies blood to the left and right bundle branches and sometimes the bundle of His. MI involving the LAD can lead to high-degree AV block (ie, Mobitz type II second-degree, infranodal third-degree) involving conduction disruption below the AV node. Because the LAD does not supply blood to the AV node, low-degree AV block is not typically seen.\n\n(Choices B and C) The left main coronary artery bifurcates into the LAD artery and the left circumflex artery, which courses around the left side of the heart to supply the lateral left ventricle. The left main coronary artery does not directly supply blood to the conduction system. The left circumflex artery frequently supplies blood to the sinoatrial node after coursing around to the back of the heart, but only supplies the AV node in about 10% of patients (ie, those with left-dominant coronary circulation).\n\n(Choice D) Present in approximately 20% of the population, a ramus intermedius is a third branch off of the left main coronary artery. It originates at the bifurcation of the LAD and left circumflex arteries and courses between them to supply the anterolateral left ventricular wall. It does not supply blood to the conduction system. {{exhibit_2}}",
