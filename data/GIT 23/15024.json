    "en": "This patient with diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity has hepatic cirrhosis, likely due to long-standing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Cirrhosis is the end stage of multiple liver diseases and is characterized by replacement of normal lobular architecture with regenerating nodules separated by bridging fibrous septa. Cirrhosis can be visualized histologically as thickened collagenous bands (which stain blue with Masson trichrome stain) separating clusters of hepatocytes. Fat infiltration (ie, hepatic steatosis, visible as clear vacuoles within the parenchyma) is commonly seen in both alcohol-induced fatty liver disease and NAFLD. In response to chronic injury, stellate (Ito) cells in the space of Disse are activated and transform into myofibroblasts capable of proliferating, promoting chemotaxis, and producing collagen in large quantities. This leads to progressive scar formation and cirrhosis. Manifestations of cirrhosis include jaundice, scleral icterus, spider angiomas, and elevated liver enzymes. Evidence of abnormal hepatic synthetic function (eg, abnormal coagulation parameters, hypoalbuminemia) and thrombocytopenia are also common.\n\n(Choice A) Cholangiocytes are epithelial cells within the bile duct system. They transport ions and solutes into bile as it travels through the canaliculi.\n\n(Choice B) Hepatocytes are located in the liver parenchyma and have many functions, including protein synthesis and storage, fatty acid metabolism, gluconeogenesis, cholesterol synthesis, and drug metabolism.\n\n(Choice C) Kupffer cells are macrophages that reside within hepatic sinusoids. They are indirectly involved in fibrogenesis because they generate cytokines (ie, TNF-alpha) to assist in the activation of stellate cells; however, their primary function is bacterial phagocytosis and the clearance of red blood cells.\n\n(Choice D) Sinusoidal endothelial cells, which line hepatic sinusoids, are fenestrated cells that filter solutes out of the blood and into hepatocytes. They assist in the removal of metabolic waste and other macromolecules from circulation.\n\nEducational objective:\nStellate (Ito) cells are the primary cells involved in hepatic fibrosis. In response to hepatic injury, the stellate cells are activated and transform into myofibroblasts capable of proliferating, promoting chemotaxis, and producing large quantities of collagen. Collagen stains blue with Masson trichrome stain. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该糖尿病伴病态肥胖的患者患有肝硬化，这很可能是由于长期存在的非酒精性脂肪肝病(NAFLD)所致。肝硬化是多种肝病的终末期，其特征是正常的肝小叶结构被再生结节所取代，这些结节由桥接纤维间隔分隔。肝硬化在组织学上可见增厚的胶原纤维带（用Masson三色染色染成蓝色），分隔着肝细胞簇。脂肪浸润（即肝脂肪变性，表现为实质内清晰的空泡）常见于酒精性脂肪肝病和NAFLD。为了应对慢性损伤，位于窦周隙的星状（伊藤）细胞被激活并转化为成肌纤维细胞，能够增殖、促进趋化作用，并产生大量胶原蛋白。这导致进行性瘢痕形成和肝硬化。肝硬化的表现包括黄疸、巩膜黄染、蜘蛛痣和肝酶升高。异常肝脏合成功能（例如，凝血参数异常、低白蛋白血症）和血小板减少症也很常见。\n\n(选项A) 胆管细胞是位于胆管系统内的上皮细胞。它们将离子和溶质转运到胆汁中，当胆汁通过毛细胆管时。\n\n(选项B) 肝细胞位于肝实质中，具有多种功能，包括蛋白质合成和储存、脂肪酸代谢、糖异生、胆固醇合成和药物代谢。\n\n(选项C) 枯否细胞是存在于肝窦内的巨噬细胞。它们间接参与纤维化，因为它们产生细胞因子（即TNF-α）来帮助激活星状细胞；然而，它们的主要功能是细菌吞噬和清除红细胞。\n\n(选项D) 窦内皮细胞排列在肝窦内，是具有开孔的细胞，可将溶质从血液中过滤到肝细胞中。它们有助于清除循环中的代谢废物和其他大分子。\n\n教育目标：\n星状（伊藤）细胞是参与肝纤维化的主要细胞。为了应对肝损伤，星状细胞被激活并转化为成肌纤维细胞，能够增殖、促进趋化作用并产生大量胶原蛋白。胶原蛋白用Masson三色染色染成蓝色。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of hepatic cirrhosis, specifically the role of stellate cells in collagen production and fibrosis. It also requires interpretation of a liver biopsy stained with trichrome to identify collagen deposition.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical scenario of chronic liver disease and the histologic finding of collagen deposition. Recall that stellate cells are the primary cells responsible for collagen production in the liver during fibrosis.",
