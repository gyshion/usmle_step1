    "en": "A 6-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents due to persistent nasal bleeding. The boy picks his nose frequently and has had several nosebleeds in the past, all of which stopped spontaneously after pinching the nose. The parents say that they have been pinching the nasal alae for over 30 minutes while the boy leans forward. Family history is negative for bleeding disorders. The patient takes no medications and has no allergies. Examination shows continuous blood trickle from his right nostril. Silver nitrate cautery is performed and the bleeding stops.",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The nasal mucosa is highly vascular and easily irritated by trauma (eg, nose-picking), mucosal dryness, foreign body insertion, and rhinitis (eg, allergy, infection). **Epistaxis** is very common in children and may be classified as anterior or posterior, depending on the bleeding source. Anterior nosebleeds are by far the most common, and the vast majority occur within the vascular watershed area of the nasal septum (anteroinferior part of the nasal septal mucosa) known as **Kiesselbach plexus**. Anastomosis of the following vessels occurs in this region:\n\n*   Septal branch of the **anterior ethmoidal artery**\n*   Lateral nasal branch of the **sphenopalatine artery**\n*   Septal branch of the **superior labial artery** (branch of the facial artery)\n\nManagement is directed at stopping the bleeding from Kiesselbach plexus, preferably by direct compression of the nasal alae. Cautery (eg, silver nitrate) of the area surrounding the bleeding site may be necessary for persistent bleeding.\n\n(Choices A and B) The lateral nasal wall contains the superior, middle, and inferior turbinates (also known as conchae). These 3 bony projections are covered with mucous membrane: they warm, humidity, and filter inspired air and expand and contract in response to environmental changes (eg, temperature, humidity, allergens). The turbinates form corresponding meatuses that serve as drainage pathways. The superior meatus provides drainage for the sphenoidal and posterior ethmoidal sinuses. The middle meatus drains the frontal, maxillary, and anterior ethmoidal sinuses and is the most common site of nasal polyps. The inferior meatus drains the nasolacrimal duct.\n\n(Choices D and E) Branches of the sphenopalatine artery supply the posterolateral wall and posterior choanae. These posterolateral branches are the most likely source of posterior nosebleeds. Posterior epistaxis is usually severe and cannot be treated with cautery. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nEducational objective:\nEpistaxis is commonly caused by irritation of the highly vascular mucosa at the anterior nasal septum. The anterior nasal septum contains the Kiesselbach plexus. The anterior ethmoidal, sphenopalatine, and superior labial arteries anastomose in this region.",
    "zh": "鼻粘膜血管丰富，容易因外伤（如挖鼻）、粘膜干燥、异物插入和鼻炎（如过敏、感染）而受到刺激。**鼻出血**在儿童中很常见，可根据出血来源分为前鼻出血或后鼻出血。前鼻出血是最常见的，绝大多数发生在鼻中隔的血管分水岭区域（鼻中隔粘膜的前下部），称为**Kiesselbach丛**。在该区域发生以下血管吻合：\n\n*   **前筛动脉**的鼻中隔支\n*   **蝶腭动脉**的鼻外侧支\n*   **上唇动脉**（面动脉的分支）的鼻中隔支\n\n治疗的目的是阻止Kiesselbach丛的出血，最好通过直接压迫鼻翼。对于持续性出血，可能需要对出血部位周围进行烧灼（例如，硝酸银）。\n\n（选项A和B）鼻外侧壁包含上、中、下鼻甲（也称为鼻甲）。这3个骨突被粘膜覆盖：它们使吸入的空气变暖、加湿和过滤，并响应环境变化（例如，温度、湿度、过敏原）而扩张和收缩。鼻甲形成相应的鼻道，作为引流通道。上鼻道为蝶窦和后筛窦提供引流。中鼻道引流额窦、上颌窦和前筛窦，是鼻息肉最常见的部位。下鼻道引流鼻泪管。\n\n（选项D和E）蝶腭动脉的分支为后外侧壁和后鼻孔供血。这些后外侧支是后鼻出血最有可能的来源。后鼻出血通常很严重，不能用烧灼术治疗。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n教育目标：\n鼻出血通常是由于前鼻中隔高度血管化的粘膜受到刺激引起的。前鼻中隔包含Kiesselbach丛。前筛动脉、蝶腭动脉和上唇动脉在该区域吻合。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the common causes and locations of anterior epistaxis, specifically the Kiesselbach plexus in the nasal septum. It also requires understanding the anatomy of the nasal cavity and the blood supply to different regions.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's age and history of nose-picking, which are common risk factors for anterior epistaxis. Recall that the Kiesselbach plexus in the anterior nasal septum is the most frequent site of bleeding in these cases, making it the target for cautery.",
    "zh": "此题考察对前鼻出血的常见原因和位置的了解，特别是鼻中隔中的Kiesselbach丛。它还需要理解鼻腔的解剖结构和不同区域的血液供应。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要认识到患者的年龄和挖鼻史，这些都是前鼻出血的常见危险因素。记住前鼻中隔中的Kiesselbach丛是这些病例中最常见的出血部位，使其成为烧灼的目标。"
