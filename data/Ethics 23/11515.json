  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "According to The Joint Commission's sentinel event statistics, wrong-site surgery is the most frequently reported serious adverse event. Emergency operations, failure to mark the surgical site, poor communication, and surgeon fatigue are contributing factors. As in this case, multiple procedures on the same patient and multiple surgeons will also increase the risk of operating at the wrong site. Therefore, a preoperative verification process is important to decrease this risk. In addition to marking the operative site, independent verification of the patient, procedure, and site by 2 health care workers (eg, a nurse and physician) should be performed. The \"dual identifiers\" must perform the verification independently because 2 clinicians verifying identifiers together can result in replicating an error. The Joint Commission recommends use of a \"surgical timeout\" immediately prior to the procedure in order to conduct a final verification of the patient, procedure, and site.\n\n(Choice A) Although an awake and aware patient can participate in the verification process, this is not an adequate substitute for dual independent clinician identification.\n\n(Choice B) Having these 2 clinicians verify the site together is not optimal as it increases the risk that they will replicate the error.\n\n(Choices C and E) Two independent identifiers are preferred.\n\nEducational objective:\nRisk of wrong-site surgery can be reduced by requiring \"dual identifiers\" (usually a nurse and physician) to independently confirm that they have the correct patient, site, and procedure. Checks must be truly independent to ensure patient safety.",
    "zh": "根据美国联合委员会的Sentinel事件统计数据，手术部位错误是报告最频繁的严重不良事件。急诊手术、未能标记手术部位、沟通不畅和外科医生疲劳是促成因素。正如本例所示，对同一患者进行多项手术和多名外科医生也会增加在错误部位进行手术的风险。因此，术前验证过程对于降低这种风险至关重要。除了标记手术部位外，应由2名医护人员（例如，护士和医生）对患者、手术和部位进行独立验证。“双重标识符”必须独立执行验证，因为2名临床医生一起验证标识符可能导致复制错误。美国联合委员会建议在手术前立即使用“手术暂停”，以便对患者、手术和部位进行最终验证。\n\n（选项A）尽管清醒和有意识的患者可以参与验证过程，但这并不能充分替代双重独立临床医生识别。\n\n（选项B）让这2名临床医生一起验证部位并非最佳选择，因为它会增加他们复制错误的风险。\n\n（选项C和E）首选两个独立的标识符。\n\n教育目标：\n可以通过要求“双重标识符”（通常是护士和医生）独立确认他们有正确的患者、部位和手术来降低手术部位错误的风险。检查必须真正独立才能确保患者安全。"
