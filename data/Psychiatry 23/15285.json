    "en": "A healthy 8-year-old boy is brought to the office by his parents for an annual checkup. Both parents express concern about their son's behavior. The mother says, \"He never listens and I am always worried that he is going to run out into the street without looking. He rarely sits still and is always running and jumping on the furniture.\" The father adds, \"He talks all the time, interrupts me when I'm speaking, and, despite multiple reminders, forgets to do his chores and misplaces or loses his books or sporting equipment. We thought he would grow out of it as he got older, but it seems to be getting worse.\" Physical examination is unremarkable.",

    "en": "The patient's inattention, inability to sit still, and impulsivity are concerning for possible attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The diagnosis of ADHD is made clinically and requires evidence of symptoms in \\u22652 settings (eg, home, school, after-school program). Demonstration of functional impairment due to symptoms (eg, academic difficulties, impaired social relationships, peer rejection) is also required.\n\nObtaining teacher evaluations to determine if the symptoms extend beyond the home environment would be the most helpful step in establishing the diagnosis. Teachers can provide observations of classroom behavior over an extended period (eg, 6 months) and assist in determining if the symptoms are excessive compared to same-age peers (eg, comparative degree of inattentiveness, difficulty staying seated and/or following directions, talkativeness, disruptive classroom behavior). Teacher evaluations may also incorporate validated ADHD-specific rating scales, which can help assess core symptom severity and monitor response to treatment.\n\n(Choices A and C) Brain imaging and EEG are not performed routinely in the work-up of ADHD in the absence of other neurological symptoms. They would not be indicated in this patient with no other medical history and a normal physical examination.\n\n(Choice B) A hearing test is not routinely performed in the initial evaluation of ADHD, and hearing impairment would have likely been identified by this age. However, a hearing test should be performed if coexisting hearing impairment is suspected.\n\n(Choice D) A speech and language evaluation would be warranted if the patient had problems with speech articulation/production or his language development was delayed.\n\n(Choice F) Toxicology screening is not routinely performed in the assessment of ADHD. It is less likely to be helpful in the assessment of this patient who lacks any history pointing to medical illness or substance use.\n\nEducational objective:\nDiagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder requires evidence of inattentive and/or hyperactive/impulsive symptoms for \\u22652 months in \\u22652 settings (eg, home, home, school, after-school program). Teacher evaluations can elicit core symptom severity and monitor response to treatment.",
    "zh": "患者的注意力不集中、无法静坐和冲动行为提示可能患有注意力缺陷多动障碍 (ADHD)。ADHD 的诊断是在临床上做出的，需要有症状存在于 \\u22652 个场所（例如，家庭、学校、课后活动场所）的证据。还需要证明由于症状引起的 functional impairment（例如，学业困难、社交关系受损、同伴排斥）。\n\n获取教师评估以确定症状是否超出家庭环境将是建立诊断的最有帮助的步骤。教师可以提供对课堂行为的长时间观察（例如，6 个月），并帮助确定症状与同龄人相比是否过度（例如，注意力不集中的程度、难以保持坐姿和/或遵循指令、健谈、干扰课堂行为）。教师评估还可以纳入经过验证的 ADHD 特异性评分量表，这有助于评估核心症状的严重程度和监测对治疗的反应。\n\n（选项 A 和 C）在没有其他神经系统症状的情况下，ADHD 的检查中通常不进行脑部影像学检查和脑电图检查。它们不适用于没有其他病史和体格检查正常的患者。\n\n（选项 B）在 ADHD 的初步评估中通常不进行听力测试，并且听力障碍可能在这个年龄段就被发现了。但是，如果怀疑存在伴随的听力障碍，则应进行听力测试。\n\n（选项 D）如果患者存在言语清晰度/产生的问题或语言发育迟缓，则需要进行言语和语言评估。\n\n（选项 F）毒理学筛查通常不在 ADHD 的评估中进行。它不太可能对缺乏任何指向疾病或物质使用病史的患者的评估有帮助。\n\n教育目标：\n诊断注意力缺陷多动障碍需要有注意力不集中和/或多动/冲动症状在 \\u22652 个场所（例如，家庭、学校、课后活动场所）持续 \\u22652 个月的证据。教师评估可以引出核心症状的严重程度并监测对治疗的反应。"

    "en": "This question tests the diagnostic approach to suspected attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a child, specifically focusing on the importance of gathering information from multiple settings.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that ADHD is a diagnosis that requires symptoms to be present in at least two settings. Therefore, obtaining information from a setting outside the home, such as school, is crucial for diagnosis.",
