    "en": "A 3-year-old girl is brought to the office after developing fever and a sore throat. The patient recently entered day care, and similar symptoms have been reported in several of the other children. Physical examination shows exudative pharyngitis and enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes. A rapid antigen detection test confirms the diagnosis of streptococcal throat infection. Her condition resolves with antibiotic therapy. Several weeks later, she is re-exposed to *Streptococcus pyogenes*. The bacteria penetrating beyond the surface epithelium are immediately coated with preformed IgG antibodies. Which of the following substances acts in the most similar manner to IgG antibodies to facilitate phagocytosis?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Opsonization occurs when host proteins such as immunoglobulins or complement bind to the surface of foreign cells (eg, bacteria) to promote phagocytosis. The most important opsonins (coating proteins) are immunoglobulin (Ig) G and complement C3b {{exhibit_1}}, but mannose-binding lectin and C-reactive protein can also opsonize cells. After opsonins are bound to the cell surface, they act as a handle for receptors on phagocytes (eg, Fc receptors, C3b receptors) to grasp, allowing the phagocytes to more easily engulf the foreign cell.\n\nThe importance of C3 is demonstrated by the fact that all 3 complement pathways (lectin, classical, and alternative) converge on it, resulting in cleavage into C3a and C3b. C3a helps recruit phagocytic cells and induce inflammation. C3b, in addition to acting as an opsonin, can bind to C3b convertase and form C5 convertase, ultimately triggering the membrane attack complex.\n\n(Choice A) 5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) is produced by a variety of immune cells and serves as a leukotriene and lipoxin precursor. It also causes neutrophil and macrophage chemotaxis and neutrophil degranulation.\n\n(Choice C) Complement C5a can enhance phagocytosis by macrophages, but it does so by binding to receptors on the phagocytes and stimulating them directly, not by coating the foreign cells. It also is a potent chemotactic agent, drawing more neutrophils and monocytes to the site of inflammation.\n\n(Choice D) Although IgM can be a potent stimulator of C3b opsonization via activation of the complement cascade, there are no receptors on macrophages for the Fc portion of IgM and it does not directly enhance phagocytosis (unlike IgG).\n\n(Choice E) Leukotriene B4 is a chemotactic agent that increases the ability of leukocytes to cross from the serum into the tissues as part of an inflammatory response.\n\n(Choice F) L-selectin is an adhesion molecule that aids entry of lymphocytes from the blood into lymphoid tissue and margination of neutrophils during inflammatory responses.\n\nEducational objective:\nOpsonization occurs when host proteins such as immunoglobulins or complement bind to foreign cells such as bacteria and coat the surface, enhancing phagocytosis. The most important opsonins (coating proteins) are immunoglobulin G and complement C3b.",
    "zh": "调理作用发生在宿主蛋白（如免疫球蛋白或补体）与异物细胞（如细菌）表面结合以促进吞噬作用时。最重要的调理素（包被蛋白）是免疫球蛋白 (Ig) G 和补体 C3b {{exhibit_1}}，但甘露糖结合凝集素和 C 反应蛋白也可以调理细胞。调理素与细胞表面结合后，它们充当吞噬细胞（如 Fc 受体、C3b 受体）上受体的把手，从而使吞噬细胞更容易吞噬异物细胞。\n\nC3 的重要性体现在所有 3 条补体途径（凝集素途径、经典途径和替代途径）都汇聚于它，从而导致其分解为 C3a 和 C3b。C3a 有助于募集吞噬细胞并诱导炎症。C3b 除了充当调理素外，还可以与 C3b 转化酶结合并形成 C5 转化酶，最终触发膜攻击复合物。\n\n(选项 A) 5-羟二十碳四烯酸 (5-HETE) 由多种免疫细胞产生，并充当白三烯和脂氧素的前体。它还会引起中性粒细胞和巨噬细胞的趋化作用和中性粒细胞脱颗粒。\n\n(选项 C) 补体 C5a 可以增强巨噬细胞的吞噬作用，但它通过与吞噬细胞上的受体结合并直接刺激它们来实现，而不是通过包被异物细胞来实现。它也是一种有效的趋化因子，将更多中性粒细胞和单核细胞吸引到炎症部位。\n\n(选项 D) 尽管 IgM 可以通过激活补体级联反应来强烈刺激 C3b 调理作用，但巨噬细胞上没有 IgM 的 Fc 部分的受体，并且它不能直接增强吞噬作用（与 IgG 不同）。\n\n(选项 E) 白三烯 B4 是一种趋化因子，可增加白细胞从血清进入组织的能力，作为炎症反应的一部分。\n\n(选项 F) L-选择素是一种粘附分子，有助于淋巴细胞从血液进入淋巴组织，以及中性粒细胞在炎症反应期间的边缘化。\n\n教育目标：\n当宿主蛋白（如免疫球蛋白或补体）与异物细胞（如细菌）结合并包被其表面以增强吞噬作用时，就会发生调理作用。最重要的调理素（包被蛋白）是免疫球蛋白 G 和补体 C3b。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of opsonization and the role of IgG and complement C3b in facilitating phagocytosis. It requires understanding how these molecules coat pathogens, acting as handles for phagocytes to enhance engulfment. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that IgG and C3b are the primary opsonins. Other options may have roles in inflammation or chemotaxis, but they do not directly coat pathogens to promote phagocytosis in the same manner.",
