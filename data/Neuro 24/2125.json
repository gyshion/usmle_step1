    "en": "A 65-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to acute-onset slurred speech. He also has right-sided weakness but denies any trauma, headache, or loss of consciousness. His medical problems include hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. Neurologic examination shows right-sided lower facial droop with sparing of the forehead muscles. Motor strength is 3/5 on the right and 5/5 on the left with a Babinski response on the right. There is also dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia involving his right upper and lower extremities. MRI of the brain reveals an acute lacunar infarct in the brainstem, as shown in the image below. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a brainstem stroke, specifically affecting the pons, given the combination of dysarthria, contralateral hemiparesis (weakness on the right), lower facial droop with forehead sparing (suggesting a central facial palsy), dysmetria, and dysdiadochokinesia. The MRI {{exhibit_2}} confirms an acute lacunar infarct in the brainstem. The question asks which cranial nerve exits the brainstem closest to the level of the infarct. The trigeminal nerve (CN V) exits the brainstem at the level of the middle cerebellar peduncles, which are located in the mid-pons. The infarct is described as being in the brainstem and affecting the medial pons, which is consistent with the location of the trigeminal nerve's exit. The trigeminal nerve is responsible for sensory innervation to the face and motor control of mastication. The symptoms of facial droop and motor deficits are consistent with pontine involvement. \n\n(Choice A) The facial nerve (CN VII) nucleus is located in the caudal pons, and the nerve exits at the pontomedullary junction. While the patient has lower facial droop, this is due to a central lesion affecting the corticobulbar tract, not direct damage to the facial nerve nucleus or nerve itself. The trigeminal nerve is located more rostrally in the pons.\n\n(Choice B) The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) nucleus is located in the medulla, and the nerve exits at the preolivary sulcus. This is caudal to the pons.\n\n(Choice C) The oculomotor nerve (CN III) exits the midbrain from the interpeduncular fossa. This is rostral to the pons.\n\n(Choice E) The trochlear nerve (CN IV) exits the dorsal midbrain and wraps around to the ventral side. This is also rostral to the pons.\n\nKey clinical pearls: Lacunar infarcts in the pons can cause contralateral hemiparesis, dysarthria, and facial palsy. The location of cranial nerve exit points from the brainstem is crucial for localizing lesions. The trigeminal nerve exits at the mid-pons, making it the closest to the described infarct. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "患者出现的症状提示脑干卒中，特别是影响脑桥，因为其表现为构音障碍、对侧偏瘫（右侧无力）、下部面部下垂伴额肌幸免（提示中枢性面瘫）、共济失调和快速交替动作障碍。MRI {{exhibit_2}}证实了脑干的急性腔隙性梗死。该问题询问哪条脑神经从脑干的出口最靠近梗死部位。三叉神经（CN V）从脑干中部小脑脚水平穿出，其位于脑桥中部。梗死被描述为位于脑干并影响内侧脑桥，这与三叉神经的出口位置一致。三叉神经负责面部感觉神经支配和咀嚼的运动控制。面部下垂和运动功能障碍的症状与脑桥受累相符。\n\n（选项A）面神经（CN VII）核位于脑桥尾部，该神经从脑桥延髓交界处穿出。虽然患者有下部面部下垂，但这归因于影响皮质脑干束的中央病变，而不是对面神经核或神经本身的直接损伤。三叉神经位于脑桥更靠头部的位置。\n\n（选项B）舌下神经（CN XII）核位于延髓，该神经从橄榄前沟穿出。这比脑桥靠尾部。\n\n（选项C）动眼神经（CN III）从脑干中脑的脚间窝穿出。这比脑桥靠头部。\n\n（选项E）滑车神经（CN IV）从脑干背侧中脑穿出并绕到腹侧。这比脑桥也更靠头部。\n\n关键临床要点：脑桥腔隙性梗死可引起对侧偏瘫、构音障碍和面瘫。脑神经从脑干穿出的位置对于定位病变至关重要。三叉神经从脑桥中部穿出，使其最靠近所描述的梗死。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of neuroanatomy, specifically the location of cranial nerve exit points from the brainstem, in the context of a patient presenting with symptoms of a pontine stroke. It requires correlating clinical signs and imaging findings with the anatomical structures involved.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the likely location of the stroke based on the clinical presentation and MRI findings. Then, recall the anatomical exit points of the listed cranial nerves from the brainstem and determine which nerve exits closest to the affected area. Understanding the relationship between brainstem structures and cranial nerve nuclei is essential.",
