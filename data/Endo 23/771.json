    "en": "A 33-year-old man comes to the office due to several months of episodic headaches accompanied by sweating and feelings of anxiety that spontaneously resolve after 15-30 minutes. The patient has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. His brother recently had surgery to treat hyperparathyroidism. Blood pressure is 180/110 mm Hg and pulse is 102/min. Laboratory results show normal serum electrolytes and renal function. CT scan of the abdomen reveals a mass in the right adrenal gland. Which of the following cells have the same embryologic origin as the tissue responsible for this patient's current condition?",

    "en": "This patient with hypertension; episodic headache, anxiety, and diaphoresis; and an adrenal mass on CT scan has a pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine-secreting tumor arising from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. Pheochromocytoma can be sporadic or associated with several familial disorders, especially multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 (likely in this patient given his family history of hyperparathyroidism). \n\nThe chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla are derived from neural crest cells, which are multipotent, migratory cells that originate in the ectoderm at the margin of the neural tube and give rise to a diverse cell lineage. In addition to the adrenal medulla, other important structures that arise from neural crest cells include melanocytes (melanin-producing cells) and neural ganglia (eg, sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia). Some cardiac (eg, aorticopulmonary septum, endocardial cushions) and skeletal (eg, skull/facial bones) structures are also derived from neural crest cells. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices A, B, and C) Capillary endothelial cells, cardiac myocytes, and interstitial fibroblasts are mesodermal derivatives. Unlike the adrenal cortex, which is also derived from mesoderm, the adrenal medulla is a neural crest derivative.\n\n(Choice E) Thyroid follicular cells are an endodermal derivative arising from the pharyngeal epithelium at the base of the tongue; parafollicular C cells are also an endodermal derivative, although they were previously thought to originate from the neural crest.",
    "zh": "该患者出现高血压；阵发性头痛、焦虑和出汗；以及CT扫描显示肾上腺肿块，患有嗜铬细胞瘤，这是一种源自肾上腺髓质嗜铬细胞的儿茶酚胺分泌肿瘤。嗜铬细胞瘤可以是散发的，也可以与几种家族性疾病相关，特别是多发性内分泌肿瘤病 (MEN) 2型（考虑到该患者有甲状旁腺功能亢进的家族史，这种情况很可能）。\n\n肾上腺髓质的嗜铬细胞源自神经嵴细胞，神经嵴细胞是多能的、迁移细胞，起源于神经管边缘的外胚层，并产生多种细胞谱系。除了肾上腺髓质外，其他重要的结构也源自神经嵴细胞，包括黑素细胞（产生黑色素的细胞）和神经节（例如，交感神经节和副交感神经节）。一些心脏（例如，主动脉肺间隔，心内膜垫）和骨骼（例如，颅骨/面部骨骼）结构也源自神经嵴细胞。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项 A、B 和 C）毛细血管内皮细胞、心肌细胞和间质成纤维细胞是中胚层衍生物。与也源自中胚层的肾上腺皮质不同，肾上腺髓质是神经嵴衍生物。\n\n（选项 E）甲状腺滤泡细胞是内胚层衍生物，起源于舌根部的咽部上皮；滤泡旁 C 细胞也是内胚层衍生物，尽管以前认为它们起源于神经嵴。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of embryological origins of different tissues, specifically the adrenal medulla and its relationship to neural crest cells. It requires understanding the germ layer derivatives and their associated structures.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the tissue of origin for pheochromocytoma (adrenal medulla) and then recall which germ layer gives rise to the adrenal medulla. Then, evaluate each answer choice to determine which shares the same embryological origin.",
