    "en": "A 40-year-old woman is hospitalized due to a femoral neck fracture that occurred when she slipped while stepping out of the bathtub. The patient was diagnosed with a prolactinoma 3 years ago during evaluation of amenorrhea, but she refused medical or surgical treatments. The tumor is being monitored closely and has not increased in size or caused any visual symptoms. The patient has no other medical problems, takes no medications, and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. She has 3 healthy children and no significant family history. The underlying mechanism for this patient's susceptibility to fracture is most likely to cause which of the following additional manifestations?",

    "en": "Prolactinomas are the most common pituitary tumors. High levels of circulating prolactin, a hormone involved in milk production, result in galactorrhea (nonlactational milk production) and infertility in premenopausal women. Excess prolactin suppresses GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus, leading to reduced secretion of LH (and to a lesser extent FSH) and subsequent hypogonadism, anovulation, and amenorrhea. The resultant estrogen deficiency can manifest as vasomotor symptoms (eg, hot flashes), vaginal dryness and atrophy, and dyspareunia. Because estrogen maintains bone mass in premenopausal women, prolonged estrogen deficiency can lead to OSTEOPOROSIS and an increased risk for fragility fractures (ie, fractures due to minimal trauma, such as a fall from standing height).\n\nMen with prolactinomas may develop symptoms due to hypogonadism (eg, infertility, decreased libido), but galactorrhea is rare in both men and postmenopausal women as milk production requires estrogen/progesterone priming of the breast tissue. Men with prolactinomas are more likely to present at an advanced stage with mass-effect symptoms (eg, headache, visual field defects) due to compression of surrounding structures.\n\n(Choices A and D) Central hyperthyroidism due to a TSH-secreting (thyrotroph) pituitary adenoma can present with weight loss, palpitations, systolic hypertension, and hyperadrenergic symptoms (eg, hand tremor). Chronic TSH stimulation can also lead to enlargement of the thyroid gland and compressive symptoms (eg, dysphagia). However, compression of thyrotroph cells by an enlarging prolactinoma causes central hypothyroidism.\n\n(Choices B and C) Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is characterized by primary hyperparathyroidism (with hypercalcemia), pituitary tumors (including prolactinoma), and endocrine pancreatic tumors. Complications of hyperparathyroidism include osteoporosis and kidney stones. Stomach ulcers can occur in MEN1 due to hypercalcemia or a gastrin-producing pancreatic tumor (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). However, most prolactinomas are sporadic and not associated with MEN1. In addition, MEN1 is rare, and this patient's lack of a significant family history makes it even less likely.\n\nEducational objective:\nIn patients with prolactinoma, high levels of circulating prolactin suppress GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus, leading to reduced secretion of LH and subsequent hypogonadism, anovulation, and amenorrhea. The resulting estrogen deficiency can cause osteoporosis with an increased risk for fragility fractures, and lead to vaginal dryness and atrophy.",
    "zh": "泌乳素瘤是最常见的垂体肿瘤。高水平的循环泌乳素，一种参与乳汁产生的激素，会导致绝经前妇女出现溢乳（非哺乳期乳汁产生）和不孕症。过量的泌乳素会抑制下丘脑释放促性腺激素释放激素（GnRH），导致促黄体生成素（LH，促间质细胞激素）分泌减少（促卵泡激素，FSH，促卵泡激素，相对较少）以及随后的性腺功能减退、无排卵和闭经。由此导致的雌激素缺乏症可表现为血管舒缩症状（例如，潮热）、阴道干燥和萎缩以及性交困难。由于雌激素维持绝经前妇女的骨量，长期的雌激素缺乏可导致骨质疏松症，并增加脆性骨折的风险（即，由于轻微创伤，例如站立高度摔倒）。\n\n患有泌乳素瘤的男性可能会因性腺功能减退而出现症状（例如，不育、性欲下降），但男性和绝经后妇女的溢乳现象均罕见，因为乳汁产生需要雌激素/孕激素对乳腺组织的启动。患有泌乳素瘤的男性更有可能在晚期出现肿块效应症状（例如，头痛、视野缺损），这是由于对周围结构的压迫。\n\n（选项 A 和 D）由于促甲状腺激素（TSH）分泌（促甲状腺细胞）垂体腺瘤引起的中央甲状腺功能亢进可表现为体重减轻、心悸、收缩期高血压和肾上腺素能症状（例如，手颤）。慢性促甲状腺激素刺激也可能导致甲状腺增大和压迫症状（例如，吞咽困难）。然而，增大泌乳素瘤对促甲状腺细胞的压迫会导致中枢性甲状腺功能减退。\n\n（选项 B 和 C）多发性内分泌肿瘤病 1 型（MEN1）的特征是原发性甲状旁腺功能亢进症（伴高钙血症）、垂体肿瘤（包括泌乳素瘤）和内分泌胰腺肿瘤。甲状旁腺功能亢进症的并发症包括骨质疏松症和肾结石。MEN1 可因高钙血症或产生胃泌素的胰腺肿瘤（Zollinger-Ellison 综合征）而发生胃溃疡。然而，大多数泌乳素瘤是散发的，与 MEN1 无关。此外，MEN1 很少见，并且该患者缺乏重要的家族史使其发生的可能性更小。\n\n教育目标：\n在患有泌乳素瘤的患者中，高水平的循环泌乳素会抑制下丘脑释放 GnRH，导致 LH 分泌减少，进而导致性腺功能减退、无排卵和闭经。由此产生的雌激素缺乏可导致骨质疏松症，并增加脆性骨折的风险，以及导致阴道干燥和萎缩。"

    "en": "This question tests the complications of prolactinoma, specifically the effects of hyperprolactinemia on GnRH secretion and subsequent estrogen deficiency, leading to osteoporosis and increased fracture risk. It also tests the ability to differentiate prolactinoma complications from other endocrine disorders.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that prolactinomas can cause estrogen deficiency due to GnRH suppression. Estrogen deficiency leads to osteoporosis and vaginal dryness. Rule out other options based on their association with different endocrine disorders or mechanisms.",
