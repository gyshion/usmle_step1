    "en": "A 38-year-old woman, gravida 3 para 2, at 35 weeks gestation comes to the emergency department due to sudden-onset visual changes and headache. The patient reports \"spots\" in her vision for the past few hours and an occipital headache. She took a dose of acetaminophen, but it did not improve her symptoms. The patient's pregnancy has been complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus requiring insulin. Blood pressure is 168/114 mm Hg and pulse is 90/min. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. Visual field testing shows partial loss of vision bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

    "en": "This patient has preeclampsia, defined as new-onset hypertension (systolic ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic ≥90 mm Hg) at ≥20 weeks gestation with proteinuria and/or signs of end-organ dysfunction. Preeclampsia likely occurs due to abnormal placental development that results in high-resistance, low-perfusion vessels and subsequent placental ischemia. Placental ischemia triggers widespread endothelial dysfunction, which causes dysregulated vascular tone (eg, vasospasm, vasoconstriction), increased vascular permeability, and decreased end-organ perfusion.\n\nTherefore, a classic presentation of preeclampsia is hypertension with headache and visual changes:\n\n• Headaches are typically severe and throbbing in nature. They occur due to dysregulated cerebral blood flow, brain ischemia, and/or capillary leakage resulting in cerebral edema.\n\n• Visual changes include blurry vision, photopsia (seeing \"sparks\"), and scotoma (partial vision loss [blind spots]), which are due to RETINAL ARTERY VASOSPASM and optic nerve ischemia. Eye movement and the pupillary light reflex typically remain intact.\n\nSymptoms usually resolve after delivery, which is curative for preeclampsia. However, in rare cases, patients with severe retinal ischemia or retinal detachment may have permanent vision loss.\n\n(Choice A) Choroidal neovascularization, abnormal vessel growth beneath the retina, causes age-related wet macular degeneration. However, it presents with painless vision loss (no associated headache) and onset of symptoms is typically unilateral (ie, one eye affected first).\n\n(Choice B) A decreased anterior chamber angle (ie, angle-closure glaucoma) can cause headache and visual changes due to increased intraocular pressure. However, patients typically have a painful red eye and a dilated pupil that reacts poorly to light.\n\n(Choice C) Vitreous hemorrhage is associated with eye injury, anticoagulation, and diabetic retinopathy. It typically causes monocular vision loss associated with floaters/photopsia, not bilateral scotomata.\n\n(Choice D) Inflammatory optic nerve demyelination (ie, optic neuritis) causes monocular vision loss and eye pain with extraocular movement. This patient has bilateral visual changes and normal extraocular movement.\n\nEducational objective:\nPreeclampsia causes widespread endothelial dysfunction, resulting in dysregulated vascular tone, increased vascular permeability, and decreased end-organ perfusion. Therefore, a common presentation is headache with visual changes (eg, scotomata) due to dysregulated cerebral blood flow and retinal artery vasospasm.",
    "zh": "该患者患有先兆子痫，其定义为妊娠≥20周出现的新发高血压（收缩压≥140 mmHg或舒张压≥90 mmHg），伴有蛋白尿和/或终末器官功能障碍的体征。先兆子痫可能由于胎盘发育异常导致高阻力、低灌注血管以及随后的胎盘缺血而发生。胎盘缺血会触发广泛的内皮功能障碍，导致血管张力失调（例如，血管痉挛、血管收缩）、血管通透性增加和终末器官灌注减少。\n\n因此，先兆子痫的典型表现是高血压伴头痛和视觉改变：\n\n• 头痛通常是严重的搏动性头痛。它们是由于脑血流失调、脑缺血和/或毛细血管渗漏导致脑水肿引起的。\n\n• 视觉改变包括视力模糊、闪光感（看到“火花”）和暗点（部分视力丧失[盲点]），这是由于视网膜动脉血管痉挛和视神经缺血引起的。眼球运动和瞳孔对光反射通常保持完整。\n\n症状通常在分娩后消退，分娩可以治愈先兆子痫。然而，在极少数情况下，患有严重视网膜缺血或视网膜脱离的患者可能会永久性失明。\n\n（选项A）脉络膜新生血管形成，视网膜下方的异常血管生长，会导致与年龄相关的湿性黄斑变性。然而，它的表现是无痛性视力丧失（没有相关的头痛），并且症状的出现通常是单侧的（即，首先影响一只眼睛）。\n\n（选项B）前房角变窄（即，闭角型青光眼）可因眼内压升高引起头痛和视觉改变。然而，患者通常有疼痛的红眼和对光反应差的瞳孔放大。\n\n（选项C）玻璃体出血与眼外伤、抗凝和糖尿病性视网膜病变有关。它通常引起单眼视力丧失，伴有飞蚊症/闪光感，而不是双侧暗点。\n\n（选项D）炎症性视神经脱髓鞘（即，视神经炎）引起单眼视力丧失和眼外肌运动时的眼痛。该患者有双侧视觉改变和正常的眼外肌运动。\n\n教学目标：\n先兆子痫引起广泛的内皮功能障碍，导致血管张力失调、血管通透性增加和终末器官灌注减少。因此，常见表现是头痛伴有视觉改变（例如，暗点），这是由于脑血流失调和视网膜动脉血管痉挛引起的。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation of preeclampsia, specifically focusing on the neurological and visual symptoms associated with the condition. It requires differentiating preeclampsia-related visual disturbances from other ophthalmologic emergencies.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key features of the patient's presentation: new-onset hypertension, headache, and bilateral visual changes in a pregnant woman at 35 weeks gestation. Consider the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, which involves endothelial dysfunction and vasospasm, leading to compromised blood flow to the brain and eyes. Evaluate each option in the context of these findings and the typical presentations of alternative diagnoses.",
