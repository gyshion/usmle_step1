    "en": "A 40-year-old unemployed man with chronic back pain comes to the office for an appointment with a new physician. The patient injured his back in a work accident years ago and has not worked since. He uses marijuana daily to \"ease the pain\" and admits that a portion of his income goes toward its purchase. The patient says that nothing has changed and asks the physician to sign a disability form so he can continue to collect disability benefits. When the physician asks about his disability and previous treatment, he replies angrily, \"I wouldn't be here re-applying for disability if anything had worked\" and slams the disability form down on the table. Review of his medical records indicates a normal MRI one year earlier and inconsistent adherence with physical rehabilitation appointments. The patient walks normally with no apparent discomfort or limitations. Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?",
    "zh": "一名40岁失业男性，患有慢性背痛，前来诊所预约就诊新医生。患者多年前在一次工作事故中背部受伤，此后一直未工作。他每天使用大麻来“缓解疼痛”，并承认他的一部分收入用于购买大麻。患者说没有任何改变，并要求医生签署一份残疾证明，以便他可以继续领取残疾福利。当医生询问他的残疾情况和之前的治疗时，他愤怒地回答：“如果任何治疗有效，我就不会在这里重新申请残疾了”，并将残疾证明摔在桌子上。对他的病历进行审查表明，一年前的MRI结果正常，并且对物理康复预约的依从性不一致。患者行走正常，没有明显的不适或限制。以下哪项是医生最合适的反应？"

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "In the United States, disability is a form of insurance that is administered by private insurance carriers or by the Social Security Administration. It provides financial assistance to workers who are unable to continue working due to a medical or psychiatric condition. CERTIFICATION of disability by a physician is usually required by these entities before the benefit is granted.\n\nThis patient's demand that the physician sign a disability form presents a difficult situation. Pain is highly subjective and, at this point in the interaction, the physician knows very little about this patient. Possibilities include malingering or exaggeration of extent of disability to obtain benefits, inadequately treated pain, or chronic pain resulting in legitimate disability. This patient may also have had negative interactions with health care providers or a psychiatric condition that contributes to his angry, demanding behavior. The best approach is to politely but firmly explain that determining medical disability requires further assessment of his symptoms, physical examination, and testing if indicated.\n\n(Choice A) Many individuals with legitimate medical disabilities may use substances; it is not a reason to deny disability benefits.\n\n(Choice B) It is premature to suggest that this patient is attempting to commit fraud without performing an appropriate history and physical examination.\n\n(Choices C and D) It is inappropriate to sign the form at this point in the interview without learning more about the patient and his condition. It is incorrect to assume that the previous disability determination was correct and that nothing has changed.\n\n(Choice E) Unless the patient is abusive or creating an unsafe situation, confronting him directly about his anger is not appropriate and will be unlikely to improve the situation.\n\nEducational objective:\nPhysicians are frequently asked to evaluate whether a patient is entitled to disability benefits. When interacting with demanding patients, it is best to explain that the physician has a responsibility to perform a thorough assessment prior to making this determination.",
    "zh": "在美国，残疾是一种由私人保险公司或社会保障管理局管理的保险形式。它为因医疗或精神疾病而无法继续工作的工人提供经济援助。在给予福利之前，这些实体通常需要医生出具的残疾证明。\n\n该患者要求医生签署残疾证明，这提出了一个困难的情况。疼痛是高度主观的，并且，在这次互动中，医生对该患者知之甚少。可能性包括装病或夸大残疾程度以获得福利，疼痛治疗不足，或慢性疼痛导致合法的残疾。该患者也可能与医疗保健提供者有过负面互动，或者患有精神疾病，这导致了他愤怒、要求过度的行为。最好的方法是礼貌但坚定地解释说，确定医疗残疾需要进一步评估他的症状、体格检查和必要时进行检查。\n\n（选项A）许多患有合法医疗残疾的个体可能使用药物；这不是拒绝残疾福利的理由。\n\n（选项B）在没有进行适当的病史和体格检查的情况下，建议该患者试图欺诈还为时过早。\n\n（选项C和D）在本次访谈中，在不了解更多关于患者及其病情的情况下签署表格是不合适的。假设之前的残疾确定是正确的，并且没有任何改变是不正确的。\n\n（选项E）除非患者有虐待行为或造成不安全的情况，否则直接质问他的愤怒是不合适的，并且不太可能改善情况。\n\n教育目标：\n医生经常被要求评估患者是否有权获得残疾福利。当与要求过高的患者互动时，最好解释说，医生有责任在做出此决定之前进行彻底的评估。"
