    "en": "A 74-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her son after he found her acting strangely. She was asking to open the window blinds, even though the blinds were already open and was bumping into objects when walking around her home. The patient insists that her vision is fine and came to the hospital upon her son's insistence. On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented but lacks appropriate eye contact. Bilateral direct and consensual pupillary reflexes are normal. On confrontation visual field testing, she reports the wrong number of fingers in all 4 visual quadrants. The patient indicates the wrong direction when asked to point to the door and gives an incorrect visual description when asked to describe the physician. This patient most likely has an infarction involving the brain regions supplied by which of the following arteries?",
    "zh": "一名74岁女性由其儿子带到急诊科，因为他发现她的行为举止异常。她要求打开百叶窗，即使百叶窗已经打开，并且在屋里走动时会撞到物体。患者坚持认为她的视力很好，并在她儿子的坚持下去了医院。体格检查显示，患者意识清晰，定向力好，但缺乏适当的眼神交流。双侧直接和对光反应正常。对峙视野检查显示，她在所有4个视野象限中都报告了错误的指头数。当被要求指向门时，患者指出了错误的方向，并且当被要求描述医生时，给出了错误的视觉描述。该患者最有可能患有涉及由以下哪条动脉供应的脑部区域的梗死？"

    "en": "The patient is blind, as evidenced by visual field testing. However, the patient is exhibiting signs of:\n\n•\tAnosognosia: an unawareness of one’s condition\n\n•\tConfabulation: the unintentional generation of fabricated information to fill in gaps (patients who exhibit this believe the information is true [ie, they are not purposefully lying])\n\nThis combination is suspicious for cortical blindness due to damage of the bilateral occipital lobes. The occipital lobes are supplied by the posterior cerebral arteries. Associated anosognosia and confabulation may be due to the inability of the visual cortex to communicate with areas of the brain that conduct higher-order sensory integration and speech-language processing.\n\n(Choice A) Anterior cerebral artery occlusion can infarct large portions of the medial cortex, leading to motor and sensory defects that preferentially impact the leg due to the somatotopic organization of the brain. Other characteristic deficits include incontinence (frontal micturition center), and executive dysfunction or changes in personality (prefrontal cortex).\n\n(Choice B) Basilar artery occlusion usually damages the base of the pons, which contains the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts, and the paramedian tegmentum. Consequently, patients typically have quadriplegia, bulbar dysfunction (eg, facial weakness, dysarthria), and oculomotor deficits (eg, horizontal gaze palsy).\n\n(Choice C) Middle cerebral artery infarcts typically lead to motor and sensory deficits impacting the contralateral face > arm > leg. Aphasia occurs with lesions to the dominant (usually left) hemisphere; neglect is more pronounced with lesions to the nondominant (usually right) hemisphere.\n\n(Choice D) The ophthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery that supplies the eye and structures of the orbit. Occlusion of the artery can lead to blindness in the respective eye. However, it would not cause anosognosia or confabulation.\n\nEducational objective:\nCortical blindness occurs due to damage to the primary visual cortex, located in the occipital lobes, which are supplied by the posterior cerebral arteries. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cortical blindness and its association with bilateral occipital lobe damage due to posterior cerebral artery infarction. It also assesses the ability to differentiate between various stroke syndromes based on the affected artery and resulting neurological deficits.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the combination of blindness, anosognosia, and confabulation as indicative of cortical blindness. Recall that the occipital lobes, responsible for vision, are supplied by the posterior cerebral arteries. Rule out other options based on their typical clinical presentations.",
    "zh": "本题考察对皮质盲及其与大脑后动脉梗死引起的双侧枕叶损伤相关的知识。它还评估了根据受影响的动脉和由此产生的神经功能缺损区分各种卒中综合征的能力。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要认识到失明、病感缺失和虚构的组合提示皮质盲。回想一下，负责视觉的枕叶由大脑后动脉供血。根据其他选项的典型临床表现排除它们。"
