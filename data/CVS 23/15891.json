  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The above autopsy image shows cystic medial degeneration (necrosis), the classic histologic finding in aortic dissection. The tunica media is the largest and strongest of the 3 portions of the aortic wall. With aging, collagen, elastin, and smooth muscle in the aortic media are broken down and replaced by mucoid extracellular matrix. There is elastic tissue fragmentation in a \"basket weave\" pattern with development of many cystic collections of mucopolysaccharide. These changes result in progressive loss of integrity, reducing the vessel's ability to handle wall stress from conditions such as systemic hypertension.\n\nOnce cystic medial degeneration develops, a small intimal tear can readily extend into and throughout the media, creating a lengthy dissection plane that propagates proximally or distally. As blood enters the dissection plane a false aortic lumen is created and aortic branches (eg, left subclavian artery, renal arteries) may become obstructed. The enlarging hematoma in the false lumen can eventually penetrate the adventitia, resulting in full-thickness rupture.\n\n(Choice A) Atherosclerosis primarily affects the intima and is an important contributor to acute coronary syndrome. Histologically it appears as an atheroma with an endothelial covering, fibrous cap, and necrotic core. Atherosclerosis can contribute to cystic medial degeneration but is not the primary pathophysiologic mechanism.\n\n(Choice B) Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (calciphylaxis) can occur with advanced chronic kidney disease and leads to severe skin ischemia and necrosis. Histologically, it is characterized by superficial arteriolar calcification, subintimal fibrosis, and thrombosis. It does not typically affect large vessels such as the aorta.\n\n(Choice D) Granulomatous inflammation of large vessels can occur in Takayasu arteritis and tuberculous aortitis. Histopathology demonstrates granuloma formation in the media with multinucleated giant cells.\n\n(Choice E) Monckeberg sclerosis is a rare disease that results in diffuse medial calcification of small and medium-sized arteries. Calcification typically appears as blue-to-violet irregular deposits on hematoxylin–eosin stains, as seen in this calcified atherosclerotic plaque.\n\nEducational objective:\nCystic medial degeneration (necrosis) is the classic histologic finding in aortic dissection, as it weakens the aortic wall and allows a small intimal tear to readily propagate. Collagen, elastin, and smooth muscle are replaced by a basophilic mucoid extracellular matrix with elastic tissue fragmentation and cystic collections of mucopolysaccharide. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "上述尸检图像显示中膜囊性变性（坏死），这是主动脉夹层的经典组织学发现。中膜是主动脉壁的3个组成部分中最大、最强韧的。随着年龄的增长，主动脉中膜中的胶原蛋白、弹性蛋白和平滑肌会被分解，并被黏液性细胞外基质所取代。存在弹性组织碎裂，呈“编织”模式，并形成许多囊性粘多糖集合体。这些变化导致进行性完整性丧失，降低了血管处理来自全身性高血压等情况下的壁应力的能力。\n\n一旦发生中膜囊性变性，小的内膜撕裂很容易延伸到整个中膜，从而形成一个向近端或远端扩散的冗长夹层平面。当血液进入夹层平面时，会形成假性主动脉腔，并且主动脉分支（例如，左锁骨下动脉、肾动脉）可能会发生阻塞。假腔内扩大的血肿最终会穿透外膜，导致全层破裂。\n\n（选项A）动脉粥样硬化主要影响内膜，是急性冠脉综合征的重要促成因素。组织学上，它表现为有内皮覆盖层、纤维帽和坏死核心的粥样斑块。动脉粥样硬化可促进中膜囊性变性，但不是主要的病理生理学机制。\n\n（选项B）钙化性尿毒症性血管病（钙化性尿毒症性小动脉病）可发生于晚期慢性肾病，并导致严重的皮肤缺血和坏死。组织学上，其特征是浅表小动脉钙化、内膜下纤维化和血栓形成。它通常不会影响主动脉等大血管。\n\n（选项D）大血管的肉芽肿性炎症可发生于高安动脉炎和结核性主动脉炎。组织病理学显示中膜中形成肉芽肿，并有多核巨细胞。\n\n（选项E）Monckeberg 硬化是一种罕见疾病，导致中小动脉弥漫性中膜钙化。钙化通常表现为在苏木精-伊红染色中呈蓝色到紫色的不规则沉积，如在该钙化动脉粥样硬化斑块中所见。\n\n教育目的：\n中膜囊性变性（坏死）是主动脉夹层的经典组织学发现，因为它会削弱主动脉壁，并允许小的内膜撕裂容易扩散。胶原蛋白、弹性蛋白和平滑肌被嗜碱性黏液性细胞外基质取代，伴有弹性组织碎裂和囊性粘多糖集合体。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"

It also requires differentiating aortic dissection from other vascular pathologies.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key clinical features (chest pain, syncope, hypertension, family history) and correlate them with the histological finding of cystic medial degeneration in the aorta.
