    "en": "The patient described in this vignette has type 2 diabetes mellitus (advanced age, obesity, prolonged non-compliance with treatment without immediate life-threatening consequences). The two cardinal defects involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus are increased insulin resistance and defective insulin secretion. Although still controversial, many researchers believe that increased insulin resistance is the primary abnormality in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Early in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, glucose tolerance is thought to remain normal because of a compensatory increase in insulin secretion from beta cells. This compensatory insulin response by beta cells ultimately fails, causing poor glucose tolerance. A number of genetic and acquired factors are implicated in the beta-cell dysregulation of type 2 diabetes. Islet amyloid polypeptide (amylin) is one factor thought to be responsible for this beta cell dysfunction. Amylin is stored in insulin secretory granules and is co-secreted with insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Deposits of amylin are universally seen in the pancreatic islets of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Amylin may play a causative role in beta cell apoptosis and defective insulin secretion; however, this theory is still controversial.\n\nType 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus have very strong genetic components. Twin studies have shown a concordance rate of 50% in identical twins for diabetes mellitus type 1, and around 80% for diabetes mellitus type 2. The genes involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus type 2 remain largely unknown. Gene polymorphism within the major histocompatibility complex contributes to type 1 diabetes mellitus disease in humans. HLA-DQ and -DR are the most important determinants of type 1 diabetes mellitus. In the general population, DR3 and DR4 are seen in approximately 40% of subjects; however, in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, DR3 and DR4 haplotypes are seen in more than 90% of subjects.\n\n(Choices A, C, D & E) These are features of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes occurs when an autoimmune response is triggered by an environmental insult in genetically susceptible individuals. Patients with type 2 diabetes retain at least some beta cell function, but patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus develop absolute deficiency of insulin secondary to immune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. These patients need insulin for survival. Discontinuation of insulin treatment results in ketoacidosis.\n\nEducational objective:\nPancreatic islet amyloid deposition is characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A strong linkage with HLA class II gene makeup, pancreatic islet infiltration with leukocytes (insulitis), and antibodies against islet antigens are frequently seen in type 1 diabetes.",
    "zh": "该病例描述的患者患有2型糖尿病（高龄、肥胖、长期不遵守治疗方案，无直接危及生命的后果）。2型糖尿病病理生理学中涉及的两个主要缺陷是胰岛素抵抗增加和胰岛素分泌缺陷。尽管仍有争议，许多研究人员认为，胰岛素抵抗增加是2型糖尿病的主要异常。在2型糖尿病的发病机制早期，由于β细胞胰岛素分泌的代偿性增加，葡萄糖耐受性被认为是正常的。这种β细胞的代偿性胰岛素反应最终失败，导致葡萄糖耐受不良。许多遗传和获得性因素与2型糖尿病的β细胞失调有关。胰岛淀粉样多肽（amylin）是被认为是导致这种β细胞功能障碍的一个因素。Amylin储存在胰岛素分泌颗粒中，并与胰岛素一起从胰腺β细胞中共同分泌。Amylin沉积普遍存在于2型糖尿病患者的胰岛中。Amylin可能在β细胞凋亡和胰岛素分泌缺陷中起因果作用；然而，这一理论仍存在争议。\n\n1型和2型糖尿病均具有非常强的遗传成分。双生子研究显示，1型糖尿病在同卵双胞胎中的一致性为50%，而2型糖尿病约为80%。参与2型糖尿病发病机制的基因在很大程度上仍然未知。主要组织相容性复合体内的基因多态性是人类1型糖尿病发病的原因之一。HLA-DQ和-DR是1型糖尿病最重要的决定因素。在普通人群中，DR3和DR4的检出率约为40%；然而，在1型糖尿病患者中，DR3和DR4单倍型检出率超过90%。\n\n（选项A、C、D和E）这些是1型糖尿病的特征。1型糖尿病发生在具有遗传易感性的个体中，当环境因素触发自身免疫反应时。2型糖尿病患者至少保留了一些β细胞功能，但1型糖尿病患者由于胰腺β细胞的免疫破坏而出现胰岛素的绝对缺乏。这些患者需要胰岛素才能生存。停止胰岛素治疗会导致酮症酸中毒。\n\n教学目标：\n胰岛淀粉样蛋白沉积是2型糖尿病的特征。HLA II类基因组成很强的关联、胰岛白细胞浸润（胰岛炎）和抗胰岛抗体在1型糖尿病中很常见。"
