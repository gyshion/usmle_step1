  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a small, enveloped RNA virus that does not contain a replicase or RNA polymerase. Therefore, the virus is completely reliant on host cell machinery for transcription and translation. In addition, HDV is considered a replication-defective virus because it does not encode for viral envelope proteins, which are necessary to generate viral progeny. HDV can only finish its replication cycle in the setting of coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV encodes for several envelope proteins (HBsAg) that are used to generate the envelope of HDV. Therefore, universal vaccination against HBV would completely eliminate HDV.\n\nHDV infection can occur as an acute coinfection with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in a chronic HBV carrier. Infection with HDV dramatically increases the already elevated risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma seen with HBV.\n\n(Choice A) Fulminant viral hepatitis is rare but can occur with any of the hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D, or E). Therefore, vaccination against HBV would not eliminate fulminant viral hepatitis.\n\n(Choice B) There is currently no vaccine against hepatitis C virus (HCV). Vaccinating a patient against HBV would not prevent HCV infection.\n\n(Choice D) Hepatocellular carcinoma is most commonly associated with HCV or HBV infection. Although universal vaccination against HBV would reduce the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, it would not eradicate the condition.\n\n(Choices E and F) HBV and HCV can cause extrahepatic manifestations such as membranous glomerulopathy and mixed cryoglobulinemia due to the formation of circulating immune complexes. Although vaccination against HBV would reduce the incidence of these extrahepatic manifestations, it would not completely eliminate them.\nEducational objective:\nHepatitis D virus (HDV) is a replication-defective RNA virus that is capable of causing infection only in the setting of coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV provides hepatitis B surface antigen for the HDV envelope.",
    "zh": " 丁型肝炎病毒 (HDV) 是一种小型、有包膜的 RNA 病毒，不包含复制酶或 RNA 聚合酶。因此，该病毒完全依赖宿主细胞机制进行转录和翻译。此外，HDV 被认为是一种复制缺陷型病毒，因为它不编码病毒包膜蛋白，而这些蛋白是产生病毒子代所必需的。HDV 只能在与乙型肝炎病毒 (HBV) 共感染的情况下完成其复制周期。HBV 编码几种包膜蛋白 (HBsAg)，这些蛋白用于产生 HDV 的包膜。因此，普遍接种乙肝疫苗将完全消除 HDV。\n\nHDV 感染可作为乙型肝炎的急性共感染或慢性 HBV 携带者的再感染。HDV 感染会显著增加 HBV 患者已升高的肝硬化和肝细胞癌的风险。\n\n（选项 A）暴发性病毒性肝炎虽然罕见，但可发生于任何肝炎病毒（甲、乙、丙、丁或戊型）。因此，接种乙肝疫苗并不能消除暴发性病毒性肝炎。\n\n（选项 B）目前没有针对丙型肝炎病毒 (HCV) 的疫苗。接种乙肝疫苗并不能预防 HCV 感染。\n\n（选项 D）肝细胞癌最常见于 HCV 或 HBV 感染。虽然普遍接种乙肝疫苗会降低肝细胞癌的发病率，但并不能根除这种疾病。\n\n（选项 E 和 F）HBV 和 HCV 可引起肝外表现，如膜性肾小球病和混合性冷球蛋白血症，这归因于循环免疫复合物的形成。虽然接种乙肝疫苗会降低这些肝外表现的发生率，但并不能完全消除它们。\n\n教育目标：\n丁型肝炎病毒 (HDV) 是一种复制缺陷型 RNA 病毒，仅在与乙型肝炎病毒 (HBV) 共感染的情况下才能引起感染。HBV 为 HDV 包膜提供乙型肝炎表面抗原。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the hepatitis D virus (HDV) and its relationship to hepatitis B virus (HBV). Specifically, it assesses understanding of HDV's replication-defective nature and its dependence on HBV for its envelope proteins.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that HDV requires HBV for its replication. Therefore, universal vaccination against HBV would eliminate the hepatitis B surface antigen, which HDV needs for its envelope, thus eradicating HDV.",
    "zh": " 这个问题考察了对丁型肝炎病毒 (HDV) 及其与乙型肝炎病毒 (HBV) 关系的了解。具体来说，它评估了对 HDV 复制缺陷性质及其依赖 HBV 包膜蛋白的理解。\n\n解决这个问题的关键是认识到 HDV 需要 HBV 进行复制。因此，普遍接种乙肝疫苗将消除乙型肝炎表面抗原，而 HDV 需要这种抗原才能形成其包膜，从而根除 HDV。"
