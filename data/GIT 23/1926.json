The boy does not have any medical problems, and his hospital stay after birth was unremarkable. His mother consumes a well-balanced diet, takes no medications, and does not drink alcohol. The boy is at the 50th percentile for weight and the 60th percentile for height. His physical examination is normal. At this time, supplementation with which of the following should be recommended for this infant?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Breast milk is the gold standard of infant nutrition; it contains proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, trace minerals, immunoglobulins, amino acids, and enzymes. All vitamins and trace minerals are present in adequate amounts except vitamins D and K. Vitamin K is supplemented by an intramuscular injection at delivery to prevent hemorrhagic disease in the newborn.\n\nRegular sunlight exposure typically provides sufficient vitamin D. However, infants are generally shielded from direct sunlight due to sunburn risk. In addition, infants with dark skin pigmentation require more sunlight exposure to produce adequate vitamin D. Melanin is a natural sunblock and prevents ultraviolet rays from reaching the skin for vitamin D synthesis. Prolonged vitamin D insufficiency can lead to rickets (inadequate bone and cartilage mineralization). Therefore, all exclusively breastfed infants should receive vitamin D supplementation to prevent rickets. Formula-fed infants do not require supplementation as formula is fortified with adequate amounts of vitamin D. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices A, C, and D) Human breast milk normally provides adequate amounts of folic acid, riboflavin, and thiamine for full-term infants.\n\n(Choice B) Although breast milk has low iron content, the bioavailability of iron in breastmilk is considerably higher than supplemental iron and is sufficient for infants until age 4 months. Due to decreasing iron concentration in breast milk over time, supplementation is recommended for breastfed infants at age >4 months until solid food intake provides an adequate amount.\n\n(Choice E) Vitamin A stores in the liver are low at birth but rapidly increase due to the large amount in colostrum and breast milk.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe breast milk content of vitamins D and K is typically insufficient for the nutritional needs of the newborn. Vitamin K is given parenterally to all newborns at birth to prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Exclusively breastfed infants require vitamin D supplementation due to lack of sunlight exposure and to prevent rickets.",
    "zh": "母乳是婴儿营养的黄金标准；它含有蛋白质、碳水化合物、脂肪、维生素、微量矿物质、免疫球蛋白、氨基酸和酶。除维生素 D 和 K 外，所有维生素和微量矿物质的含量都足够。维生素 K 通过分娩时肌内注射补充，以预防新生儿出血性疾病。\n\n规律的阳光照射通常能提供足够的维生素 D。然而，由于晒伤的风险，婴儿通常会避免直接接触阳光。此外，深色皮肤色素沉着的婴儿需要更多的阳光照射才能产生足够的维生素 D。黑色素是一种天然的防晒霜，可以阻止紫外线到达皮肤进行维生素 D 合成。长期维生素 D 不足可导致佝偻病（骨骼和软骨矿化不足）。因此，所有纯母乳喂养的婴儿都应补充维生素 D 以预防佝偻病。配方奶喂养的婴儿不需要补充，因为配方奶中富含足量的维生素 D。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项 A、C 和 D）人乳通常为足月儿提供足量的叶酸、核黄素和硫胺素。\n\n（选项 B）虽然母乳的含铁量较低，但母乳中铁的生物利用度远高于补充铁，并且足以满足 4 个月以下婴儿的需求。由于母乳中的铁浓度会随着时间的推移而降低，因此建议 4 个月以上的母乳喂养婴儿补充铁，直到固体食物摄入提供足够的量。\n\n（选项 E）出生时肝脏中的维生素 A 储存量较低，但由于初乳和母乳中的含量较高，因此会迅速增加。\n\n教育目标：\n母乳中维生素 D 和 K 的含量通常不足以满足新生儿的营养需求。维生素 K 在出生时通过肠外途径给予所有新生儿，以预防新生儿出血性疾病。纯母乳喂养的婴儿需要补充维生素 D，因为缺乏阳光照射并预防佝偻病。"
