    "en": "A 64-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to 2 days of abrupt-onset fever, malaise, and myalgia. He has also had nasal discharge, sore throat, and a nonproductive cough. The patient has a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He is a former smoker but does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Temperature is 38.3 C (101 F), blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg, pulse is 96/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination shows watery nasal discharge, pharyngeal erythema, and clear lungs on auscultation. Droplet precautions are immediately instituted to prevent spread of the infection. Hand hygiene with an alcohol-based disinfectant following patient contact is also initiated. This patient's infecting pathogen is likely susceptible to the disinfectant due to the presence of which of the following characteristics?",

    "en": "Although both influenza and the common cold can be associated with upper respiratory symptoms (eg, rhinorrhea, cough, sore throat), influenza can often be differentiated based on the abrupt onset of symptoms and the presence of nonspecific, systemic manifestations (eg, fever, malaise, myalgias, headache).\n\nThe influenza virus is an enveloped orthomyxovirus with a segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. Transmission occurs via contaminated, large-particle droplets. Therefore, patients who are hospitalized with influenza generally require droplet precautions (mask and gown for health care providers), and close contacts should be advised to practice appropriate hand hygiene.\n\nAlcohol-based disinfectants, which are composed of ethyl or isopropyl alcohol (at concentrations of 60%-90%) in water, are often used for hand hygiene. These solutions kill vegetative bacteria (but not spores), fungus, and enveloped viruses (eg, influenza, HIV, herpes) by dissolving their lipid bilayer membranes and subsequently denaturing their proteins. Nonenveloped viruses such as adenovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, and poliovirus are less susceptible to some alcohol-based disinfectants (particularly isopropyl-based solutions) because they do not have a lipid bilayer envelope.\n\n(Choice B) Proteins (and spores) are sterilized by moist heat (eg, autoclave), which results in protein denaturation. Although proteins are somewhat susceptible to alcohol-based disinfectants, high concentrations must be used and efficacy is variable. Alcohol has the strongest effect on lipophilic membranes.\n\n(Choice C) RNA can be rendered inert by ionizing radiation, which dislodges electrons and results in the formation of reactive ions that break covalent bonds. Alcohol has a minimal effect on RNA molecule integrity.\n\n(Choice D) Neuraminidase, 1 of the 2 influenza surface glycoproteins, can be blocked by neuraminidase inhibitors (eg, oseltamivir, zanamivir). These are often used to treat acute influenza (prevent the virus from leaving infected cells).\n\n(Choice E) The M2 ion channel mediates fusion of the influenza envelope with the endosome membrane, which liberates the influenza nucleocapsid and enzymes into the cytoplasm of the host cells. Blockade of the M2 ion channel with amantadine can prevent influenza infection. However, because influenza virus has developed resistance to M2 ion channel inhibitors, these drugs are not recommended for use in the United States.\n\nEducational objective:\nAlcohol-based disinfectants kill enveloped viruses (eg, influenza) by dissolving their outer lipid envelope. Nonenveloped viruses are less susceptible to some alcohol-based disinfectants because they have no lipid envelope to target.",
    "zh": "虽然流感和普通感冒都可能与上呼吸道症状相关（例如，鼻漏、咳嗽、咽喉痛），但流感通常可以根据症状的突然发作以及非特异性、全身表现（例如，发热、不适、肌痛、头痛）来区分。\n\n流感病毒是一种具有分段、负链、单链 RNA 基因组的包膜型正粘病毒。 传播通过受污染的大颗粒飞沫发生。 因此，因流感住院的患者通常需要飞沫隔离措施（医护人员佩戴口罩和穿防护服），并且应建议密切接触者 practice 适当的手部卫生。\n\n含酒精消毒剂，由乙醇或异丙醇（浓度为 60%-90%）溶于水组成，常用于手部卫生。 这些溶液通过溶解脂质双层膜，随后使蛋白质变性来杀死繁殖性细菌（但不是孢子）、真菌和包膜病毒（例如，流感、HIV、疱疹）。 腺病毒、鼻病毒、肠病毒和脊髓灰质炎病毒等无包膜病毒对某些含酒精消毒剂（特别是异丙醇溶液）的敏感性较低，因为它们没有脂质双层包膜。\n\n(选项 B) 蛋白质（和孢子）通过湿热（例如，高压灭菌）灭菌，这会导致蛋白质变性。 尽管蛋白质对含酒精消毒剂有一定程度的敏感性，但必须使用高浓度并且效果不稳定。 酒精对亲脂性膜的影响最强。\n\n(选项 C) RNA 可通过电离辐射变得惰性，电离辐射会移去电子并导致形成破坏共价键的反应性离子。 酒精对 RNA 分子完整性的影响很小。\n\n(选项 D) 神经氨酸酶是 2 种流感表面糖蛋白之一，可以被神经氨酸酶抑制剂（例如，奥司他韦、扎那米韦）阻断。 这些药物常用于治疗急性流感（防止病毒离开被感染的细胞）。\n\n(选项 E) M2 离子通道介导流感包膜与内体膜的融合，将流感核衣壳和酶释放到宿主细胞的细胞质中。 用金刚烷胺阻断 M2 离子通道可以预防流感感染。 然而，由于流感病毒已对 M2 离子通道抑制剂产生耐药性，因此不建议在美国使用这些药物。\n\n教育目标：\n含酒精消毒剂通过溶解其外层脂质包膜来杀死包膜病毒（例如，流感）。 无包膜病毒对某些含酒精消毒剂的敏感性较低，因为它们没有脂质包膜可供靶向。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of viral structure and the mechanism of action of alcohol-based disinfectants, specifically how they target enveloped viruses like influenza. It also assesses understanding of infection control measures and the characteristics that make certain pathogens susceptible to disinfectants.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key information: the patient likely has influenza, and alcohol-based disinfectants are being used. Recall that enveloped viruses are susceptible to alcohol because it dissolves their lipid bilayer, leading to their inactivation.",
