  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Stable angina results from fixed coronary artery stenosis in the setting of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). Such a stenosis limits blood supply to the downstream myocardium, which, during periods of increased myocardial oxygen demand (eg, exercise), can cause a mismatch of oxygen supply and demand that manifests as anginal symptoms (eg, chest pain, shortness of breath).\n\nPharmacologic stress testing can be useful in diagnosing atherosclerotic CAD. Dobutamine, a beta-1 agonist, increases heart rate and contractility to mimic the increase in myocardial oxygen demand that occurs with exercise. Myocardium that is unable to obtain sufficient blood flow to meet the increased oxygen demand typically demonstrates a transient decrease in contractility (ie, wall motion defect), often leading to reduced ejection fraction. This patient with a transient wall motion defect localized to the cardiac apex most likely has a fixed atherosclerotic lesion that limits blood flow to that area of myocardium.\n\n(Choice A) Coronary artery occlusion due to plaque rupture and thrombosis leads to acute myocardial infarction (MI). Because of total coronary artery occlusion and a completely blocked myocardial oxygen supply, a persistent (before, during, and after dobutamine infusion), rather than transient, wall motion defect would be expected.\n\n(Choice B) Vasospastic angina is due to coronary artery vasospasm and can mimic stable angina that results from atherosclerotic CAD; however, vasospastic angina typically occurs in relatively young patients (age <50). In addition, dobutamine has only a small agonistic effect on alpha-1 receptors and is unlikely to trigger coronary vasospasm.\n\n(Choice C) Focal myocardial fibrosis typically results from previous MI. Contractility is impaired in the fibrosed myocardium, leading to a persistent wall motion defect similar to that expected with acute MI.\n\n(Choice D) In the normal state, dobutamine boosts myocardial contractility, and the rise in myocardial oxygen demand is met by increased myocardial oxygen supply via increased blood flow. Therefore, the normal response to dobutamine infusion is a transient increase in ejection fraction.",

    "en": "This question tests the pathophysiology of stable angina and the interpretation of dobutamine stress echocardiography findings in the context of coronary artery disease. It requires understanding the mechanism of supply-demand mismatch in the presence of fixed coronary stenosis.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the transient nature of the wall motion abnormality during dobutamine infusion, which points towards a supply-demand mismatch due to fixed coronary stenosis. Ruling out other causes of chest pain and wall motion abnormalities is also crucial.",
