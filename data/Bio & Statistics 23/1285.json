    "en": "A new tumor marker is being investigated for its usefulness in diagnosing ovarian cancer. A sample of 400 women is stratified into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of BRCA mutations. Serum levels of the new marker are obtained in the 2 groups; in addition, both groups of women undergo conventional screening to determine their disease status. The curves on the top represent the distribution of the new serum marker in women with BRCA mutations, and the curves on the bottom represent the distribution of the new serum marker in women without the BRCA mutations. {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The cutoff value of a quantitative diagnostic test determines whether a given result is interpreted as positive or negative. When there is overlap between the serum values of the healthy and diseased populations, a cutoff value that correctly categorizes all individuals in both populations cannot be chosen. This limits the sensitivity and specificity of the test due to the presence of false positive (FP) and/or false negative (FN) individuals.\n\nSensitivity represents the ability of a test to correctly identify those with a given disease. It is calculated as the number of patients correctly testing positive (TP) divided by the total number of patients with the disease (TP / [TP + FN]). Specificity represents the ability of a test to correctly identify those without a given disease. It is calculated as the number of patients correctly testing negative (TN) divided by the total number of patients without the disease (TN / [TN + FP]).\n\nIn this case, values of the serum marker in women with BRCA mutations show decreased overlap between the healthy and diseased curves of women with BRCA mutations (curves on the top) compared with women without BRCA mutations (curves on the bottom). The corresponding decrease in the number of FPs and FNs means the new serum marker has higher sensitivity and specificity (ie, better performance) in women with BRCA mutations.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe degree of overlap between the healthy and the diseased population curves limits the maximum combined sensitivity and specificity of a quantitative diagnostic test. The degree to which sensitivity or specificity is affected depends on the chosen cutoff value.",
    "zh": "定量诊断测试的临界值决定了给定结果被解释为阳性还是阴性。当健康人群和患病人群的血清值之间存在重叠时，无法选择一个可以正确分类两个人群中所有个体的临界值。由于存在假阳性 (FP) 和/或假阴性 (FN) 个体，这限制了测试的敏感性和特异性。\n\n敏感性代表测试正确识别患有特定疾病的能力。它被计算为正确检测呈阳性的患者数量 (TP) 除以患有该疾病的患者总数 (TP / [TP + FN])。特异性代表测试正确识别未患有特定疾病的个体的能力。它被计算为正确检测呈阴性的患者数量 (TN) 除以未患有该疾病的患者总数 (TN / [TN + FP])。\n\n在这种情况下，BRCA 突变女性的血清标志物值显示，与无 BRCA 突变的女性相比（底部曲线），BRCA 突变女性的健康和患病曲线之间的重叠减少（顶部曲线）。FP 和 FN 数量的相应减少意味着新血清标志物在 BRCA 突变女性中具有更高的敏感性和特异性（即，更好的表现）。\n\n教育目标：\n健康和患病人群曲线之间的重叠程度限制了定量诊断测试的最大组合敏感性和特异性。敏感性或特异性受影响的程度取决于所选择的临界值。"
