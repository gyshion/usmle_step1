    "en": "A 44-year-old man comes to the office due to hand tremors. The patient first noticed the tremor 2 years ago, and it has gradually worsened. He feels well most of the time, but his hands shake uncontrollably with activities such as pouring drinks or writing notes. The symptoms are most pronounced during stressful situations such as office meetings, and he keeps his hands tightly squeezed together or hidden below the table. He has had no arm stiffness, leg symptoms, or difficulty walking, but his wife has noticed that the patient occasionally keeps nodding his head while talking. Physical examination shows obvious tremors of outstretched hands that worsen during finger-nose testing.",

    "en": "This patient has a worsening tremor of his distal upper extremities that becomes more pronounced with extension of his arms and at the end of an intended action (finger-to-nose test). In association with a head tremor (eg, repetitive nodding) and absence of other neurologic manifestations, this is most consistent with ESSENTIAL TREMOR (ET). ET is often hereditary and can be passed in an autosomal dominant fashion, so a FAMILY HISTORY of tremor supports the diagnosis.\n\nAlthough features of ET are highly variable, it most often affects the WRISTS AND HANDS, especially when the arms are extended. It worsens with movement (ie, ACTION TREMOR) and improves, but may not completely abate, at rest. Although ET is not typically unilateral, it may be asymmetric. It can also affect the HEAD and voice, but it generally spares the trunk and legs and is not associated with other neurologic manifestations. Although ET does not shorten life, it is slowly PROGRESSIVE and may cause patients significant social embarrassment and impair activities of daily living.\n\n(Choice A) ET classically improves with, rather than is exacerbated by, alcohol use.\n\n(Choices B and E) Secondary parkinsonism can be induced by MPTP (a toxic substance that destroys dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra) or by the use of dopamine D2 receptor blocking drugs (eg, antipsychotics, antiemetics). Patients can have tremor, but it is typically most prominent at rest and improves with action. The tremor is also accompanied by other parkinsonian features such as rigidity, postural instability, and gait disturbances.\n\n(Choice D) Previous head trauma can predispose to a wide range of neurologic sequelae, particularly headaches, seizures, and dementia. However, the development of isolated ET due to head trauma would be rare.\n\nEducational objective:\nEssential tremor most often presents as a tremor of the hands that is suppressed at rest, exacerbated by outstretched arms, and more pronounced during goal-directed movements. It is often hereditary (autosomal dominant) and can be associated with a head tremor, but it is not associated with other neurologic symptoms.",
    "zh": "该患者出现远端上肢震颤加重，当手臂伸展和进行预期动作（指鼻试验）时更为明显。结合头部震颤（例如，重复点头）和其他神经系统表现的缺失，这与原发性震颤（ET）最为一致。ET常具有遗传性，并且可以以常染色体显性方式遗传，因此震颤的家族史支持该诊断。\n\n尽管ET的特征具有高度变异性，但它最常影响手腕和手，尤其是在手臂伸展时。它会随着运动（即，动作性震颤）而加重，并在静止时改善，但可能不会完全缓解。尽管ET通常不是单侧的，但可能是不对称的。它也可能影响头部和声音，但通常会避开躯干和腿部，并且与其它神经系统表现无关。尽管ET不会缩短寿命，但它会缓慢进展，并可能导致患者明显的社会尴尬，并损害日常生活活动。\n\n（选项A）ET通常会因饮酒而改善，而不是加重。\n\n（选项B和E）继发性帕金森病可能由MPTP（一种破坏黑质中多巴胺能神经元的有毒物质）或使用多巴胺D2受体阻断药物（例如，抗精神病药，止吐药）引起。患者可能会出现震颤，但通常在静止时最为明显，并且随着动作而改善。震颤还伴有其他帕金森病特征，例如僵硬，姿势不稳和步态障碍。\n\n（选项D）既往头部外伤可导致一系列神经系统后遗症，尤其是头痛、癫痫发作和痴呆。然而，由于头部外伤而发生孤立性ET的情况是罕见的。\n\n教育目标：\n原发性震颤最常表现为手部震颤，在静止时受到抑制，在手臂伸展时加重，并且在有目标导向的运动中更为明显。它通常具有遗传性（常染色体显性），并可能与头部震颤相关，但与其它神经系统症状无关。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation, epidemiology, and differential diagnosis of essential tremor. It requires the clinician to identify the most likely associated historical factor based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the classic features of essential tremor, including the action tremor, its exacerbation with stress and goal-directed movements, and potential association with head tremor. Then, consider the differential diagnoses for tremor and rule out conditions like Parkinson's disease. Finally, evaluate the provided options in the context of the typical epidemiology of essential tremor, particularly its hereditary nature.",
    "zh": "此题考察对原发性震颤的临床表现、流行病学和鉴别诊断的理解。它要求临床医生根据患者的症状和体格检查结果，确定最可能相关的病史因素。\n\n要解决这个问题，首先要认识到原发性震颤的经典特征，包括动作性震颤、其在压力和目标导向运动时的加重，以及与头部震颤的潜在关联。然后，考虑震颤的鉴别诊断，并排除帕金森病等疾病。最后，根据原发性震颤的典型流行病学，特别是其遗传性质，评估所提供的选项。"
