    "en": "A previously healthy 16-year-old boy is evaluated for progressive headaches and blurred vision that started several months ago. The headaches are more severe upon waking up in the morning and are often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He takes no medications and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Physical examination is notable for bilateral papilledema. MRI of the brain is shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}.

    "en": "This patient has an enhancing ventricular mass on MRI, consistent with a ventricular and ependymoma. Ependymomas arise from ependymal cells, which line the walls of the ventricular system and the central canal of the spinal cord and produce cerebrospinal fluid. Choroid plexus tumors (derived from modified ependymal cells) can also be found in the lateral ventricles and have a similar appearance on MRI.\n\nIntraventricular tumors can cause obstructive (noncommunicating) hydrocephalus due to impaired flow of cerebrospinal fluid through the interventricular foramina. Hydrocephalus typically manifests with headache, signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, nausea, papilledema, blurred vision), and dilated ventricles on neuroimaging. The diagnosis of ependymoma can be confirmed on histopathologic examination, which shows perivascular pseudorosettes {{exhibit_2}}.\n\n(Choice A) Astrocytes are the most prevalent type of glial cell in the CNS. Tumors derived from these cells (eg, astrocytoma, glioblastoma) can cause hydrocephalus due to mass effect but are typically found in the brain parenchyma as opposed to the ventricular system.\n\n(Choice C) Microglial cells are the phagocytic cells in the CNS. They are not the originators of any major types of CNS tumors.\n\n(Choice D) Brain tumors that arise from neuronal cells are rare, usually found in the brain parenchyma, and more likely to be of mixed neuronal-glial cell origin.\n\n(Choice E) Oligodendrocytes are glial cells that are responsible for the myelination of axons in the CNS. Well-differentiated brain tumors arising from oligodendrocytes are referred to as oligodendrogliomas. These tumors, like astrocytomas, occur in the brain parenchyma and not in the ventricular system.\n\n(Choice F) Schwann cells form myelin in the peripheral nervous system and serve as the cell of origin for schwannomas, which most commonly occur on upper extremity nerves. Schwannomas that arise from cranial nerves (eg, CN VII, acoustic neuromas) can cause hydrocephalus from mass effect due to their central location but would not be associated with an intraventricular mass.\n\n(Choice G) Hemangioblastomas originate from vascular endothelial cells in the cerebellum or spinal cord. They characteristically appear as an enhancing nodule with a cystic component. These tumors often bleed, which can cause hydrocephalus due to dysfunction of cerebrospinal reabsorption at the arachnoid villi, but they do not originate from the ventricular wall.\n\nEducational objective:\nEpendymomas originate from the ependymal cells that line the ventricular system and the central canal of the spinal cord. Ventricular ependymomas can block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid through the interventricular foramina, causing signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, headache, papilledema) due to obstructive (noncommunicating) hydrocephalus {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}.",
    "zh": "该患者的 MRI 扫描显示有强化性脑室肿块，与室管膜瘤一致。室管膜瘤起源于室管膜细胞，这些细胞排列在脑室系统壁和脊髓中央管内，并产生脑脊液。脉络丛肿瘤（源自修饰的室管膜细胞）也可见于侧脑室，在 MRI 上表现相似。\n\n脑室内肿瘤可因脑脊液通过室间孔的流动受损而导致梗阻性（非交通性）脑积水。脑积水通常表现为头痛、颅内压增高的体征（例如，恶心、视乳头水肿、视力模糊）和神经影像学检查显示的脑室扩张。室管膜瘤的诊断可通过组织病理学检查确认，该检查显示血管周围假菊形团 {{exhibit_2}}。\n\n(选项 A) 星形胶质细胞是 CNS 中最常见的神经胶质细胞。源自这些细胞的肿瘤（例如，星形细胞瘤、成胶质细胞瘤）可因占位效应导致脑积水，但通常位于脑实质，而不是脑室系统。\n\n(选项 C) 小胶质细胞是 CNS 中的吞噬细胞。它们不是任何主要类型的 CNS 肿瘤的起源。\n\n(选项 D) 起源于神经元细胞的脑肿瘤很少见，通常位于脑实质中，并且更有可能是神经元-神经胶质细胞混合起源。\n\n(选项 E) 少突胶质细胞是负责 CNS 中轴突髓鞘形成的神经胶质细胞。源自少突胶质细胞的分化良好的脑肿瘤被称为少突胶质细胞瘤。这些肿瘤，如星形细胞瘤，发生在脑实质中，而不是脑室系统中。\n\n(选项 F) 许旺细胞在周围神经系统中形成髓鞘，并作为神经鞘瘤的起源细胞，神经鞘瘤最常发生在四肢神经上。起源于颅神经的神经鞘瘤（例如，CN VII、听神经瘤）可因其中心位置的占位效应而导致脑积水，但与脑室内肿块无关。\n\n(选项 G) 血管母细胞瘤起源于小脑或脊髓中的血管内皮细胞。它们典型地表现为具有囊性成分的强化结节。这些肿瘤经常出血，这可能由于蛛网膜绒毛的脑脊液再吸收功能障碍而导致脑积水，但它们并非起源于脑室壁。\n\n教学目标：\n室管膜瘤起源于排列在脑室系统和脊髓中央管内的室管膜细胞。脑室室管膜瘤可阻塞脑脊液通过室间孔的流动，从而因梗阻性（非交通性）脑积水而引起颅内压增高的体征（例如，头痛、视乳头水肿）{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the cell of origin for ependymomas and their association with obstructive hydrocephalus. It requires correlating clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathological characteristics to identify the specific glial cell type involved in tumor formation within the ventricular system.\n\nTo solve this question, one should first identify the location and likely nature of the brain lesion based on the clinical vignette and MRI findings. Then, consider the differential diagnosis of intraventricular tumors and their respective cell of origin. Finally, link the symptoms of increased intracranial pressure to the mechanism of obstructive hydrocephalus caused by the tumor.",
