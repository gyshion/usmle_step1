    "en": "A 20-year-old man comes to the office due to occasional palpitations that he describes as skipped beats. He has no chest pain or shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. On physical examination, the patient has wide, fixed splitting of S2. No murmurs are heard. Chest x-ray reveals enlargement of the right heart contour. Echocardiographic findings are consistent with a congenital heart defect. Repair of this patient's congenital disease is aimed primarily at preventing irreversible changes to which of the following?",

    "en": "ASD = atrial septal defect, PVR = pulmonary vascular resistance.\n\nThis patient has wide, fixed splitting of S2, a characteristic auscultatory finding of an atrial septal defect (ASD). ASD permits left-to-right shunting due to higher pressure in the left atrium compared to the right. The increase in right atrial blood flow causes right-sided volume overload, leading to delayed closure of the pulmonic valve (wide S2) that does not vary with respirations (fixed S2). The low-velocity blood flow through the ASD does not typically produce a murmur; the characteristic murmur of ASD, present in some patients, is a midsystolic ejection murmur resulting from increased flow across the pulmonic valve.\n\nRight-sided volume overload eventually leads to right atrial and ventricular enlargement, which may be seen as an enlarged right heart contour on chest x-ray. Atrial fibrillation, which is the likely cause of this patient's palpitations, is a potential complication resulting from chronic right atrial stretching.\n\nWith long-standing ASD, the chronic increase in blood flow through the pulmonary circulation induces laminated medial hypertrophy of the pulmonary arteries. This increases pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), causing pulmonary hypertension. Eventually, PVR can exceed systemic vascular resistance, reversing the direction of the intracardiac shunt (Eisenmenger syndrome); this allows blood to bypass the pulmonary circulation and can cause adult-onset cyanosis, clubbing, and polycythemia.\n\nPulmonary vascular remodeling is irreversible. Therefore, early closure of a hemodynamically significant ASD is needed to avoid irreversible pulmonary vascular changes.\n\n(Choices A, B, and C) ASD does not typically cause volume overload or enlargement of the left heart chambers because excess blood flow is shunted to the right atrium before reaching the left ventricle. The coronary vessels are not typically affected.\n\n(Choice E) ASD causes right atrial dilation, but the consequence of this change is far less than that of the pulmonary vascular changes. In addition, right atrial dilation is mostly reversible because, unlike in the pulmonary arteries and often the right ventricle, significant muscular hypertrophy does not take place.\n\nEducational objective:\nAtrial septal defects cause wide, fixed splitting of S2 due to right-sided volume overload from left-to-right shunting. Uncorrected defects can lead to irreversible medial hypertrophy of the pulmonary arteries with pulmonary hypertension and reversal to right-to-left shunting (ie, Eisenmenger syndrome). {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "ASD = 房间隔缺损，PVR = 肺血管阻力。\n\n该患者S2有宽而固定的分裂，这是房间隔缺损 (ASD) 的特征性听诊表现。由于左心房的压力高于右心房，ASD 允许发生左向右分流。右心房血流量的增加会导致右侧容量超负荷，导致肺动脉瓣关闭延迟（S2增宽），且不随呼吸变化（S2固定）。通过ASD的低速血流通常不会产生杂音；部分患者存在的ASD的特征性杂音是源于跨肺动脉瓣血流增加的中收缩期喷射性杂音。\n\n右侧容量超负荷最终导致右心房和右心室扩大，这可能在胸部X线检查中显示为右心轮廓增大。心房颤动（可能是该患者心悸的原因）是慢性右心房扩张导致的一种潜在并发症。\n\n对于病程较长的ASD，通过肺循环的慢性血流量增加会诱导肺动脉的层状内膜肥厚。这会增加肺血管阻力 (PVR)，从而导致肺动脉高压。最终，PVR可能会超过体循环血管阻力，逆转心内分流的方向（艾森曼格综合征）；这使得血液绕过肺循环，并可能导致成人发病的紫绀、杵状指和红细胞增多症。\n\n肺血管重塑是不可逆的。因此，需要早期关闭血流动力学上显著的ASD，以避免不可逆的肺血管改变。\n\n（选项A、B和C）ASD通常不会导致左心房腔室的容量超负荷或扩大，因为过多的血流在到达左心室之前分流到右心房。冠状动脉通常不受影响。\n\n（选项E）ASD引起右心房扩张，但这种变化的影响远小于肺血管改变。此外，右心房扩张大多是可逆的，因为与肺动脉以及右心室相比，通常不会发生显著的肌肉肥大。\n\n教育目标：\n房间隔缺损由于左向右分流引起的右侧容量超负荷导致S2宽而固定。未矫正的缺损可导致肺动脉不可逆的内膜肥厚，伴有肺动脉高压，并逆转为右向左分流（即艾森曼格综合征）。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of atrial septal defect (ASD) and its long-term complications, specifically Eisenmenger syndrome and irreversible pulmonary vascular changes.
