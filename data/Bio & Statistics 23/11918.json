    "en": "A research scientist studying the metabolic pathways that contribute to obesity feeds experimental animals a high-carbohydrate, high-protein diet for a prolonged period. A sample of liver tissue is then obtained from the animals, and the activity of various enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism is measured and recorded. It is determined that beta-oxidation of fatty acids is inhibited within these cells as a result of the diet.",

    "en": "In the well-fed state, the abundance of ATP in hepatocytes inhibits isocitrate dehydrogenase, leading to high levels of citrate in the mitochondria. Citrate is transferred to the cytosol via the citrate shuttle and cleaved by ATP citrate lyase to form acetyl-CoA. High citrate levels (in addition to elevated insulin caused by high carbohydrate intake) causes upregulation of Acetyl-CoA carboxylase. This cytosolic enzyme catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA in the rate-limiting step of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Fatty acid synthase then catalyzes the condensation of malonyl-CoA with acetyl-CoA to create a 4-carbon molecule that will undergo subsequent condensation reactions to form a 16-carbon fatty acid.\n\nBeta-oxidation of fatty acids takes place primarily within the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondrial membranes are impermeable to fatty acids due to their negative charge, so a specialized membrane carrier (carnitine) must be used to shuttle them into the matrix. Malonyl-CoA inhibits carnitine acyltransferase, preventing the transfer of acyl groups into the mitochondria. This inhibitory action functions to prevent the breakdown of newly synthesized fatty acids.\n\n(Choice A) Ketone bodies (eg, acetoacetate) are a major source of fuel for muscle, brain, and cardiac tissue that are produced during times of starvation or fasting when oxaloacetate is in short supply and acetyl-CoA is in excess.\n\n(Choice B) Carnitine is an amino acid that is essential for the transport of fatty acids through the mitochondrial membrane. It is a necessary component of fatty acid oxidation.\n\n(Choice C) Citrate is an intermediate in the TCA cycle. It can be exported out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the cytosol, where it is broken down into acetyl-CoA for use in de novo fatty acid synthesis.\n\n(Choice E) NADPH is a reducing molecule necessary for the synthesis of fatty acids. In contrast, beta-oxidation of fats produces FADH₂ and NADH-reducing equivalents.\n\nEducational objective:\nCytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA during the rate-limiting step of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Malonyl-CoA also inhibits the action of mitochondrial carnitine acyltransferase, thereby inhibiting beta-oxidation of newly formed fatty acids.",
    "zh": "在饱食状态下，肝细胞中ATP的丰富会抑制异柠檬酸脱氢酶，导致线粒体中柠檬酸水平升高。柠檬酸通过柠檬酸穿梭系统转移到胞质溶胶中，并被ATP柠檬酸裂解酶裂解形成乙酰辅酶A。高水平的柠檬酸（除了高碳水化合物摄入引起的胰岛素升高外）会导致乙酰辅酶A羧化酶的上调。这种胞质溶胶酶催化乙酰辅酶A转化为丙二酰辅酶A，这是从头脂肪酸合成的限速步骤。然后，脂肪酸合酶催化丙二酰辅酶A与乙酰辅酶A的缩合，生成一个4碳分子，该分子将经历随后的缩合反应形成一个16碳脂肪酸。\n\n脂肪酸的β-氧化主要在线粒体基质中进行。线粒体膜由于其负电荷而对脂肪酸不通透，因此必须使用一种特殊的膜载体（肉碱）将它们转运到基质中。丙二酰辅酶A抑制肉碱酰基转移酶，阻止酰基进入线粒体。这种抑制作用可以防止新合成的脂肪酸的分解。\n\n(选项A) 酮体（例如乙酰乙酸）是肌肉、大脑和心脏组织的主要燃料来源，这些燃料是在饥饿或禁食期间产生的，此时草酰乙酸供应不足，乙酰辅酶A过量。\n\n(选项B) 肉碱是一种氨基酸，对于脂肪酸通过线粒体膜的转运至关重要。它是脂肪酸氧化的必要组成部分。\n\n(选项C) 柠檬酸是TCA循环中的中间体。它可以从线粒体基质中导出到胞质溶胶中，在那里它会被分解成乙酰辅酶A，用于从头脂肪酸的合成。\n\n(选项E) NADPH是脂肪酸合成所必需的还原分子。相比之下，脂肪的β-氧化产生FADH₂和NADH还原当量。\n\n教学目标：\n胞质溶胶乙酰辅酶A羧化酶在从头脂肪酸合成的限速步骤中将乙酰辅酶A转化为丙二酰辅酶A。丙二酰辅酶A还抑制线粒体肉碱酰基转移酶的作用，从而抑制新形成的脂肪酸的β-氧化。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of fatty acid metabolism, specifically the regulation of beta-oxidation by malonyl-CoA. It also requires understanding of the role of carnitine in transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that malonyl-CoA is produced during fatty acid synthesis and inhibits carnitine acyltransferase, which is necessary for the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation. Therefore, an increase in malonyl-CoA would inhibit beta-oxidation.",
    "zh": "这道题考察了对脂肪酸代谢的了解，特别是丙二酰辅酶A对β-氧化的调节。它还需要理解肉碱在将脂肪酸转运到线粒体中的作用。\n\n要解决这个问题，请回忆一下，丙二酰辅酶A是在脂肪酸合成过程中产生的，并抑制肉碱酰基转移酶，而肉碱酰基转移酶是脂肪酸转运到线粒体中进行β-氧化所必需的。因此，丙二酰辅酶A的增加会抑制β-氧化。"
