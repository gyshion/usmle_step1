    "en": "A 33-year-old man comes to the office due to trouble swallowing and a chronic sore throat. He has no chronic medical conditions and does not use tobacco or alcohol. Physical examination shows an enlarged, ulcerated right tonsil. Biopsy of the ulcerated lesion reveals infiltrating nests of moderately differentiated squamous cells. Immunohistochemistry is positive for p16, suggesting that the tumor is likely due to human papilloma virus. Further imaging studies for cancer staging are planned. This patient's tumor is most likely to spread first to which of the following locations?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Most carcinomas, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, spread first from the primary site of the tumor to regional lymph nodes via the lymphatics. In this patient with a tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma, this spread would be to the upper anterior cervical (ie, jugular) lymph nodes. Assessment of regional lymph node status is important for tumor staging based on the TNM staging system, which evaluates the size and characteristics of the Tumor, regional lymph Node involvement, and distant Metastases.\n\n(Choice A) Similar to the tonsils, adenoid tissue is also lymphatic tissue in the head and neck that can harbor a primary site of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, it is located in the nasopharynx rather than the oropharynx. The spread of cancer is typically to regional lymph nodes rather than to other mucosal sites in the head and neck.\n\n(Choices B, C, and F) Although these are possible sites of distant cancer metastases, they are less commonly associated with metastatic head and neck cancer. Common primary sources for metastases to these sites include:\n\nAdrenal gland metastases: breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and melanoma\nBrain metastases (gray-white matter junction): lung cancer\nVertebral body metastases: prostate cancer\nHowever, the first site of spread of most carcinomas (including head and neck cancer) is the regional lymph nodes.\n\n(Choice E) The lung parenchyma is the most common site for distant metastases from head and neck cancer. However, regional lymph node spread is typically seen first.\n\nEducational objective:\nHead and neck squamous cell carcinomas typically spread first to the anterior cervical (ie, jugular) lymph nodes via the lymphatics. Distant spread occurs after regional lymph node involvement.",
    "zh": "大多数癌，包括头颈部鳞状细胞癌，首先通过淋巴管从肿瘤原发部位扩散到区域淋巴结。对于这名患有扁桃体鳞状细胞癌的患者，这种扩散将到达上颈前（即颈静脉）淋巴结。基于TNM分期系统，评估区域淋巴结状况对于肿瘤分期很重要，该系统评估肿瘤的大小和特征、区域淋巴结受累情况以及远处转移。\n\n（选项A）与扁桃体类似，腺样体也是头颈部的淋巴组织，可以作为头颈部鳞状细胞癌的原发部位。然而，它位于鼻咽部而不是口咽部。癌症的扩散通常是到区域淋巴结，而不是到头颈部的其他粘膜部位。\n\n（选项B、C和F）尽管这些是可能的远处癌症转移部位，但它们与转移性头颈癌的相关性较小。转移到这些部位的常见原发来源包括：\n\n肾上腺转移：乳腺癌、肾细胞癌和黑色素瘤\n脑转移（灰质-白质交界处）：肺癌\n椎体转移：前列腺癌\n然而，大多数癌（包括头颈癌）的首个扩散部位是区域淋巴结。\n\n（选项E）肺实质是头颈癌远处转移最常见的部位。然而，通常首先观察到区域淋巴结扩散。\n\n教育目标：\n头颈部鳞状细胞癌通常首先通过淋巴管扩散到颈前（即颈静脉）淋巴结。远处扩散发生在区域淋巴结受累之后。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the typical pattern of metastasis for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, specifically the initial spread to regional lymph nodes. It also requires understanding of the lymphatic drainage pathways in the head and neck region.\n\nThe best approach is to recall that most carcinomas, including head and neck cancers, initially spread to regional lymph nodes via lymphatic vessels. Identify the lymph nodes that are most proximal to the primary tumor site (tonsil) to determine the most likely location of initial metastasis.",
    "zh": "此问题测试对头颈部鳞状细胞癌转移的典型模式的了解，特别是最初扩散到区域淋巴结。它还需要了解头颈部区域的淋巴引流途径。\n\n最好的方法是回忆大多数癌，包括头颈癌，最初通过淋巴管扩散到区域淋巴结。确定最靠近原发肿瘤部位（扁桃体）的淋巴结，以确定最初转移最有可能的位置。"
