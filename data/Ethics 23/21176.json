  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Patients who belong to ethnic minority groups experience significant health disparities in pain management. For example, Black and Hispanic patients are more likely to be undertreated for pain compared to nonminority patients. Disparities may arise from physician bias (eg, stereotyping) and suboptimal communication (eg, language barriers, incomplete pain assessment). A patient's cultural and social background can influence pain-related beliefs and behavior. Some patients value STOICISM (eg, as a \"test of faith\") or emphasize respect toward healthcare workers (eg, avoid burdening providers by expressing discomfort). This patient has declined medication despite visible indications (eg, grimacing) and verbal confirmation of pain. The next best step is to nonjudgmentally explore the factors influencing the patient's decision, which reflects cross-cultural and patient-centered care. Objectives for discussion include:\n\n*   Clarifying the shared goal of patient well-being, which can address potential misconceptions that requesting pain medication burdens the physician\n*   Exploring the patient's preferences for increasing comfort, which may or may not include the use of medication\n\n(Choice A) Although the patient has the right to decline medication, the physician should first explore the reasoning behind his decision, which can clarify misunderstandings (eg, burdening the physician) and promote shared decision-making to improve his comfort.\n\n(Choice B) The patient's desire to avoid being a burden may reflect deference toward the physician rather than underlying depression. Exploration of the patient's emotional state is better achieved through an open-ended discussion of the values important to his comfort and well-being.\n\n(Choice C) This statement is physician centered; it focuses on the physician's perception of the patient's comfort. It also assumes that \"feeling better\" involves the use of medication and may be perceived as judgmental.\n\n(Choice E) Having a palliative care provider speak with the patient may ultimately be appropriate, but the physician should first attempt to explore the patient's values surrounding comfort and goals of pain management.\n\nEducational objective:\nEthnic minorities are more likely to be undertreated for pain, potentially due to physician bias or suboptimal communication. Cross-cultural care can promote optimal pain management by establishing the shared goal of patient well-being. This can be facilitated by exploring the cultural values (eg, stoicism, deference) that influence patient perceptions of pain and comfort.",
    "zh": "属于少数族裔群体的患者在疼痛管理方面会经历显著的健康差异。例如，与非少数族裔患者相比，黑人和西班牙裔患者更有可能因疼痛而未得到充分治疗。差异可能源于医生的偏见（例如，刻板印象）和不理想的沟通（例如，语言障碍、不完整的疼痛评估）。患者的文化和社会背景会影响与疼痛相关的信念和行为。一些患者重视坚忍（例如，作为“信仰的考验”）或强调对医护人员的尊重（例如，通过不表达不适来避免给医生带来负担）。尽管有明显的迹象（例如，皱眉）和口头确认疼痛，但这位患者拒绝了药物治疗。下一步是客观地探讨影响患者决定的因素，这反映了跨文化和以患者为中心的护理。讨论的目标包括：\n\n* 阐明患者福祉的共同目标，这可以解决要求止痛药会给医生带来负担的潜在误解\n* 探索患者增加舒适度的偏好，这可能包括也可能不包括药物的使用\n\n（选项 A）尽管患者有权拒绝药物治疗，但医生应该首先探讨他做出决定的原因，这可以澄清误解（例如，给医生带来负担）并促进共同决策，以改善他的舒适度。\n\n（选项 B）患者希望避免成为负担可能反映了对医生的尊重，而不是潜在的抑郁症。通过对对他舒适度和福祉重要的价值观进行开放式讨论，可以更好地探索患者的情绪状态。\n\n（选项 C）此声明是以医生为中心的；它侧重于医生对患者舒适度的看法。它还假定“感觉更好”涉及使用药物，并且可能被认为是带有评判性的。\n\n（选项 E）让姑息治疗提供者与患者交谈最终可能是合适的，但医生应该首先尝试探索患者对舒适度和疼痛管理目标的价值观。\n\n教育目标：\n少数族裔更有可能因疼痛而未得到充分治疗，这可能归因于医生的偏见或不理想的沟通。跨文化护理可以通过建立患者福祉的共同目标来促进最佳的疼痛管理。这可以通过探索影响患者对疼痛和舒适感认知的文化价值观（例如，坚忍、尊重）来实现。"
