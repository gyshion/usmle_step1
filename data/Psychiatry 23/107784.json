    "en": "A 17-year-old, previously healthy boy is brought to the office by his mother due to heartburn. He describes an intermittent burning sensation behind his chest that has developed over the past several months. The patient has taken over-the-counter medications without relief. His mother notes that he has been losing weight. There is no history of dysphagia, abdominal pain, melena, or hematochezia. The patient was made a starter on the high school soccer team about a year ago, and his mother adds that he does not want to miss any workouts. Blood pressure is 106/64 mm Hg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 18/min. Age-adjusted BMI is 17 kg/m². The patient has a thin build. Oropharyngeal examination reveals mild pharyngeal hyperemia and dental erosions over the lingual surface. The abdomen is soft and nontender.",

    "en": "This adolescent athlete has treatment-refractory heartburn, weight loss, and tooth decay, likely due to self-induced vomiting (ie, purging). Purging may be used as a maladaptive behavioral response to reduce body weight (ie, anorexia nervosa), particularly in environments that emphasize lean physiques (eg, aerobic sports).\n\nDuring vomiting, gastric acid expelled from the stomach irritates the esophagus (eg, retrosternal chest pain perceived as heartburn), larynx (eg, dysphonia), and the oropharynx (eg, dental erosions). Vomiting stimulates salivary production to help protect this tissue damage; over time, repeated vomiting causes physiologic salivary gland hypertrophy.\n\nPatients with significantly low body weight also develop changes in the gastrointestinal tract to optimize nutrient extraction:\n\n*   Gastric emptying is reduced, increasing digestion and maximizing nutrient availability from food. This may manifest as postprandial bloating and early satiety (Choice A).\n*   Liver cells undergo autophagy and apoptosis in order to recycle and conserve limited nutrient resources. This may be observed as a mildly elevated transaminase level.\n*   Intestinal motility is decreased, increasing time for nutrients to be absorbed from digested food. This may manifest as constipation.\n\n(Choice B) Absence of esophageal peristalsis characterizes achalasia, which results from degeneration of the myenteric plexus. Patients can present with heartburn and significant weight loss. However, patients also typically have progressive difficulty swallowing solids and liquids and regurgitation of undigested food.\n\n(Choice C) Symptoms of celiac disease result from inflammatory damage to the colonic mucosa (ie, blunting of intestinal villi), causing malabsorption (eg, abdominal discomfort, greasy stools, weight loss). However, this patient's presentation (ie, athlete with heartburn/dental erosions) strongly suggest weight loss related to purging.\n\n(Choice E) When patients with anorexia begin nutritional rehabilitation, fatty infiltration of the liver may be observed as it begins to store large amounts of energy as fat.\n\nEducational objective:\nSelf-induced vomiting (ie, purging) damages the upper gastrointestinal tract (eg, heartburn, dental erosions) and results in compensatory physiologic responses (eg, salivary gland hypertrophy). Patients with significantly low body weight also develop changes in the gastrointestinal tract to optimize nutrient extraction and availability (eg, decreased gastric emptying and intestinal motility).",
    "zh": "这位青少年运动员患有难治性烧心、体重减轻和牙齿腐烂，这很可能是由于自我诱导呕吐（即，清除）。清除可能被用作一种适应不良的行为反应以减轻体重（即，神经性厌食症），尤其是在强调瘦体质的环境中（例如，有氧运动）。\n\n在呕吐期间，从胃中排出的胃酸会刺激食管（例如，胸骨后疼痛被认为是烧心）、喉部（例如，发声障碍）和口咽部（例如，牙齿侵蚀）。 呕吐会刺激唾液的产生，以帮助保护这种组织损伤； 随着时间的推移，反复呕吐会导致生理性唾液腺肥大。\n\n体重显着偏低的患者也会出现胃肠道的改变，以优化营养提取：\n\n*   胃排空减少，增加消化并最大限度地提高食物中的营养物质的利用率。这可能表现为餐后腹胀和早期饱腹感（选项 A）。\n*   肝细胞经历自噬和凋亡，以回收和保存有限的营养资源。这可能被观察为轻度升高的转氨酶水平。\n*   肠蠕动减弱，增加了从消化食物中吸收营养物质的时间。这可能表现为便秘。\n\n（选项 B）食管蠕动缺失是失弛缓症的特征，该病是由于肌间神经丛变性引起的。患者可出现烧心和显着体重减轻。 然而，患者通常也会逐渐出现吞咽固体和液体困难以及未消化食物的反流。\n\n（选项 C）乳糜泻的症状是由于结肠黏膜的炎症损伤（即，肠绒毛变钝），导致吸收不良（例如，腹部不适、油腻粪便、体重减轻）。 然而，该患者的表现（即，患有烧心/牙齿侵蚀的运动员）强烈提示与清除相关的体重减轻。\n\n（选项 E）当厌食症患者开始营养康复时，可能会观察到肝脏脂肪浸润，因为它开始以脂肪的形式储存大量能量。\n\n教育目标：\n自我诱导呕吐（即，清除）会损害上消化道（例如，烧心、牙齿侵蚀）并导致代偿性生理反应（例如，唾液腺肥大）。体重显着偏低的患者也会出现胃肠道的改变，以优化营养提取和利用（例如，胃排空和肠蠕动减少）。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the gastrointestinal and systemic complications associated with self-induced vomiting (purging) in an adolescent athlete, particularly the physiological adaptations to low body weight and nutrient conservation.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the signs and symptoms suggestive of purging (heartburn, weight loss, dental erosions) and then correlating these with the known physiological consequences of chronic vomiting and malnutrition on the gastrointestinal tract, specifically focusing on changes in motility and nutrient absorption.",
