    "en": "A 40-year-old man comes to the emergency department 30 minutes after experiencing a seizure. Over the past 3 months, the patient has had several episodes of brief twitching of the right hand, but today the abnormal movement gradually progressed to involve the entire right upper extremity, followed by shaking of the whole body for about a minute. He also lost consciousness and urinated involuntarily during the event. {{exhibit_1}} The patient feels groggy and has a mild headache. He has no other medical conditions but reports several concussions from playing football in college. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows mild weakness of right hand grip but is otherwise normal. This patient's seizure presentation is most suggestive of which of the following etiologic processes?",

    "en": "This patient with prior episodes of isolated hand twitching (characteristic of focal aware seizures) now experienced a focal-onset seizure that progressed to a bilateral tonic-clonic seizure (previously secondarily generalized seizure) with loss of consciousness and involuntary urination. Focal-onset seizures are caused by a regional area of hypersynchronized excitatory neuronal activity that originates in a single hemisphere (in contrast to generalized-onset seizures, which originate globally throughout the cerebral cortex) and are subcategorized by level of consciousness during the event: Focal aware seizures (formerly simple partial seizures): Patients remain aware and interactive. Symptoms correspond to the area of brain involvement; for example, twitching/jerking of the face or limb (motor cortex of frontal lobe), paresthesia (somatosensory cortex of parietal lobe), auditory/olfactory hallucinations (temporal lobe), or visual hallucinations (occipital lobe). Focal impaired awareness seizures (formerly complex partial seizures): Patients appear awake but do not interact appropriately with their environment (eg, blank stare). They frequently engage in repetitive, stereotyped actions known as automatisms (eg, lip smacking, hand wringing, repeating words). The most common underlying cause of focal-onset seizures is a focal structural brain abnormality (eg, cerebral neoplasms, stroke, hippocampal sclerosis). These seizures can remain localized or generalize to involve both hemispheres (focal to bilateral tonic-clonic) and are frequently associated with postictal focal neurologic deficits (eg, this patient's right hand weakness). (Choices A, D, and E) Diffuse cerebral hypoperfusion, neuroexcitatory substance use, and neuronal metabolic disturbances (except hyperglycemia, which can cause focal seizures) all affect the brain globally and therefore are more likely to present as a generalized seizure rather than a focal seizure. Generalized seizures are characterized by widespread and rapid propagation of neuronal hyperexcitability without the initial localizing symptoms of a focal abnormality. (Choice C) Genetic epilepsy syndromes can have either focal seizures (eg, benign focal epilepsy of infancy) or generalized seizures (eg, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome), but these conditions typically present in childhood and persist into adulthood. Educational objective: Focal-onset seizures most commonly occur due to a focal structural abnormality (eg, stroke, neoplasm) that causes a region of hyperexcitable neuronal activity in one cerebral hemisphere. These seizures begin with localized symptomatology (eg, muscle twitching, paresthesia) and are classified according to level of consciousness (eg, aware, impaired awareness). They can progress to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures if the excitatory neuronal activity spreads to involve both cerebral hemispheres.",
    "zh": "这位患者之前曾出现过孤立的右手抽搐发作（是局灶性清醒发作的特征），现在经历了局灶起病性癫痫发作，并进展为双侧强直-阵挛性发作（以前称为继发性全身性发作），伴有意识丧失和不自主排尿。局灶起病性癫痫发作是由在单个半球起源的超同步兴奋性神经元活动区域引起的（与起源于整个大脑皮层的全身起病性发作相反），并根据发作期间的意识水平进行细分：局灶清醒发作（以前称为简单部分性发作）：患者保持清醒并具有互动性。症状与大脑受累区域相对应；例如，面部或肢体抽搐/抽动（额叶运动皮质）、感觉异常（顶叶感觉皮质）、听觉/嗅觉幻觉（颞叶）或视觉幻觉（枕叶）。局灶性意识障碍性发作（以前称为复杂部分性发作）：患者看起来是清醒的，但与周围环境的互动不当（例如，茫然的凝视）。他们经常进行重复的、刻板的动作，称为自动症（例如，咂嘴、搓手、重复单词）。局灶起病性癫痫发作最常见的根本原因是局灶性脑结构异常（例如，脑肿瘤、中风、海马硬化）。这些癫痫发作可以保持局部，或泛化到累及两个半球（局灶性转为双侧强直-阵挛性发作），并且常伴有发作后局灶性神经功能缺损（例如，该患者的右手无力）。（选项A、D和E）弥漫性脑低灌注、神经兴奋性物质使用和神经元代谢紊乱（高血糖除外，高血糖可引起局灶性癫痫发作）都会影响整个大脑，因此更容易表现为全身性癫痫发作，而不是局灶性癫痫发作。全身性癫痫发作的特征是神经元过度兴奋的广泛而快速的传播，而没有局灶性异常的初始定位症状。（选项C）遗传性癫痫综合征既可出现局灶性癫痫发作（例如，婴儿良性局灶性癫痫），也可出现全身性癫痫发作（例如，Lennox-Gastaut综合征），但这些情况通常发生在儿童时期并持续到成年。教育目标：局灶起病性癫痫发作最常见的原因是局灶性结构异常（例如，中风、肿瘤），导致一个大脑半球出现过度兴奋的神经元活动区域。这些癫痫发作始于局部症状（例如，肌肉抽搐、感觉异常），并根据意识水平进行分类（例如，清醒、意识障碍）。如果兴奋性神经元活动扩散到累及两个大脑半球，它们可能会进展为双侧强直-阵挛性癫痫发作。"
