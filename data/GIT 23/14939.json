    "en": "A 54-year-old man comes to the office for evaluation of chronic diarrhea and weight loss. He has had bulky, foul-smelling stools for the past 8 months, which usually occur shortly after eating. There have been no nocturnal bowel movements, and he denies fecal incontinence. The patient also experiences dull, epigastric abdominal pain that is exacerbated by eating and unrelieved by antacids. He drinks 6 or 7 beers a day but denies tobacco or illicit drug use. Vital signs are within normal limits. The abdomen is tender to palpation in the epigastrium without distension, rebound, or guarding. Sudan staining of a fecal specimen is positive, and fecal occult blood testing is negative. Blood testing reveals normal hemoglobin.",
    "zh": "一名54岁男性前来就诊，评估慢性腹泻和体重减轻。过去8个月来，他一直有大便量多、恶臭的粪便，通常在餐后不久发生。没有夜间排便，且否认大便失禁。患者还经历钝痛、剑突下腹痛，进食后加重，并且无法通过抗酸药缓解。他每天喝6到7杯啤酒，但否认吸烟或使用违禁药物。生命体征在正常范围内。腹部剑突下触诊有压痛，无膨胀、反跳痛或腹肌紧张。粪便标本的苏丹染色呈阳性，粪便隐血试验呈阴性。血液检测显示血红蛋白正常。"

    "en": "This patient with a history of alcohol use disorder who has chronic epigastric pain, weight loss, and steatorrhea (ie, bulky, fatty stools) likely has CHRONIC PANCREATITIS, a progressive inflammatory disease that ultimately leads to pancreatic fibrosis. Major risk factors include ALCOHOL ABUSE, recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis, and smoking.\n\nPatients classically have EPIGASTRIC PAIN that worsens with meals; pain is initially intermittent but may become constant in advanced disease. Other signs and symptoms of chronic pancreatitis are due to the following pathophysiologic changes:\n\n*   Endocrine insufficiency: Destruction of islet cells results in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n*   Exocrine insufficiency: Destruction of acinar cells results in lipase, elastase, amylase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin deficiency. This results in protein and fat malabsorption with WEIGHT LOSS, STEATORRHEA, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies.\n\nElastase is derived from a zymogen produced by pancreatic acinar cells and activated by trypsin in the duodenum; levels correlate with pancreatic exocrine activity. Therefore, low fecal elastase can help diagnose PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY and supports a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. Other useful tests include Sudan staining (which identifies fecal fat) and hemoglobin A1c (which diagnoses diabetes mellitus).\n\n(Choice A) Bile acid synthesis, which occurs in the liver, is not affected by chronic pancreatitis. Bile acids are necessary for proper biliary flow; therefore, bile acid synthesis disorders usually present with cholestasis, jaundice, and hepatic failure in neonates.\n\n(Choice C) Autoimmune gastritis occurs due to autoantibodies directed at parietal cells and intrinsic factor, resulting in reduced intrinsic factor production. Although patients may have postprandial abdominal pain, they also typically have macrocytic anemia (due to vitamin B12 deficiency). Steatorrhea (due to fat malabsorption) is unexpected.\n\n(Choice D) The pancreas normally produces a bicarbonate-rich fluid that neutralizes stomach acid. Chronic pancreatitis results in progressive pancreatic destruction, leading to decreased pancreatic bicarbonate production.\n\n(Choice E) Villous atrophy of the small bowel is characteristic of celiac disease. Although patients can have steatorrhea and abdominal pain, celiac disease also usually causes iron deficiency anemia. In addition, chronic pancreatitis is more likely in this patient with heavy alcohol use.",
    "zh": "该患者有酒精使用障碍病史，并伴有慢性剑突下疼痛、体重减轻和脂肪泻（即，粪便量多、含脂肪），很可能患有慢性胰腺炎，这是一种进行性炎症性疾病，最终导致胰腺纤维化。主要危险因素包括酒精滥用、反复发作的急性胰腺炎和吸烟。\n\n患者通常表现为进食后加重的剑突下疼痛；疼痛最初为间歇性，但在晚期疾病中可能变为持续性。慢性胰腺炎的其他体征和症状是由于以下病理生理学改变造成的：\n\n*   内分泌功能不全：胰岛细胞破坏导致胰岛素依赖型糖尿病。\n*   外分泌功能不全：腺泡细胞破坏导致脂肪酶、弹性蛋白酶、淀粉酶、胰蛋白酶和胰凝乳蛋白酶缺乏。这导致蛋白质和脂肪吸收不良，伴有体重减轻、脂肪泻和脂溶性维生素缺乏。\n\n弹性蛋白酶来源于胰腺腺泡细胞产生的酶原，并在十二指肠中被胰蛋白酶激活；其水平与胰腺外分泌活性相关。因此，粪便弹性蛋白酶降低有助于诊断胰腺功能不全，并支持慢性胰腺炎的诊断。其他有用的检查包括苏丹染色（用于识别粪便脂肪）和糖化血红蛋白A1c（用于诊断糖尿病）。\n\n（选项A）胆汁酸合成发生在肝脏中，不受慢性胰腺炎的影响。胆汁酸对于正常的胆汁流动是必需的；因此，胆汁酸合成障碍通常表现为胆汁淤积、黄疸和新生儿肝衰竭。\n\n（选项C）自身免疫性胃炎是由于针对壁细胞和内因子的自身抗体引起的，导致内因子产生减少。尽管患者可能出现餐后腹痛，但他们通常也会出现巨幼细胞性贫血（由于维生素B12缺乏）。脂肪泻（由于脂肪吸收不良）是意料之外的。\n\n（选项D）胰腺通常产生富含碳酸氢盐的液体，可中和胃酸。慢性胰腺炎导致进行性胰腺破坏，从而导致胰腺重碳酸盐产生减少。\n\n（选项E）小肠绒毛萎缩是乳糜泻的特征。尽管患者可能出现脂肪泻和腹痛，但乳糜泻通常也会引起缺铁性贫血。此外，对于有大量饮酒史的患者，慢性胰腺炎的可能性更大。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of chronic pancreatitis, its etiology, clinical presentation, and the underlying pathophysiology of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. It also tests the ability to differentiate chronic pancreatitis from other conditions presenting with similar symptoms such as celiac disease or autoimmune gastritis.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of chronic pancreatitis (alcohol abuse, epigastric pain worsened by eating, steatorrhea, weight loss). Understand that chronic pancreatitis leads to exocrine insufficiency, resulting in decreased levels of pancreatic enzymes like elastase.",
