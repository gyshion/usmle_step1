The patient has difficulty getting out of bed in the mornings and staying focused at work. He has no medical conditions and takes no medications. The patient drinks 3 or 4 beers daily and more on weekends. The physician provides education about the link between alcohol and mood changes. The patient responds, \"But it really helps me to unwind and relax after a long workday and makes it easier to fall asleep. It's also how I hang out with my friends on weekends. I can't see quitting.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate statement by the physician at this time?",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient believes that alcohol plays a beneficial role in his life (helping with relaxation, sleep, and socialization) and explicitly states that he does not want to quit. Motivational interviewing is a patient-centered approach to help change maladaptive behaviors; it matches strategies to the patient's stage of readiness to make a change. The goal is to develop the patient's own intrinsic motivation to change, rather than using pressure to motivate change.\n\nThis patient should be educated about the link between mood and alcohol to help him see the discrepancy between continued alcohol use and his goal of not being depressed. However, direct confrontation of his resistance to change (eg, advising the patient not to drink, dwelling on adverse consequences of alcohol use) is likely to make him feel misunderstood, attacked, or criticized and may lead to conflict or defensiveness. It is more productive to acknowledge the patient's resistance to change as a starting point. This involves reflecting the patient's view that alcohol helps him relax and then encouraging discussion of any downsides to drinking from his perspective. In this way, the patient is encouraged to identify ambivalent feelings about drinking that can help him begin to make his own arguments for change.\n\n(Choice A) This statement focuses on the negative aspects of alcohol use and insists that it be addressed, which may lead to defensiveness rather than change. Instead, the patient's resistance should be respected, and his internal motivation encouraged.\n\n(Choice B) Although this response initially acknowledges the patient's perspective, it then makes an assumption that may be experienced as judgmental. It would be better to encourage an open-ended discussion about how the patient himself understands his alcohol use.\n\n(Choice D) This approach prematurely focuses on alternative behaviors without first developing the patient's ambivalence about drinking and intrinsic motivation to make a change. The patient should be encouraged to come up with possible alternative behaviors himself rather than forcing suggestions on him.\n\n(Choice E) Although this statement accurately reflects the patient's current lack of readiness to make a change, it does not encourage discussion and prematurely terminates any efforts to facilitate change.\n\nEducational objective:\nMotivational interviewing is a patient-centered approach to help change maladaptive behaviors; it matches strategies to the patient's stage of readiness to make a change. This includes acknowledging the patient's resistance and developing the patient's own motivation to change.",
    "zh": "该患者认为酒精在他的生活中起着有益的作用（有助于放松、睡眠和社交），并明确表示他不想戒酒。动机性访谈是一种以患者为中心的方法，旨在帮助改变适应不良的行为；它将策略与患者准备改变的阶段相匹配。目标是培养患者自身的内在改变动机，而不是使用压力来激发改变。\n\n应该对该患者进行关于情绪和酒精之间关系的教育，以帮助他看到持续饮酒与他不抑郁的目标之间的差异。然而，直接对抗他对改变的抵抗（例如，建议患者不要喝酒，反复强调饮酒的负面后果）可能会让他感到被误解、被攻击或被批评，并可能导致冲突或防御。更有效的方法是承认患者对改变的抵抗是起点。这包括反映患者认为酒精有助于他放松的观点，然后鼓励从他的角度讨论饮酒的任何不利之处。通过这种方式，鼓励患者识别对饮酒的矛盾情绪，这可以帮助他开始为自己的改变提出论据。\n\n（选项 A）这种说法侧重于饮酒的负面影响，并坚持要解决这个问题，这可能会导致防御而不是改变。相反，应该尊重患者的抵抗，并鼓励他的内在动机。\n\n（选项 B）虽然这种回应最初承认了患者的观点，但随后做出了可能被认为是评判的假设。最好鼓励就患者自己如何理解他的饮酒进行开放式讨论。\n\n（选项 D）这种方法过早地侧重于替代行为，而没有首先培养患者对饮酒的矛盾心理和内在改变动机。应该鼓励患者自己提出可能的替代行为，而不是强加建议给他。\n\n（选项 E）虽然这种说法准确地反映了患者目前尚未准备好做出改变，但它并没有鼓励讨论，并过早地终止了任何促进改变的努力。\n\n教育目标：\n动机性访谈是一种以患者为中心的方法，旨在帮助改变适应不良的行为；它将策略与患者准备改变的阶段相匹配。这包括承认患者的抵抗并培养患者自身的改变动机。"
