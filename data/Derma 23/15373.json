    "en": "A 24-year-old woman comes to the office due to worsening acne. Over the past 3 months, the patient has had frequent breakouts on the shoulders and upper back. She had acne on her face during puberty, which cleared spontaneously after several years, but has never before had symptoms on her trunk. The patient has no other medical conditions, and her only medication is a combination oral contraceptive. She has been training for a half-marathon for the past 4 months and has lost 6.8 kg (15 lb) during this period. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs, and she relocated from California to Wisconsin for work a year ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows acneiform eruptions on the shoulders and mid-back.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Acne vulgaris is a disorder of the pilosebaceous follicle. Hyperkeratinization and obstruction of the follicle in combination with glandular enlargement and increased sebum production provides an optimal environment for *Cutibacterium (Propionibacterium) acnes*. This organism metabolizes sebaceous lipids, releasing inflammatory factors that lead to follicular and perifollicular inflammation. Acne is most common in areas with a high concentration of sebaceous follicles, including the face, back, chest, and upper arms.\n\nAndrogens stimulate production of sebum, and increased androgen levels (eg, puberty, polycystic ovary syndrome) increase the incidence of acne. Obstruction of the glands, such as by oil-based hair products (pomade acne), also promotes acne. In addition, mechanical irritation can promote acne by increasing glandular occlusion and disruption of follicles (acne mechanica). Sports participation, as in this patient, frequently triggers acne due to the use of tight-fitting clothing (eg, sports bras) and protective gear (eg, helmets).\n\n(Choice A) High ambient temperatures can worsen acne, leading to formation of painful nodules on the trunk (tropical acne). Colder temperatures are not associated with acne.\n\n(Choice B) Exposure to water contaminated with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* can cause erythematous papules and pustules around hair follicles (hot-tub folliculitis). This condition begins acutely, resolves spontaneously within 1-2 weeks, and typically involves the skin under a bathing suit (eg, buttocks) or on the extremities.\n\n(Choice C) Obesity is associated with an increased risk of acne, but weight loss generally does not worsen acne.\n\n(Choice D) Typical oral contraceptives do not promote acne. Rather, many commonly used contraceptives can reduce acne due to decreased synthesis of androgens.",
    "zh": "寻常痤疮是毛脂腺毛囊的疾病。毛囊过度角化和阻塞，加上腺体增大和皮脂分泌增加，为痤疮丙酸杆菌（*Cutibacterium (Propionibacterium) acnes*）提供了最佳环境。这种生物体代谢皮脂，释放炎症因子，导致毛囊和毛囊周围炎症。痤疮最常见于皮脂腺毛囊高度集中的区域，包括面部、背部、胸部和上臂。\n\n雄激素刺激皮脂的产生，雄激素水平升高（例如，青春期、多囊卵巢综合征）会增加痤疮的发生率。腺体阻塞，例如由油性美发产品（发油痤疮）引起，也会促进痤疮。此外，机械刺激可以通过增加腺体闭塞和毛囊破坏来促进痤疮（机械性痤疮）。正如该患者一样，体育锻炼通常会因使用紧身衣（例如，运动文胸）和防护装备（例如，头盔）而引发痤疮。\n\n（选项A）高温会使痤疮恶化，导致躯干上形成疼痛性结节（热带痤疮）。低温与痤疮无关。\n\n（选项B）接触受*铜绿假单胞菌（Pseudomonas aeruginosa）*污染的水会导致毛囊周围出现红斑性丘疹和脓疱（热水浴缸毛囊炎）。这种情况急性发作，在1-2周内自发缓解，通常涉及泳衣下的皮肤（例如，臀部）或四肢。\n\n（选项C）肥胖与痤疮风险增加相关，但体重减轻通常不会使痤疮恶化。\n\n（选项D）典型的口服避孕药不会促进痤疮。相反，许多常用的避孕药可以由于雄激素合成减少而减少痤疮。"
