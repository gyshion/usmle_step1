This mutation prevents the receptor from binding leptin and initiating its normal signaling cascade. The knockout mice are allowed to feed at will, and their body mass index (BMI) and serum leptin levels are measured and compared with control mice. On the graph below, area C represents the normal relationship between BMI and leptin in a control mouse. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "Leptin is a protein hormone that plays an important role in regulating appetite and metabolism. It is produced primarily in adipocytes, and large fat cells produce more leptin than small ones. Serum leptin concentrations are highly correlated with body fat content.\n\nLeptin decreases food intake in the following important ways:\n\n1.  Leptin decreases the production of neuropeptide Y, a potent appetite stimulant, in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.\n2.  Leptin stimulates the production of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the arcuate nucleus. Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) is produced by cleavage of POMC and inhibits food intake.\n\nThe knockout mouse described is homozygous for a mutation in the gene encoding the leptin receptor (db/db), resulting in ineffective leptin signaling. As a result, these mice become hyperphagic and profoundly obese. As leptin production is normal in these mice, leptin levels are elevated due to the increased lipocyte mass. In contrast, mice that are homozygous for a mutation resulting in impaired leptin production (ob/ob) also become hyperphagic and profoundly obese, but their leptin levels are low (Choice A).\n\nHuman obesity resulting from mutations in the leptin receptor and the leptin gene has been described. However, most obese individuals do not have either of these mutations. Instead, it is thought that the sustained elevation in leptin levels from the enlarged fat stores results in leptin desensitization. Thus, obese individuals become resistant to the effects of leptin in a manner similar to the development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes.\n\n(Choice D) Low leptin and low BMI correlate with low adipocyte stores and may be seen after prolonged starvation.\n\n(Choice E) With intact receptor signaling, elevated leptin levels (ie, from exogenous leptin administration) would result in weight loss.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nLeptin is a protein hormone produced by adipocytes in proportion to the quantity of fat stored. Leptin acts on the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus to inhibit production of neuropeptide Y (decreasing appetite) and stimulate production of alpha-MSH (increasing satiety). Mutations in the leptin gene or receptor result in hyperphagia and profound obesity.",
    "zh": "瘦素是一种蛋白质激素，在调节食欲和代谢中起重要作用。它主要在脂肪细胞中产生，大脂肪细胞产生的瘦素比小脂肪细胞多。血清瘦素浓度与体内脂肪含量高度相关。\n\n瘦素通过以下重要方式减少食物摄入：\n\n1. 瘦素减少下丘脑弓形核中神经肽 Y（一种强效食欲刺激剂）的产生。\n2. 瘦素刺激弓形核中阿片黑皮质素 (POMC) 的产生。 α-促黑素细胞刺激素 (alpha-MSH) 由 POMC 的切割产生，并抑制食物摄入。\n\n所描述的基因敲除小鼠是编码瘦素受体 (db/db) 的基因的纯合突变体，导致瘦素信号传导无效。因此，这些小鼠变得过度饮食且严重肥胖。由于这些小鼠的瘦素产生是正常的，因此由于脂肪细胞质量增加，瘦素水平升高。相比之下，纯合突变导致瘦素产生受损（ob/ob）的小鼠也会变得过度饮食且严重肥胖，但它们的瘦素水平较低（选项 A）。\n\n已经描述了由瘦素受体和瘦素基因突变引起的人类肥胖。然而，大多数肥胖个体并没有这两种突变。相反，人们认为来自扩大的脂肪储存的瘦素水平持续升高会导致瘦素脱敏。因此，肥胖个体对瘦素的影响变得耐受，其方式类似于 2 型糖尿病中胰岛素抵抗的发展。\n\n（选项 D）低瘦素和低 BMI 与低脂肪细胞储存相关，并且可能在长时间饥饿后出现。\n\n（选项 E）在受体信号传导完整的情况下，瘦素水平升高（即，来自外源性瘦素的给药）将导致体重减轻。\n\n教育目标：\n\n瘦素是一种由脂肪细胞产生的蛋白质激素，其量与储存的脂肪量成正比。瘦素作用于下丘脑的弓形核，抑制神经肽 Y 的产生（降低食欲）并刺激 alpha-MSH 的产生（增加饱腹感）。瘦素基因或受体的突变导致过度饮食和严重肥胖。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of leptin's role in appetite regulation and the consequences of leptin receptor mutations on body mass index (BMI) and serum leptin levels. It requires knowledge of how leptin signaling affects food intake and energy balance.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the impact of a non-functional leptin receptor on leptin signaling. In the absence of functional receptors, leptin levels will be high due to increased fat mass, but the signal will not be transduced, leading to hyperphagia and obesity.",
