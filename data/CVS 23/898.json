    "en": "A 24-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to the sudden onset of palpitations. The patient says it feels like \"my heart is racing.\" He had an episode similar to this a year ago that resolved spontaneously. Blood pressure is 126/74 mm Hg and pulse is 164/min. Rapid intravenous administration of a medication to this patient results in instantaneous resolution of the arrhythmia but is accompanied by short-lived flushing, burning in the chest, and shortness of breath.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient is exhibiting symptoms consistent with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). As the name implies, PSVT comes on suddenly and the focus of automaticity lies above the ventricles (ie, atria or atrioventricular node). When due to development of a reentrant circuit, the tachyarrhythmia may be terminated by the administration of adenosine.\n\nAdenosine is a coronary arteriole vasodilator, but it also affects cardiac conduction. As an anti-arrhythmic, it acts by hyperpolarizing the nodal pacemaker and conducting cells to briefly block conduction through the atrioventricular node. Its effects are rapid-onset and short-lived (half-life <10 seconds); by temporarily blocking signal conduction from the atria to the ventricles, administration of the drug will often terminate the reentrant circuit and lead to conversion of PSVT to normal sinus rhythm.\n\nThe most frequent adverse effects associated with adenosine are flushing, chest burning (due to bronchospasm), hypotension, and high-grade atrioventricular block.\n\n(Choice B) Amiodarone (class III anti-arrhythmic) is one of the broadest-spectrum anti-arrhythmic drugs available, and can be used to treat both supraventricular (eg, PSVT, atrial fibrillation) and ventricular arrhythmias. It has a wide range of adverse effects, including photodermatitis, blue/gray skin discoloration, pulmonary fibrosis, liver toxicity, and hyper- or hypothyroidism.\n\n(Choice C) Digoxin slows conduction through the atrioventricular node and is useful in treating supraventricular tachycardia, especially atrial fibrillation. It causes a well-characterized toxicity in overdose; symptoms include fatigue, yellow-tinted vision, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and confusion.\n\n(Choice D) Ibutilide (class III anti-arrhythmic) is used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and flutter. Its principal adverse effect is QTc prolongation leading to torsades de pointes.\n\n(Choice E) Lidocaine (class IB anti-arrhythmic) is sometimes used for ventricular arrhythmias but has little utility for supraventricular arrhythmias. Lidocaine toxicity most commonly causes neurologic symptoms or arrhythmias.\n\n(Choice F) Verapamil (class IV anti-arrhythmic) is the most cardioselective of the calcium channel blockers, and is often used in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia. Common adverse reactions noted with verapamil are bradycardia and constipation. Because verapamil decreases cardiac contractility, it can also exacerbate systolic heart failure.\n\nEducational objective:\nAdenosine causes hyperpolarization of the nodal pacemaker to briefly block conduction through the atrioventricular node, and it is effective in the initial treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Common adverse effects include flushing, chest burning (due to bronchospasm), hypotension, and high-grade atrioventricular block.",
    "zh": "该患者表现出的症状与阵发性室上性心动过速（PSVT）一致。顾名思义，PSVT的发生很突然，自主神经的焦点位于心室上方（即，心房或房室结）。当由于折返环路的形成时，可由给予腺苷来终止快速性心律失常。\n\n腺苷是一种冠状动脉小动脉扩张剂，但它也会影响心脏传导。作为一种抗心律失常药，它通过使窦房结起搏细胞和传导细胞超极化，短暂阻断通过房室结的传导而起作用。它的作用迅速且短暂（半衰期<10秒）；通过暂时阻断从心房到心室的信号传导，给予该药物通常会终止折返环路并导致PSVT转化为正常窦性心律。\n\n与腺苷相关最常见的不良反应是潮红、胸部灼热感（由于支气管痉挛）、低血压和高度房室传导阻滞。\n\n（选项B）胺碘酮（III类抗心律失常药）是目前可用的最广谱的抗心律失常药物之一，可用于治疗室上性（例如，PSVT、房颤）和室性心律失常。它具有广泛的不良反应，包括光敏性皮炎、蓝/灰色皮肤变色、肺纤维化、肝毒性和甲状腺功能亢进或减退。\n\n（选项C）地高辛减慢通过房室结的传导，适用于治疗室上性心动过速，尤其是房颤。它在过量时会导致特征明确的毒性；症状包括疲劳、视力发黄、恶心/呕吐、腹泻和意识模糊。\n\n（选项D）伊布利特（III类抗心律失常药）用于治疗房颤和心房扑动。其主要不良反应是QTc间期延长，导致尖端扭转型室速。\n\n（选项E）利多卡因（IB类抗心律失常药）有时用于室性心律失常，但对室上性心律失常作用甚微。利多卡因毒性最常见的表现为神经系统症状或心律失常。\n\n（选项F）维拉帕米（IV类抗心律失常药）是最具心脏选择性的钙通道阻滞剂，常用于治疗室上性心动过速。维拉帕米的常见不良反应是心动过缓和便秘。由于维拉帕米降低心肌收缩力，它也可能加剧收缩性心力衰竭。\n\n教育目标：\n腺苷导致窦房结起搏细胞超极化，短暂阻断通过房室结的传导，并且在阵发性室上性心动过速的初始治疗中有效。常见的不良反应包括潮红、胸部灼热感（由于支气管痉挛）、低血压和高度房室传导阻滞。"
