  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is D. Assessment of suicide risk requires detailed questioning to determine the presence of suicidal thoughts and plans. Suicidal thoughts can be differentiated as passive (wish to be dead or not wake up) versus active suicidal ideation (actual thoughts of killing oneself). Patients who have active suicidal ideation should be further questioned about whether they have thought about specific methods of killing themselves and whether they have made any preparations and plans for suicide. Finally, the strength of the patient's intention to carry out the suicide plan should be assessed.\n\nAlthough this patient has several risk factors, it is her recent preparation for suicide (ie, collecting old medication with a plan of taking an overdose) that is the most concerning. Patients with active suicidal ideation and intent who have made preparations to carry out a specific method of suicide are at highest risk. Hospitalization may be necessary to ensure their safety.\n\n(Choices A and F) This patient's other risk factors for suicide include her family history of suicide (considered a static risk factor) and recurrent episodes of major depressive disorder. They are not as important as her recent active suicidal ideation associated with a specific method and preparatory behavior.\n\n(Choices B and C) Social isolation and insomnia are common symptoms of major depression that occur in patients with and without suicidality. Although they increase the risk for suicide, they are not as critical as this patient's active suicidal ideation and preparations.\n\n(Choice E) Although suicide risk increases in patients who have lost a loved one, this is not as strong a risk factor as having active suicidal ideation with a plan.\n\nEducational objective: Patients with suicidal thoughts should be assessed for intent and plan. Patients with active suicidal ideation and intent who have made preparations to carry out a specific method of suicide are at highest risk.",
    "zh": "正确的答案是 D。评估自杀风险需要详细询问以确定是否存在自杀念头和计划。自杀念头可区分为被动（希望死去或不想醒来）与主动自杀意念（实际的杀人想法）。对于有主动自杀意念的患者，应进一步询问他们是否考虑过具体的自杀方法，以及他们是否为自杀做好了任何准备和计划。最后，应评估患者执行自杀计划的意图强度。\n\n尽管该患者有几个危险因素，但她最近为自杀所做的准备（即，收集旧药并计划过量服用）是最令人担忧的。有主动自杀意念和意图并为执行特定自杀方法做好准备的患者，风险最高。可能需要住院以确保他们的安全。\n\n（选项 A 和 F）该患者的其他自杀危险因素包括她的自杀家族史（被认为是静态危险因素）和复发性重度抑郁障碍发作。它们不如她最近与特定方法和准备行为相关的主动自杀意念那么重要。\n\n（选项 B 和 C）社交孤立和失眠是重度抑郁症的常见症状，发生在有和没有自杀倾向的患者中。尽管它们增加了自杀风险，但它们不如该患者的主动自杀意念和准备那么关键。\n\n（选项 E）虽然失去亲人的患者自杀风险增加，但这不如有计划的主动自杀意念那么强的危险因素。\n\n教育目标：对于有自杀念头的患者，应评估其意图和计划。对于有主动自杀意念和意图并已准备执行特定自杀方法的患者，风险最高。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to identify and prioritize risk factors for suicide in a patient presenting with symptoms of depression. It emphasizes the importance of assessing active suicidal ideation, method, plan, and intent over passive ideation or general risk factors.\n\nTo solve this question, one must evaluate the patient's clinical presentation for specific indicators of suicide risk. The most critical step is to differentiate between passive suicidal thoughts and active suicidal ideation, and then to assess for the presence of a specific method, preparatory behaviors, and intent to act.",
