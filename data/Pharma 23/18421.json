    "en": "An 8-year-old boy is brought to the office due to fatigue and intermittent bone pain for the past year. The patient's parents are concerned because he has stopped playing outside and mostly stays indoors watching television. On examination, height and weight are at the 5th percentile for age. The abdomen is soft and nontender with the liver palpable 4 cm below the right costal margin and the spleen palpable 8 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory results show anemia and thrombocytopenia. A bone marrow biopsy shows macrophages with wrinkled, paperlike cytoplasm due to the accumulation of glycolipids within lysosomes. The patient is prescribed enzyme replacement therapy.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside, a glycolipid component of cell membranes, within the lysosomes of macrophages, giving them the classic appearance of wrinkled tissue paper. Characteristic symptoms, such as hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and bone pain, develop as lipid-laden macrophages accumulate in the body's tissues (eg, spleen, liver, and bone).\n\nLysosomal storage diseases can be treated through the delivery of a replacement enzyme into the lysosomes of affected cells. In the case of Gaucher disease, recombinant glucocerebrosidase (eg, imiglucerase) is available to replace the deficient enzyme. Almost all human enzymes, including lysosomal enzymes, are large polypeptides (eg, proteins). Therefore, the administered medication is a PROTEIN.\n\nAlthough the oral route is often preferred for drug administration, most peptide-based drugs (eg, insulin, immunoglobulins) cannot be efficiently absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract due to the intestinal epithelial barrier and extensive proteolysis that takes place in the stomach and duodenum. As a result, large polypeptides such as glucocerebrosidase must be administered INTRAVENOUSLY to achieve adequate circulating levels.\n\nOnce in the circulation, exogenous glucocerebrosidase can enter cells by binding to MANNOSE 6-PHOSPHATE RECEPTORS. These receptors are found in the Golgi network, where they help route newly synthesized lysosomal proteins (tagged by mannose 6-phosphate residues). They are also expressed on the CELL SURFACE, where they bind free lysosomal enzymes that are accidentally secreted. Exogenous glucocerebrosidase can bind to these cell surface receptors, inducing ENDOCYTOSIS of the bound enzyme. It is then carried by endosomes to lysosomes, where it can degrade accumulated glucocerebrosides, reducing disease manifestations.\n\n(Choices C and D) Enzymes are large, polar polypeptides that are unable to effectively cross the cell membrane by passive diffusion. In contrast, steroid-based drugs are typically hydrophobic and can easily cross cell membranes by passive diffusion. However, steroidal drugs function by binding to receptors; they do not directly catalyze reactions.\n\n(Choices E, F, G, and H) Unlike in lysosomal storage diseases, enzyme replacement therapy for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is administered orally because pancreatic digestive enzymes normally function within the gastrointestinal lumen.",
    "zh": "该患者患有戈谢病，这是一种溶酶体贮积病，由葡糖脑苷脂酶缺乏引起。这种缺乏导致细胞膜的糖脂成分葡糖脑苷脂在巨噬细胞的溶酶体内积聚，使其呈现出皱纹状的纸样外观。典型症状，如肝脾肿大、全血细胞减少和骨痛，是在富含脂质的巨噬细胞在体内组织（如脾脏、肝脏和骨骼）中积聚时发生的。\n\n溶酶体贮积病可以通过将替代酶输送到受影响细胞的溶酶体中来治疗。在戈谢病的情况下，重组葡糖脑苷脂酶（例如，伊米苷酶）可用于替代缺乏的酶。几乎所有人类酶，包括溶酶体酶，都是大的多肽（例如，蛋白质）。因此，所用药物是一种蛋白质。\n\n虽然口服途径通常是药物的首选给药方式，但由于肠上皮屏障以及在胃和十二指肠中发生的广泛蛋白水解，大多数基于肽的药物（例如，胰岛素、免疫球蛋白）不能被胃肠道有效吸收。因此，像葡糖脑苷脂酶这样的大型多肽必须静脉注射，以达到足够的循环水平。\n\n一旦进入循环，外源性葡糖脑苷脂酶可以通过与甘露糖6-磷酸受体结合进入细胞。这些受体存在于高尔基网络中，它们有助于引导新合成的溶酶体蛋白（被甘露糖6-磷酸残基标记）。它们也在细胞表面表达，在那里它们结合意外分泌的游离溶酶体酶。外源性葡糖脑苷脂酶可以与这些细胞表面受体结合，诱导结合酶的内吞。然后它被内体运送到溶酶体，在那里它可以降解累积的葡糖脑苷脂，从而减轻疾病的症状。\n\n（选项C和D）酶是大的、极性的多肽，不能通过被动扩散有效地穿过细胞膜。相比之下，基于类固醇的药物通常是疏水性的，可以通过被动扩散轻松穿过细胞膜。然而，类固醇类药物通过与受体结合发挥作用；它们不直接催化反应。\n\n（选项E、F、G和H）与溶酶体贮积病不同，胰腺外分泌功能不全的酶替代疗法是通过口服给药的，因为胰腺消化酶通常在胃肠道腔内发挥作用。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of enzyme replacement therapy for lysosomal storage diseases, specifically Gaucher disease. It assesses knowledge of the nature of the replacement enzyme (protein), the appropriate route of administration (intravenous), and the mechanism of cellular uptake (endocytosis via mannose 6-phosphate receptors).\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the underlying diagnosis (Gaucher disease) and the type of therapy used (enzyme replacement). Then, recall that therapeutic enzymes are proteins, must be administered intravenously due to their size and susceptibility to digestion, and enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis.",
