    "en": "This immunosuppressed patient has febrile neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] of 0.60 × 800 = 480/mm3) and additional findings concerning for sepsis (eg, hypotension, tachycardia). With neutropenia (typically ANC <500/mm3), there is increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. The dermatologic lesions in this patient are consistent with ecthyma gangrenosum (EG), which is strongly associated with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* bacteremia.\n\nPerivascular bacterial invasion of arteries and veins in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, with subsequent release of exotoxins destructive to human tissue, leads to characteristic skin patches exhibiting necrosis and ulceration as a result of insufficient blood flow. *P aeruginosa* virulence factors that may contribute to EG include exotoxin A (protein synthesis inhibition), elastase (degrades elastin - important for blood vessel destruction), phospholipase C (degrades cellular membranes), and pyocyanin (generates reactive oxygen species).\n\nAlthough gram-negative sepsis is sometimes associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and resultant purpuric skin lesions, DIC is unlikely given the normal platelet count and coagulation times (prothrombin and activated thromboplastin times).\n\n(Choice A) *Escherichia coli* is not associated with EG. *E coli* is the most common cause of gram-negative sepsis, usually following urinary tract infections. Hemolytic uremic syndrome, sometimes seen with Shiga toxin-producing *E coli*, is classically associated with renal failure and thrombocytopenia (not seen in this patient).\n\n(Choices B and E) *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Haemophilus influenzae* are typically associated with respiratory infections and can be isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or respiratory sources. They are not associated with EG.\n\n(Choice C) *Klebsiella pneumoniae* infection is most commonly associated with necrotizing pneumonia in elderly or immunocompromised patients.\n\n(Choice F) *Streptococcus pyogenes* (Group A *Streptococcus*) frequently causes cutaneous infections (eg, impetigo, erysipelas) and necrotizing fasciitis, a rapidly progressive deep tissue infection that spreads contiguously along the muscle fascia. Necrotizing fasciitis initially appears as a single site of infection with erythema, edema, warmth, and pain out of proportion to physical findings. This progresses to purpuric discoloration, bullae formation, and sensory loss due to tissue necrosis.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nEcthyma gangrenosum is a cutaneous necrotic disease with a strong association with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* bacteremia. It occurs from perivascular invasion and release of tissue-destructive exotoxins, causing vascular destruction and insufficient blood flow to patches of skin that become edematous and subsequently necrose. *Pseudomonas* infections are common in patients who are neutropenic, are hospitalized, have burns, or have indwelling catheters. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "这位免疫抑制患者患有发热性中性粒细胞减少症（绝对中性粒细胞计数[ANC]为0.60 × 800 = 480/mm3），并且有其他与脓毒症相关的发现（例如，低血压，心动过速）。由于中性粒细胞减少症（通常ANC <500/mm3），对细菌感染的易感性增加。该患者的皮肤病变与坏疽性脓疱病（EG）一致，这与*铜绿假单胞菌*菌血症密切相关。\n\n血管周围细菌侵入真皮和皮下组织的动脉和静脉，随后释放对人体组织具有破坏性的外毒素，导致特征性皮肤斑块出现坏死和溃疡，这是由于血流不足所致。*铜绿假单胞菌*的毒力因子可能导致EG，包括外毒素A（抑制蛋白质合成），弹性蛋白酶（降解弹性蛋白 - 对血管破坏很重要），磷脂酶C（降解细胞膜）和绿脓菌素（产生活性氧）。\n\n尽管革兰氏阴性菌脓毒症有时与弥散性血管内凝血（DIC）和随之而来的紫癜性皮肤病变有关，但考虑到正常的血小板计数和凝血时间（凝血酶原时间和活化部分凝血活酶时间），DIC不太可能发生。\n\n（选项A）*大肠杆菌*与EG无关。*大肠杆菌*是革兰氏阴性菌脓毒症最常见的原因，通常继发于尿路感染。溶血性尿毒症综合征，有时可见于产志贺毒素的*大肠杆菌*，经典地与肾衰竭和血小板减少症有关（在该患者中未见）。\n\n（选项B和E）*肺炎链球菌*和*流感嗜血杆菌*通常与呼吸道感染有关，可以从血液、脑脊液或呼吸道来源中分离出来。它们与EG无关。\n\n（选项C）*肺炎克雷伯菌*感染最常见于老年或免疫功能低下患者的坏死性肺炎。\n\n（选项F）*化脓性链球菌*（A组链球菌）经常引起皮肤感染（例如，脓疱病，丹毒）和坏死性筋膜炎，这是一种快速进展的深层组织感染，沿着肌肉筋膜连续扩散。坏死性筋膜炎最初表现为单个感染部位，出现红斑、水肿、发热和疼痛，与体格检查结果不成比例。这会进展为紫癜性变色、大疱形成和由于组织坏死引起的感觉丧失。\n\n教育目标：\n\n坏疽性脓疱病是一种皮肤坏死性疾病，与*铜绿假单胞菌*菌血症密切相关。它发生于血管周围的侵袭和组织破坏性外毒素的释放，导致血管破坏和皮肤斑块血流不足，这些斑块会水肿并随后坏死。*假单胞菌*感染在患有中性粒细胞减少症、住院、烧伤或留置导管的患者中很常见。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"
