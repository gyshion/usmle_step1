    "en": "A 9-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department following a 3-minute generalized seizure. She has had a fever with a worsening headache for 3 days. The girl has no medical problems and is not taking any medications. She lives with her parents and pet cat and has traveled to Canada and {{exhibit_1}}. On physical examination, she is disoriented and has difficulty staying awake. Her speech is difficult to understand due to inappropriate word choice. She is admitted to the intensive care unit for further workup. The patient becomes unresponsive the following day and dies overnight. Autopsy reveals bilateral, hemorrhagic necrosis of the {{exhibit_2}} and {{exhibit_3}} temporal lobes. This patient's condition was most likely caused by infection with which of the following?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The autopsy findings of bilateral, hemorrhagic necrosis of the temporal lobes, combined with the clinical presentation of fever, headache, seizure, altered mental status, and aphasia, are highly suggestive of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) encephalitis. HSV-1 encephalitis is the most common cause of fatal sporadic encephalitis and results from primary oropharyngeal infection that travels via the olfactory tract or reactivation of latent virus in the trigeminal ganglion. CT, MRI, and post-mortem brain examination can reveal edema and hemorrhagic necrosis of the temporal lobe. While unilateral involvement is most common, bilateral necrosis can also occur. The patient's travel history to Canada and England is not a significant factor in differentiating between the options, as HSV can be found worldwide. Naegleria fowleri typically causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis, which has a rapid and severe course, but the autopsy findings are not as specific for temporal lobe necrosis. Enteroviruses, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae are common causes of meningitis and meningoencephalitis, but the specific pattern of temporal lobe necrosis seen in this case is more characteristic of HSV. Toxoplasma gondii can cause encephalitis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, but the clinical presentation and autopsy findings are less typical for this patient.",
    "zh": "尸检结果显示双侧颞叶出血性坏死，并结合发热、头痛、癫痫、精神状态改变和失语的临床表现，高度提示单纯疱疹病毒(HSV)脑炎。HSV-1脑炎是致命散发性脑炎最常见的原因，由原发性口咽感染经嗅束传播或三叉神经节潜伏病毒再激活引起。CT、MRI和尸检脑部检查可显示颞叶水肿和出血性坏死。虽然单侧受累最常见，但也可发生双侧坏死。患者的加拿大和英格兰旅行史在区分选项时不是一个重要因素，因为HSV可在世界范围内发现。福氏耐格里阿米巴原虫通常引起原发性阿米巴脑膜脑炎，病程进展迅速且严重，但尸检结果对颞叶坏死的特异性不强。肠道病毒、脑膜炎奈瑟菌和肺炎链球菌是脑膜炎和脑膜脑炎的常见病因，但本例中出现的特定颞叶坏死模式更具有HSV的特征。弓形虫可引起脑炎，尤其是在免疫功能低下的人群中，但这种临床表现和尸检结果对该患者而言不太典型。"
