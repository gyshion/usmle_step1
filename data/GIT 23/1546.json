    "en": "A 50-year-old man with a remote history of alcohol dependence is evaluated in the clinic for chronic diarrhea and weight loss. The patient has had bloating with daily loose stools for the past 2 years. His stool is described as greasy and malodorous. Pancreatic insufficiency is suspected despite normal abdominal imaging. The patient undergoes a test in which bicarbonate concentration is measured from duodenal aspirates as hormone A is infused intravenously. The data is plotted in the graph below {{exhibit_1}}.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Secretin is a hormone produced by intestinal S cells that increases bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas. Secretin stimulates the exocrine pancreatic ductal cells to release a high volume of bicarbonate-rich and chloride-poor fluid into the small bowel. The release of gastric acid into the duodenum is the most potent stimulus for secretin release, which begins as the duodenal pH drops below 5 and rises dramatically as the pH drops below 3. The sodium bicarbonate in the pancreatic secretions neutralizes the hydrochloric acid from the gastric contents in a reaction that produces sodium chloride and carbonic acid. Secretin has little to no effect on the secretion of enzymes from pancreatic acinar cells, which is instead under the control of cholecystokinin.\n\n(Choice B) Gastrin is the major hormone secreted by G cells of the gastric antrum. Gastrin increases parietal cell acid production and therefore increases the amount of acid delivered from the stomach to the duodenum.\n\n(Choices C and D) The endocrine pancreas is composed of glucagon-producing alpha cells, insulin-producing beta cells, and somatostatin-producing D cells. Insulin and glucagon help regulate blood glucose levels and metabolic homeostasis. Somatostatin inhibits the secretion of insulin, glucagon, gastrin, and most other gastrointestinal hormones.\n\n(Choice E) The liver parenchyma is not a significant source of circulating hormones that affect pancreatic exocrine function.\n\n(Choice F) Renal peritubular cells are responsible for producing erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow.\n\nEducational objective:\nSecretin is produced by S cells in the duodenal mucosa in response to stimulation by intraluminal acidity. Secretin stimulates the release of bicarbonate-rich secretions from the exocrine pancreas, which is the major source of acid-neutralizing bicarbonate entering the duodenum.",
    "zh": "促胰液素是由肠道S细胞产生的一种激素，可增加胰腺的碳酸氢盐分泌。促胰液素刺激外分泌胰管细胞释放大量富含碳酸氢盐和氯离子含量低的液体进入小肠。胃酸释放到十二指肠是促胰液素释放的最强刺激，当十二指肠pH值降至5以下时开始，并且随着pH值降至3以下而急剧升高。胰腺分泌物中的碳酸氢钠中和来自胃内容物的盐酸，反应生成氯化钠和碳酸。促胰液素对胰腺腺泡细胞分泌酶的影响很小甚至没有影响，酶的分泌受胆囊收缩素控制。\n\n（选项B）胃泌素是由胃窦G细胞分泌的主要激素。胃泌素增加壁细胞的酸产生，因此增加了从胃输送到十二指肠的酸量。\n\n（选项C和D）内分泌胰腺由产生胰高血糖素的α细胞、产生胰岛素的β细胞和产生生长抑素的D细胞组成。胰岛素和胰高血糖素有助于调节血糖水平和代谢稳态。生长抑素抑制胰岛素、胰高血糖素、胃泌素和大多数其他胃肠道激素的分泌。\n\n（选项E）肝实质不是影响胰腺外分泌功能的循环激素的重要来源。\n\n（选项F）肾小管周围细胞负责产生促红细胞生成素，这是一种刺激骨髓中红细胞生成的激素。\n\n教育目标：\n促胰液素由十二指肠粘膜中的S细胞产生，以响应管腔内酸度的刺激。促胰液素刺激外分泌胰腺释放富含碳酸氢盐的分泌物，这是进入十二指肠的中和酸的主要碳酸氢盐来源。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of gastrointestinal hormones and their effects on pancreatic bicarbonate secretion. Specifically, it focuses on the role of secretin, produced by duodenal S cells, in stimulating bicarbonate release from the pancreas.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the graph shows an increase in bicarbonate concentration with increasing levels of hormone A. Recall that secretin is the primary hormone responsible for stimulating bicarbonate secretion in response to duodenal acidity.",
