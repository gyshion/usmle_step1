    "en": "A 43-year-old man comes to the office due to occasional chest discomfort over the last 6 weeks. He thinks he is most likely experiencing musculoskeletal pain but is concerned due to family history of heart disease. The patient has no medical conditions and does not use tobacco. He leads an active lifestyle and exercises every day. He undergoes treadmill exercise stress testing. Baseline blood pressure is 122/75 mm Hg and pulse is 54/min. After 10 minutes of exercise, his blood pressure is 155/80 mm Hg and pulse is 150/min. He has no chest pain and ECG shows no abnormalities. Compared to pretest conditions, {{exhibit_1}} which of the following is the single most important limiting factor for left ventricular myocardial blood supply during the test?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Myocardial perfusion is provided by the right and left coronary arteries arising directly from the aortic root. In contrast to most other vascular beds in the body, left ventricular myocardial perfusion occurs mainly during diastole.  During ventricular systole, intraventricular pressure and wall stress in the left ventricle exceed the aortic perfusion pressure (eg, 120 mm Hg), preventing effective coronary perfusion. Wall tension is highest in the subendocardial region, making this area of the myocardium particularly susceptible to ischemia. Relaxation of the left ventricle during diastole decreases intraventricular pressure to about 10 mm Hg (which is much lower than aortic diastolic pressure [~80 mm Hg]), providing a driving force to allow adequate perfusion.\n\nIncreased heart rate shortens the time of ventricular relaxation (duration of diastole); therefore, the time available for maximal coronary blood flow decreases and consequently becomes the major limiting factor for coronary blood supply to the myocardium.\n\n(Choice B) During exercise, mechanisms such as flow-mediated dilation and release of vasodilators such as adenosine and nitric oxide ensure adequate coronary blood supply.\n\n(Choices A, E, and F) Left ventricular contraction force, intraventricular pressure, and ventricular wall stress all increase during exercise to provide adequate blood flow to actively contracting skeletal muscle. However, because there is already minimal left ventricular perfusion occurring during systole, the increase in these forces does not cause further limitation in left ventricular myocardial perfusion.\n\n(Choice C) Diastolic aortic pressure is the driving force for coronary blood flow during diastole, and coronary blood flow is reduced in patients with low diastolic pressures. This patient's diastolic pressures are similar while at rest and during exercise and would not contribute to decreased coronary blood supply.\n\nEducational objective: The high systolic intraventricular pressure and wall stress of the left ventricle prevent myocardial perfusion during systole; therefore, the majority of left ventricular myocardial perfusion occurs during diastole. Shorter duration of diastole is the major limiting factor for coronary blood supply to the left ventricular myocardium during periods of tachycardia (eg, exercise). {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "心肌灌注由直接源于主动脉根部的右冠状动脉和左冠状动脉提供。与体内大多数其他血管床不同，左心室心肌灌注主要发生在舒张期。在心室收缩期，左心室内的心室内压力和壁应力超过主动脉灌注压（例如，120 mm Hg），从而阻止有效的冠状动脉灌注。壁张力在心内膜下区域最高，这使得心肌的这一区域特别容易受到缺血的影响。舒张期左心室的松弛使心室内压力降低到约10 mm Hg（远低于主动脉舒张压 [~80 mm Hg]），从而提供驱动力以允许充分灌注。\n\n心率增加缩短了心室松弛时间（舒张期持续时间）；因此，最大冠状动脉血流量的时间减少，因此成为心肌冠状动脉血供的主要限制因素。\n\n（选项B）在运动期间，诸如血流介导的扩张和血管舒张剂（如腺苷和一氧化氮）的释放等机制可确保充分的冠状动脉血供。\n\n（选项A、E和F）左心室收缩力、心室内压力和心室壁应力在运动期间都会增加，以向主动收缩的骨骼肌提供充足的血流。然而，由于收缩期已经发生最小的左心室灌注，这些力的增加不会导致左心室心肌灌注的进一步限制。\n\n（选项C）舒张期主动脉压是舒张期冠状动脉血流的驱动力，而在舒张压低的患者中，冠状动脉血流减少。该患者的舒张压在静息和运动时相似，不会导致冠状动脉血供减少。\n\n教育目标：左心室的高收缩期心室内压力和壁应力阻止了收缩期心肌灌注；因此，左心室的大部分心肌灌注发生在舒张期。舒张期持续时间缩短是心动过速（例如，运动）期间左心室心肌冠状动脉血供的主要限制因素。{{exhibit_2}}"
