  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The Southern, Western, Northern and Southwestern blot procedures are techniques used to analyze and identify DNA fragments, proteins, mRNA, and DNA-bound proteins, respectively. The best method for determining whether a gene is undergoing transcription is to analyze for the presence of its mRNA using a Northern blot. In the case described above, Northern blot analysis of each of the cell culture samples can determine if mRNA corresponding to the gene of interest is being transcribed {{exhibit_1}}.\n\nAll of the \"blot\" tests rely on the same basic techniques. First, the components of the unknown sample – DNA for Southern blots, mRNA for Northern blots, protein for Western blots, and DNA-bound protein for Southwestern blots – are separated by size and charge via gel electrophoresis. The resultant bands are then blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with a labeled hybridization probe or antibody to identify the specific DNA fragment, mRNA molecule or protein of interest.\n\n(Choice B) A complete failure of gene expression would lead to a failure to produce the protein, which can be detected by Western blotting. However, the question is asking how to determine if the gene is being transcribed (genes may be transcribed but not properly expressed if there is a problem with protein translation). As transcription refers to the production of mRNA from a DNA template, a test that detects specific mRNA sequences (Northern blot) would be most appropriate.\n\n(Choices C and D) This patient's mutation in a non-coding DNA sequence (likely affecting a promoter or enhancer region) is resulting in decreased gene expression. A Southern or Southwestern blot could potentially be used to detect the mutated DNA sequence and assess for transcription factor binding. However, the degree of transcription of the affected gene is better assessed through direct detection of its associated mRNA.\n\n(Choice E) ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is a test commonly employed to measure the amount of a protein in body fluids. It can be quantitative, for example, to measure plasma insulin levels.\n\nEducational objective:\nNorthern blots detect target mRNA in a sample and can be used to assess the degree of gene transcription.",
    "zh": "Southern、Western、Northern 和 Southwestern 印迹程序是分别用于分析和鉴定 DNA 片段、蛋白质、mRNA 和与 DNA 结合的蛋白质的技术。确定基因是否正在转录的最佳方法是使用 Northern 印迹分析其 mRNA 的存在。在上述情况下，对每个细胞培养物样本进行 Northern 印迹分析可以确定是否存在与目标基因相对应的 mRNA 正在转录 {{exhibit_1}}。\n\n所有“印迹”测试都依赖于相同的基本技术。首先，未知样本的成分——Southern 印迹的 DNA、Northern 印迹的 mRNA、Western 印迹的蛋白质和 Southwestern 印迹的 DNA 结合蛋白——通过凝胶电泳按大小和电荷分离。然后将所得条带印迹到硝酸纤维素膜上，并用标记的杂交探针或抗体孵育，以鉴定特定的 DNA 片段、mRNA 分子或目标蛋白质。\n\n(选项 B) 基因表达的完全失败将导致无法产生蛋白质，这可以通过 Western 印迹检测到。然而，这个问题是询问如何确定基因是否正在转录（如果蛋白质翻译出现问题，基因可能被转录但没有正确表达）。由于转录是指从 DNA 模板产生 mRNA，因此检测特定 mRNA 序列（Northern 印迹）的测试是最合适的。\n\n(选项 C 和 D) 该患者在非编码 DNA 序列中的突变（可能影响启动子或增强子区域）导致基因表达降低。Southern 或 Southwestern 印迹可用于检测突变的 DNA 序列并评估转录因子结合。然而，通过直接检测其相关 mRNA 可以更好地评估受影响基因的转录程度。\n\n(选项 E) ELISA（酶联免疫吸附试验）是一种常用于测量体液中蛋白质量的测试。它可以是定量的，例如测量血浆胰岛素水平。\n\n教育目标：\nNorthern 印迹检测样本中的目标 mRNA，可用于评估基因转录的程度。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of molecular biology techniques, specifically the application of Northern blotting to assess gene transcription. It requires understanding the central dogma of molecular biology and the specific molecules each blotting technique targets.\n\nThe best approach is to recall that transcription produces mRNA, and Northern blots are used to detect mRNA. Eliminate options that target DNA or proteins, focusing on the direct measurement of mRNA levels to determine if the gene is being transcribed.",
