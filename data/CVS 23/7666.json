    "en": "A 63-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to an episode of syncope. The patient was recently discharged back to a nursing home after being hospitalized for a urinary tract infection. He has a history of coronary artery disease and takes aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin. His other medical conditions include type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Blood pressure is 68/32 mm Hg and pulse is 118/min. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring reveals an elevated right atrial pressure of 17 mm Hg and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 7 mm Hg (normal: 8-10 mm Hg).",

    "en": "This patient is in shock (eg, severe hypotension, end organ dysfunction [syncope]) due to an unknown cause. Hemodynamic monitoring (eg, pulmonary artery catheterization) shows decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) {{exhibit_1}} and increased right atrial pressure (RAP), which indicate impaired blood flow from the right ventricle to the left side of the heart (right-sided heart failure). Common causes of right-sided heart failure include obstruction of pulmonary circulation (eg, pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary embolism) and right ventricular infarction (likely in this patient due to multiple cardiovascular risk factors).\n\nIn right ventricular infarction, the right ventricle is unable to effectively pump blood forward into the pulmonary arteries, causing increased pressure in the right atrium (ie, elevated central venous pressure). The decreased right ventricular outflow also lowers PCWP (an indicator of left-sided preload), which subsequently reduces cardiac output and causes hypotension. A reflexive increase in heart rate is mostly intact in this patient, though it is often impaired in right ventricular infarction due to frequent ischemic involvement of the conduction system.\n\n(Choices A and D) Anaphylactic shock and septic shock are associated with peripheral vasodilation and massive fluid shift to the extravascular space. The depleted intravascular volume lowers the mean circulatory filling pressure, reducing both RAP and PCWP, while hypotension caused by widespread peripheral vasodilation leads to a compensatory increase in cardiac output.\n\n(Choice B) Gastrointestinal bleeding can cause hypovolemic shock with decreased RAP, PCWP, and cardiac output. Decreased cardiac output triggers an increase in sympathetic tone with peripheral vasoconstriction (increased systemic vascular resistance) to help maintain perfusion pressure.\n\n(Choice E) Aortic stenosis causes left ventricular outflow obstruction and would increase pressure in the left atrium (increased PCWP) and pulmonary circulation. In severe cases, right-sided heart failure can also develop, leading to increased RAP. Systemic vascular resistance is increased with aortic stenosis in response to a reduction in cardiac output.\n\nEducational objective:\nRight ventricular infarction (right-sided heart failure) can lead to shock via impaired forward blood flow to the left heart, which lowers left-sided preload (decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) and decreases cardiac output. The reduced right ventricular output also raises right atrial and central venous pressure. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者由于不明原因而处于休克状态（例如，严重低血压、器官功能障碍[晕厥]）。血流动力学监测（例如，肺动脉导管插入术）显示肺毛细血管楔压 (PCWP) 降低 {{exhibit_1}} 和右心房压力 (RAP) 升高，这表明从右心室到心脏左侧（右心衰竭）的血流受损。右心衰竭的常见原因包括肺循环阻塞（例如，肺动脉高压、肺栓塞）和右心室梗死（该患者由于多种心血管危险因素而可能发生）。\n\n在右心室梗死中，右心室无法有效地将血液泵入肺动脉，导致右心房压力升高（即，中心静脉压升高）。右心室排血量减少也会降低PCWP（左侧前负荷的指标），进而降低心输出量并引起低血压。该患者的反射性心率增加基本完整，尽管在右心室梗死中，由于传导系统经常受到缺血影响，心率增加常常受损。\n\n（选项A和D）过敏性休克和感染性休克与周围血管舒张和大量液体转移到血管外空间有关。血管内容量减少会降低平均循环充盈压，从而降低RAP和PCWP，而由广泛的周围血管舒张引起的低血压会导致代偿性心输出量增加。\n\n（选项B）消化道出血可引起血容量不足性休克，并伴有RAP、PCWP和心输出量降低。心输出量降低会触发交感神经张力增加，伴有周围血管收缩（全身血管阻力增加），以帮助维持灌注压力。\n\n（选项E）主动脉瓣狭窄导致左心室流出道梗阻，会增加左心房压力（PCWP升高）和肺循环压力。在严重情况下，也可能发生右心衰竭，导致RAP升高。主动脉瓣狭窄时，全身血管阻力会因心输出量降低而增加。\n\n教育目标：\n右心室梗死（右心衰竭）可通过阻碍向左心室的前向血流导致休克，从而降低左侧前负荷（肺毛细血管楔压降低）并降低心输出量。右心室输出量减少也会升高右心房和中心静脉压。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of right ventricular infarction as a cause of cardiogenic shock, focusing on hemodynamic parameters like right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The key to solving this question is recognizing the pattern of elevated right atrial pressure and decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which is indicative of impaired right ventricular function and reduced preload to the left ventricle.
