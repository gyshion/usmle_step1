    "en": "A 42-year-old man comes to the office due to 2 weeks of progressive fever, chills, abdominal discomfort, and loose stools, which began during a trip to Southeast Asia. He received no pretravel vaccinations and did not strictly follow food and water safety precautions during the trip. The patient has no chronic medical conditions; however, he had an episode of *Salmonella* Enteritidis gastroenteritis last year, and it resolved with symptomatic care. Temperature is 39.4 C (102.9 F), blood pressure is 110/64 mm Hg, pulse is 62/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination shows a faint macular rash on the trunk. There is mild tenderness to palpation in the lower abdominal quadrants with no guarding or rebound tenderness. Hepatosplenomegaly is present. Blood culture grows gram-negative, non-lactose-fermenting rods.",

    "en": "This patient most likely has TYPHOID FEVER, an invasive *Salmonella* infection. *Salmonella* species are gram-negative, non-lactose-fermenting, motile enteric rods divided into nontyphoidal and typhoidal strains. Both strains penetrate enterocytes, where they travel in vacuoles from the apical to the basolateral end of the cell and invade the lamina propria. However, the pathogenesis then diverges, as follows:\n\n*   Nontyphoidal strains (eg, *S* Enteritidis) are phagocytosed by neutrophils and macrophages in the lamina propria and induce a massive inflammatory response with neutrophilic infiltration. This cytokine-mediated response causes gastroenteritis (eg, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever), which usually self-resolves, as in this patient's prior history.\n*   In contrast, TYPHOIDAL STRAINS contain specialized virulence factors (eg, Vi capsular antigen) that INHIBIT NEUTROPHIL RECRUITMENT AND PHAGOCYTOSIS, limiting the acute inflammatory response that helps contain nontyphoidal species. It also inhibits macrophages from generating an oxidative burst to destroy the bacteria, allowing the pathogen to undergo extensive, UNCHECKED INTRAPHAGOCYTIC REPLICATION and dissemination through the lymphatic and reticuloendothelial system. This results in typhoid fever, as seen in this patient.\n\nManifestations begin approximately a week after transmission of the typhoidal strain, which typically occurs via consumption of food or water contaminated by human feces in regions of poor sanitation. Initial symptoms include an ESCALATING FEVER that is often associated with relative bradycardia (PULSE-TEMPERATURE DISSOCIATION). A week later, patients typically develop abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, hepatosplenomegaly, and transient salmon-colored macules (ROSE SPOTS) on the trunk. Blood culture is diagnostic.\n\n(Choice A) Contact between *Entamoeba histolytica* and the host cell results in insertion of an amebic channel-forming protein in the host cell membrane, causing cell death. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea and/or extraintestinal manifestations (eg, liver abscess). Rash is uncommon, and blood cultures would not show gram-negative rods.\n\n(Choice B) *Campylobacter* infection causes acute, self-limited diarrhea (<7 days) and may result in cross-reacting antibodies to ganglioside GM1, leading to Guillain-Barré syndrome. Rose spots, hepatosplenomegaly, and pulse-temperature dissociation would not be expected.\n\n(Choice D) Rotavirus and *Giardia* damage intestinal villi, leading to intestinal malabsorption due to villous blunting and decreased levels of brush border enzymes (eg, maltase, lactase).\n\nEducational objective:\nTyphoidal strains of *Salmonella* contain a capsular antigen (Vi) and other virulence factors that inhibit neutrophil phagocytosis, neutrophil recruitment, and macrophage-mediated destruction. Therefore, typhoidal *Salmonella* undergoes extensive replication in macrophages and is able to spread through the lymphatic and reticuloendothelial system, leading to widespread systemic disease (typhoid fever).",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有伤寒，这是一种侵袭性*沙门氏菌*感染。*沙门氏菌*属是革兰氏阴性、不发酵乳糖、有动力的肠杆菌，分为非伤寒和伤寒菌株。这两种菌株都能穿透肠细胞，它们在液泡中从细胞的顶端移动到基底外侧端，并侵入固有层。然而，发病机制随后出现分歧，如下所示：\n\n*   非伤寒菌株（例如，*S* Enteritidis）被固有层中的中性粒细胞和巨噬细胞吞噬，并诱导伴有中性粒细胞浸润的大量炎症反应。这种细胞因子介导的反应会导致胃肠炎（例如，水样腹泻、腹痛、发烧），这通常会自发缓解，如该患者既往病史。\n*   相比之下，伤寒菌株含有特殊的毒力因子（例如，Vi荚膜抗原），可抑制中性粒细胞募集和吞噬作用，从而限制有助于控制非伤寒菌种的急性炎症反应。它还抑制巨噬细胞产生氧化爆发以破坏细菌，从而使病原体能够进行广泛的、不受控制的吞噬细胞内复制，并通过淋巴系统和网状内皮系统播散。这会导致伤寒，如该患者所见。\n\n症状在伤寒菌株传播后大约一周开始出现，这通常发生在卫生条件差的地区通过食用被人类粪便污染的食物或水而发生。最初的症状包括不断升级的发烧，通常伴有相对缓脉（脉搏-体温分离）。一周后，患者通常会出现腹痛、腹泻或便秘、肝脾肿大和躯干上短暂的鲑鱼色斑丘疹（玫瑰疹）。血培养具有诊断意义。\n\n（选项A）溶组织内阿米巴和宿主细胞之间的接触会导致阿米巴成孔蛋白插入宿主细胞膜，导致细胞死亡。症状包括血性腹泻和/或肠外表现（例如，肝脓肿）。皮疹不常见，血培养不会显示革兰氏阴性杆菌。\n\n（选项B）*弯曲杆菌*感染会导致急性、自限性腹泻（<7天），并可能导致对神经节苷脂GM1的交叉反应性抗体，从而导致格林-巴利综合征。玫瑰疹、肝脾肿大和脉搏-体温分离不应该出现。\n\n（选项D）轮状病毒和*贾第虫*会损害肠绒毛，导致因绒毛变钝和刷状缘酶水平降低（例如，麦芽糖酶、乳糖酶）引起的肠道吸收不良。\n\n教育目标：\n伤寒菌株的*沙门氏菌*含有荚膜抗原（Vi）和其他毒力因子，可抑制中性粒细胞的吞噬作用、中性粒细胞募集和巨噬细胞介导的破坏。因此，伤寒*沙门氏菌*在巨噬细胞中进行广泛复制，并能够通过淋巴系统和网状内皮系统传播，导致广泛的全身性疾病（伤寒）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathogenesis of typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi, specifically the mechanism by which it evades the host's immune response and causes systemic disease. It also requires differentiating typhoid fever from other causes of gastroenteritis.\n\nThe key to answering this question is recognizing the patient's travel history, prolonged fever, and hepatosplenomegaly, which are suggestive of typhoid fever. Understanding that Salmonella typhi inhibits neutrophil recruitment and undergoes extensive intracellular replication in macrophages is crucial for selecting the correct answer.",
