    "en": "Scabies is a skin infection caused by the human itch mite, Sarcoptes scabiei. Transmission occurs from prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infected individual but may occasionally occur due to contact with contaminated fomites (eg, bedsheets, clothing). Mites burrow under the epidermis and evoke a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to mite feces and eggs, which leads to an intensely pruritic rash. The mites can often be seen on microscopy {{exhibit_2}}. \n\nClassic scabies is associated with a mild mite burden (10-15 mites). Patients usually have several small erythematous papules on the sides/webs of the fingers, wrists, elbows, axillae, waist, and genitalia. Excoriations and burrows (thin, serpiginous red tracks) may be seen. In contrast, patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity (eg, HIV) are unable to contain the infection and usually develop crusted scabies, which is associated with thousands or millions of mites. These patients often have mild pruritus (because the inflammatory response is muted) and several erythematous patches with scaling and crusting. {{exhibit_3}}\n\nTreatment is required to prevent discomfort, transmission, and potential complications (eg, secondary bacterial infection). First-line therapy includes topical permethrin, which blocks mite neurotransmission by impairing voltage-gated sodium channels. Oral ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent that binds chloride ion channels in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells, is an alternate medication for classic scabies that is used in combination with permethrin for crusted scabies. {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choice A) Oral acyclovir is used for human herpes simplex virus outbreaks, which are usually characterized by vesicular lesions on an erythematous base. The orolabial mucosa and genital area are affected most commonly. Histopathology would show epidermal blisters with acantholysis and multinucleated cells. {{exhibit_5}}\n\n(Choice B) Oral terbinafine can be used for patients with dermatophytic infections of the skin. Dermatophytes often cause an erythematous scaly rash and erosions. Microscopy typically reveals fungal spores and/or hyphae. {{exhibit_6}}\n\n(Choice C) Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can be treated with topical glucocorticoids. It is usually associated with symmetric, sharply defined skin plaques with overlying scales on the extensor elbows, knees, and scalp. Microscopy generally shows uniform epidermal hyperplasia, parakeratosis, dilated capillaries in the papillary dermis, and perivascular lymphocytes. {{exhibit_7}}\n\n(Choice D) Topical mupirocin is used for the treatment of impetigo, a superficial bacterial infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The condition typically presents as a localized papulovesicular rash with surrounding erythema and adherent golden crusts involving the face or extremities.\n\nEducational objective:\nScabies is a human mite infection associated with a pruritic papular rash with excoriations and burrows. Patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity (eg, HIV) often develop a very high mite burden. Treatment with topical permethrin and/or ivermectin is generally curative.",
