    "en": "A 14-year-old girl is evaluated in the burn unit due to nausea and recurrent bilious vomiting occurring over the past 4 hours. Twelve days ago, the patient was admitted to the burn unit after she was in a house fire. Examination on admission showed deep and superficial, partial-thickness burns covering 40% of her body. The patient has been receiving intravenous fluids, analgesics, nutritional support, and wound care, with slow improvement in clinical status until today. Temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F), blood pressure is 133/77 mm Hg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 22/min, findings consistent with those of previous days. Physical examination shows mild diaphoresis and mild upper abdominal distension. Multiple wound and blood cultures taken since admission are negative. CT scan of the abdomen with intravenous contrast demonstrates significant reduction of the angle between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta, with compression of an intervening portion of the gastrointestinal tract. {{exhibit_1}} Impingement of which of the following structures is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",

    "en": "This 14-year-old patient with significant burn injuries developed symptoms of bowel obstruction (bilious vomiting, abdominal distension) following multiple days of hospitalization. The healing process after moderate to severe burns elicits a hypermetabolic state, mobilizing energy to cells involved in wound healing while countering heat and water loss from damaged insulating cutaneous tissue. This can lead to significant consumption of adipose reserves, including the fat pads that support abdominal structures.\n\nThe superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is supported by mesenteric fat that normally cushions the transverse (third) segment of the duodenum. With substantial lipolysis, consumption of the fat pad collapses the angle between the SMA and the aorta (aortomesenteric angle), compressing the duodenum (superior mesenteric artery syndrome). Because the obstruction is distal to biliary/pancreatic outflow from the duodenal papilla—located in the descending (second) segment of the duodenum (Choice B)—intestinal obstruction results in regurgitation of partially digested food (chyme) and biliary emesis. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choices A, C, D, and E) These structures do not pass under the SMA and are not susceptible to compression after mesenteric fat depletion.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe transverse segment of the duodenum travels through a mesenteric fat pad that provides structural support for the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Conditions that deplete mesenteric fat (eg, hypermetabolic states, starvation) may allow the SMA to compress the transverse segment against the aorta, causing progressive abdominal distension and recurrent bilious vomiting (ie, superior mesenteric artery syndrome).",
    "zh": "这名14岁的患者，由于严重的烧伤，在住院数天后出现肠梗阻的症状（胆汁性呕吐，腹胀）。中度至重度烧伤后的愈合过程会引发高代谢状态，调动能量到参与伤口愈合的细胞，同时对抗来自受损绝缘皮肤组织的 heat 和 water 损失。这可能导致大量消耗脂肪储备，包括支持腹部结构的脂肪垫。\n\n肠系膜上动脉 (SMA) 由肠系膜脂肪支撑，肠系膜脂肪通常缓冲十二指肠横段（第三段）。由于大量的脂肪分解，脂肪垫的消耗导致 SMA 和主动脉之间的角度（主动脉肠系膜角）塌陷，压迫十二指肠（肠系膜上动脉综合征）。因为梗阻位于十二指肠乳头（位于十二指肠降段，即第二段，选项 B）的胆汁/胰腺流出道远端，肠梗阻会导致部分消化的食物（食糜）和胆汁呕吐反流。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n（选项 A、C、D 和 E）这些结构不通过 SMA，并且在肠系膜脂肪耗尽后不易受到压迫。\n\n教育目标：\n十二指肠横段穿过肠系膜脂肪垫，该脂肪垫为肠系膜上动脉（SMA）提供结构支撑。消耗肠系膜脂肪的疾病（例如，高代谢状态、饥饿）可能使 SMA 压迫横段对抗主动脉，导致进行性腹胀和反复的胆汁性呕吐（即，肠系膜上动脉综合征）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome, its pathophysiology related to mesenteric fat loss, and the resulting compression of the transverse duodenum. It also assesses the ability to correlate clinical findings of bowel obstruction with anatomical structures in the context of a hypermetabolic state following burn injuries.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of bowel obstruction in a patient with burn injuries, consider the potential for mesenteric fat depletion due to a hypermetabolic state, and identify the anatomical relationship between the SMA, aorta, and transverse duodenum.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试了对肠系膜上动脉 (SMA) 综合征的了解，其病理生理学与肠系膜脂肪流失相关，以及由此导致的对十二指肠横段的压迫。它还评估了在烧伤后高代谢状态的背景下，将肠梗阻的临床表现与解剖结构相关联的能力。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要认识到烧伤患者肠梗阻的临床表现，考虑高代谢状态可能导致肠系膜脂肪耗竭，并确定 SMA、主动脉和十二指肠横段之间的解剖关系。"
