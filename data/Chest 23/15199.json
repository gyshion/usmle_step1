  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with pulmonary hypertension {{exhibit_2}}. The disease most commonly presents with progressive dyspnea, and patients may also experience exertional angina or syncope. Physical examination reveals a loud pulmonic component (P2) of S2, caused by forceful pulmonic valve closure in the setting of high pulmonary arterial pressure. In addition, the right ventricle becomes enlarged due to increased pressure load (ie, concentric right ventricular hypertrophy), which can create an accentuated impulse palpated at the left sternal border (left parasternal lift due to right ventricular heave). \n\nPulmonary arterial hypertension describes pulmonary hypertension directly caused by vascular remodeling of the small pulmonary arteries/arterioles; relatively young women are most commonly affected. Fatigue and exertional dyspnea are common and result from decreased cardiac output due to the inability of the right ventricle to pump blood through the lungs. Right-sided heart failure eventually develops, but because left ventricular function remains intact, there is an absence of pulmonary edema in pulmonary arterial hypertension. {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(Choice A) Hypertensive heart disease occurs as the result of prolonged systemic hypertension. It involves concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, leading to impaired ventricular compliance and diastolic heart failure. Pulmonary edema is expected with diastolic heart failure that is severe enough to cause dyspnea.\n\n(Choice B) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy typically demonstrates a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border. The murmur intensifies with maneuvers that decrease left ventricular blood volume (eg, abrupt standing, Valsalva strain phase).\n\n(Choice C) Left bundle branch block can delay closure of the aortic valve, leading to later occurrence of the aortic component (A2) of S2 and narrowed or paradoxical splitting. However, left bundle branch block is unlikely to significantly affect the relative audible intensity of A2 and P2.\n\n(Choice E) Pulmonic valve stenosis can delay the occurrence of P2 (later valve closure) but typically leads to a softer intensity of P2. {{exhibit_4}}\n\nEducational objective:\nPulmonary hypertension can be recognized on physical examination by a loud pulmonic component of S2 and an accentuated, palpable impulse at the left sternal border (left parasternal lift due to right ventricular heave).",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现与肺动脉高压一致{{exhibit_2}}。该疾病最常见的表现是进行性呼吸困难，患者也可能出现劳力性心绞痛或晕厥。体格检查显示S2的肺动脉瓣成分（P2）响亮，这是由于肺动脉压力升高时，肺动脉瓣有力关闭所致。此外，右心室由于压力负荷增加而增大（即向心性右心室肥大），这可能导致在左胸骨缘触及增强的搏动（由于右心室抬举引起的左侧胸骨旁抬举）。\n\n肺动脉高压描述的是由小肺动脉/小动脉的血管重塑直接引起的肺动脉高压；相对年轻的女性最常受影响。疲劳和劳力性呼吸困难很常见，是由于右心室无法将血液泵入肺部导致心输出量下降所致。最终会发展为右心衰竭，但由于左心室功能保持完整，在肺动脉高压中不存在肺水肿。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n(选项A) 高血压性心脏病是长期全身性高血压的结果。它涉及向心性左心室肥大，导致心室顺应性受损和舒张性心力衰竭。如果舒张性心力衰竭严重到足以引起呼吸困难，则预计会出现肺水肿。\n\n(选项B) 肥厚型心肌病通常表现为在左胸骨缘听诊最清楚的递增-递减型收缩期杂音。该杂音随着减少左心室血容量的动作（例如，突然站立、瓦尔萨瓦动作用力期）而增强。\n\n(选项C) 左束支传导阻滞可延迟主动脉瓣的关闭，导致S2的主动脉瓣成分（A2）较晚出现，并出现窄或反常的分裂。然而，左束支传导阻滞不太可能显着影响A2和P2的相对可听强度。\n\n(选项E) 肺动脉瓣狭窄可延迟P2的发生（瓣膜关闭延迟），但通常会导致P2强度降低。{{exhibit_4}}\n\n教学目标：\n通过听诊S2的肺动脉瓣成分响亮以及在左胸骨缘触及增强的可触及搏动（由于右心室抬举引起的左侧胸骨旁抬举），可以在体格检查中识别出肺动脉高压。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pulmonary hypertension, specifically its clinical presentation, physical exam findings, and underlying pathophysiology related to right ventricular changes. It also requires differentiating pulmonary hypertension from other cardiac conditions based on auscultation and other clinical features.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key findings: exertional dyspnea, loud P2, and right ventricular heave. These point towards increased pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy, which are characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Rule out other options based on their distinct clinical presentations.",
