  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The potency of an inhaled anesthetic is determined by the minimum concentration in the brain necessary to achieve an adequate level of anesthesia. When an inhaled anesthetic is administered at a constant rate over a prolonged period of time, its partial pressure in the brain equals its partial pressure in the other compartments (inhaled air, lungs, and arterial blood). Since an anesthetic's concentration in the brain tissue is directly proportional to its partial pressure, it is possible to use the steady-state alveolar partial pressure of the inhaled agent as a measure of anesthetic potency.\n\nThe minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) refers to the percentage of anesthetic in the inspired gas mixture that renders 50% of patients unresponsive to painful stimuli. It corresponds to ED50 on the dose-effect curve. Potency is inversely proportional to the MAC; the lower the MAC, the more potent the anesthetic. MAC is an intrinsic property of the anesthetic that does not depend on the type of surgery; duration of anesthesia; or the sex, height, and weight of the patient. It does, however, depend on body temperature and also decreases with increasing patient age.\n\n(Choice A) The arteriovenous concentration gradient is an indirect measurement of the solubility of the anesthetic in body tissues. A high arteriovenous concentration gradient means that more anesthetic is extracted from the blood by the body tissues, increasing the time it takes for the blood to become saturated and slowing the onset of action.\n\n(Choice B) The blood/gas partition coefficient corresponds to the solubility of anesthetic in the blood. Anesthetics with a high blood/gas partition coefficient are absorbed to a greater extent by the blood and have a slower onset of action.\n\n(Choice C) Clearance of inhaled anesthetics occurs mainly via exhalation from the lungs into the air; hepatic metabolism of most gas anesthetics is low. However, certain gas anesthetics, particularly halothane, are metabolized extensively by the liver, resulting in the production of reactive intermediates that cause hepatotoxicity.\n\n(Choice E) The steepness of the arterial tension curve depends on the solubility of the anesthetic in the blood. Partial pressure in the blood rises more rapidly with less soluble anesthetics, producing a steeper curve.",
    "zh": "吸入麻醉剂的效力由大脑中达到足够麻醉水平所需的最低浓度决定。当以恒定速率长时间给予吸入麻醉剂时，其在大脑中的分压等于其在其他隔室（吸入空气、肺和动脉血）中的分压。由于麻醉剂在大脑组织中的浓度与其分压成正比，因此可以使用吸入剂的稳态肺泡分压来衡量麻醉剂的效力。\n\n最小肺泡浓度 (MAC) 指的是吸入气体混合物中麻醉剂的百分比，该百分比使 50% 的患者对疼痛刺激无反应。它对应于剂量-效应曲线上的 ED50。效力与 MAC 成反比；MAC 越低，麻醉剂的效力越强。MAC 是麻醉剂的固有特性，不依赖于手术类型；麻醉持续时间；或患者的性别、身高和体重。然而，它确实取决于体温，并且随着患者年龄的增长而降低。\n\n(选项 A) 动静脉浓度梯度是麻醉剂在身体组织中溶解度的间接测量。较高的动静脉浓度梯度意味着身体组织从血液中提取更多的麻醉剂，从而增加了血液饱和所需的时间，并减缓了作用的发生。\n\n(选项 B) 血/气分配系数对应于麻醉剂在血液中的溶解度。具有较高血/气分配系数的麻醉剂被血液吸收的程度更大，并且起效较慢。\n\n(选项 C) 吸入麻醉剂的清除主要通过从肺部呼出到空气中进行；大多数气体麻醉剂的肝脏代谢率较低。然而，某些气体麻醉剂，特别是氟烷，会被肝脏广泛代谢，导致产生引起肝毒性的反应性中间体。\n\n(选项 E) 动脉张力曲线的陡度取决于麻醉剂在血液中的溶解度。溶解度较低的麻醉剂在血液中的分压上升得更快，从而产生更陡峭的曲线。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of anesthetic potency and its correlation with the minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of inhaled anesthetics. It assesses the knowledge of how MAC is defined and its inverse relationship with potency.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall the definition of anesthetic potency and identify the parameter that directly reflects the concentration required to achieve a specific effect (50% unresponsiveness). Understanding that MAC represents this effective concentration and its inverse relationship with potency is key to selecting the correct answer.",
