    "en": "A 35-year-old man is admitted to the hospital after he fell off a moving tractor and caught his right leg underneath the vehicle. The patient has no past medical history. Over the next few hours, he develops worsening severe pain and rapidly increasing swelling in the injured right leg. Crepitus is present on physical examination. Emergent radiographic imaging reveals gas in the tissues. Surgical evaluation is performed.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Spores of _Clostridium perfringens_, a gram-positive bacillus responsible for ~95% of cases of GAS GANGRENE (clostridial myonecrosis), are abundant in soil and can inoculate PENETRATING INJURY sites. On entering the host, the spores germinate in the ANAEROBIC environment into vegetative cells, which produce a phospholipase TOXIN that attacks cell membranes. Extensive tissue damage, NECROSIS, and reduced blood supply to the affected area result, with the disease spreading in the enlarging anaerobic environment. The organism rapidly metabolizes carbohydrates, producing GAS that can sometimes be felt on examination (crepitus) and may often be VISUALIZED on radiographs (helping to distinguish gas gangrene from other necrotizing infections). Treatment involves antibiotics and emergent debridement. However, prognosis is poor even with prompt therapy, and tissue loss is often considerable.\n\n_C perfringens_ can also cause late-onset FOOD POISONING that is characterized by transient watery diarrhea. This gastroenteritis is caused by a toxin formed when large quantities of clostridial spores are ingested. The spores germinate in the digestive tract and then begin to elaborate toxin, which explains the disease's delayed onset. This is in contrast to early-onset food poisoning caused by the preformed toxins of _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Bacillus cereus_.\n\n(Choices A and B) _C perfringens_ does not cause cough. It is also an extremely rare cause of endocarditis and valve abscess.\n\n(Choice C) Relentless headaches and nausea can be caused by any organism that causes meningitis. Subacute or chronic infections causing these illnesses include _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, _Acanthamoeba_, and _Cryptococcus neoformans_.\n\n(Choice E) Urinary frequency and burning are caused by urethritis/cystitis. The urethritis of urinary tract infections is usually due to _Escherichia coli_, whereas sexually transmitted types of urethritis can be due to gonorrhea, chlamydia, and _Ureaplasma urealyticum_. _C perfringens_ does not cause dysuria.\n\nEducational objective:\n_Clostridium perfringens_ causes late-onset food poisoning and clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene). The food poisoning is toxin-mediated, late-onset, and causes transient watery diarrhea.",
    "zh": "产气荚膜梭菌的孢子，一种革兰氏阳性杆菌，是GAS坏疽（梭菌性肌坏死）病例的约95%的病原体，在土壤中含量丰富，并能接种到穿透性损伤部位。进入宿主体内后，孢子在厌氧环境中发芽成营养细胞，产生一种磷脂酶毒素，攻击细胞膜。导致广泛的组织损伤、坏死以及受影响区域的血液供应减少，疾病在扩大的厌氧环境中蔓延。该生物体迅速代谢碳水化合物，产生气体，有时可在检查时感觉到（捻发音），并且通常可在X光片上看到（有助于将气性坏疽与其他坏死性感染区分开来）。治疗方法包括抗生素和急诊清创。然而，即使及时治疗，预后也很差，并且组织损失通常是相当大的。\n\n_C perfringens_ 也可以引起迟发性食物中毒，其特征是一过性水样腹泻。这种胃肠炎是由摄入大量梭菌孢子后形成的毒素引起的。孢子在消化道中发芽，然后开始产生毒素，这解释了疾病的延迟发作。这与由金黄色葡萄球菌和蜡样芽孢杆菌的预先形成的毒素引起的早发性食物中毒形成对比。\n\n（选项A和B）_C perfringens_ 不会引起咳嗽。它也是心内膜炎和瓣膜脓肿的极罕见病因。\n\n（选项C）持续性头痛和恶心可由任何引起脑膜炎的生物体引起。引起这些疾病的亚急性或慢性感染包括结核分枝杆菌、棘阿米巴和新型隐球菌。\n\n（选项E）尿频和尿痛是由尿道炎/膀胱炎引起的。尿路感染的尿道炎通常是由于大肠杆菌引起的，而性传播类型的尿道炎可能是由于淋病、衣原体和解脲脲原体引起的。_C perfringens_ 不会引起排尿困难。\n\n教育目标：\n产气荚膜梭菌引起迟发性食物中毒和梭菌性肌坏死（气性坏疽）。食物中毒是由毒素介导的，迟发性，并引起一过性水样腹泻。"
