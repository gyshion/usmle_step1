An electrophysiology study reveals focal atrial tachycardia that originates in the crista terminalis of the right atrium. Radiofrequency ablation is planned to destroy the ectopic focus and treat the arrhythmia. Which of the following nerves is in close proximity to the treatment site and is at risk for injury during the ablation?",

    "en": "Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVTs) are arrhythmias that occur intermittently and have abrupt onset and offset. They arise from regions of abnormal electrical activity that occur in the atrioventricular node, an accessory pathway, or the atria. Radiofrequency ablation can be used to destroy the inciting cardiomyocytes and cure the arrhythmia.\n\nThe crista terminalis, located in the right atrium, is a common site of origination for atrial PSVT. The right phrenic nerve, which innervates to the right hemidiaphragm, courses along the pericardium that overlies the right atrium and is at risk of injury during procedures that target structures in or near the right atrium (eg, crista terminalis, cavotricuspid isthmus, right-sided pulmonary veins). Such injury is typically recognized by elevation of the right hemidiaphragm on chest x-ray. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) The spinal root of the accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI) courses superiorly from the upper spinal cord through the foramen magnum to join with the cranial root. The combined roots then exit the cranium through the jugular foramen to provide motor innervation to the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. There is risk of injury during biopsy or lymph node dissection in the neck, but not during procedures involving the right atrium.\n\n(Choice B) The long thoracic nerve arises from the lower cervical spinal cord and courses laterally and inferiorly to provide motor innervation to the serratus anterior muscle. Injury can occur during breast surgery or chest-tube placement (resulting in a \"winged\" scapula); however, due to its lateral location, the nerve is not at risk of injury during procedures involving the right atrium.\n\n(Choice D) The recurrent laryngeal nerve is a branch of the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) that courses underneath the aortic arch on the left and the brachiocephalic trunk on the right to provide motor, sensory, and parasympathetic innervation to the upper esophagus, trachea, and portions of the larynx. It is at risk of injury during thyroid surgery but not during procedures involving the right atrium.\n\n(Choice E) The sympathetic trunk parallels the length of the spinal column on both sides and provides sympathetic innervation throughout the body. Injury leads to Horner syndrome (ie, miosis, ptosis, anhydrosis) and can occur during spinal surgery, but not during procedures involving the right atrium.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe right phrenic nerve courses along the pericardium overlying the right side of the heart and is at risk for injury during procedures in or near the right atrium (eg, radiofrequency ablation). Right phrenic nerve injury is typically recognized by elevation of the right hemidiaphragm on chest x-ray. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the anatomical location of the phrenic nerve in relation to the right atrium and the risk of injury during radiofrequency ablation procedures targeting the crista terminalis. It also requires understanding the clinical presentation of phrenic nerve injury.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that the phrenic nerve courses along the pericardium overlying the right atrium. Therefore, procedures targeting structures in or near the right atrium, such as radiofrequency ablation of the crista terminalis, pose a risk of phrenic nerve injury.",
    "zh": "此题考察了关于膈神经与右心房的解剖位置，以及在针对嵴嵴的射频消融术中损伤风险的知识。它还需要了解膈神经损伤的临床表现。\n\n要解决这个问题，请回忆膈神经沿着覆盖右心房的心包走行。因此，针对右心房内或附近结构（如嵴嵴的射频消融术）的手术，会带来膈神经损伤的风险。"
