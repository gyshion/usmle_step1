    "en": "A 48-year-old deaf man comes to the office for a new patient visit. The patient recently moved to the area and is accompanied by a friend with whom he communicates using American Sign Language. The office staff informs the physician that the patient has also been communicating by reading lips, using gestures, and nodding his head in agreement. At the start of the appointment, the friend says that the patient has asthma and uses an inhaler as needed. The patient gives the physician a handwritten note indicating that he would like to try a longer-acting inhaler.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This deaf patient is communicating with health care providers using standardized American Sign Language (ASL) via a surrogate, nonstandard gestures, lip reading, and handwritten notes. However, in general, the most accurate and effective method of communication is to use a medical interpreter (or provider) trained in ASL. \n\nAs with spoken languages, communicating medical information in ASL requires precise wording and use of terminology that is not typically used by lay persons in daily communication. Using a trained medical ASL interpreter can help to avoid potentially dangerous miscommunication. As with any nonprovider personnel, the use of an ASL interpreter is subject to patient preference and consent and should be offered to all deaf and hard of hearing patients. If a face-to-face interpreter is unavailable, alternate modes of communication include computer-assisted real-time transcription and assistive listening devices.\n\n(Choice A) Friends and family members are not preferred for interpretation due to lack of impartiality, unfamiliarity with medical terminology, and possible barriers to open discussion of sensitive topics (eg, domestic abuse). Even though this patient has used his friend to assist in communication, this method should not be used unless the patient specifically requests it.\n\n(Choice B) Handwriting can be time-consuming, leading to use of abbreviations and shortcuts; many nuances can be lost or misinterpreted, and information may be left out for the sake of brevity. Therefore, writing is not recommended as the primary mode of communication.\n\n(Choice C) Supplemental communication measures can include written information sheets, standardized questionnaires, and captioned educational videos; however, the information conveyed by these modalities is limited, and they should not be used as the primary method of communication.\n\n(Choice D) Many deaf and hard of hearing individuals learn lip reading and expressive gestures to facilitate communication in casual settings. However, these methods are subject to error or misunderstanding and should not be relied on as a primary communication modality in health care.\n\nEducational objective:\nDeaf and hard of hearing patients should be offered the services of an interpreter trained in medical translation and American Sign Language, subject to patient preference and consent. Alternate modes of communication include computer-assisted real-time transcription and assistive listening devices.",
    "zh": "这名聋哑患者通过非标准的手势、读唇和手写笔记，以及一名替身，使用标准的美国手语 (ASL) 与医疗保健提供者进行交流。然而，一般来说，最准确有效 的沟通方法是使用经过 ASL 培训的医疗翻译（或提供者）。\n\n与口语一样，使用 ASL 交流医疗信息需要精确的措辞和使用日常交流中非专业人士通常不使用的术语。使用经过培训的医疗 ASL 翻译可以帮助避免潜在的危险误解。与任何非提供者人员一样，ASL 翻译的使用应以患者的喜好和同意为准，并应向所有聋哑和听力障碍患者提供。如果无法面对面翻译，其他沟通方式包括计算机辅助实时转录和辅助听力设备。\n\n(选项 A) 由于缺乏公正性、不熟悉医学术语以及可能阻碍对敏感话题（例如家庭虐待）的公开讨论，不建议朋友和家人进行翻译。即使该患者已使用他的朋友协助沟通，也不应使用这种方法，除非患者明确要求。\n\n(选项 B) 手写可能很耗时，导致使用缩写和快捷方式；许多细微差别可能会丢失或被误解，并且为了简洁起见，可能会省略信息。因此，不建议将书写作为主要的沟通方式。\n\n(选项 C) 补充沟通措施可包括书面信息表、标准化问卷和带字幕的教育视频；但是，这些方式传达的信息是有限的，不应将其用作主要的沟通方式。\n\n(选项 D) 许多聋哑和听力障碍者学习读唇和表情手势，以促进在非正式环境中的交流。但是，这些方法容易出错或被误解，不应将其作为医疗保健中的主要沟通方式。\n\n教育目标：\n应向聋哑和听力障碍患者提供经过医学翻译和美国手语培训的翻译服务，但需征得患者的喜好和同意。其他沟通方式包括计算机辅助实时转录和辅助听力设备。"
