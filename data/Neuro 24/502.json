    "en": "A 35-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, comes to the office for a routine prenatal visit. Her first child was born with a hydrocele and syndactyly of the first and second toes. The patient has no significant medical conditions and takes no medications except for a multivitamin. Examination shows clear lungs and normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Uterine size, fetal movements, and fetal cardiac activity are all within normal limits. The patient undergoes an amniocentesis at 18 weeks gestation. Amniotic fluid analysis shows an increased level of acetylcholinesterase. This patient's amniocentesis results most likely suggest failure of which of the following processes?",

    "en": "The patient's elevated acetylcholinesterase (AChE) level in the amniotic fluid suggests a NEURAL TUBE DEFECT (NTD). AChE is an enzyme normally found in high concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Elevated AChE in the amniotic fluid indicates leakage of fetal CSF into the amniotic cavity, which occurs when there is an open NTD. NTDs occur during the fourth week of fetal development due to failed fusion of the neural plate edges. This failure can lead to anencephaly (failure of rostral neuropore closure) or spina bifida (failure of caudal neuropore closure). A persistent opening between the neural tube and the amniotic cavity allows leakage of AFP and AChE into the amniotic fluid. The patient's history of a child with syndactyly (a limb abnormality) and hydrocele (which can be associated with NTDs) also raises suspicion for developmental abnormalities.\n\n(Choice A) Duodenal atresia results from impaired recanalization of the duodenum due to failure of epithelial cell apoptosis. This condition causes elevated amniotic fluid volume but not elevated AChE on amniocentesis. The syndactyly in the patient's first child could be an example of failed apoptosis of mesenchyme between digits, but it is not directly related to the elevated AChE.\n\n(Choices C, E, and F) Failure of the thyroglossal duct to involute can cause a persistent thyroglossal duct cyst. Hirschsprung disease involves failed neural crest cell migration into the sigmoid colon/rectum. Failure of the processus vaginalis to obliterate can lead to congenital hydrocele or indirect inguinal hernia. None of these conditions are associated with increased AChE in the amniotic fluid because they do not involve a persistent opening between the fetal neural tube and the amniotic cavity.\n\n(Choice D) Meiotic nondisjunction of chromosome 21 leads to Down syndrome. Advanced maternal age is a risk factor for Down syndrome. Down syndrome typically presents with low AFP and normal AChE levels in the amniotic fluid, not elevated AChE.\n\nEducational objective: Neural tube defects (NTDs) most often occur when the neural folds fail to fuse in the region of the anterior or posterior neuropores. An open NTD allows leakage of alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase into the amniotic fluid, leading to elevated levels detected on amniocentesis.",
    "zh": "患者羊水中乙酰胆碱酯酶(AChE)水平升高提示神经管缺陷(NTD)。AChE是一种通常高浓度存在于脑脊液(CSF)中的酶。羊水中AChE升高表明胎儿脑脊液漏入羊膜腔，这种情况发生在神经管开放性缺陷时。神经管缺陷发生在胎儿发育的第四周，由于神经板边缘融合失败。这种失败可导致无脑畸形（颅端神经孔闭合失败）或脊柱裂（尾端神经孔闭合失败）。神经管和羊膜腔之间的持续开放使得AFP和AChE泄漏到羊水中。患者的病史中，其孩子患有并指(一种肢体畸形)和鞘膜积液(可能与NTD相关)，也增加了对发育异常的怀疑。\n\n(选项A) 十二指肠闭锁是由上皮细胞凋亡失败导致十二指肠复管受损引起的。这种情况会导致羊水增多，但羊膜穿刺术中AChE不会升高。患者第一个孩子的并指可能是指间间充质细胞凋亡失败的一个例子，但它与升高的AChE没有直接关系。\n\n(选项C、E和F) 甲状舌管退化失败可引起持续性甲状舌管囊肿。Hirschsprung病涉及神经嵴细胞向乙状结肠/直肠迁移失败。阴道鞘突闭锁失败可导致先天性鞘膜积液或腹股沟斜疝。这些情况均与羊水中AChE升高无关，因为它们不涉及胎儿神经管和羊膜腔之间的持续开口。\n\n(选项D) 21号染色体的减数分裂不分离导致唐氏综合征。高龄产妇是唐氏综合征的危险因素。唐氏综合征通常表现为羊水中AFP降低和AChE水平正常，而不是AChE升高。\n\n教育目标：神经管缺陷（NTD）最常发生在神经褶在前后神经孔区域融合失败时。开放性NTD允许甲胎蛋白和乙酰胆碱酯酶泄漏到羊水中，导致羊膜穿刺术中检测到水平升高。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of neural tube defects (NTDs), their embryological basis, and their detection via amniocentesis. Specifically, it assesses the ability to correlate elevated amniotic fluid acetylcholinesterase levels with failed fusion of the neural plate edges during embryonic development.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recognize that elevated amniotic fluid acetylcholinesterase is a marker for an open neural tube defect. Then, recall the embryological process of neural tube formation and identify which option represents the failure leading to such defects. Ruling out other developmental abnormalities based on their typical biochemical markers in amniotic fluid is also crucial.",
