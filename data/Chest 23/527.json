    "en": "A 24-year-old man comes to the office due to paroxysmal episodes of breathlessness and wheezing for the past 6 months. He does not recognize any triggers for these episodes and reports they are not associated with exercise or stress. The patient has no history of recent illness. He had eczema as a child. The patient has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Lung examination shows good air movement and no wheezing. Sputum microscopy reveals many granule-containing cells and crystalloid masses. The sputum findings in this patient are a direct result of which of the following cytokines?",

    "en": "This patient's presentation of paroxysmal breathlessness and wheezing, along with a history of eczema and sputum microscopy showing granule-containing cells (eosinophils) and Charcot-Leyden crystals, is highly suggestive of ATOPIC ASTHMA. Atopic asthma is a T H 2 -mediated allergic inflammatory disease. The pathogenesis involves sensitization to environmental aero-allergens, leading to the production of IgE antibodies. Upon re-exposure, these antibodies bind to mast cells and eosinophils, triggering the release of inflammatory mediators. \n\nIL-5 is a CRITICAL cytokine in the development and activation of eosinophils. It promotes eosinophil proliferation, differentiation, survival, and recruitment to the airways. The granule-containing cells seen in the sputum microscopy are eosinophils, and their presence is a hallmark of allergic inflammation in asthma. Therefore, the sputum findings are a direct result of IL-5.\n\n(Choice A) Although IL-1 release from macrophages is involved in asthma pathogenesis, it is a component of almost all inflammatory processes and does not specifically drive eosinophil recruitment or activation. It is not the primary cytokine responsible for the observed sputum findings.\n\n(Choice C) IL-12 functions to promote the differentiation of T H 1 cells and is involved in cell-mediated immunity. It is not directly involved in eosinophil recruitment or the pathogenesis of atopic asthma.\n\n(Choice D) Interferon-gamma is secreted by T H 1 cells and activates macrophages, playing a role in adaptive immunity against intracellular pathogens. It is not directly chemotactic for eosinophils and is not the primary driver of eosinophilic inflammation in asthma.\n\n(Choice E) Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is a growth factor involved in tissue regeneration and repair and is associated with subepithelial fibrosis and airway remodeling seen in chronic asthma. However, it is not directly chemotactic for eosinophils and is not the primary cytokine responsible for the acute inflammatory findings in the sputum.\n\nKey clinical pearls:\n- ATOPIC ASTHMA is characterized by T H 2 inflammation and eosinophilia.\n- IL-5 is the key cytokine for EOSINOPHIL development, survival, and recruitment.\n- Sputum microscopy showing eosinophils and Charcot-Leyden crystals is diagnostic for allergic airway inflammation.",
    "zh": "该患者出现阵发性呼吸困难和喘息，以及湿疹病史和痰液显微镜检查显示含颗粒细胞（嗜酸性粒细胞）和夏科-莱登晶体，高度提示特应性哮喘。特应性哮喘是一种由T H 2介导的过敏性炎症性疾病。其发病机制涉及对环境中的气传过敏原的敏化，导致IgE抗体的产生。再次暴露后，这些抗体与肥大细胞和嗜酸性粒细胞结合，触发炎症介质的释放。\n\nIL-5是嗜酸性粒细胞发育和激活的关键细胞因子。它促进嗜酸性粒细胞的增殖、分化、存活和向气道的募集。在痰液显微镜检查中可见的含颗粒细胞是嗜酸性粒细胞，它们的存在是哮喘中过敏性炎症的标志。因此，痰液结果是IL-5的直接结果。\n\n（选项A）尽管巨噬细胞释放的IL-1参与哮喘的发病机制，但它是几乎所有炎症过程的一部分，并未特异性地驱动嗜酸性粒细胞的募集或激活。它不是导致观察到的痰液结果的主要细胞因子。\n\n（选项C）IL-12的功能是促进T H 1细胞的分化，并参与细胞介导的免疫。它与嗜酸性粒细胞的募集或特应性哮喘的发病机制没有直接关系。\n\n（选项D）干扰素-γ由T H 1细胞分泌，并激活巨噬细胞，在针对细胞内病原体的适应性免疫中发挥作用。它对嗜酸性粒细胞没有直接的趋化作用，也不是哮喘中嗜酸性粒细胞炎症的主要驱动因素。\n\n（选项E）转化生长因子β（TGF-β）是一种参与组织再生和修复的生长因子，与慢性哮喘中可见的上皮下纤维化和气道重塑有关。然而，它对嗜酸性粒细胞没有直接的趋化作用，也不是导致痰液中急性炎症发现的主要细胞因子。\n\n关键临床要点：\n- 特应性哮喘的特征是T H 2炎症和嗜酸性粒细胞增多。\n- IL-5是嗜酸性粒细胞发育、存活和募集的关键细胞因子。\n- 痰液显微镜检查显示嗜酸性粒细胞和夏科-莱登晶体是诊断过敏性气道炎症的依据。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the immunological mechanisms underlying atopic asthma, specifically the role of cytokines in eosinophilic inflammation. It requires correlating clinical presentation and sputum findings with the specific cytokine responsible for eosinophil recruitment and activation.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the clinical features suggestive of atopic asthma, recognize that the sputum findings indicate eosinophilic inflammation, and recall the cytokine that is central to eosinophil biology, which is IL-5.",
