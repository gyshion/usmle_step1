    "en": "A 33-year-old man with a 2-year history of Crohn ileocolitis comes to the clinic with left-sided flank pain that started in the morning. The pain is 8 on a scale of 0-10 in intensity and is characterized as sharp. The pain is also colicky and radiates to the left groin. The patient has no nausea or vomiting. He is in moderate distress and has trouble lying still during the examination. Urinalysis shows hematuria. A day later, the patient passes a urinary stone. Abdominal imaging reveals several additional kidney stones. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's kidney stones?",

    "en": "Crohn disease is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by patchy granulomatous inflammation. Any area of the gastrointestinal tract may be involved, but involvement of the terminal ileum is especially common. Bile acids, which facilitate the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, are normally reabsorbed in the ileum, recycled in the liver, and then reused in the absorptive process. When the terminal ileum is inflamed, bile acids are lost in the feces, leading to impaired fat absorption. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nIn the healthy bowel, dietary calcium binds to dietary oxalate, producing insoluble calcium oxalate salts that are eliminated in the feces. But in malabsorptive syndromes such as Crohn disease, calcium forms soap complexes with the excess fat in the intestinal lumen and is unavailable for complexing with oxalate. As a result, free oxalate absorption is increased and subsequently filtered into the urine, promoting the formation of oxalate kidney stones (enteric oxaluria).\n\n(Choice A) Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by defective dibasic amino acid transport in the proximal renal tubules. The urine becomes supersaturated with cystine, leading to formation of cystine stones beginning in childhood or adolescence. Crohn disease can cause malabsorption of dietary protein and amino acids, but this is due to inflammation, not abnormal amino acid transporters: patients are not predisposed to cystine stones.\n\n(Choice B) Patients with Crohn disease commonly develop vitamin/nutrient deficiencies (eg, vitamin D, calcium) due to malabsorption, which can reduce bone mineral density and increase the risk of fractures. Secondary hyperparathyroidism may be present, but unlike primary hyperparathyroidism does not promote kidney stone formation.\n\n(Choice C) Uric acid stones may develop from conditions associated with rapid cell turnover (eg, myeloproliferative disease, hemolytic anemia) due to chronically increased uric acid production. The stones seen in Crohn disease are composed of calcium oxalate rather than uric acid.\n\n(Choice E) Alkalinization of the urine by urease-producing organisms (eg, Proteus, Klebsiella) in the upper urinary tract can promote formation of stones made up of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and calcium carbonate apatite. Although patients with Crohn disease can develop enterovesicular fistulas and recurrent urinary tract infections, this patient has no features of urinary infection (eg, fever, dysuria, pyuria).\n\nEducational objective:\nCrohn disease is associated with oxalate kidney stones. Impaired bile acid absorption in the terminal ileum leads to loss of bile acids in feces with subsequent fat malabsorption. Intestinal lipids then bind calcium ions, and the resulting soap complex is excreted. Free oxalate (normally bound by calcium to form an unabsorbable complex) is absorbed and forms urinary calculi (enteric oxaluria).",
    "zh": "克罗恩病是一种以斑片状肉芽肿性炎症为特征的炎症性肠病。胃肠道的任何部位都可能受累，但末端回肠受累尤为常见。胆汁酸有助于吸收脂肪和脂溶性维生素，通常在回肠中被重吸收，在肝脏中循环，然后在吸收过程中被重复使用。当末端回肠发炎时，胆汁酸会随粪便排出，导致脂肪吸收受损。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n在健康的肠道中，膳食钙与膳食草酸盐结合，产生不溶性草酸钙盐，这些盐通过粪便排出。但在克罗恩病等吸收不良综合征中，钙与肠腔内过多的脂肪形成肥皂复合物，而无法与草酸盐结合。因此，游离草酸盐的吸收增加，随后被滤入尿液，促进草酸钙肾结石的形成（肠源性草酸尿症）。\n\n（选项 A）胱氨酸尿症是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是近端肾小管中碱性氨基酸转运缺陷。尿液变得胱氨酸过饱和，导致胱氨酸结石形成，始于儿童期或青春期。克罗恩病可导致膳食蛋白和氨基酸吸收不良，但这归因于炎症，而非异常的氨基酸转运蛋白：患者不会易患胱氨酸结石。\n\n（选项 B）克罗恩病患者常因吸收不良而出现维生素/营养素缺乏症（如维生素 D、钙），这会降低骨密度并增加骨折风险。可能存在继发性甲状旁腺功能亢进症，但与原发性甲状旁腺功能亢进症不同，不会促进肾结石形成。\n\n（选项 C）痛风石可能由与细胞快速更新相关的疾病引起（例如，骨髓增生性疾病、溶血性贫血），这是由于慢性尿酸生成增加所致。克罗恩病中可见的结石由草酸钙而非尿酸组成。\n\n（选项 E）由尿素酶产生细菌（例如，变形杆菌、克雷伯菌）引起的尿液碱化可促进上尿路中由磷酸镁铵（鸟粪石）和磷灰石碳酸钙组成的结石形成。尽管克罗恩病患者可发生肠膀胱瘘和反复尿路感染，但该患者没有尿路感染的特征（例如，发烧、排尿困难、脓尿）。\n\n教育目标：\n克罗恩病与草酸钙肾结石相关。末端回肠中胆汁酸吸收受损导致粪便中胆汁酸流失，随后发生脂肪吸收不良。肠道脂质随后与钙离子结合，形成的肥皂复合物被排出。游离草酸盐（通常与钙结合形成不可吸收的复合物）被吸收并形成尿路结石（肠源性草酸尿症）。"

The question requires understanding of the pathophysiology of enteric oxaluria in the context of inflammatory bowel disease. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's Crohn's disease history and the presence of kidney stones. Recall that Crohn's disease, particularly involving the terminal ileum, can lead to fat malabsorption, causing increased oxalate absorption and subsequent oxalate kidney stone formation.",
