    "en": "This patient with upper respiratory symptoms (eg, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion) now has a barking cough, retractions, and inspiratory stridor, symptoms suggestive of croup.\n\nCroup is a viral infection caused by the PARAINFLUENZA VIRUS most commonly seen in children age 6 months to 3 years. The virus spreads from the nasopharyngeal mucosa to the larynx and trachea, causing inflammation and edema of the proximal trachea (ie, subglottis) {{exhibit_2}}. Narrowing at this area creates a partial airway obstruction, which results in inspiratory stridor, hoarseness, and a barking cough. X-ray may reveal subglottic narrowing (ie, steeple sign).\n\n(Choice A) The nasal mucosa is likely inflamed and edematous in this patient, leading to nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. However, edema of the nasal mucosa does not lead to stridor or a barking cough.\n\n(Choice B) The tonsils are located in the oropharynx and can become inflamed and edematous in conditions such as mononucleosis or a peritonsillar abscess. Although severe swelling in the oropharynx can lead to airway obstruction, it classically presents with voice changes (ie, hot potato voice) but not a barking cough.\n\n(Choice C) Inflammation and edema of the submandibular and sublingual spaces is characteristic of Ludwig angina, a rapidly progressive cellulitis that can lead to airway obstruction due to displacement of the tongue posteriorly. However, this typically occurs in adults due to an infection in the mandibular molars and presents with a firm, elevated floor of mouth, \"woody\" induration of the neck, drooling, and tripod positioning.\n\n(Choice D) Epiglottitis is a severe infection that can lead to stridor and respiratory distress. However, it does not cause a barking cough. In addition, it typically occurs in unimmunized children and patients typically appear very ill, anxious, and have high fever, difficulty swallowing, drooling, and tripod positioning. In contrast, children with croup are generally comfortable, even in the supine position; if visualized, they would have a normal-appearing epiglottis.\n\n(Choice E) Esophagitis can cause dysphagia, odynophagia, and chest pain. It does not lead to airway obstruction. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者出现上呼吸道症状（如鼻溢、鼻塞），现在出现犬吠样咳嗽、内陷和吸气性喘鸣，这些症状提示为哮吼。\n\n哮吼是由副流感病毒引起的病毒感染，最常见于6个月至3岁的儿童。病毒从鼻咽粘膜扩散到喉和气管，导致近端气管（即声门下）的炎症和水肿 {{exhibit_2}}。该区域的狭窄会造成部分气道阻塞，导致吸气性喘鸣、声音嘶哑和犬吠样咳嗽。X光片可能显示声门下狭窄（即尖塔征）。\n\n(选项 A) 该患者的鼻粘膜可能发炎和水肿，导致鼻塞和鼻溢。然而，鼻粘膜水肿不会导致喘鸣或犬吠样咳嗽。\n\n(选项 B) 扁桃体位于口咽部，在单核细胞增多症或扁桃体周围脓肿等情况下会发炎和水肿。尽管口咽部严重肿胀可导致气道阻塞，但其典型表现为声音变化（即含糊不清的语音），而非犬吠样咳嗽。\n\n(选项 C) 下颌下和舌下间隙的炎症和水肿是路德维希咽峡炎的特征，这是一种快速进展的蜂窝织炎，由于舌头向后移位，可导致气道阻塞。然而，这种情况通常发生在成年人中，原因是下颌磨牙感染，其表现为口腔底部坚硬隆起、颈部“木质”硬结、流涎和三脚架体位。\n\n(选项 D) 会厌炎是一种严重感染，可导致喘鸣和呼吸窘迫。然而，它不会引起犬吠样咳嗽。此外，它通常发生在未接种疫苗的儿童中，患者通常看起来病得很重，焦虑，并伴有高烧、吞咽困难、流口水和三脚架体位。相比之下，患有哮吼的儿童通常感觉舒适，即使是仰卧位；如果能看到，他们的会厌会正常显示。\n\n(选项 E) 食管炎可引起吞咽困难、吞咽痛和胸痛。它不会导致气道阻塞。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of croup (laryngotracheobronchitis), its etiology, clinical presentation, and the anatomical location of the inflammation causing the characteristic symptoms. Croup is typically caused by the parainfluenza virus, leading to inflammation and edema in the subglottic region of the trachea. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic symptoms of croup (barking cough, inspiratory stridor, and retractions) and associate them with the subglottic region. Rule out other causes of upper airway obstruction based on their distinct clinical features and anatomical locations.",
