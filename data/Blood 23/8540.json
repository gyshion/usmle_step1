    "en": "A 67-year-old man comes to the office due to severe fatigue for the past several months. The patient cannot eat as much as he used to and has lost nearly 10 kg (22 lb) in the past 6 months. Physical examination shows mucosal pallor, hepatomegaly, and massive splenomegaly. Further evaluation reveals a gain-of-function mutation of a non-receptor tyrosine kinase protein in hematopoietic cells, leading to persistent activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins. This patient is most likely suffering from which of the following disorders?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The chronic myeloproliferative disorders are bone marrow diseases characterized by overproduction of myeloid cells. Primary myelofibrosis {{exhibit_1}} is caused by atypical megakaryocytic hyperplasia, which stimulates fibroblast proliferation, resulting in progressive replacement of the marrow space by extensive collagen deposition. In the early stages, there is marrow hypercellularity with minimal fibrosis, but as the disease progresses, pancytopenia can result. Hepatomegaly and massive splenomegaly develop because the loss of bone marrow hematopoiesis is compensated for by extramedullary hematopoiesis. The peripheral smear characteristically shows teardrop-shaped red blood cells (dacrocytes) and nucleated red blood cells.\n\nWith the exception of chronic myelogenous leukemia, the chronic myeloproliferative disorders (especially polycythemia vera) frequently harbor a mutation in the nonreceptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). This mutation results in CONSTITUTIVE TYROSINE PHOSPHORYLATION ACTIVITY, and consequently, in the cytokine-independent activation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway. Once they are activated, STAT proteins translocate to the nucleus and promote transcription. A JAK2 inhibitor (ruxolitinib) has been approved for treatment of primary myelofibrosis.\n\n(Choice A) In acute promyelocytic leukemia, t(15;17) leads to the formation of a fusion gene between the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) genes. The abnormal PML/RARA fusion protein blocks differentiation of myeloid precursors.\n\n(Choice B) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a lymphoproliferative disorder involving B lymphocytes. The most significant laboratory finding is marked lymphocytosis, with \"smudge cells\" seen on peripheral blood smear. The majority of cases exhibit increased expression of the proto-oncogene BCL2; a similar finding occurs in follicular lymphomas.\n\n(Choices C and D) Several high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) are associated with cytogenetic abnormalities. The t(8;14) translocation involves the c-Myc oncogene and is common in Burkitt lymphoma, which is associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection and classically has a \"starry sky\" histological appearance. Mantle cell lymphoma is a low grade NHL characterized by t(11;14), leading to cyclin D1 overexpression.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe chronic myeloproliferative disorders (polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, and primary myelofibrosis) often have a mutation in Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase. This results in constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, and consequently, in the cytokine-independent activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins (JAK-STAT signaling pathway).",
    "zh": "慢性骨髓增生性疾病是以髓系细胞过度增生为特征的骨髓疾病。原发性骨髓纤维化 {{exhibit_1}} 是由非典型巨核细胞增生引起，刺激成纤维细胞增殖，导致骨髓腔逐渐被广泛的胶原沉积所取代。在早期，骨髓高度细胞增生，纤维化程度轻微，但随着疾病进展，可导致全血细胞减少。肝肿大和巨大的脾肿大是由于骨髓造血功能丧失，代偿性髓外造血所致。外周血涂片特征性地显示泪滴状红细胞（异形红细胞）和有核红细胞。\n\n除了慢性髓细胞白血病外，慢性骨髓增生性疾病（尤其是真性红细胞增多症）常携带非受体细胞质酪氨酸激酶Janus激酶2（JAK2）的突变。这种突变导致持续的酪氨酸磷酸化活性，进而导致信号转导和转录激活因子（STAT）通路的细胞因子非依赖性激活。一旦被激活，STAT蛋白会易位至细胞核并促进转录。一种JAK2抑制剂（ruxolitinib）已被批准用于治疗原发性骨髓纤维化。\n\n（选项 A）在急性早幼粒细胞白血病中，t(15;17)导致早幼粒细胞白血病（PML）和维甲酸受体α（RARA）基因之间形成融合基因。异常的PML/RARA融合蛋白阻碍髓系前体细胞分化。\n\n（选项 B）慢性淋巴细胞白血病是一种涉及B淋巴细胞的淋巴增殖性疾病。最重要的实验室发现是明显的淋巴细胞增多症，在外周血涂片上可见“涂抹细胞”。大多数病例表现出原癌基因BCL2的表达增加；在滤泡性淋巴瘤中也出现类似的发现。\n\n（选项 C 和 D）几种高级别非霍奇金淋巴瘤（NHL）与细胞遗传学异常有关。t(8;14)易位涉及c-Myc癌基因，在Burkitt淋巴瘤中很常见，后者与Epstein-Barr病毒感染有关，并具有典型的“星空”组织学表现。套细胞淋巴瘤是一种低级别NHL，其特征是t(11;14)，导致细胞周期蛋白D1过度表达。\n\n教育目标：\n慢性骨髓增生性疾病（真性红细胞增多症、原发性血小板增多症和原发性骨髓纤维化）通常具有Janus激酶2（JAK2）的突变，这是一种细胞质酪氨酸激酶。这导致组成型酪氨酸激酶活性，进而导致信号转导和转录激活因子（STAT）蛋白（JAK-STAT信号通路）的细胞因子非依赖性激活。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of myeloproliferative disorders, specifically primary myelofibrosis, and its clinical presentation, pathophysiology involving JAK-STAT pathway mutations, and characteristic findings like hepatosplenomegaly and fatigue. It also requires differentiating primary myelofibrosis from other hematologic malignancies based on clinical and molecular features. \n\nTo solve this question, focus on the patient's symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly), the presence of a gain-of-function mutation affecting the STAT pathway, and rule out other hematologic malignancies based on their distinct features (e.g., smudge cells in CLL, specific translocations in APL and lymphomas).",
