  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disease characterized by serous fluid–filled, tense bullae on normal or erythematous skin. The most common sites of involvement include the inner thighs and flexor aspects of the forearms, axillae, groin, and lower abdomen. Elderly individuals are most commonly affected.\n\nBP is caused by antibodies against hemidesmosomes along the basement membrane of the dermal-epidermal junction. These autoantibodies result in a destructive inflammatory cascade that causes the entire epidermis to separate from the dermis, forming subepidermal, nonacantholytic blisters. Immunofluorescence shows IgG and/or C3 deposits in a linear pattern along the basement membrane. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}} {{exhibit_10}} {{exhibit_11}} {{exhibit_12}}\n\n(Choice B) Acute allergic contact dermatitis is characterized by localized erythema, vesicles, edema, and severe pruritus. Biopsy typically shows spongiosis (abnormal accumulation of edema fluid in the intercellular spaces between keratinocytes) and lymphocytic perivascular infiltrates but no separation of the epidermis from the dermis.\n\n(Choice C) Dermatitis herpetiformis presents with small, pruritic papules and vesicles over extensor surfaces and is characterized histologically by microabscesses containing fibrin and neutrophils at the dermal papillae tips.\n\n(Choice D) Lichen planus causes pruritic, purple papules and plaques involving the skin and mucous membranes (not blisters). Microscopic analysis shows a lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermal-epidermal junction with destruction of basal epidermal cells.\n\n(Choice E) Pemphigus vulgaris is due to autoantibodies directed against desmosomal proteins. Biopsy of an active pemphigus lesion shows intraepithelial cleavage with detached keratinocytes (acantholysis), retained keratinocytes along the basement membrane, and an eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate.\n\nEducational objective:\nBullous pemphigoid is caused by autoantibodies against hemidesmosomes along the basement membrane of the dermal-epidermal junction. This causes the entire epidermis to separate from the dermis and form tense, subepidermal blisters.",
    "zh": "大疱性类天疱疮（BP）是一种自身免疫性水疱病，其特征是在正常或红斑性皮肤上出现充满浆液性液体的张力性大疱。最常见的受累部位包括大腿内侧和前臂屈侧、腋窝、腹股沟和下腹部。老年人最常受到影响。\n\nBP是由针对真皮-表皮连接处基底膜沿线的半桥粒的抗体引起的。这些自身抗体导致破坏性炎症级联反应，导致整个表皮与真皮分离，形成表皮下、非棘层松解性水疱。免疫荧光显示IgG和/或C3呈线性模式沉积在基底膜沿线。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}} {{exhibit_10}} {{exhibit_11}} {{exhibit_12}}\n\n（选项B）急性过敏性接触性皮炎的特征是局部红斑、水疱、水肿和严重瘙痒。活检通常显示海绵状变性（角质形成细胞之间细胞间隙中水肿液异常积聚）和淋巴细胞性血管周围浸润，但表皮与真皮没有分离。\n\n（选项C）疱疹样皮炎表现为伸侧的小的瘙痒性丘疹和小疱，其组织学特征是在真皮乳头尖端有含纤维蛋白和中性粒细胞的微脓肿。\n\n（选项D）扁平苔藓引起皮肤和黏膜（不是水疱）受累的瘙痒性紫红色丘疹和斑块。显微镜分析显示真皮-表皮连接处有淋巴细胞浸润，伴有基底表皮细胞破坏。\n\n（选项E）寻常型天疱疮是由于针对桥粒蛋白的自身抗体引起的。活跃的天疱疮病变的活检显示上皮内裂解，伴有脱落的角质形成细胞（棘层松解）、沿基底膜保留的角质形成细胞和嗜酸性粒细胞炎症浸润。\n\n教育目标：\n大疱性类天疱疮是由针对真皮-表皮连接处基底膜沿线的半桥粒的自身抗体引起的。这导致整个表皮与真皮分离并形成张力性表皮下水疱。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disease, including its clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and histological findings. It requires differentiating bullous pemphigoid from other blistering skin conditions based on clinical features and biopsy results. \n\nTo solve this question, focus on the patient's age, the presence of tense bullae, the location of the lesions, and the biopsy findings of subepidermal blisters.
