    "en": "A 56-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to palpitations that started several hours ago. He has not had similar symptoms before. The patient has had no chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or syncope. He drinks alcohol on weekends and does not use illicit drugs. He has no family history of heart disease. Blood pressure is 145/78 mm Hg. BMI is 40 kg/m². ECG is shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}. The patient is treated medically in the emergency department. He is then taken to the electrophysiology laboratory for radiofrequency catheter ablation to terminate his arrhythmia. The ablation procedure should create a conduction block through which of the following areas?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's ECG strip shows rapid and regular atrial activity in a saw-toothed pattern (flutter or F waves), consistent with ATRIAL FLUTTER. Narrow QRS complexes are typically present and the ventricular rhythm appears regular. Because the ATRIAL RATE is approximately 300/min, typical ventricular rates in atrial flutter are 150/min, 100/min, or 75/min due to 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1 conduction through the atrioventricular node, respectively.\n\nAtrial flutter shares many of the same triggers as atrial fibrillation; underlying comorbidities that cause atrial dilation (eg, heart failure) are often present and alcohol intake may contribute. Typical atrial flutter is caused by a large REENTRANT CIRCUIT that traverses the CAVOTRICUSPID ISTHMUS, the region of right atrial tissue between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve annulus. This region is identified during electrophysiologic study and is the target for radiofrequency ablation to interrupt the reentrant circuit and abolish atrial flutter {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}.\n\n(Choice A) An accessory pathway that bypasses the atrioventricular node is present in atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, also known as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. ECG shows the triad of short PR interval, wide QRS complex, and slurred upstroke of the QRS complex (delta wave).\n\n(Choice C) The right ventricular outflow tract is the most common origination site of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia; a repetitive monomorphic ventricular tachycardia that occurs in the absence of structural heart disease. ECG shows a wide QRS complex with uniform QRS morphology and a regular rhythm.\n\n(Choice D) The pulmonary vein ostia are often the origination site of atrial fibrillation, and catheter ablation of pulmonary vein trigger sites (pulmonary vein isolation) may be used to treat symptomatic patients. ECG reveals an irregularly irregular rhythm with varying R-R intervals and absence of P waves.\n\n(Choice E) Dual electrical pathways (a slow and fast pathway) within or near the atrioventricular node are implicated in atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia; the slow pathway is targeted for radiofrequency ablation. ECG shows narrow QRS complexes with a rapid rate and regular rhythm, and sometimes retrograde P waves.\n\nEducational objective:\nAtrial flutter demonstrates rapid and regular atrial activity in a saw-toothed pattern (flutter or F waves) on ECG. Typical atrial flutter is caused by a large reentrant circuit that traverses the cavotricuspid isthmus of the right atrium, which is the target site for radiofrequency ablation.",
    "zh": "该患者的心电图显示快速且规律的锯齿状心房活动（扑动或F波），与房扑一致。通常存在窄QRS波群，且心室节律呈规则性。由于心房率约为300/min，房扑时的典型心室率分别为150/min、100/min或75/min，这分别取决于通过房室结的2:1、3:1或4:1传导。\n\n房扑与房颤具有许多相同的触发因素；通常存在导致心房扩张的潜在合并症（如心力衰竭），并且饮酒可能有所贡献。典型的房扑是由穿过腔静脉-三尖瓣峡部（cavotricuspid isthmus）的大型折返环路引起的，该区域是右心房组织在下腔静脉和三尖瓣环之间的区域。该区域在电生理学研究中被确定，是射频消融术的目标，用于中断折返环路并消除房扑 {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}。\n\n（选项A）绕过房室结的旁路存在于房室折返性心动过速中，也称为WPW综合征。心电图显示短PR间期、宽QRS波群和QRS波群的斜坡上升（δ波）三联征。\n\n（选项C）右心室流出道是特发性室性心动过速（一种在无结构性心脏病时发生的重复性单形性室性心动过速）最常见的起源部位。心电图显示宽QRS波群，具有一致的QRS形态和规则的节律。\n\n（选项D）肺静脉口通常是房颤的起源部位，可使用导管消融肺静脉触发位点（肺静脉隔离）来治疗有症状的患者。心电图显示不规则的节律，R-R间期变化且无P波。\n\n（选项E）房室结内或附近的双电通路（慢通路和快通路）与房室结折返性心动过速有关；慢通路是射频消融术的目标。心电图显示窄QRS波群，心率快且节律规则，有时出现逆行P波。\n\n教育目标：\n房扑在心电图上表现为快速且规律的锯齿状心房活动（扑动或F波）。典型的房扑是由穿过右心房腔静脉-三尖瓣峡部的大型折返环路引起的，该区域是射频消融术的目标部位。"
