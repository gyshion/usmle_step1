    "en": "A 72-year-old man comes to the office due to palpitations and mild fatigue for the last 3 weeks. He has otherwise been feeling well. The patient walks 2 miles around his neighborhood twice per week with no chest pain or shortness of breath. Medical history is remarkable for benign prostatic hyperplasia, for which he takes terazosin. He drinks 1-2 cups of coffee every day and a glass of wine once or twice per month. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 128/68 mm Hg, and pulse is 78/min and irregular. Physical examination reveals a 2/6 early-peaking systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border. Carotid pulses are prompt and full bilaterally. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is no peripheral edema. ECG is shown in the exhibit t. {{exhibit_1}} Which of the following is most likely the strongest risk factor for this patient's presentation?",

    "en": "This patient with several weeks of palpitations and fatigue has atrial fibrillation, which is recognized on ECG by an irregularly irregular rhythm (irregular R-R intervals) and an absence of organized P waves. Atrial fibrillation usually occurs in the setting of atrial remodeling, which describes changes to the atrial myocardium that result from both normal aging and underlying comorbidities that cause atrial dilation (eg, hypertension, heart failure, mitral valve disease). Coronary artery disease and its associated risk factors (eg, diabetes mellitus, smoking) are also associated with atrial fibrillation, although their contribution may be primarily driven by ischemia that leads to left ventricular dysfunction and consequent left atrial dilation.\n\nAge, independent of comorbidities, is one of the strongest risk factors for atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is relatively rare in those age <40, but the prevalence is estimated at approximately 10% in those age >75 and approaches 20% in those age >85.\n\n(Choices B and D) After remodeling has created a susceptible substrate, certain triggers (eg, increased sympathetic drive) can initiate atrial fibrillation. Heavy alcohol use (eg, large binges or chronic ingestion of >1-2 drinks per day) is one such trigger, but occasional alcohol intake is unlikely to significantly contribute. High caffeine intake (eg, coffee) may somewhat encourage the triggering of atrial fibrillation (via increased sympathetic stimulation), but there is little evidence to support this association.\n\n(Choice C) This patient's early peaking systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with prompt and full carotid pulses is consistent with mild aortic stenosis. Both mitral regurgitation and especially mitral stenosis are strongly associated with atrial fibrillation as these valvular defects can cause left atrial dilation even in the absence of heart failure. However, aortic stenosis typically must be severe to cause left atrial dilation; mild aortic stenosis is not associated with atrial fibrillation.\n\n(Choice E) Beta adrenergic agonists (eg, albuterol) may sometimes trigger atrial fibrillation by stimulating the generation of ectopic conduction foci. However, terazosin is an alpha blocker and does not significantly affect cardiac conduction.\n\nEducational objective:\nAge, independent of comorbidities, is one of the strongest risk factors for atrial fibrillation as age-related change to the atrial myocardium is one of the primary contributors to atrial remodeling. Left atrial dilation is the other primary contributor to atrial remodeling; therefore, comorbidities that cause left atrial dilation (eg, hypertension, heart failure, mitral valve disease) are also strongly associated with atrial fibrillation. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "这位有几周心悸和疲劳的患者患有心房颤动，通过心电图可识别出不规则的心律（R-R间期不规则）和无规律的P波。心房颤动通常发生在心房重塑的情况下，这描述了心房心肌的变化，这些变化源于正常的衰老和导致心房扩张的潜在合并症（如高血压、心力衰竭、二尖瓣疾病）。冠状动脉疾病及其相关风险因素（如糖尿病、吸烟）也与心房颤动有关，尽管它们的作用可能主要由导致左心室功能障碍和随之而来的左心房扩张的缺血驱动。\n\n年龄，独立于合并症，是心房颤动最强的风险因素之一。心房颤动在40岁以下的人群中相对罕见，但在75岁以上的人群中，患病率估计约为10%，在85岁以上的人群中接近20%。\n\n（选项B和D）在重塑产生易感底物后，某些触发因素（如交感神经驱动增加）可引发心房颤动。大量饮酒（例如，大量饮酒或每天长期摄入1-2杯以上饮料）是其中一个触发因素，但偶尔饮酒不太可能显著促成。高咖啡因摄入（如咖啡）可能会在一定程度上促进心房颤动的触发（通过增加交感神经刺激），但几乎没有证据支持这种关联。\n\n（选项C）该患者在右侧胸骨上缘的早期收缩期杂音伴有清晰且饱满的颈动脉脉搏，与轻度主动脉瓣狭窄一致。二尖瓣反流，尤其是二尖瓣狭窄，与心房颤动密切相关，因为这些瓣膜缺陷即使在没有心力衰竭的情况下也会导致左心房扩张。然而，主动脉瓣狭窄通常必须很严重才能导致左心房扩张；轻度主动脉瓣狭窄与心房颤动无关。\n\n（选项E）β-肾上腺素能受体激动剂（如沙丁胺醇）有时可以通过刺激异位传导灶的产生来触发心房颤动。然而，特拉唑嗪是一种α受体阻滞剂，不会显着影响心脏传导。\n\n教育目标：\n年龄，独立于合并症，是心房颤动最强的风险因素之一，因为与年龄相关的心房心肌变化是心房重塑的主要促成因素之一。左心房扩张是心房重塑的另一个主要促成因素；因此，导致左心房扩张的合并症（如高血压、心力衰竭、二尖瓣疾病）也与心房颤动密切相关。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the risk factors for atrial fibrillation, with a focus on the significance of advanced age as a primary contributor. It also assesses understanding of how other factors like alcohol, caffeine, valvular disease, and medications can influence atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the patient's presentation as likely atrial fibrillation and then consider the most significant risk factor among the options. Age is the most important independent risk factor, especially in older individuals, while other options are less likely to be the primary driver in this case.",
