    "en": "This patient's phonocardiogram shows an early-peaking systolic murmur as well as a widely split S2 that is fixed (ie, no variation between inspiration and expiration). These findings are characteristic of an ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD), a common congenital heart lesion resulting in an abnormal connection between the right and left atria.\n\nLeft atrial pressure is normally slightly higher than in the right atrium due to the greater compliance of the thin-walled right ventricle; as a result, ASDs cause LEFT-TO-RIGHT SHUNTING. This blood flow has low velocity and turbulence and therefore does not create a murmur directly. Instead, the increased volume of blood delivered to the right heart (ie, normal venous return plus extra blood through the shunt) results in INCREASED BLOOD FLOW into the pulmonary arteries across the PULMONIC VALVE. This creates the characteristic early-peaking MIDSYSTOLIC EJECTION MURMUR over the left upper sternal border (ie, pulmonic flow murmur), as seen in this patient. Increased blood flow through the tricuspid valve may also cause a diastolic rumble at the left lower sternal border (not present in this patient).\n\nIncreased blood flow across the pulmonic valve also accounts for the characteristic ASD finding of a WIDELY SPLIT, FIXED S2. Under normal conditions, splitting of S2 is heard only during inspiration when there is increased venous return to the right heart. This results in delayed pulmonic valve closure (P2) relative to aortic valve closure (A2) due to the increased time needed for right ventricular blood ejection. With ASD, right ventricular volume remains increased throughout the entire respiratory cycle, leading to a persistently delayed P2 with no apparent respiratory variation in splitting.\n\n(Choice A) Aortic stenosis causes a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur over the right second intercostal space. A2 may be delayed until after P2 (paradoxical splitting) due to the increase in left ventricular ejection time.\n\n(Choice B) Ventricular septal defects create a holosystolic murmur along the left lower sternal border due to a high-pressure, left-to-right shunt. Splitting of S2 may be widened but is usually not fixed. Fixed splitting is more typical of ASDs because atrial shunts reduce the normal variation in right ventricular volume during the respiratory cycle (flow through the ASD increases when venous return decreases, minimizing inspiratory/expiratory differences in right ventricular volume).\n\n(Choice D) Aortic insufficiency is characterized by regurgitant blood flow through the aortic valve, resulting in a decrescendo diastolic murmur along the sternal border. Splitting of S2 is usually not affected.\n\nEducational objective:\nAn atrial septal defect leads to increased right-sided blood flow due to left-to-right shunting. Characteristic findings are an early-peaking midsystolic ejection murmur over the left upper sternal border (ie, pulmonic flow murmur) and wide and fixed splitting of S2.",
    "zh": "该患者的心音图显示早期峰值收缩期杂音以及广泛分裂的S2，且S2固定（即，吸气和呼气之间没有变化）。这些发现是心房间隔缺损(ASD)的特征，这是一种常见的先天性心脏病变，导致右心房和左心房之间的异常连接。\n\n由于薄壁右心室的顺应性更大，左心房压力通常略高于右心房；因此，ASD会导致左向右分流。这种血流速度低，且存在湍流，因此不会直接产生杂音。相反，输送到右心的血量增加（即，正常的静脉回流加上通过分流的额外血液）导致通过肺动脉的血流量增加。这会在左上胸骨缘产生特征性的早期峰值中期收缩期喷射性杂音（即，肺动脉血流杂音），如该患者所示。通过三尖瓣的血流量增加也可能导致在左下胸骨缘出现舒张期隆隆声（该患者未出现）。\n\n通过肺动脉瓣的血流量增加也解释了ASD的特征性发现，即广泛分裂、固定的S2。在正常情况下，只有在吸气时才能听到S2的分裂，此时右心房的静脉回流增加。这会导致肺动脉瓣关闭（P2）相对于主动脉瓣关闭（A2）延迟，因为右心室血液喷射需要更多的时间。对于ASD，右心室容量在整个呼吸周期中保持增加，导致持续延迟的P2，且分裂没有明显的呼吸变化。\n\n（选项A）主动脉瓣狭窄会在右侧第二肋间隙产生渐强-减弱的收缩期杂音。由于左心室射血时间增加，A2可能会延迟到P2之后（反常分裂）。\n\n（选项B）室间隔缺损由于高压的左向右分流，会在左下胸骨缘产生全收缩期杂音。S2的分裂可能会加宽，但通常不会固定。固定分裂更典型于ASD，因为心房分流减少了呼吸周期中右心室容量的正常变化（当静脉回流减少时，通过ASD的血流量增加，从而最小化吸气/呼气时右心室容量的差异）。\n\n（选项D）主动脉瓣关闭不全的特征是血液通过主动脉瓣的反流，导致沿胸骨缘出现减弱的舒张期杂音。S2的分裂通常不受影响。\n\n教育目标：\n心房间隔缺损会导致右侧血流量增加，这是由于左向右分流所致。特征性发现是在左上胸骨缘出现早期峰值中期收缩期喷射性杂音（即，肺动脉血流杂音），以及S2的广泛且固定分裂。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of atrial septal defect (ASD) and its characteristic auscultatory findings, including a midsystolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border and a fixed, widely split S2. It also requires understanding the pathophysiology of left-to-right shunting in ASD and its impact on pulmonary blood flow.\n\nTo solve this question, analyze the phonocardiogram for the presence of a systolic murmur and fixed splitting of S2. Recognize that these findings are highly suggestive of ASD. Eliminate other options based on their typical murmur characteristics and associated S2 splitting patterns.",
