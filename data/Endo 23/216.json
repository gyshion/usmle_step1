    "en": "Pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the gonadotroph cells in the anterior pituitary. LH stimulates the release of testosterone from the Leydig cells in the interstitium of the testicles; and FSH stimulates the release of inhibin B from the Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules of the testicles. Testosterone and inhibin B induce negative feedback on LH and FSH production, respectively. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nFSH also stimulates the Sertoli cells to produce androgen-binding protein locally, within the seminiferous tubules. This androgen-binding protein is responsible for the high local testosterone concentration and is different from sex hormone-binding globulin, which is found in the blood. High local levels of testosterone and FSH are necessary for spermatogenesis. Defective FSH receptors will prevent spermatogenesis and cause low inhibin B levels, because FSH is responsible for both spermatogenesis and inhibin B production.\n\n(Choice A) FSH levels will be high in patients with FSH receptor defects because there is no negative feedback from inhibin B; inhibin B cannot be produced without proper functioning of the FSH pathway.\n\n(Choices B and D) LH and testosterone levels are likely to be normal in this patient because FSH does not play a role in either LH or testosterone feedback. Since the FSH receptor defect is isolated, this patient will have normal testosterone and LH levels.\n\n(Choice E) The circulating levels of other androgens such as DHEA, DHEAS, and androstenedione are also not affected by FSH.\n\nEducational objective:\nLH stimulates the release of testosterone from the Leydig cells of the testes; FSH stimulates the release of inhibin B from the Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules. Testosterone and inhibin B induce negative feedback on LH and FSH production, respectively.",
    "zh": "下丘脑释放促性腺激素释放激素（GnRH）的脉冲式分泌刺激垂体前叶的促性腺细胞释放促卵泡刺激素（FSH）和黄体生成素（LH）。LH刺激睾丸间质的Leydig细胞释放睾酮；FSH刺激睾丸生精小管中Sertoli细胞释放抑制素B。睾酮和抑制素B分别对LH和FSH的产生产生负反馈。{{exhibit_1}}\n\nFSH还刺激Sertoli细胞在生精小管内局部产生雄激素结合蛋白。这种雄激素结合蛋白负责局部高睾酮浓度，它不同于在血液中发现的性激素结合球蛋白。高水平的局部睾酮和FSH对精子生成是必需的。FSH受体缺陷将阻止精子生成，并导致抑制素B水平低，因为FSH负责精子生成和抑制素B的产生。\n\n（选项A）FSH水平在FSH受体缺陷的患者中会升高，因为没有来自抑制素B的负反馈；如果没有FSH通路的正常功能，就无法产生抑制素B。\n\n（选项B和D）该患者的LH和睾酮水平可能正常，因为FSH在LH或睾酮反馈中不起作用。由于FSH受体缺陷是孤立的，该患者将有正常的睾酮和LH水平。\n\n（选项E）其他雄激素（如DHEA、DHEAS和雄烯二酮）的循环水平也不会受到FSH的影响。\n\n教育目标：LH刺激睾丸Leydig细胞释放睾酮；FSH刺激生精小管中Sertoli细胞释放抑制素B。睾酮和抑制素B分别对LH和FSH的产生产生负反馈。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and the role of FSH in stimulating inhibin B production by Sertoli cells. It also assesses understanding of the negative feedback loops involved in regulating hormone levels.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that FSH stimulates Sertoli cells to produce inhibin B. If FSH receptors are defective, inhibin B production will be impaired, leading to decreased levels of inhibin B. The other hormones are not directly affected by the FSH receptor defect.",
    "zh": "这道题测试对下丘脑-垂体-性腺轴以及FSH在刺激Sertoli细胞产生抑制素B中的作用的了解。它还评估对参与调节激素水平的负反馈回路的理解。\n\n要解决这个问题，请回忆一下FSH刺激Sertoli细胞产生抑制素B。如果FSH受体有缺陷，抑制素B的产生将受损，导致抑制素B水平降低。其他激素不会直接受到FSH受体缺陷的影响。"
