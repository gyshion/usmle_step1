    "en": "A 62-year-old woman comes to the office due to a change in bowel habits. For 2 months, she has had bowel movements once every 5 or 6 days. The patient describes her stools as hard and lumpy and of small volume; defecation is uncomfortable. She has no trouble passing gas and has no other symptoms, including no nausea, vomiting, or weight changes. The patient was admitted to the hospital 3 months ago for acute diverticulitis, and her hospital course was complicated by new-onset atrial fibrillation. Colonoscopy a month after hospitalization revealed sigmoid diverticulosis but no masses or polyps. The patient takes fiber supplements, diltiazem, and apixaban. She does not use tobacco or alcohol. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiac auscultation reveals an irregular heart rhythm but no murmurs. Abdominal examination is significant for mild distension.",

    "en": "Constipation is an exceedingly common gastrointestinal condition with a wide variety of underlying etiologies (eg, autonomic neuropathy, hypothyroidism, electrolyte abnormalities). In this patient who developed constipation after new-onset atrial fibrillation, the most likely etiology is a drug effect related to diltiazem.\n\nDiltiazem and verapamil are non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers that decrease conduction velocity in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes and are often used in the management of atrial fibrillation. Constipation, a common adverse effect, occurs due to inhibition of the colonic migrating motor complex, resulting in slowed contractions of colonic smooth muscle. This is not typically seen with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine, nifedipine).\n\nOther common medications that cause constipation include opiates, serotonin 5-HT3 antagonists (eg, ondansetron), iron tablets, aluminum-containing agents (eg, antacids), and medications with anticholinergic properties (eg, diphenhydramine, tricyclic antidepressants, first-generation antipsychotics).\n\n(Choice A) Alterations in the colonic microbiome are common after antibiotic therapy but typically cause diarrhea (eg, Clostridioides [formerly Clostridium] difficile colitis), not constipation.\n\n(Choice B) The gastrocolic reflex is a neurogenic reflex triggered by gastric distension from food, leading to colonic contractions; impairment of the reflex can cause constipation. However, this typically occurs in patients with diabetic neuropathy and gastroparesis.\n\n(Choice C) Inappropriate contraction of pelvic floor muscles occurs with dyssynergic defecation, preventing the expulsion of stool from the rectum. Dyssynergic defecation is more common in the elderly and often associated with neurologic disorders (eg, PARKINSON disease) or trauma. The development of symptoms after this patient started diltiazem is more consistent with medication-induced constipation.\n\n(Choice E) A rectocele, which occurs when the rectum prolapses into the posterior vaginal wall, usually develops in elderly, multiparous women. Although constipation is common, patients usually describe pelvic pressure and the need to manually push on the vagina or rectum to defecate.\n\n(Choice F) Sigmoid volvulus typically presents with progressive abdominal pain, nausea, and constipation and eventually results in bowel obstruction (eg, failure to pass gas, obstipation, possible perforation). Symptoms occur over the course of days, not months.\n\nEducational objective:\nConstipation is a common adverse effect of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem, verapamil). Other medications that cause constipation include opiates, 5-HT3 antagonists, iron tablets, aluminum-containing antacids, and medications with anticholinergic properties.",
    "zh": "便秘是一种非常常见的胃肠道疾病，具有多种潜在病因（例如，自主神经病变、甲状腺功能减退、电解质异常）。对于该患者，在新发房颤后出现便秘，最可能的病因是与地尔硫卓相关的药物作用。\n\n地尔硫卓和维拉帕米是非二氢吡啶类钙通道阻滞剂，可降低窦房结和房室结的传导速度，常用于房颤的治疗。便秘是一种常见的不良反应，是由于抑制结肠移行性运动复合体，导致结肠平滑肌收缩减慢所致。这通常在二氢吡啶类钙通道阻滞剂（如氨氯地平、硝苯地平）中不常见。\n\n其他常见的导致便秘的药物包括阿片类药物、5-HT3受体拮抗剂（如昂丹司琼）、铁剂、含铝制剂（如抗酸剂）以及具有抗胆碱能特性的药物（如苯海拉明、三环类抗抑郁药、第一代抗精神病药）。\n\n(选项A) 结肠微生物群的改变在抗生素治疗后很常见，但通常会导致腹泻（例如，艰难梭菌[以前称为梭状芽胞杆菌]性结肠炎），而不是便秘。\n\n(选项B) 胃结肠反射是一种由食物引起的胃膨胀触发的神经源性反射，导致结肠收缩；反射受损可导致便秘。然而，这通常发生在患有糖尿病神经病变和胃轻瘫的患者中。\n\n(选项C) 盆底肌肉的不适当收缩发生在排便功能障碍时，阻止粪便从直肠排出。排便功能障碍在老年人中更常见，并且通常与神经系统疾病（例如，帕金森病）或外伤相关。该患者开始服用地尔硫卓后症状的发展与药物引起的便秘更为一致。\n\n(选项E) 直肠膨出，当直肠脱垂到后阴道壁时发生，通常发生在老年、多产妇女中。尽管便秘很常见，但患者通常会描述盆腔压力，并且需要手动按压阴道或直肠以排便。\n\n(选项F) 乙状结肠扭转通常表现为进行性腹痛、恶心和便秘，并最终导致肠梗阻（例如，无法排气、便秘、可能穿孔）。症状在几天内发生，而不是几个月。\n\n教育目标：\n便秘是非二氢吡啶类钙通道阻滞剂（例如，地尔硫卓、维拉帕米）的常见不良反应。其他导致便秘的药物包括阿片类药物、5-HT3受体拮抗剂、铁剂、含铝抗酸剂以及具有抗胆碱能特性的药物。"
