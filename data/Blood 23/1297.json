    "en": "A 60-year-old African-American female is evaluated for fatigue. Past surgical history includes mitral valve repair with a mechanical valve due to severe mitral insufficiency. She has 30-pack year history of smoking and occasionally drinks alcohol. Examination shows pallor. Laboratory studies show the following:\n\nComplete blood count\n\n Hemoglobin 9.0 g/L\n Reticulocytes 6.8%\n Platelets 218,000/mm3\n Leukocyte count 4,500/mm3\n\nSerum chemistries are within normal limits. Her peripheral smear shows red blood cell fragments, \"burr cells,\" and \"helmet cells\". Which of the following is the most likely cause of her condition?",

    "en": "All of the choices represent mechanisms for anemia. The key to answering this question is this patient's history and peripheral smear. Red blood cell fragments, burr cells and helmet cells are consistent with traumatic hemolysis, which can result from either microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or mechanical damage (e.g. prosthetic valve).\n\nProsthetic valves produce excessive shear and turbulence in the cardiac circulation, causing mechanical trauma to the RBCs.\n\nBurr cells are erythrocytes with short, evenly-spaced projections. They can occur as an artifact or in association with uremia, pyruvate kinase deficiency, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, or mechanical damage.\n\n(Choice A) Microvascular thrombi are the pathophysiologic mechanism for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which causes thrombocytopenia. In this patient, platelet count is normal.\n\n(Choice B) Cytoskeleton abnormalities describe an intracorpuscular defect characteristic of a group of anemias that includes hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, and hereditary stomatocytosis. Respectively, spherocytes, elliptocytes, or stomatocytes are characteristically seen in the peripheral blood smear.\n\n(Choice C) Impaired DNA synthesis is the pathophysiologic mechanism for megaloblastic anemia. Ovalo-macrocytes are the associated morphologic RBC variant seen in this group of anemia. In addition, hypersegmented neutrophils are also characteristic.\n\n(Choice D) Gastrointestinal blood loss results in hypochromic, microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency.\n\n(Choice E) Mutation of the beta globin chain results in beta thalassemia; target cells are the RBC morphologic variant commonly seen.\n\n(Choice F) Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an episodic hemolysis caused by a complement-mediated mechanism. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (pancytopenia) are commonly associated.\n\nEducational Objective:\n\nRed blood cell fragments, burr cells, and helmet cells are associated with either microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or mechanical or mechanical red cell destruction.\n\nIn patients with prosthetic valves, red blood cells are exposed to excessive shear and turbulence in the circulation, causing damage from mechanical trauma.",
    "zh": "所有选项都代表贫血的机制。回答这个问题的关键在于患者的病史和外周血涂片。红细胞碎片、刺细胞和盔形细胞与创伤性溶血一致，这可能由微血管病性溶血性贫血或机械性损伤（例如，人工瓣膜）引起。\n\n人工瓣膜会在心脏循环中产生过度的剪切力和湍流，导致红细胞发生机械性损伤。\n\n刺细胞是具有短而均匀间隔突起的红细胞。它们可能作为一种伪影出现，或与尿毒症、丙酮酸激酶缺乏症、微血管病性溶血性贫血或机械性损伤有关。\n\n（选项A）微血管血栓是微血管病性溶血性贫血的病理生理学机制，可导致血小板减少。在该患者中，血小板计数正常。\n\n（选项B）细胞骨架异常描述了一种红细胞内缺陷，是包括遗传性球形红细胞增多症、遗传性椭圆形红细胞增多症和遗传性口形红细胞增多症在内的一组贫血的特征。球形红细胞、椭圆形红细胞或口形红细胞分别在外周血涂片中可见。\n\n（选项C）DNA合成受损是巨幼红细胞性贫血的病理生理学机制。卵圆巨红细胞是与这组贫血相关的形态学红细胞变异。此外，过度分叶的中性粒细胞也是其特征。\n\n（选项D）胃肠道失血导致由于缺铁引起的低色素性、小细胞性贫血。\n\n（选项E）β珠蛋白链的突变导致β地中海贫血；靶细胞是常见的红细胞形态学变异。\n\n（选项F）阵发性夜间血红蛋白尿是一种由补体介导机制引起的阵发性溶血。通常伴有白细胞减少和血小板减少（全血细胞减少）。\n\n教育目标：\n\n红细胞碎片、刺细胞和盔形细胞与微血管病性溶血性贫血或机械性红细胞破坏有关。\n\n在人工瓣膜患者中，红细胞暴露于循环中过度的剪切力和湍流中，从而导致机械性损伤。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of mechanical hemolytic anemia, specifically in the context of a prosthetic heart valve. It requires recognizing the association between prosthetic valves, red blood cell fragments (burr cells, helmet cells), and the resulting anemia.\n\nThe key to solving this question is identifying the patient's history of a mechanical heart valve and correlating it with the peripheral smear findings. Recognizing that mechanical trauma to red blood cells can occur with prosthetic valves leads to the correct diagnosis.",
