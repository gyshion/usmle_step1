    "en": "Sometimes axons become severed due to trauma. Such injury causes specific changes in both the proximal and distal segments of the axon, as well as in the neuronal body.\n\n_Wallerian degeneration_ occurs in the segment of axon that has lost connection with the cell body. It represents the degeneration of axon and myelin distal to a point of injury. First, swelling and irregularity are noted in the distal segment of the axon. Within a week the axon is destroyed and its fragments are digested by Schwann cells and macrophages. Similar degenerative changes occur in the segment of axon that lies proximal to the injury. Degeneration of the proximal segment extends to the closest node of Ranvier.\n\nThe changes seen in the neuronal body after the axon is severed are called **axonal reaction**. The cell body shows signs of cellular edema. It becomes swollen and rounded, with the nucleus displaced to the periphery. Nissl substance becomes fine, granular and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (central chromatolysis). Axonal reaction becomes visible in 24-48 hours after the injury. Maximal changes in the neuronal body occur approximately 12 days after the injury. These changes reflect an increased synthesis of protein by the cells in order to regenerate the severed axon.\n\n(Choice A) Degenerative diseases are characterized by progressive loss of neurons with associated reactive glial changes. Neuronal loss in these conditions is selective: it affects one or more well-defined neuronal groups. Alzheimer's, Pick's, and Huntington's disease are all examples of degenerative disorders.\n\n(Choice B) Transient but profound hypoxia, ischemia or toxic injury may lead to the loss of neurons. Irreversible neuronal injury manifests with shrinkage of the neuronal body, deep eosinophilia of the cytoplasm, pyknosis of the nucleus and loss of Nissl substance.\n\n(Choice D) Compression atrophy may occur due to increased intracranial pressure or a mass lesion. A decrease in the size and number of neurons is characteristic of compression atrophy.\n\n(Choice E) Normal aging is characterized by atrophy and gradual neuronal loss. Axonal reaction is not associated with this process.",
    "zh": "有时，由于创伤，轴突会断裂。这种损伤会导致轴突的近端和远端部分以及神经元体发生特定变化。\n\n_瓦勒氏变性_发生在与细胞体失去连接的轴突部分。它代表轴突和髓鞘在损伤点远端的变性。首先，在轴突的远端部分观察到肿胀和不规则。在一周内，轴突被破坏，其碎片被雪旺细胞和巨噬细胞消化。类似的退行性变化发生在轴突的近端部分。近端部分的变性延伸至最近的朗飞氏结。\n\n轴突断裂后神经元体中发生的变化称为**轴突反应**。细胞体出现细胞性水肿的迹象。它变得肿胀和变圆，核移位到外周。尼氏体变得细小、呈颗粒状，并分散在整个细胞质中（中央染色质溶解）。轴突反应在损伤后24-48小时内变得可见。神经元体中的最大变化发生在损伤后大约12天。这些变化反映了细胞为了再生断裂的轴突而增加蛋白质合成。\n\n（选项A）退行性疾病的特征是进行性神经元丢失，伴有相关的反应性神经胶质细胞变化。在这些情况下，神经元丢失是选择性的：它影响一个或多个定义明确的神经元组。阿尔茨海默病、皮克病和亨廷顿病都是退行性疾病的例子。\n\n（选项B）短暂但严重的缺氧、缺血或毒性损伤可能导致神经元丢失。不可逆的神经元损伤表现为神经元体收缩、细胞质的深嗜伊红性、核的固缩和尼氏体的缺失。\n\n（选项D）压迫性萎缩可能由于颅内压增高或占位性病变而发生。神经元的大小和数量减少是压迫性萎缩的特征。\n\n（选项E）正常老化以萎缩和逐渐的神经元丢失为特征。轴突反应与此过程无关。"
