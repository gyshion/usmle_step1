    "en": "An 80-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department following a burn injury. The patient lives alone in an apartment. Earlier today, her clothes caught fire while she was cooking. The patient's neighbor heard her screaming and helped extinguish the fire, but the patient had already sustained burns on her face, arms, and body. She has a history of Parkinson disease and osteoporosis. Temperature is 37.4 C (99.3 F), blood pressure is 140/84 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 18/min. Oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. On examination, the patient is in distress and anxious. There are partial- to full-thickness burns involving the lower face, neck, both arms, and anterior chest and abdomen.",

    "en": "The correct answer is A. With advancing age, the cardiopulmonary system undergoes physiologic changes that can lead to reduced ability to cope with critical illness. One of the major changes in the cardiovascular system involves decreased responsiveness to adrenergic stimuli, which contributes to a lower maximal heart rate and reduced maximal cardiac output. Critical illness often involves a hypermetabolic state (ie, increased resting energy expenditure) and a marked decrease in intravascular blood volume (eg, evaporative losses with severe burn injury, vascular leakage with sepsis), both of which necessitate a sympathetic-mediated increase in heart rate and contractility to help maintain organ and tissue perfusion. The attenuation of this response with age likely contributes to poorer critical illness outcomes in elderly patients.\n\n(Choices B and E) Compliance of the aorta and other large arteries decreases with age, resulting in isolated systolic hypertension and an increase in left ventricular afterload. In response to the increased afterload, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy occurs, resulting in increased left ventricular wall thickness. The reduced arterial compliance also decreases blood volume retained in the arterial system, which increases susceptibility to hypotension during critical illness.\n\n(Choices C and F) Degeneration of lung elastin with age causes alveolar enlargement and increased air trapping. The alveolar enlargement decreases the percentage of the alveolar surface in contact with alveolar capillaries, reducing gas exchange surface area. This effect, combined with reduced alveolar ventilation due to increased air trapping, increases ventilation-perfusion mismatching.\n\n(Choice D) Diaphragmatic strength decreases with age. This has little effect on resting tidal volumes, but it increases the susceptibility to respiratory fatigue during periods of respiratory stress (eg, critical illness).\n\nEducational objective: Physiologic age-related changes in the cardiopulmonary system can lead to reduced ability to cope with critical illness. These changes include reduced maximal heart rate and cardiac output due to decreased responsiveness to adrenergic stimuli, reduced retention of arterial blood volume due to decreased arterial compliance, and reduced respiratory strength and gas exchange efficiency.",
    "zh": "正确答案是A。随着年龄的增长，心肺系统会发生生理性变化，这可能导致应对危重疾病的能力下降。心血管系统中的主要变化之一涉及对肾上腺素能刺激的反应降低，这会导致最大心率降低和最大心输出量减少。危重疾病通常涉及高代谢状态（即，静息能量消耗增加）和血管内血容量显着减少（例如，严重烧伤的蒸发损失、脓毒症的血管渗漏），这两者都需要交感神经介导的心率和收缩力增加，以帮助维持器官和组织灌注。这种反应随着年龄的增长而减弱，可能会导致老年患者的危重疾病预后更差。\n\n（选项 B 和 E）随着年龄的增长，主动脉和其他大动脉的顺应性降低，导致孤立性收缩期高血压和左心室后负荷增加。为了应对增加的后负荷，会发生轻度向心性左心室肥大，导致左心室壁厚度增加。动脉顺应性降低也会减少保留在动脉系统中的血容量，这会增加在危重疾病期间发生低血压的易感性。\n\n（选项 C 和 F）肺弹性蛋白的年龄相关性变性会导致肺泡扩张和空气潴留增加。肺泡扩张降低了与肺泡毛细血管接触的肺泡表面积的百分比，从而降低了气体交换表面积。这种效应，加上由于空气潴留增加导致的肺泡通气减少，增加了通气-血流比例失调。\n\n（选项 D）膈肌力量随着年龄的增长而降低。这对于静息潮气量影响不大，但它会增加在呼吸应激期间（例如，危重疾病）发生呼吸疲劳的易感性。\n\n教育目标：心肺系统中与年龄相关的生理变化可能导致应对危重疾病的能力下降。这些变化包括由于对肾上腺素能刺激的反应降低导致的最大心率和心输出量降低，由于动脉顺应性降低导致动脉血容量保留减少，以及呼吸力量和气体交换效率降低。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of age-related cardiopulmonary changes and their impact on the ability to cope with critical illness, specifically in the context of a severe burn injury in an elderly patient. It assesses the knowledge of how decreased adrenergic response in older adults compromises their ability to mount an adequate cardiovascular response to stress.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the patient's critical condition (severe burns) and consider the impact of aging on the cardiopulmonary system. The key is to recognize which age-related change would most significantly impair the body's ability to compensate for the physiological demands of severe illness, such as increased metabolic rate and fluid shifts.",
