    "en": "A 62-year-old man comes to the office due to gnawing epigastric pain radiating to the back, which started 3 months ago and has become increasingly intense. He has also experienced a 10-kg (22-lb) weight loss and yellowing of the eyes. The patient has smoked 4 or 5 cigarettes a day for most of his life. Vital signs are within normal limits. The patient appears cachectic. Examination shows scleral icterus. The abdomen is tender to deep palpation. Abdominal CT scan is shown in the image below: {{exhibit_1}} This patient's CT scan shows a mass in the body of the pancreas, which is concerning for malignancy in the setting of gnawing epigastric pain, jaundice, and unexpected weight loss.",

    "en": "The majority of pancreatic cancers are derived from the pancreatic ductal system (ie, PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA [PDAC]). On gross examination, they appear as firm, whitish-yellow masses, often with cystic features. On CT scan, they often appear as ill-defined hypoattenuating lesions within the pancreatic parenchyma. PDAC is microscopically characterized by haphazardly arranged pleomorphic glandular cells surrounded by dense stromal fibrosis (eg, desmoplasia).\n\n(Choice A) Cholangiocarcinoma is a cancer derived from bile duct epithelial cells. Although abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss are common in cholangiocarcinoma, this patient's CT scan clearly shows a mass in the pancreas, not the biliary tree.\n\n(Choice B) Hepatocellular carcinoma originates from hepatocytes and most commonly occurs in patients with chronic liver disease (eg, viral hepatitis, cirrhosis). A pancreatic mass without liver involvement is not consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n(Choice C) Cancers derived from pancreatic acinar cells (eg, acinar cell carcinoma) can cause symptoms similar to those of PDAC and may have similar CT findings; however, acinar cell carcinoma is extremely rare compared to PDAC and is therefore less likely in this patient.\n\n(Choice E) Hemangiomas are benign hepatic tumors that arise from vascular endothelium; they do not typically develop within the pancreas.\n\nEducational objective:\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common pancreatic malignancy and typically presents with epigastric pain, weight loss, jaundice (more common if in the pancreatic head), or back pain (more common if in the pancreatic body/tail). It appears radiographically as an ill-defined hypoattenuating lesion within the pancreatic parenchyma. It is characterized microscopically by haphazardly arranged pleomorphic glandular cells surrounded by dense stromal fibrosis (eg, desmoplasia). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "大多数胰腺癌源于胰管系统（即，胰管腺癌[PDAC]）。在肉眼检查中，它们表现为坚硬的、白色-黄色的肿块，通常具有囊性特征。在CT扫描中，它们通常表现为胰腺实质内边界不清的低衰减病灶。PDAC在显微镜下表现为无序排列的、多形性腺细胞，周围环绕着致密的间质纤维化（例如，去分化）。\n\n(选项 A) 胆管癌是一种源自胆管上皮细胞的癌症。尽管腹痛、黄疸和体重减轻在胆管癌中很常见，但这位患者的CT扫描清楚地显示了胰腺内的肿块，而不是胆道。\n\n(选项 B) 肝细胞癌起源于肝细胞，最常发生在患有慢性肝病（例如，病毒性肝炎、肝硬化）的患者中。胰腺肿块而没有肝脏受累与此诊断不符。\n\n(选项 C) 源自胰腺腺泡细胞的癌症（例如，腺泡细胞癌）可引起与PDAC相似的症状，并可能具有相似的CT扫描结果；然而，与PDAC相比，腺泡细胞癌非常罕见，因此在这种患者中不太可能。\n\n(选项 E) 血管瘤是源于血管内皮的良性肝肿瘤；它们通常不会在胰腺内发展。\n\n教育目标：\n胰管腺癌是最常见的胰腺恶性肿瘤，通常表现为上腹痛、体重减轻、黄疸（如果位于胰头更常见）或背痛（如果位于胰体/胰尾更常见）。它在影像学上表现为胰腺实质内边界不清的低衰减病灶。它在显微镜下表现为无序排列的、多形性腺细胞，周围环绕着致密的间质纤维化（例如，去分化）。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pancreatic cancer, specifically pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), including its typical presentation, radiographic findings, and cellular origin. It also requires differentiating PDAC from other potential causes of abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic presentation of pancreatic cancer (epigastric pain radiating to the back, jaundice, weight loss) and the CT scan findings of a pancreatic mass. Knowing that PDAC is the most common type of pancreatic cancer originating from the pancreatic ductal system leads to the correct answer.",
