    "en": "An 82-year-old man is found unresponsive by his neighbor. The patient lives alone in his suburban home. When the neighbor went to check on him, the patient was on the floor and not answering any questions. His medical history is unknown. On arrival of emergency medical services, the patient is obtunded and responds only to painful stimuli. Supportive measures are begun, including endotracheal intubation, but the patient dies en route to the hospital. Autopsy reveals extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the coronary and internal carotid arteries. Histopathologic examination of the brain in the right middle cerebral artery territory shows neurons with intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm and nuclear fragmentation. Based on these findings, this patient's cerebral injury most likely occurred approximately how long ago?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is B. The histopathologic findings of neurons with intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm and nuclear fragmentation are characteristic of red neurons, which are the earliest microscopic sign of irreversible ischemic injury. Red neurons are typically seen 12-24 hours after an ischemic event. The explanation provided in the image details the timeline of microscopic and macroscopic changes in ischemic stroke. Specifically, it states that 'Red neurons are typically seen 12-24 hours after irreversible ischemic injury and are characterized by intense eosinophilic staining of the cytoplasm due to dissolution of Nissl bodies (basophilic granules consisting of rough endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes). The nuclei also become pyknotic (eg, shrunken and deeply basophilic) and undergo fragmentation (karyorrhexis).'\n\n(Choice A) There is typically little change in the microscopic or macroscopic appearance of brain tissue less than 1 hour after irreversible ischemic injury. Early changes are often subtle and may not be readily apparent on routine H&E staining.\n\n(Choice C) At 1-2 weeks after an ischemic stroke, there will be robust phagocytosis of neuron and myelin breakdown products by activated macrophages/microglia. Astrocytes will start proliferating, leading to reactive gliosis, and new vessels will form in the periphery of the necrotic area. Liquefactive necrosis is also a prominent feature during this period.\n\n(Choices D and E) Several months to years after a brain infarction, the necrotic area typically appears as a cystic cavity surrounded by a wall of dense fibers formed by astrocytic processes (glial scar). This represents chronic changes, not the acute changes described in the case.",
    "zh": "正确答案是B。神经元具有强嗜酸性细胞质和核碎裂的组织病理学发现是红色神经元的特征，这是不可逆缺血性损伤最早的微观征象。红色神经元通常在缺血事件发生后12-24小时内可见。图像中提供的解释详细描述了缺血性卒中微观和宏观变化的发生时间。具体来说，它指出“红色神经元通常在不可逆缺血性损伤后12-24小时内可见，其特征是由于尼氏体（由粗面内质网和核糖体组成的嗜碱性颗粒）溶解，细胞质出现强嗜酸性染色。细胞核也会变得固缩（例如，萎缩和深嗜碱性），并发生碎裂（核碎裂）。”\n\n（选项A）在不可逆缺血性损伤后不到1小时，脑组织的微观或宏观外观通常变化不大。早期变化通常很微妙，可能不容易通过常规H&E染色观察到。\n\n（选项C）在缺血性卒中发生后1-2周，激活的巨噬细胞/小胶质细胞会大量吞噬神经元和髓磷脂分解产物。星形胶质细胞将开始增殖，导致反应性神经胶质增生，并且新的血管将在坏死区域的周围形成。液化坏死也是此期间的突出特征。\n\n（选项D和E）脑梗死发生后数月至数年，坏死区域通常表现为由星形胶质细胞突起（神经胶质瘢痕）形成的致密纤维壁包围的囊性腔。这代表了慢性变化，而不是本例中描述的急性变化。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the temporal progression of histopathologic changes in ischemic stroke. Specifically, it assesses the ability to correlate microscopic findings such as red neurons with the time elapsed since the ischemic event.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recognize the described microscopic findings (eosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear fragmentation) as indicative of red neurons and recall or refer to the established timeline of ischemic stroke pathology to determine the approximate time of injury.",
