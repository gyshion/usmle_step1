Approximately an hour ago, the patient collapsed at the dinner table and developed full body shaking and urinary incontinence. Her mother says that the girl has had a mild headache and fatigue for the past few days. On examination, the patient is sleepy and difficult to rouse. Vital signs are normal. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. CT scan of the head is shown in the image below: {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient's head imaging reveals a ring-enhancing lesion with surrounding edema, findings concerning for a brain abscess. Presentation of a brain abscess is often nonspecific and can include headache with or without fever or focal neurologic deficits. Seizure may also be the initial manifestation in some patients, as seen in this girl.\n\nA brain abscess can be due to the hematogenous spread of bacteria from a distant location (eg, pulmonary infection with bacteremia) or the direct extension of a head and neck space infection, such as otitis media, sinusitis, or mastoiditis.\n\nBecause of its anatomic proximity to the middle ear, a temporal lobe abscess, as seen in this patient, can develop as a rare complication of ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA; a recent history of fever, ear pain, and bulging tympanic membrane in this patient would support this diagnosis. Microbiologic examination of the abscess generally reflects the primary site of infection, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae from middle ear infections.\n\n(Choice A) The risk of certain epilepsy syndromes (eg, absence seizures, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy) is increased with a positive family history. This patient's seizure was provoked by a focal intraparenchymal lesion, which is inconsistent with epilepsy.\n\n(Choice B) Shigella infection classically causes fever and bloody diarrhea and can be associated with seizure and encephalopathy, particularly in children. However, brain abscesses are not associated with this infection.\n\n(Choice C) Congenital toxoplasmosis can cause long-term neurologic sequelae (eg, seizures, hearing loss), but imaging typically reveals intracranial calcifications, which are not seen here. In addition, although multiple ring-enhancing lesions are classic for CNS toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised adults, these are not typically present in patients with congenital infection. Moreover, this patient has a single lesion.\n\n(Choice D) Immune thrombocytopenia can cause petechiae/bruising, recurrent minor bleeding (eg, gingival bleeding), or severe hemorrhage (eg, gastrointestinal, intracranial). Seizure may be a presenting sign of an acute intracranial bleed, but CT scan typically reveals a hyperdense fluid collection, not a ring-enhancing lesion.\n\nEducational objective:\nA brain abscess appears as a ring-enhancing lesion on imaging and typically causes headache with or without fever and neurologic symptoms (eg, seizure). Pathogenesis often involves direct spread from head and neck space infections, such as acute otitis media.",
    "zh": "该患者的头部影像显示有环形强化病灶伴周围水肿，提示脑脓肿。脑脓肿的临床表现通常不特异，可包括头痛，可伴或不伴发热或局灶性神经功能缺损。癫痫发作也可能是某些患者的初始表现，如本例女孩所示。\n\n脑脓肿可由于细菌从远处部位（例如，伴有菌血症的肺部感染）的血源性播散，或头颈部间隙感染（如中耳炎、鼻窦炎或乳突炎）的直接蔓延引起。\n\n由于其与中耳的解剖位置接近，颞叶脓肿（如本患者所示）可发展为急性中耳炎的罕见并发症；本患者近期有发热、耳痛和鼓膜膨隆病史，支持此诊断。脓肿的微生物学检查通常反映了原发感染部位，如肺炎链球菌来自中耳感染。\n\n(选项A) 某些癫痫综合征（例如，失神发作、青少年肌阵挛性癫痫）的风险会因阳性家族史而增加。该患者的癫痫发作是由局灶性脑实质内病变引起的，这与癫痫不符。\n\n(选项B) 志贺菌感染典型地引起发热和血性腹泻，并可能与癫痫发作和脑病相关，尤其是在儿童中。然而，脑脓肿与这种感染无关。\n\n(选项C) 先天性弓形体病可引起长期的神经系统后遗症（例如，癫痫发作、听力丧失），但影像学检查通常显示颅内钙化，此处未见。此外，尽管多发环形强化病灶是免疫功能低下成人中枢神经系统弓形体病的典型表现，但这些通常不在先天性感染患者中出现。而且，该患者只有一个病灶。\n\n(选项D) 免疫性血小板减少症可引起瘀点/瘀斑、复发性轻微出血（例如，牙龈出血）或严重出血（例如，胃肠道、颅内）。癫痫发作可能是急性颅内出血的首发症状，但CT扫描通常显示高密度液体积聚，而不是环形强化病灶。\n\n教育目标：\n脑脓肿在影像学上表现为环形强化病灶，通常引起头痛，可伴或不伴发热和神经系统症状（例如，癫痫发作）。发病机制通常涉及头颈部间隙感染（如急性中耳炎）的直接蔓延。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of brain abscess etiology, specifically the association with otitis media in children, and the interpretation of CT imaging findings. The question also requires differentiating brain abscess from other causes of seizures and ring-enhancing lesions.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the ring-enhancing lesion on the CT scan as a brain abscess. Then, consider the most common causes of brain abscess in the pediatric population, focusing on direct extension from nearby infections like otitis media.",
