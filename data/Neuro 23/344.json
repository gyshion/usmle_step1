    "en": "A 12-year-old boy is brought to the office by his adoptive parents for a routine physical examination. The boy has mild intellectual disability. The parents say he is adjusting well to a new school that has more resources for children with learning disabilities. The patient was adopted as an infant, and the birth family's history is unknown. His vaccinations are up to date, and he has no allergies. Review of the patient's medical records reveals that prior cytogenetic studies showed a small gap near the tip of the long arm of the X chromosome when cells were cultured under folate-deficient conditions. Which of the following findings are likely to be present on this patient's physical examination?",

    "en": "This patient with intellectual disability has cytogenetic study results consistent with fragile X syndrome (FXS). FXS is an X-linked disorder caused by unstable expansion of trinucleotide repeats (CGG) in the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome. When the cells of affected individuals are cultured in a folate-deficient medium, the area of increased repeats does not stain and appears \"broken\" with a small gap near the tip of the long arm of the X chromosome (hence the name fragile X). {{exhibit_1}}\n\nOne of the earliest manifestations of FXS is typically developmental delay, including delayed achievement of motor and language milestones. A variable degree of intellectual disability is expected, and many patients also have neurobehavioral features of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and/or autism spectrum disorder. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nClassic physical features of FXS tend to be subtle during infancy and become most noticeable after puberty, including a long, narrow face and prominent forehead, jaw, chin, and ears. Macroorchidism (testicular enlargement) with normal testicular function is also typical. {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(Choice A) Classic manifestations of Marfan syndrome are usually cardiac (eg, aortic root dilation, mitral valve prolapse) and musculoskeletal (eg, tall stature, arachnodactyly, scoliosis). Lens dislocation (ectopia lentis) is also common. Unlike this patient, a person with Marfan syndrome would likely have normal cognition and chromosomes. {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choice C) Down syndrome is a common cause of intellectual disability, and classic physical findings include short neck, low-set ears, and epicanthal folds. Cytogenetic studies usually show a karyotype with 47 chromosomes (3 copies of chromosome 21). {{exhibit_5}}\n\n(Choice D) Fetal alcohol syndrome is characterized by facial dysmorphisms (eg, short palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum, thin vermilion border) and neurobehavioral issues (eg, impairment in adaptive and executive functioning). Cytogenetic studies would be normal. {{exhibit_6}}\n\n(Choice E) Klinefelter syndrome presents with tall stature as well as gynecomastia and small, firm testes with decreased testosterone secretion.\n\nEducational objective:\nFragile X syndrome is a common cause of intellectual disability. It results from unstable expansion of trinucleotide repeats (CGG) in the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene. Classic physical findings include dysmorphic facial features (eg, long face, prominent jaw, protruding ears) and macroorchidism.",
    "zh": "这位患有智力障碍的患者的细胞遗传学研究结果与脆性X综合征(FXS)一致。 FXS是一种X连锁疾病，由X染色体上脆性X信使核糖核蛋白1 (FMR1) 基因中的三核苷酸重复序列(CGG)不稳定扩张引起。当受影响个体的细胞在叶酸缺乏的培养基中培养时，重复序列增加的区域不着色，并在X染色体长臂末端附近出现一个小间隙，看起来“断裂”（因此被称为脆性X）。 {{exhibit_1}}\n\nFXS最早的临床表现之一通常是发育迟缓，包括运动和语言里程碑的延迟实现。 预计会有不同程度的智力障碍，许多患者也有注意力缺陷多动障碍和/或自闭症谱系障碍的神经行为特征。 {{exhibit_2}}\n\nFXS的典型体征在婴儿期往往很轻微，在青春期后变得最明显，包括长而窄的脸和突出的额头、下颌、下巴和耳朵。 巨睾症（睾丸增大）伴睾丸功能正常也很典型。 {{exhibit_3}}\n\n（选项 A）马凡综合征的典型表现通常是心脏（如主动脉根扩张、二尖瓣脱垂）和肌肉骨骼（如身材高大、蜘蛛指、脊柱侧弯）。 晶状体脱位（晶状体异位）也很常见。 与本患者不同，马凡综合征患者可能具有正常的认知和染色体。 {{exhibit_4}}\n\n（选项 C）唐氏综合征是智力障碍的常见原因，典型体征包括短颈、低位耳和内眦赘皮。 细胞遗传学研究通常显示核型为47条染色体（21号染色体有3个拷贝）。 {{exhibit_5}}\n\n（选项 D）胎儿酒精综合征的特征是面部畸形（例如，睑裂短、人中平滑、唇红缘薄）和神经行为问题（例如，适应性和执行功能受损）。 细胞遗传学研究将是正常的。 {{exhibit_6}}\n\n（选项 E）Klinefelter综合征表现为身材高大，以及男性乳房发育和睾丸小而硬，睾酮分泌减少。\n\n教育目标：\n脆性X综合征是智力障碍的常见原因。 它是由脆性X信使核糖核蛋白1 (FMR1) 基因中三核苷酸重复序列(CGG)的不稳定扩张引起的。 典型的体征包括面部畸形（例如，长脸、突出的下颌、突出的耳朵）和巨睾症。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the clinical presentation and genetic basis of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common cause of inherited intellectual disability. It requires recognizing the characteristic physical features associated with FXS, such as a long face, large ears, and macroorchidism. \n\nThe best approach is to correlate the cytogenetic findings (small gap on the X chromosome) with the expected physical exam findings in a patient with intellectual disability. Rule out other genetic syndromes based on their distinct clinical features and cytogenetic abnormalities.",
