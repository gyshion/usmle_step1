    "en": "A 4-month-old boy is being evaluated in the emergency department due to persistent vomiting, fussiness, and feeding intolerance. Symptoms began earlier today. The emesis was initially clear but became bilious over the last few hours. The patient was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. His newborn course was unremarkable. The patient has been exclusively breastfed since birth, and his last bowel movement occurred this morning. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F). Blood pressure and pulse are normal. Physical examination shows abdominal distension. A vomit sample is consistent with bilious emesis.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has abdominal distension and bilious emesis, findings suggestive of intestinal obstruction. Because the pancreatic and bile ducts join and enter the duodenum at the major duodenal papilla, bilious emesis suggests obstruction distal to this anatomic location. Of the options, the only defect that could cause obstruction beyond this site is annular pancreas, a rare congenital anomaly that occurs when the ventral pancreatic bud fails to rotate completely in utero.\n\nThe ventral pancreatic bud is a foregut derivative that appears by the fifth week of gestation. It normally rotates behind the duodenum and fuses with the dorsal pancreatic bud during the seventh to eight weeks. The ventral pancreatic bud gives rise to the uncinate process of the pancreatic head and the main pancreatic duct (of Wirsung). The pancreatic tail, body, and the remainder of head derive from the dorsal bud.\n\nIn patients with annular pancreas, incomplete ventral bud rotation results in pancreatic tissue surrounding the second part of the duodenum; the majority of patients with annular pancreas are asymptomatic. However, in some individuals, the circumferential pancreatic tissue can compress the duodenal lumen, causing obstruction that can be either proximal to the major duodenal papilla (nonbilious emesis) or distal (bilious emesis, as in this patient). Annular pancreas can also result in obstructed pancreatic drainage (eg, pancreatitis).\n\n(Choice B) Failure of endoderm proliferation as the esophagus is stretched by the rapidly growing heart and liver during the fourth and fifth week of development can cause esophageal atresia (eg, excessive drooling, feeding intolerance immediately after birth). Bilious emesis does not occur because the obstruction is always proximal to the major duodenal papilla.\n\n(Choice C) Fibrous obliteration of the biliary ducts causes biliary atresia, and patients often develop jaundice and acholic stools in the first 2 months of life due to biliary obstruction. Signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction would not be expected.\n\n(Choice D) Hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle causes pyloric stenosis. Unlike this patient's bilious emesis, pyloric stenosis causes nonbilious emesis in the first 3-6 months of life due to gastric outlet obstruction (ie, proximal to the major duodenal papilla).\n\n(Choice E) Incomplete obliteration of the allantois (connects the bladder to the umbilicus in utero) leads to a patent urachus or urachal cyst. Patients have increased risk for urinary tract infections, and young infants may have vomiting and irritability, but bilious emesis would not be present and persistent umbilical discharge is typical.\n\nEducational objective:\nAnnular pancreas (ie, pancreatic tissue encircling the duodenum) is caused by abnormal rotation of the ventral pancreatic bud in utero. Although frequently asymptomatic, it can cause intestinal obstruction (eg, vomiting, abdominal distension), including bilious emesis if the constriction is distal to the major duodenal papilla. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该患者出现腹部膨胀和胆汁性呕吐，这些发现提示肠梗阻。 由于胰管和胆管在十二指肠大乳头处汇合并进入十二指肠，胆汁性呕吐表明梗阻位于该解剖位置的远端。 在这些选项中，唯一可能导致该部位之外发生梗阻的缺陷是环状胰腺，这是一种罕见的先天性异常，当腹侧胰芽在子宫内未能完全旋转时发生。\n\n腹侧胰芽是前肠衍生物，在妊娠第五周出现。 它通常在十二指肠后方旋转，并在第七到第八周与背侧胰芽融合。 腹侧胰芽形成胰头钩突和主胰管（Wirsung 氏管）。 胰体、体部和头部的其余部分来自背侧芽。\n\n在环状胰腺患者中，腹侧芽旋转不完全会导致胰腺组织包绕十二指肠的第二部分； 大多数环状胰腺患者没有症状。 然而，在某些个体中，环状胰腺组织可以压迫十二指肠腔，导致梗阻，该梗阻可以位于十二指肠大乳头近端（非胆汁性呕吐）或远端（胆汁性呕吐，如该患者）。 环状胰腺也可能导致胰腺引流受阻（例如，胰腺炎）。\n\n（选项 B）在第四和第五周发育期间，由于食管被快速生长的心脏和肝脏拉伸，内胚层增殖失败会导致食管闭锁（例如，出生后立即出现过度流涎、喂养不耐受）。 由于梗阻始终位于十二指肠大乳头近端，因此不会发生胆汁性呕吐。\n\n（选项 C）胆管纤维闭塞会导致胆道闭锁，患者通常在出生后头 2 个月内因胆道梗阻而出现黄疸和无胆汁便。 不会预期出现肠梗阻的体征和症状。\n\n（选项 D）幽门肌肥大会导致幽门狭窄。 与该患者的胆汁性呕吐不同，幽门狭窄在出生后头 3-6 个月内会导致非胆汁性呕吐，原因是胃出口梗阻（即，位于十二指肠大乳头近端）。\n\n（选项 E）尿囊未完全闭塞（在子宫内将膀胱连接到脐带）会导致尿膜管未闭或尿膜囊肿。 患者患尿路感染的风险增加，幼儿可能出现呕吐和烦躁不安，但不会出现胆汁性呕吐，且脐部持续性分泌物是典型的。\n\n教育目标：\n环状胰腺（即，包绕十二指肠的胰腺组织）是由子宫内腹侧胰芽异常旋转引起的。 尽管通常无症状，但如果狭窄位于十二指肠大乳头远端，则可引起肠梗阻（例如，呕吐、腹部膨胀），包括胆汁性呕吐。 {{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the embryological development of the pancreas and the etiology of bilious emesis in infants. Specifically, it assesses the understanding of annular pancreas and its association with intestinal obstruction.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that bilious emesis indicates an obstruction distal to the ampulla of Vater. Then, considering the congenital anomalies that can cause such an obstruction, annular pancreas is the most likely diagnosis.",
