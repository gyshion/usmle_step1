  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "In this question, 70% of the adult population in a small community with an influenza A outbreak are uninfected, because they are protected either through vaccination or from prior influenza A infection (with a similar strain). A humoral response with antibodies directed against hemagglutinin is generally the most important source of protection. These antibodies can neutralize the virus and primarily block its binding to the host cells. Antibodies to neuraminidase are not the main source of protection against reinfection although they have some protective effect (decrease extent of viral invasion and shedding) (Choice B).\n\n(Choices C and D) Circulating antibodies to internal influenza virus proteins (including the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) do not confer immunity. Innate immunity (eg, antigen-nonspecific macrophage responses) does not appear to prevent primary influenza infection or reinfection. Reinfection is best prevented by adaptive immune mechanisms, which are by definition antigen-specific.\n\n(Choice E) Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells specific for the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-associated peptides derived from nucleocapsid proteins can kill infected cells and limit disease severity but are not thought to prevent infection. Expression of nucleocapsid proteins on MHC class II stimulates a CD4+ Th1-type T cell response (which stimulates CD8+ cell production through cytokines) and a CD4+ Th2-type T cell response. The Th2-type T cell response generates anti-nucleocapsid antibodies that do not appear to play a role in protective immunity.\n\nEducational objective:\nMajor adaptive immune mechanisms that prevent reinfection with the influenza virus include anti-hemagglutinin antibodies.",
    "zh": "在本题中，一个小社区中 70% 的成年人口未受到甲型流感爆发的感染，因为他们要么通过接种疫苗得到保护，要么先前感染了甲型流感 A 型（具有相似的毒株）。针对血凝素的抗体介导的体液反应通常是最重要的保护来源。这些抗体可以中和病毒，主要阻断其与宿主细胞的结合。虽然针对神经氨酸酶的抗体具有一定的保护作用（降低病毒侵入和脱落的程度），但它们并不是预防再次感染的主要来源（选项 B）。\n\n（选项 C 和 D）针对流感病毒内部蛋白质（包括病毒的 RNA 依赖性 RNA 聚合酶）的循环抗体不能提供免疫力。先天免疫（例如，抗原非特异性巨噬细胞反应）似乎不能预防原发性流感感染或再感染。再感染最好通过适应性免疫机制来预防，这些机制从定义上来说是抗原特异性的。\n\n（选项 E）针对源自核衣壳蛋白的与主要组织相容性复合体 (MHC) I 类相关的肽的细胞毒性 CD8+ T 细胞可以杀死受感染的细胞并限制疾病的严重程度，但人们认为它们不能预防感染。核衣壳蛋白在 MHC II 类上的表达会刺激 CD4+ Th1 型 T 细胞反应（通过细胞因子刺激 CD8+ 细胞的产生）和 CD4+ Th2 型 T 细胞反应。Th2 型 T 细胞反应产生抗核衣壳抗体，这些抗体似乎在保护性免疫中不起作用。\n\n教育目标：\n预防流感病毒再感染的主要适应性免疫机制包括抗血凝素抗体。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the adaptive immune response to influenza virus, specifically the role of anti-hemagglutinin antibodies in preventing reinfection. It requires knowledge of viral neutralization mechanisms and the limitations of other immune responses.\n\nThe best approach is to recall the key surface proteins of the influenza virus and their roles in infection. Hemagglutinin is crucial for viral entry, making antibodies against it the most effective in preventing reinfection. Understanding the limitations of other immune responses, such as those targeting internal viral proteins or innate immunity, is also important.",
    "zh": "本题考察对流感病毒适应性免疫反应的理解，特别是抗血凝素抗体在预防再感染中的作用。它需要了解病毒中和机制以及其他免疫反应的局限性。\n\n最好的方法是回忆流感病毒的关键表面蛋白及其在感染中的作用。血凝素对病毒进入至关重要，因此针对它的抗体是预防再感染最有效的。了解其他免疫反应的局限性，例如针对内部病毒蛋白或先天免疫的反应，也很重要。"
