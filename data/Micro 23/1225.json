  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient most likely has active tuberculosis, which should never be treated with drug monotherapy due to the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance in *M. tuberculosis*. Isoniazid resistance specifically occurs by two selective gene mutations. The first is a decrease in bacterial expression of the catalase-peroxidase enzyme that is required for isoniazid activation once the drug enters the bacterial cell. The second mechanism of resistance occurs through modification of the protein target binding site for isoniazid. Treatment of active tuberculosis is accomplished by combining multiple antibiotics to avoid selecting for resistant strains. Commonly used drug regimens include isoniazid and rifampin in addition to streptomycin, ethambutol, and/or pyrazinamide.\n\nIsoniazid monotherapy may be used for patients who have a positive PPD and a negative chest x-ray (i.e., no evidence of clinical disease).\n\n(Choice A) For isoniazid monotherapy to result in the selective survival of intracellular bacilli would suggest that isoniazid is unable to penetrate into (or is otherwise degraded by) macrophages that house *M. tuberculosis*. However, this is not the case. Isoniazid can reach therapeutic levels within macrophages, areas of caseous necrosis, and cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n(Choice B) Decreased transport protein expression at the cell surface would interfere with the effectiveness of drugs that require protein-mediated transport into the bacterial cell to reach the intended target (eg, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, aminoglycosides).\n\n(Choice C) β-lactamase induction within bacterial cells would not result from isoniazid exposure because isoniazid is not a beta-lactam antibiotic.\n\n(Choice D) Rapid mycobacterial elimination from the body occurs when a small inoculum is recognized and quickly destroyed by the cell-mediated immune system. This happens in the majority of exposures. By the time tuberculosis has progressed to active, symptomatic disease, large caseous and liquefactive necrotic granulomas have usually formed and a lengthy treatment period with appropriate multidrug therapy is required to eradicate the organism. Antibiotic therapy for tuberculosis lasts a minimum of six months.\n\nEducational Objective:\nActive tuberculosis is never treated with drug monotherapy due to the fast emergence of mycobacterial antibiotic resistance from rapid, selective gene mutations. Isoniazid monotherapy may be used for patients who have a positive PPD and a negative chest x-ray (ie, no evidence of clinical disease).",
    "zh": "该患者很可能患有活动性结核病，由于*结核分枝杆菌*中耐药性的迅速出现，绝不应采用单药治疗。异烟肼耐药性具体发生于两种选择性基因突变。第一种是细菌表达的过氧化氢酶-过氧化物酶减少，该酶是异烟肼进入细菌细胞后激活所需的酶。第二种耐药机制是通过修饰异烟肼的蛋白靶结合位点而发生的。活动性结核病的治疗是通过联合多种抗生素来实现的，以避免选择耐药菌株。常用的药物方案包括异烟肼和利福平，以及链霉素、乙胺丁醇和/或吡嗪酰胺。\n\n异烟肼单药治疗可用于PPD阳性且胸片阴性的患者（即，无临床疾病证据）。\n\n（选项A）异烟肼单药治疗导致细胞内杆菌的选择性存活，这表明异烟肼无法穿透进入（或被巨噬细胞降解）容纳*结核分枝杆菌*的巨噬细胞。然而，事实并非如此。异烟肼可以达到巨噬细胞、干酪样坏死区域和脑脊液中的治疗浓度。\n\n（选项B）细胞表面转运蛋白表达降低会干扰需要蛋白介导转运进入细菌细胞以到达预期靶点（例如，氟喹诺酮类、大环内酯类、氨基糖苷类）的药物的有效性。\n\n（选项C）细菌细胞内β-内酰胺酶诱导不会由异烟肼暴露引起，因为异烟肼不是β-内酰胺类抗生素。\n\n（选项D）当细胞介导的免疫系统识别到少量接种物并迅速将其破坏时，就会发生结核分枝杆菌从体内迅速清除。这种情况发生在大多数暴露中。当结核病进展到活动性、有症状的疾病时，通常已经形成了大的干酪样和液化性坏死性肉芽肿，需要进行长时间的适当多药治疗才能根除该生物。结核病的抗生素治疗至少持续六个月。\n\n教育目标：\n由于快速、选择性基因突变导致分枝杆菌抗生素耐药性快速出现，活动性结核病绝不采用单药治疗。异烟肼单药治疗可用于PPD阳性且胸片阴性的患者（即，无临床疾病证据）。"

It emphasizes the importance of multidrug therapy to prevent the development of resistant strains.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical scenario suggestive of active tuberculosis (cough, hemoptysis, weight loss, acid-fast bacilli).
