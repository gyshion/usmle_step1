    "en": "A 61-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital due to shortness of breath, fever, and confusion. Medical history includes stage III lung cancer treated with chemotherapy. The patient is unable to communicate but prepared an advance directive several weeks ago specifying \"no intubation.\" Despite supportive care, the patient's condition worsens and she appears to be developing signs of respiratory failure that would warrant intubation. Her husband of 40 years, who accompanied her to the hospital, says, \"My daughter is due to give birth to her first child in a week. I'm sure my wife would want a chance to see her grandchild. She would want to be intubated.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate response? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient is unable to communicate her wishes regarding care. However, she previously outlined her wishes in the form of an ADVANCE DIRECTIVE that specified \"no intubation.\" An advance directive is prepared when the person has decision-making capacity and is used only when the person lacks the capacity to make a medical decision at the time of service.\n\nThere are two main types of advance directive:\n\n*   A LIVING WILL is a written document detailing the patient's wishes primarily regarding specific end-of-life interventions (eg, intubation, enteral feeding).\n*   A HEALTH CARE PROXY is designation of a surrogate decision maker who is authorized to make health care decisions on the patient's behalf.\n\nIf no advance directive is in place, decision-making falls to a default surrogate (eg, next of kin). Because the default surrogate may have conflicting emotions and opinions regarding end-of-life decision-making, an advance directive, especially a living will, prevents confusion by establishing the patient's preferences for future medical care. Based on the principle of PATIENT AUTONOMY, an advance directive is determinative in making decisions regarding a patient's care.\n\nIn this scenario, the \"no intubation\" directive overrules any family member's preference, and the physician may not intervene against this patient's advance directive. However, this message must be delivered with sensitivity given the nature of the patient's condition and its impact on loved ones. CLEAR BUT GENTLE COMMUNICATION on following the patient's instructions (eg, \"we should follow and respect her wishes\") should be provided within a SUPPORTIVE CONTEXT (eg, \"we're doing everything possible\") to ease distress.\n\n(Choices A and B) Relating to the loved one's distress with empathy can provide comfort and support. However, the ensuing blunt comments (eg, \"regaining consciousness is minimal,\" \"would be inappropriate\") are unnecessarily harsh.\n\n(Choices C and D) Without a living will, a health care proxy or default surrogate decision maker (eg, spouse, adult child) may determine medical care. However, in almost all states, living wills take precedence in decision-making, and the husband should not be misled by suggestion that the patient's predetermined decision (ie, \"no intubation\") can be changed.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nAdvance directives detail patients' instructions for future medical care. A living will is a written document that specifies a patient's wishes, whereas a health care proxy is a designation of a surrogate who is authorized to make health care decisions on the patient's behalf. Advance directives take precedence over the wishes of family members.",
    "zh": "该患者无法表达她对护理的意愿。然而，她之前以预先指示的形式概述了她的愿望，其中明确了“不插管”。预先指示是在当事人具有决策能力时准备的，仅当当事人在服务时缺乏做出医疗决定的能力时才使用。\n\n预先指示主要有两种类型：\n\n*   一份生前遗嘱是一份书面文件，详细说明了患者的意愿，主要涉及特定的临终干预措施（例如，插管，肠内喂养）。\n*   医疗保健委托人是指被授权代表患者做出医疗保健决定的替代决策者。\n\n如果没有预先指示，决策权将落在默认的替代人（例如，近亲属）身上。由于默认的替代人可能对临终决策持有相互矛盾的情绪和意见，预先指示，特别是生前遗嘱，通过确定患者对未来医疗护理的偏好来防止混淆。基于患者自主权的原则，预先指示在做出关于患者护理的决定时具有决定性。\n\n在这种情况下，“不插管”的指令优先于任何家庭成员的偏好，医生不得违反患者的预先指示进行干预。然而，鉴于患者病情的性质及其对亲人的影响，此消息必须以敏感的方式传达。在支持性背景下提供清晰但温和的沟通，以遵循患者的指示（例如，“我们应该遵循并尊重她的愿望”），以减轻痛苦。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）用同情心对待亲人的痛苦可以提供安慰和支持。然而，随之而来的生硬评论（例如，“恢复意识的可能性很小”，“是不合适的”）是不必要地严厉的。\n\n（选项 C 和 D）如果没有生前遗嘱，医疗保健委托人或默认的替代决策者（例如，配偶，成年子女）可以决定医疗护理。但是，在几乎所有州，生前遗嘱在决策中占优先地位，并且不应误导丈夫认为患者的预定决定（即，“不插管”）可以改变。\n\n教育目标：\n\n预先指示详细说明了患者对未来医疗护理的指示。生前遗嘱是一份书面文件，其中规定了患者的意愿，而医疗保健委托人是指被授权代表患者做出医疗保健决定的替代人。预先指示优先于家庭成员的意愿。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of advance directives, specifically living wills, and their legal and ethical implications in patient care. It emphasizes the principle of patient autonomy and the precedence of a valid advance directive over family wishes. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the presence of a valid advance directive specifying \"no intubation.\" The most appropriate response respects the patient's previously expressed wishes, while also acknowledging the family's emotional distress and providing support.",
