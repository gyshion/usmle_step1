    "en": "A 26-year-old previously healthy man is brought to the emergency department following a motorbike accident. He is found to have a maxillofacial injury. His condition is stabilized, and surgical repair is performed. While recovering, the patient develops difficulty chewing food. On examination, the jaw deviates to the right side when the patient is instructed to open his mouth. The nerve that has been injured in this patient exits the skull through which of the following foramina?",

    "en": "This patient has symptoms consistent with injury of the third division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve [CN] V3, mandibular nerve), which provides sensory innervation to the face and motor innervation to the muscles of mastication. These include the 3 muscles that close the jaw (masseter, medial pterygoid, temporalis) and the single muscle that opens the jaw (lateral pterygoid).\n\nUnilateral injury to CN V3 will result in unopposed action of the contralateral pterygoid muscles; because of the plane of action of these muscles, this leads to deviation of the mandible toward the paralyzed side on opening the mouth. Bilateral paralysis would cause mandibular drop and lack of jaw movement. CN V3 exits the skull through the foramen ovale, which also contains the lesser petrosal nerve, the accessory meningeal artery, and the emissary veins.\n\nThe second division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V2, maxillary nerve) exits the skull via the foramen rotundum (Choice C). The foramen spinosum contains the middle meningeal artery, middle meningeal vein, and the meningeal (recurrent) branch of CN V3, which supplies the dura and contains sympathetic fibers (Choice D). The first branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V1, ophthalmic nerve) passes through the superior orbital fissure.\n\n(Choice A) The foramen lacerum contains only a few small vessels (meningeal branch of ascending pharyngeal artery, emissary veins) and is otherwise occluded by fibrous tissue and cartilage. The internal carotid artery passes along its superior surface but does not traverse it.\n\n(Choice E) The jugular foramen contains CNs IX, X, and XI; the inferior petrosal and sigmoid sinuses; and the posterior meningeal artery.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe third (mandibular) branch of the trigeminal nerve exits the skull through the foramen ovale and innervates the muscles of mastication, including the masseter, the medial and lateral pterygoids, and the temporalis muscles. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该患者的症状与三叉神经第三支（颅神经 [CN] V3，下颌神经）损伤相符，该神经支配面部的感觉，并支配咀嚼肌的运动。 这些包括闭合下颌的 3 块肌肉（咬肌、内翼肌、颞肌）和打开下颌的单块肌肉（外翼肌）。\n\nCN V3 的单侧损伤将导致对侧翼肌的拮抗作用； 由于这些肌肉的运动平面，这会导致张口时下颌骨向瘫痪侧偏斜。 双侧麻痹将导致下颌下垂和缺乏下颌运动。 CN V3 通过卵圆孔离开颅骨，卵圆孔还包含小的岩浅神经、脑膜副动脉和导静脉。\n\n三叉神经的第二支（CN V2，上颌神经）通过圆孔离开颅骨（选项 C）。 棘孔包含脑膜中动脉、脑膜中静脉和 CN V3 的脑膜（复发）分支，后者供应硬脑膜并包含交感神经纤维（选项 D）。 三叉神经的第一支（CN V1，眼神经）通过眶上裂。\n\n（选项 A）破裂孔仅包含少量小血管（咽升动脉的脑膜分支、导静脉），其余部分被纤维组织和软骨阻塞。 颈内动脉沿其上表面通过，但不穿过它。\n\n（选项 E）颈静脉孔包含 CNs IX、X 和 XI； 岩下窦和乙状窦； 以及脑膜后动脉。\n\n教育目标：\n三叉神经的第三（下颌）分支通过卵圆孔离开颅骨，并支配咀嚼肌，包括咬肌、内翼肌和外翼肌以及颞肌。 {{exhibit_1}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the anatomical course of the trigeminal nerve branches and their exit points from the skull, specifically focusing on the mandibular branch (V3) and its relationship to the foramen ovale. It also assesses understanding of the clinical consequences of V3 injury, such as jaw deviation due to unopposed muscle action. \n\nTo solve this question, recall the function of each trigeminal nerve branch and the foramina through which they exit the skull. Consider the clinical presentation of jaw deviation and relate it to the muscles innervated by the mandibular branch (V3) of the trigeminal nerve.",
