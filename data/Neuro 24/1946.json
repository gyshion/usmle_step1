    "en": "A 52-year-old woman comes to the office due to a hand tremor that has been present for several months. It is most prominent while she is carrying out simple daily activities such as drinking from a glass or pouring from a tea kettle. When asked if anything improves the tremor, the patient mentions that it subsides somewhat when she drinks small amounts of alcohol. Family history is significant for similar problems in her mother. Vital signs are normal. Neurologic examination shows bilateral tremor in the upper extremities. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has ESSENTIAL TREMOR, the most commonly diagnosed movement disorder. Essential tremor is also referred to as FAMILIAL TREMOR as it often follows AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT inheritance. A positive family history of tremor can sometimes assist in making the diagnosis. Essential tremor classically worsens while maintaining a particular posture (eg, when holding an object). Patients commonly report that their symptoms IMPROVE WITH ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. Propranolol is the first-line treatment for essential tremor. This nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist is thought to lessen the tremor via central nervous system effects.\n(Choice A) Benztropine is an anticholinergic agent that can be used to treat Parkinson disease and to counteract the extrapyramidal side effects of neuroleptic medications such as haloperidol.\n(Choices B and D) Haloperidol is most commonly used to treat the positive symptoms of psychosis (eg, delusions, hallucinations). Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that blocks D2 (dopamine) and 5HT2 (serotonin) receptors in the CNS.\n(Choice C) Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that is effective for treatment of seizures and alcohol withdrawal. This patient has had intention tremor for several months and family history is positive for essential tremor; these findings would make alcohol withdrawal very unlikely.\n(Choice E) L-DOPA, or levodopa, is used in combination with the DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa to treat Parkinson disease. Patients with Parkinson disease have a resting tremor.\nEducational objective:\nEssential tremor is the most common movement disorder. Patients experience a slowly progressive, symmetric postural and/or kinetic tremor that most commonly affects the upper extremities. Essential tremor is often inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion (referred to as familial tremor). First-line treatment is the nonspecific beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol.",
    "zh": "该患者患有原发性震颤，这是最常被诊断出的运动障碍。原发性震颤也被称为家族性震颤，因为它通常遵循常染色体显性遗传。震颤的阳性家族史有时可以帮助做出诊断。原发性震颤在保持特定姿势时（例如，握持物体时）会典型地恶化。患者通常报告他们的症状在饮酒后有所改善。普萘洛尔是原发性震颤的一线治疗药物。这种非选择性β-肾上腺素能受体拮抗剂被认为通过中枢神经系统作用减轻震颤。\n（选项A）苯托品是一种抗胆碱能药物，可用于治疗帕金森病和对抗神经安定剂（如氟哌啶醇）的锥体外系副作用。\n（选项B和D）氟哌啶醇最常用于治疗精神病的阳性症状（例如，妄想、幻觉）。氯氮平是一种非典型抗精神病药，可阻断中枢神经系统中的D2（多巴胺）和5HT2（血清素）受体。\n（选项C）地西泮是一种苯二氮卓类药物，可有效治疗癫痫发作和戒酒。该患者已出现意向性震颤数月，且家族史对原发性震颤呈阳性；这些发现使得戒酒的可能性很小。\n（选项E）左旋多巴与多巴脱羧酶抑制剂卡比多巴联合使用，用于治疗帕金森病。帕金森病患者有静止性震颤。\n教育目标：\n原发性震颤是最常见的运动障碍。患者会经历缓慢进展的、对称的姿势性和/或运动性震颤，最常影响上肢。原发性震颤通常以常染色体显性方式遗传（称为家族性震颤）。一线治疗是β-肾上腺素能受体拮抗剂普萘洛尔。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of essential tremor, its characteristic presentation, and its first-line pharmacologic management. It requires differentiating essential tremor from other movement disorders based on patient history and physical examination findings.\nTo solve this question, identify the key features of the patient's presentation, including the type of tremor (action/postural), its chronicity, family history, and response to alcohol. Based on these findings, diagnose essential tremor and select the appropriate first-line treatment from the given options.",
    "zh": "此题考察对原发性震颤的理解、其特征性表现以及一线药理学管理。它需要根据患者病史和体格检查结果，将原发性震颤与其他运动障碍区分开来。\n要解决这个问题，需要确定患者表现的关键特征，包括震颤的类型（动作性/姿势性）、其慢性病程、家族史和对酒精的反应。基于这些发现，诊断原发性震颤，并从给定的选项中选择合适的一线治疗。"
