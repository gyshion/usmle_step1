    "en": "A 40-year-old man comes to the office due to recurrent epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and watery diarrhea for the past several months. The patient has had similar burning pain previously and was treated for peptic ulcer disease. He has been taking over-the-counter antacids but with no significant symptom relief. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination shows mild epigastric tenderness and increased bowel sounds. Testing for stool occult blood is positive, and laboratory studies show microcytic hypochromic anemia. Serum gastrin level is markedly elevated. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals prominent gastric folds and multiple ulcers in the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Given these findings, this patient should be assessed for a personal or family history of which of the following conditions?",
    "zh": "一位40岁男性因反复发作的上腹部疼痛、恶心和水样腹泻就诊，病程已持续数月。患者既往曾出现类似的烧灼痛，并接受过消化性溃疡病的治疗。他一直在服用非处方抗酸药，但症状缓解不明显。患者不吸烟、不饮酒、不使用违禁药物。生命体征在正常范围内。腹部检查显示轻度上腹部压痛和肠鸣音亢进。大便潜血试验阳性，实验室检查显示小细胞低色素性贫血。血清胃泌素水平显著升高。上消化内镜检查显示胃皱襞突出，十二指肠和近端空肠有多发性溃疡。鉴于这些发现，该患者应评估其个人或家族史中是否存在以下哪种疾病？"

    "en": "This patient's recurrent peptic ulcer disease, associated with chronic blood loss (iron deficiency) anemia and an elevated gastrin level, is likely due to a gastrin-secreting pancreatic tumor (ZOLLINGER-ELLISON syndrome). Although most gastrinomas are sporadic, 20%-30% occur in association with MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA type 1 (MEN1). This autosomal dominant disorder is most often due to mutations of the *MEN1* gene (menin protein) and is characterized by parathyroid adenomas, pituitary tumors, and pancreatic endocrine tumors (the 3 Ps). \n\nPatients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or other pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors should be assessed for symptoms or family history of other MEN1 manifestations. Potential associated conditions include PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM (eg, hypercalcemia, constipation, KIDNEY STONES) and pituitary adenomas (eg, headaches, visual field defects).\n\n(Choices A and C) Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple tumors, including hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytoma, and renal cell carcinoma. Plexiform neurofibromas are large aggregates of neuronal cells, supporting cells, and connective tissue that are seen in approximately 30% of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Although an increased incidence of pancreatic endocrine tumors has been reported in both VHL and NF1, these associations are much less frequent than in MEN1.\n\n(Choices B and E) MEN2A consists of medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism. MEN2B (also known as MEN3) is associated with medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, mucosal neuromas, and a marfanoid habitus. The MEN2 syndromes are not associated with pancreatic endocrine tumors.\n\nEducational objective:\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 consists of hyperparathyroidism (eg, hypercalcemia, constipation, kidney stones), pituitary tumors, and pancreatic endocrine tumors (eg, gastrinoma). The genetic defect involves mutations of the *MEN1* gene.",
    "zh": "该患者的复发性消化性溃疡病，伴有慢性失血（缺铁性）贫血和胃泌素水平升高，很可能由于分泌胃泌素的胰腺肿瘤（ZOLLINGER-ELLISON综合征）所致。虽然大多数胃泌素瘤是散发的，但20%-30%的病例与多发性内分泌肿瘤1型（MEN1）相关。这种常染色体显性遗传病最常是由于*MEN1*基因（抑癌蛋白）的突变引起的，其特征是甲状旁腺腺瘤、垂体瘤和胰腺内分泌肿瘤（3个P）。\n\n患有Zollinger-Ellison综合征或其他胰腺神经内分泌肿瘤的患者应评估MEN1其他表现的症状或家族史。潜在的相关疾病包括原发性甲状旁腺功能亢进症（如，高钙血症、便秘、肾结石）和垂体腺瘤（如，头痛、视野缺损）。\n\n（选项A和C）Von Hippel-Lindau病（VHL）是一种常染色体显性遗传病，其特征是多发性肿瘤，包括血管母细胞瘤、嗜铬细胞瘤和肾细胞癌。丛状神经纤维瘤是神经元细胞、支持细胞和结缔组织的聚集体，约30%的1型神经纤维瘤病（NF1）患者可见。虽然VHL和NF1均有胰腺内分泌肿瘤发病率增加的报道，但这些关联远不如MEN1常见。\n\n（选项B和E）MEN2A包括甲状腺髓样癌、嗜铬细胞瘤和原发性甲状旁腺功能亢进症。MEN2B（也称为MEN3）与甲状腺髓样癌、嗜铬细胞瘤、黏膜神经瘤和马凡样体型相关。MEN2综合征与胰腺内分泌肿瘤无关。\n\n教学目标：\n多发性内分泌肿瘤1型包括甲状旁腺功能亢进症（如，高钙血症、便秘、肾结石）、垂体瘤和胰腺内分泌肿瘤（如，胃泌素瘤）。基因缺陷涉及*MEN1*基因的突变。"

It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and linking it to the potential underlying genetic condition of MEN1.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the key findings (recurrent peptic ulcers, elevated gastrin, microcytic anemia) suggestive of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, then consider the associated conditions, particularly MEN1, and its characteristic features like hyperparathyroidism and kidney stones.",
