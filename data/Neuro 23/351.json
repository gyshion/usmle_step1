    "en": "As with many other medications, phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic P450 oxidase. Plasma drug level, efficacy, and the severity of side effects are directly influenced by the rate of metabolism of phenytoin. The following features of phenytoin metabolism are important:\n\n*   Hepatic hydroxylation of phenytoin is dose-dependent. When low doses of phenytoin are administered, a large number of free enzyme molecules are available to rapidly bind and eliminate the drug. Higher doses of phenytoin cause the enzymes to be fully saturated; increasing the dose above the saturation limit prolongs drug metabolism (switches from first- to zero-order kinetics) and leads to a rapid rise in plasma levels.\n*   Phenytoin is an inducer of P450 oxidase. P450 inducers can increase the rate of elimination of medications that are metabolized by the liver, such as oral contraceptives, thereby reducing efficacy.\n*   Because phenytoin itself is metabolized by P450 enzymes, its level is affected when it is co-administered with other medications that induce or inhibit the P450 system. The co-administration of phenytoin with P450 inducers (eg, rifampin, carbamazepine) decreases concentration of phenytoin in plasma and diminishes its effectiveness.\n\n(Choice A) Amoxicillin does not affect the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin.\n\n(Choices C, D and E) Fluconazole, cimetidine, and omeprazole inhibit P450 enzymes and increase the concentration of phenytoin in the serum.\n\n(Choice F) Oral contraceptives are metabolized by hepatic P450 oxidase, but neither induce nor inhibit the activity of P450 oxidase.",
    "zh": "与其他许多药物一样，苯妥英钠通过肝脏P450氧化酶代谢。血浆药物水平、疗效和副作用的严重程度直接受到苯妥英钠代谢速率的影响。苯妥英钠代谢的以下特征很重要：\n\n*   苯妥英钠的肝羟基化呈剂量依赖性。当给予低剂量苯妥英钠时，大量游离酶分子可快速结合并消除药物。较高剂量的苯妥英钠会导致酶完全饱和；将剂量增加到饱和极限以上会延长药物代谢（从一级动力学转变为零级动力学），并导致血浆水平迅速升高。\n*   苯妥英钠是P450氧化酶的诱导剂。P450诱导剂可以增加通过肝脏代谢的药物（如口服避孕药）的消除速率，从而降低疗效。\n*   由于苯妥英钠本身由P450酶代谢，因此当它与其他诱导或抑制P450系统的药物合用时，其水平会受到影响。苯妥英钠与P450诱导剂（如利福平、卡马西平）合用会降低血浆中苯妥英钠的浓度，并降低其疗效。\n\n(选项 A) 阿莫西林不影响苯妥英钠的肝脏代谢。\n\n(选项 C、D 和 E) 氟康唑、西咪替丁和奥美拉唑抑制P450酶，并增加血清中苯妥英钠的浓度。\n\n(选项 F) 口服避孕药由肝脏P450氧化酶代谢，但既不诱导也不抑制P450氧化酶的活性。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of drug interactions, specifically how other medications can affect the metabolism and serum levels of phenytoin, an anti-epileptic drug. It requires understanding of P450 enzyme induction and inhibition.\n\nTo solve this question, identify medications that are known P450 inducers. These medications will decrease phenytoin levels, leading to breakthrough seizures. Recognize that rifampin is a strong P450 inducer.",
