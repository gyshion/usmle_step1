    "en": "A 12-year-old boy is brought to the office due to behavioral problems. His parents are upset about his poor grades and recent school suspension for setting fires in the locker room and stealing another student's cell phone. They say that the boy has always been impulsive, had a lot of energy, and become angry and argumentative easily, but over the past year his aggressive behavior \"has gotten out of control.\" The patient says that the fires were an \"accident,\" although he admits to being angry at the coach for kicking him off the basketball team. Regarding the theft, he jokingly says, \"People deserve to have their phones stolen when they are stupid enough to leave them in plain sight.\" The patient has a history of getting into trouble for talking back to teachers, skipping class, and getting into fights since the fourth grade. He has no medical history. There is a family history of bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence. The patient smokes cigarettes occasionally but denies illicit drug or alcohol use.",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's history of fire setting, stealing, and aggressive behavior is most likely explained by CONDUCT DISORDER. Conduct disorder is a psychiatric disorder of children and adolescents and is characterized by a pattern of behaviors that VIOLATE MAJOR SOCIETAL NORMS or the RIGHTS OF OTHERS. Other behaviors seen in conduct disorder include bullying, frequent physical fights, using weapons (eg, bat, gun, knife), torturing animals, breaking into houses, and sexual coercion. Conduct disorder generally presents in middle childhood to adolescence and is more common in boys. Children with conduct disorder are at greater risk for developing ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER as adults.\n\n(Choice A) Antisocial personality disorder is not diagnosed in individuals under age 18. It involves a pattern of violation of basic societal rules and the rights of others and requires a history of some symptoms of conduct disorder before age 15.\n\n(Choice B) This patient does not have enough inattentive and hyperactive symptoms to diagnose attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and his overall behavior is more characteristic of conduct disorder.\n\n(Choice D) Aggression occurs in both conduct and intermittent explosive disorders. However, in intermittent explosive disorder, aggression is not premeditated or committed to achieve a tangible objective (eg, money, power, intimidation). This disorder would not explain this patient's stealing and fire setting.\n\n(Choice E) Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) involves a pattern of angry/irritable mood and argumentative/defiant behavior toward authority figures. Symptoms of ODD are less severe than those of conduct disorder. ODD does not include physical aggression, stealing, or destruction of property, as seen in this patient.\n\n(Choice F) Pyromania is characterized by intentional and repeated fire setting with no obvious motive; it does not involve other behaviors seen in conduct disorder (eg, lying, theft, cruelty to others). A separate diagnosis of pyromania is not given when fire setting occurs as part of conduct disorder.\n\nEducational objective:\nConduct disorder involves a persistent pattern of violating major societal norms or the rights of others. Behaviors include aggression toward people and animals, deceitfulness or theft, destruction of property, and serious violation of rules.",
    "zh": "该患者纵火、盗窃和攻击性行为的病史最有可能由品行障碍解释。品行障碍是儿童和青少年的一种精神疾病，其特征是违反主要社会规范或他人权利的行为模式。品行障碍的其他行为包括欺凌、频繁的身体斗殴、使用武器（例如，棒球棒、枪、刀）、虐待动物、闯入房屋和性胁迫。品行障碍通常在儿童中期到青春期出现，并且在男孩中更常见。患有品行障碍的儿童在成年后发生反社会人格障碍的风险更高。\n\n（选项 A）18岁以下的人员未被诊断出反社会人格障碍。它涉及违反基本社会规则和他人权利的模式，并且需要有15岁之前品行障碍的一些症状的病史。\n\n（选项 B）该患者没有足够的注意力不集中和多动症状来诊断注意缺陷多动障碍，而且他的整体行为更符合品行障碍。\n\n（选项 D）攻击行为发生在品行障碍和间歇性爆发性障碍中。但是，在间歇性爆发性障碍中，攻击行为并非预谋或为了实现有形目标（例如，金钱、权力、恐吓）。这种疾病无法解释该患者的盗窃和纵火行为。\n\n（选项 E）对立违抗性障碍 (ODD) 涉及对权威人物的愤怒/易怒情绪和争论/反抗行为模式。 ODD 的症状不如品行障碍严重。 ODD 不包括身体攻击、盗窃或财产破坏，如该患者所示。\n\n（选项 F）纵火狂的特征是故意和重复纵火，没有明显的动机；它不涉及品行障碍中出现的其他行为（例如，撒谎、盗窃、对他人的残忍）。当纵火作为品行障碍的一部分发生时，不会给出单独的纵火狂诊断。\n\n教育目标：\n品行障碍涉及持续违反主要社会规范或他人权利的模式。行为包括对人或动物的攻击、欺骗或盗窃、财产破坏和严重违反规则。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the diagnostic criteria for various behavioral disorders in children and adolescents, specifically differentiating between conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, antisocial personality disorder, and pyromania based on a clinical vignette.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully reviewing the patient's reported behaviors, including aggression, rule-breaking, theft, and fire setting, and comparing them against the diagnostic criteria for each of the provided options. Identifying the pattern and severity of behaviors is crucial for accurate diagnosis.",
