    "en": "A 21-year-old man comes to the urgent care clinic with a lesion on his penis. He noticed a painful ulcer on the right side of his penis 4 days ago and it has progressively increased in size since then. The patient has had no dysuria, hematuria, or penile discharge. He is a tourist visiting New York City from Botswana. He is HIV-positive and is sexually active. The patient currently takes no medications. He appears comfortable and is afebrile. On genitourinary examination, there is a 1.5-cm ulceration on the right side of the base of the penis; the lesion is very tender and soft; has irregular, ragged borders; and is covered with grey exudate. There is a palpable, tender, enlarged inguinal lymph node in the right groin. The examination is otherwise unremarkable. A scraping of the ulcer is performed. Polymerase chain reaction testing for herpes simplex virus is negative, and darkfield microscopy reveals no organisms. {{exhibit_1}} Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "zh": "一名21岁男性来到急诊诊所，阴茎上有一个病灶。他注意到4天前阴茎右侧出现一个疼痛性溃疡，此后逐渐增大。患者没有出现排尿困难、血尿或阴茎分泌物。他是一名来自博茨瓦纳的游客，正在纽约市旅行。他HIV阳性，性生活活跃。患者目前未服用任何药物。他看起来很舒适，且无发热。在泌尿生殖系统检查中，阴茎根部右侧有一个1.5厘米的溃疡；病灶非常触痛且柔软；边缘不规则、呈锯齿状；并覆盖着灰色渗出物。右腹股沟有一个可触及的、触痛的、肿大的腹股沟淋巴结。体格检查的其他方面无异常。进行了溃疡刮片检查。单纯疱疹病毒的聚合酶链反应检测呈阴性，暗视野显微镜检查未发现任何病原体。{{exhibit_1}} 下列哪项是最可能的诊断？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Chancroid is caused by *Haemophilus ducreyi*, a gram-negative bacterium transmitted through sexual contact. It presents as one or more deep, *painful* ulcers (you \"do cry\" with *H. ducreyi*) with *ragged borders* that are associated with a *grey exudate* and inguinal lymphadenopathy. On Gram stain, the organism appears as curved, gram-negative rods, often in a *clumping* pattern. The disease is relatively uncommon in the United States but has much higher prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and regions of Asia. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice B) Condyloma acuminata, or genital warts, are caused by the human papillomavirus. They present as skin-colored, white, or grey verrucous and filiform papules usually in the penile glans and shaft in men and the vulvovaginal and cervical areas in women.\n\n(Choice C) In immunocompromised patients, manifestations of cytomegalovirus infection include febrile illness, pneumonitis, retinitis, esophagitis, and colitis.\n\n(Choice D) Gonorrhea and chlamydia most commonly present with dysuria and penile discharge, neither of which is present in this patient. Although it may be appropriate to perform testing for other sexually transmitted infections, gonorrhea would be an unlikely explanation for this patient's painful genital ulcer.\n\n(Choice E) Granuloma inguinale is characterized by painless, extensive ulcerative lesions, typically without lymphadenopathy.\n\n(Choice F) Molluscum contagiosum is a contagious disease caused by infection with a DNA poxvirus. Lesions are smooth, skin-colored, firm, somewhat pearly papules that measure about 2–6 mm and often have a central umbilication.\n\n(Choice G) Primary syphilis commonly presents as a characteristically painless single genital ulcer called a chancre. The diagnosis is established by identification of the organisms on darkfield microscopy, serologic testing, or syphilis antibody testing. Secondary syphilis is often characterized by systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, grey mucous patches, raised grey genital papules (condylomata lata), and a diffuse rash involving the palms and soles.\n\n(Choice H) Penile squamous cell cancer can present as lumps or ulcers, sometimes with adenopathy. However, the lesions are typically painless, and average age at presentation is 50.\n\nEducational objective:\nChancroid, due to *Haemophilus ducreyi*, presents as deep, painful (you \"do cry\" with *H. ducreyi*) ulcers with ragged borders that are associated with a grey exudate and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Diagnosis is established by Gram stain and culture of the organism from a scraping of the ulcer base.",
    "zh": "软下疳是由杜克雷嗜血杆菌（*Haemophilus ducreyi*）引起的，这是一种通过性接触传播的革兰氏阴性菌。它表现为一个或多个深在的、*疼痛性*溃疡（你“哭泣” with *H. ducreyi*），具有*不规则边缘*，并伴有*灰色渗出物*和腹股沟淋巴结病。革兰氏染色显示，该病原体呈弯曲的革兰氏阴性杆菌，常呈*聚集*模式。该病在美国相对少见，但在撒哈拉以南非洲、拉丁美洲和亚洲地区的发病率要高得多。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n（选项 B）尖锐湿疣由人乳头瘤病毒引起。它们表现为肤色、白色或灰色的疣状和丝状丘疹，通常位于男性的阴茎头和阴茎干，以及女性的外阴阴道和宫颈区域。\n\n（选项 C）在免疫功能低下的患者中，巨细胞病毒感染的表现包括发热、肺炎、视网膜炎、食管炎和结肠炎。\n\n（选项 D）淋病和衣原体感染最常见的表现是排尿困难和阴茎分泌物，但该患者均未出现。尽管进行其他性传播感染的检测可能是合适的，但淋病不太可能是该患者的疼痛性生殖器溃疡的解释。\n\n（选项 E）腹股沟肉芽肿的特征是无痛、广泛的溃疡性病变，通常没有淋巴结病。\n\n（选项 F）传染性软疣是一种由DNA痘病毒感染引起的传染病。病变是光滑的、肤色的、坚硬的、略带珍珠状的丘疹，大小约为2–6毫米，并且通常有一个中央脐凹。\n\n（选项 G）一期梅毒通常表现为特征性的无痛单个生殖器溃疡，称为硬下疳。通过在暗视野显微镜下鉴定病原体、血清学检测或梅毒抗体检测来确诊。二期梅毒的特征通常是全身症状、淋巴结病、灰色黏膜斑、隆起的灰色生殖器丘疹（扁平湿疣）和涉及手掌和足底的弥漫性皮疹。\n\n（选项 H）阴茎鳞状细胞癌可表现为肿块或溃疡，有时伴有腺病。然而，这些病变通常是无痛的，平均发病年龄为50岁。\n\n教育目标：\n软下疳，由杜克雷嗜血杆菌（*Haemophilus ducreyi*）引起，表现为深在的、疼痛性（你“哭泣” with *H. ducreyi*）溃疡，具有不规则边缘，并伴有灰色渗出物和腹股沟淋巴结病。通过革兰氏染色和从溃疡基底部刮取的病原体培养来确诊。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the clinical presentation and diagnosis of genital ulcers, specifically focusing on differentiating chancroid from other sexually transmitted infections. It requires recognizing the key features of chancroid, such as painful ulcers with ragged borders, grey exudate, and associated inguinal lymphadenopathy. \n\nTo solve this question, focus on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings. The presence of a painful ulcer with ragged borders and grey exudate, along with inguinal lymphadenopathy, strongly suggests chancroid. Rule out other options based on their distinct clinical presentations, such as painless ulcers in syphilis or wart-like lesions in condyloma acuminatum. {{exhibit_3}}",
