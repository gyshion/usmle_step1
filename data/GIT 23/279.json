His other medical problems include hypertension and osteoarthritis. Blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. The patient has foul-smelling breath, but his oropharyngeal and neck examinations are normal. Cardiopulmonary examination is also normal. A barium swallow study is performed and reveals an abnormality in the upper esophagus, as shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}.",

    "en": "Abnormal spasm or diminished relaxation of the cricopharyngeal muscles during swallowing (CRICOPHARYNGEAL motor dysfunction) is thought to be the underlying mechanism of Zenker diverticulum formation. This process results in early oropharyngeal dysphagia with a feeling of food obstruction at the level of the neck and coughing/choking. Increased oropharyngeal intraluminal pressure eventually results in herniation of the pharyngeal mucosa through a zone of muscle weakness (false diverticulum) in the posterior hypopharynx (Killian triangle). Patients consequently develop food retention with halitosis/regurgitation. PULMONARY ASPIRATION of diverticular contents may also lead to recurrent pneumonia. As the diverticulum enlarges, it may become palpable as a lateral neck mass, and dysphagia can worsen due to luminal narrowing caused by extrinsic esophageal compression.\n\n(Choice B) Degenerative changes of the myenteric plexus with impaired LES relaxation result in achalasia. Barium swallow typically shows esophageal dilation with esophagogastric junction narrowing (\"bird's beak\").\n\n(Choice C) Mucosal tears around the gastroesophageal junction can be caused by increased intraluminal pressure in the stomach during prolonged or recurrent retching/vomiting (Mallory-Weiss syndrome).\n\n(Choice D) Retention cysts form due to accumulation of trapped secretions following obstruction of a gland's duct. Chronic rhinosinusitis frequently causes mucus retention cysts in the maxillary sinus.\n\n(Choice E) Mediastinal lymphadenitis (eg, due to tuberculosis, fungal infections) can cause scarring/traction of the mid-portion of the esophagus, resulting in the formation of true diverticula (containing all gut wall layers). Diminished relaxation of cricopharyngeal muscles during swallowing results in increased intraluminal pressure in the oropharynx. This may eventually cause the mucosa to herniate through a zone of muscle weakness in the posterior hypopharynx, forming a Zenker (false) diverticulum, which presents in elderly patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, halitosis, regurgitation, and recurrent aspiration. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "吞咽时环咽肌异常痉挛或松弛减弱（环咽肌运动功能障碍）被认为是Zenker憩室形成的基本机制。这个过程导致早期口咽吞咽困难，颈部有食物阻塞感，并伴有咳嗽/呛咳。口咽内腔压力升高最终导致咽粘膜通过后下咽（Killian三角）的肌肉薄弱区（假性憩室）突出。因此，患者会出现食物潴留，并伴有口臭/反流。憩室内容的肺吸入也可能导致复发性肺炎。随着憩室增大，它可能会被触诊为颈侧块，吞咽困难会由于外源性食管压迫引起的管腔狭窄而恶化。\n\n（选项B）肌间神经丛的退行性变伴LES松弛受损导致失弛缓症。钡餐吞咽通常显示食管扩张，伴有食管胃连接处狭窄（“鸟喙”）。\n\n（选项C）胃食管连接周围的粘膜撕裂可能由胃内腔压力在长时间或反复干呕/呕吐时升高引起（Mallory-Weiss综合征）。\n\n（选项D）由于腺体导管阻塞后被困分泌物的积聚而形成潴留囊肿。慢性鼻窦炎经常导致上颌窦的粘液潴留囊肿。\n\n（选项E）纵隔淋巴结炎（例如，由于结核病、真菌感染）可导致食管中段瘢痕形成/牵引，导致真性憩室的形成（包含所有肠壁层）。吞咽时环咽肌松弛减弱导致口咽内腔压力升高。这最终可能导致粘膜通过后下咽的肌肉薄弱区突出，形成Zenker（假性）憩室，其表现为老年患者的口咽吞咽困难、口臭、反流和反复吸入。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Zenker diverticulum, its pathophysiology related to cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction, and its clinical presentation including dysphagia, halitosis, regurgitation, and aspiration pneumonia.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic presentation of Zenker diverticulum in an elderly patient with dysphagia, halitosis, and recurrent pneumonia.
