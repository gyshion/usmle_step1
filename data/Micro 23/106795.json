    "en": "A 26-year-old man comes to the office due to a progressive rash on his right thigh over the past 4 days. The patient first noticed a red papule on his leg that grew larger and became tender and ulcerated. He now also has a painful \"knot\" in his right groin. Temperature is 37.8 C (100 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 16/min. A 4-cm, shallow ulceration on the medial right thigh is crusting over and surrounded by erythema. A prominent 3-cm, fluctuant lymph node is palpated in the right inguinal chain. Gram stain of a lymph node aspirate sample shows numerous small, gram-negative coccobacilli that stain poorly, findings concerning for Francisella tularensis.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Francisella tularensis is a small, poorly staining coccobacillus that can persist in environmental reservoirs (eg, mud, water, animal carcasses) for weeks or months. Transmission to humans occurs primarily due to direct contact with an infected wild animal (eg, hares, rabbits, squirrels) during hunting/skinning or due to a bite by a tick or mosquito that recently fed on an infected wild animal.\n\nF tularensis possesses several strong virulence factors (eg, capsule, lipopolysaccharide, pili), and transmission of as few as 10 microbes can trigger infection. The pathogen multiplies at the site of inoculation, travels to draining lymph nodes, and then spreads via the lymphohematogenous route.\n\nThe symptoms of tularemia are dependent on the route of transmission. Ulceroglandular disease, the most common presentation, typically occurs after CUTANEOUS INOCULATION. Patients develop a single PAPULOULCERATIVE LESION with surrounding erythema and a central eschar at the site of transmission. TENDER REGIONAL LYMPHADENOPATHY occurs simultaneously or within a few days and may become SUPPURATIVE. Most patients have fever. Sometimes, the cutaneous lesion is not present; other forms of tularemia can also occur, including pneumonia.\n\n(Choice A) Tularemia is not spread by human-to-human transmission. It can spread via contact with infected animals, an invertebrate bite, or an aerosolized bioweapon.\n\n(Choice B) Frequent gardening is a risk factor for sporotrichosis, a fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii. Although this condition causes a papuloulcerative lesion with surrounding erythema, it typically progresses over months, not days. In addition, the lesion is not usually painful and does not produce pus or odor.\n\n(Choice C) The most virulent form of tularemia is found in the United States. Travel outside of the United States is not strongly associated with infection.\n\n(Choice D) Several sexually transmitted infections, including infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a gram-negative diplococcus, can cause suppurative inguinal lesions. However, an ulcerative lesion along the thigh would be atypical.\n\nEducational objective:\nFrancisella tularensis is a highly virulent, gram-negative coccobacillus transmitted to humans during contact with an infected wild animal (eg, hare, rabbit, squirrel) or due to a bite with a tick or mosquito that recently fed on an infected animal. The most common manifestation is ulceroglandular disease, which is characterized by rapid-onset fever, a single papuloulcerative lesion with central eschar at the site of transmission, and painful regional lymphadenopathy.",
    "zh": "土拉弗朗西斯菌是一种小的、染色不良的球杆菌，可以在环境储库（如泥土、水、动物尸体）中存活数周或数月。人类的传播主要发生在直接接触受感染的野生动物（例如野兔、兔子、松鼠）在狩猎/剥皮过程中，或被最近以受感染的野生动物为食的蜱或蚊子叮咬后。\n\n土拉弗朗西斯菌具有几个强大的毒力因子（例如，荚膜、脂多糖、菌毛），只要传播少至10个微生物就可以引发感染。病原体在接种部位繁殖，转移到引流淋巴结，然后通过淋巴血途径传播。\n\n土拉弗朗西斯病的症状取决于传播途径。溃疡性腺病，即最常见的表现形式，通常发生在皮肤接种后。患者在传播部位出现单个丘疹溃疡性病变，周围有红斑和中心焦痂。触痛性局部淋巴结肿大同时发生或在几天内发生，并可能化脓。大多数患者有发热。有时，皮肤病变不存在；其他形式的土拉弗朗西斯病也可能发生，包括肺炎。\n\n(选项A) 土拉弗朗西斯病不会通过人际传播。它可以通过接触受感染的动物、无脊椎动物叮咬或气溶胶化生物武器传播。\n\n(选项B) 经常园艺是孢子丝菌病（一种由申克氏孢子丝菌引起的真菌感染）的危险因素。尽管这种情况会导致周围有红斑的丘疹溃疡性病变，但它通常需要数月而非数天的时间才会进展。此外，该病变通常无痛，也不会产生脓液或异味。\n\n(选项C) 土拉弗朗西斯病最严重的类型在美国发现。在美国境外旅行与感染没有很强的关联。\n\n(选项D) 几种性传播感染，包括奈瑟氏淋病双球菌（一种革兰氏阴性双球菌）感染，可引起化脓性腹股沟病变。然而，沿大腿的溃疡性病变是不典型的。\n\n教育目标：\n土拉弗朗西斯菌是一种高毒力的革兰氏阴性球杆菌，通过在接触受感染的野生动物（例如野兔、兔子、松鼠）期间或由于被最近以受感染的动物为食的蜱或蚊子叮咬而传播给人类。最常见的表现是溃疡性腺病，其特征是快速发热、在传播部位有中心焦痂的单个丘疹溃疡性病变以及疼痛性局部淋巴结肿大。"

Tularemia is caused by Francisella tularensis and is typically transmitted through contact with infected wild animals or through bites from ticks or mosquitoes that have fed on infected animals.
