    "en": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother after he develops a sudden rash. He was trying to retrieve a baseball that had rolled under a log when he got stung by something. By the time he told his mom, his body was covered in welts. Within minutes, the patient's face started to swell and he was having a hard time swallowing. The patient's blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg and heart rate is 120/min. Physical examination shows erythematous, raised plaques over the trunk, extremities, and face. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral expiratory wheezes. The mother is not aware of the child having any similar reaction in the past.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient is experiencing anaphylaxis, a type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in response to allergen (eg, venom from insect sting) exposure. An allergen is an antigen that promotes a robust immune response only in a subset of the population. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nOn initial exposure to allergen, a patient who will eventually develop an allergic response will undergo antibody class switching to IgE in B lymphocytes specific for these allergens. Antigen-specific IgE produced by plasma cells binds to IgE receptors on basophils in the blood and mast cells in the tissues. When the relevant antigen (allergen) interacts with cell bound-specific IgE, these antibodies will cross-link, causing degranulation and release of chemical mediators (histamine, prostaglandin, leukotrienes) responsible for systemic vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, bronchoconstriction, and hemodynamic instability.\n\n(Choice A) Antibody-antigen complex deposition in the vasculature occurs with type III hypersensitivity reactions (eg, serum sickness, Arthus reaction).\n\n(Choice B) Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity occurs in type II hypersensitivity reactions wherein IgM or IgG binds to antigens expressed on the cell surface. These antibodies are then recognized by Fc receptors on immune cells, triggering the release of perforin and granzymes that ultimately lead to cell lysis and death.\n\n(Choice C) CD8+ T lymphocyte-mediated hypersensitivity is a delayed rather than immediate type of immune response. Type IV hypersensitivity is unique in that it is not cell- versus antibody-mediated (seen in types I-III).\n\n(Choice E) Complement-mediated cytotoxicity is a function of circulating IgM and IgG, not IgE. This pathway plays a role in the damage associated with Type II and III hypersensitivity reactions. IgM is the antibody most efficient at initiating the classical complement cascade because it circulates as a pentamer (allows for increased complement interaction).\n\nEducational objective:\nType I hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by the interaction of allergen with preexisting IgE bound to basophils and mast cells. This facilitates cross-linking of the surface IgE molecules that signals the cell to degranulate releasing chemical mediators (eg, histamine, heparin). These agents are responsible for the immediate signs and symptoms of allergy, from a local wheal and flare to life-threatening anaphylaxis.",
    "zh": "该患者正在经历过敏性休克，这是一种I型（速发型）超敏反应，是对过敏原（例如，昆虫蜇伤的毒液）暴露的反应。过敏原是一种仅在部分人群中促进强烈免疫反应的抗原。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n在最初接触过敏原时，最终会产生过敏反应的患者将经历抗体类别转换，使B淋巴细胞特异性针对这些过敏原产生IgE。浆细胞产生的抗原特异性IgE与血液中嗜碱性粒细胞和组织中肥大细胞上的IgE受体结合。当相关抗原（过敏原）与细胞结合特异性IgE相互作用时，这些抗体将交联，导致脱颗粒并释放化学介质（组胺、前列腺素、白三烯），这些介质是导致全身血管舒张、血管通透性增加、支气管收缩和血流动力学不稳定的原因。\n\n（选项A）血管中抗体-抗原复合物沉积发生在III型超敏反应中（例如，血清病，Arthus反应）。\n\n（选项B）抗体依赖性细胞介导的细胞毒作用发生在II型超敏反应中，其中IgM或IgG与细胞表面表达的抗原结合。然后这些抗体被免疫细胞上的Fc受体识别，触发穿孔素和颗粒酶的释放，最终导致细胞溶解和死亡。\n\n（选项C）CD8+ T淋巴细胞介导的超敏反应是一种迟发而不是速发型免疫反应。IV型超敏反应的独特之处在于它不是细胞介导或抗体介导的（见于I-III型）。\n\n（选项E）补体介导的细胞毒作用是循环IgM和IgG的功能，而不是IgE。该途径在与II型和III型超敏反应相关的损伤中起作用。IgM是启动经典补体级联反应最有效的抗体，因为它以五聚体形式循环（允许增加补体相互作用）。\n\n教学目标：\nI型超敏反应由过敏原与预先存在的结合在嗜碱性粒细胞和肥大细胞上的IgE相互作用介导。这促进了表面IgE分子的交联，从而向细胞发出脱颗粒信号，释放化学介质（例如，组胺、肝素）。这些物质是导致过敏的即时体征和症状的原因，从局部风团和红晕到危及生命的过敏性休克。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of type I hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis), including the underlying mechanism involving IgE, mast cells, and release of inflammatory mediators. It also requires differentiating anaphylaxis from other types of hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (urticaria, angioedema, wheezing, hypotension) and associate them with a type I hypersensitivity reaction.
