    "en": "A 56-year-old man comes to the physician complaining of early satiety, nausea, and vague epigastric pain for the past 4 months. He has a 36-pack-year smoking history and admits to drinking alcohol daily for the past 15 years. On physical examination, the patient appears thin and cachectic. Palpation of his abdomen reveals splenomegaly. Abdominal CT scan shows a large irregular mass extending posteriorly from the greater curvature of the stomach, impinging on the splenic artery and vein as they pass below.",
    "zh": "一名56岁男性前来就诊，主诉过去4个月出现早饱、恶心和模糊的剑突下疼痛。 他有36包年的吸烟史，并承认过去15年来每天都饮酒。 体格检查显示患者消瘦、恶病质。 腹部触诊显示脾肿大。 腹部CT扫描显示一个大的不规则肿块从胃大弯后方延伸，压迫脾动脉和静脉，它们从下方通过。"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The splenic artery originates from the celiac artery and courses superior to the pancreas. Along its route, it gives off several branches to the stomach and pancreas before reaching the spleen. The short gastric arteries and the left gastroepiploic artery arise from the splenic artery immediately after it passes the greater curvature of the stomach. The short gastric arteries have very poor anastomoses, and the tissue supplied by them is vulnerable to ischemic injury following splenic artery blockage. In contrast, tissues supplied by the left gastroepiploic artery can be alternatively supplemented by its strong anastomotic connection with the right gastroepiploic artery (Choice B). {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) The gastroduodenal artery supplies blood to the pylorus and the proximal part of the duodenum. It arises from the common hepatic artery.\n\n(Choice C) The right gastric artery supplies blood to the distal lesser curvature of the stomach. It arises from the proper hepatic artery.\n\n(Choice D) The right gastroepiploic artery arises from the gastroduodenal artery and perfuses the distal greater curvature of the stomach. It forms an anastomosis with the left gastroepiploic artery.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe splenic artery originates from the celiac artery and gives off several branches to the stomach and pancreas (pancreatic, short gastric, and left gastroepiploic arteries) before finally reaching the spleen. Due to poor anastomoses, the gastric tissue supplied by the short gastric arteries is vulnerable to ischemic injury following splenic artery blockage.",
    "zh": "脾动脉起源于腹腔干，走行于胰腺上方。 在其走行过程中，它在到达脾脏之前会发出几条分支到胃和胰腺。 胃短动脉和左胃网膜动脉在脾动脉经过胃大弯后立即发出。 胃短动脉的吻合非常差，它们供应的组织在脾动脉阻塞后容易受到缺血性损伤。 相比之下，左胃网膜动脉供应的组织可以被其与右胃网膜动脉的强大吻合连接所补充（选项B）。 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项A）胃十二指肠动脉为幽门和十二指肠近端供血。 它起源于肝总动脉。\n\n（选项C）右胃动脉为胃小弯远端供血。 它起源于固有肝动脉。\n\n（选项D）右胃网膜动脉起源于胃十二指肠动脉，灌注胃大弯远端。 它与左胃网膜动脉形成吻合。\n\n教育目标：\n脾动脉起源于腹腔干，并发出几条分支到胃和胰腺（胰腺动脉、胃短动脉和左胃网膜动脉），最后到达脾脏。 由于吻合差，胃短动脉供应的胃组织在脾动脉阻塞后容易受到缺血性损伤。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the arterial supply to the stomach and the consequences of splenic artery compression. It requires understanding the origin and branching pattern of the splenic artery and the anastomoses between different gastric arteries.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the arteries that branch directly from the splenic artery near the stomach. Recognize that the short gastric arteries have poor anastomoses, making them most vulnerable to ischemia if the splenic artery is compressed.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试对胃动脉供应和脾动脉受压后果的了解。 它需要了解脾动脉的起源和分支模式以及不同胃动脉之间的吻合。\n\n要解决这个问题，确定直接从脾动脉分出的、靠近胃的动脉。 认识到胃短动脉吻合不良，如果脾动脉受压，它们最容易受到缺血。"
