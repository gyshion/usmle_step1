Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 66/12 mm Hg, and pulse is 182/min. A continuous harsh murmur is heard at the left infraclavicular region. There are bounding femoral and palmar pulses. A drug with which of the following mechanisms of action is most appropriate for treating the cause of this patient's murmur?",

    "en": "This newborn has a continuous murmur, widened pulse pressure, and bounding pulses, findings characteristic of a **patent ductus arteriosus** (PDA). After birth, **closure** of the ductus arteriosus normally occurs within 24-48 hours and is **initiated by loss of** placental prostaglandin E₂ (**PGE₂**) and the vasoconstrictive effects of increased systemic oxygen levels.\n\nPersistence of the ductus arteriosus (ie, a PDA) most commonly occurs in **premature infants** and may be associated with elevated postnatal PGE₂ or increased sensitivity to prostaglandins. Left-to-right shunting from the aorta to the pulmonary artery takes place, causing a continuous machinery-like murmur. Patients with a large PDA can develop decreased diastolic blood pressure (due to reduced systemic blood flow) and pulmonary overcirculation with left ventricular volume overload, leading to a compensatory increase in stroke volume that causes bounding pulses and widened pulse pressure.\n\nTreatment of PDA includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (eg, indomethacin, ibuprofen), which inhibit cyclooxygenase. Because cyclooxygenase normally synthesizes prostaglandins from arachidonic acid, NSAIDs **inhibit PGE₂ synthesis,** thereby inducing ductal smooth muscle contraction and promoting PDA closure.\n\n(Choice A) Phospholipase A₂ synthesizes arachidonic acid from phospholipids; therefore, phospholipase A₂ activation would increase arachidonic acid metabolite production, including PGE₂, and could encourage patency of the ductus arteriosus.\n\n(Choices B and C) Activation of prostacyclin (prostaglandin I₂) and PGE₂ receptors promotes vasodilation and patency, not closure, of the ductus arteriosus. This mechanism is used in treating ductal-dependent congenital heart defects (eg, transposition of the great arteries) in which maintaining ductal patency is required for adequate systemic oxygenation.\n\n(Choices E and F) Lipoxygenase converts arachidonic acid to leukotrienes, which are potent bronchoconstrictors. Similarly, the primary effect of prostaglandin D₂ (PGD₂), which is released by mast cells, is bronchoconstriction. Inhibitors of either lipoxygenase (eg, zileuton) or PGD₂ may be used as bronchodilators in asthma treatment, but they are not useful in facilitating PDA closure.\n\nEducational objective:\nA patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) classically presents with a continuous murmur, widened pulse pressure, and bounding pulses. Because physiologic closure of the ductus arteriosus is normally initiated by loss of placental prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂), treatment of a symptomatic PDA includes cyclooxygenase inhibitors (eg, indomethacin), which decrease PGE₂ production.",
    "zh": "这名新生儿有持续性杂音、脉压增宽和脉搏搏动增强，这些是**动脉导管未闭**（PDA）的特征性表现。出生后，动脉导管通常在24-48小时内**闭合**，并且**由胎盘前列腺素E₂（PGE₂）的减少**和全身氧水平升高所致的血管收缩效应**启动**。\n\n动脉导管未闭（即PDA）最常发生在**早产儿**中，并且可能与产后PGE₂升高或对前列腺素的敏感性增加有关。从主动脉到肺动脉发生左向右分流，引起持续的机器样杂音。患有大型PDA的患者可能会出现舒张压降低（由于全身血流量减少）和肺过度循环伴左心室容量超负荷，导致代偿性心搏量增加，从而导致脉搏搏动增强和脉压增宽。\n\nPDA的治疗包括非甾体抗炎药（NSAIDs）（例如，吲哚美辛、布洛芬），它们抑制环氧合酶。由于环氧合酶通常从花生四烯酸合成前列腺素，因此NSAIDs**抑制PGE₂的合成，**从而诱导导管平滑肌收缩并促进PDA闭合。\n\n（选项A）磷脂酶A₂从磷脂合成花生四烯酸；因此，磷脂酶A₂激活将增加花生四烯酸代谢物的产生，包括PGE₂，并且可能促进动脉导管的开放。\n\n（选项B和C）前列环素（前列腺素I₂）和PGE₂受体的激活促进血管舒张和开放，而不是动脉导管的闭合。这种机制用于治疗导管依赖性先天性心脏缺陷（例如，大动脉转位），在这种情况下，需要维持导管开放以获得足够的全身氧合。\n\n（选项E和F）脂氧合酶将花生四烯酸转化为白三烯，白三烯是强效的支气管收缩剂。同样，肥大细胞释放的前列腺素D₂（PGD₂）的主要作用是支气管收缩。脂氧合酶抑制剂（例如，齐留通）或PGD₂抑制剂可用于哮喘治疗中的支气管扩张剂，但它们对促进PDA闭合无用。\n\n教育目标：\n动脉导管未闭（PDA）的典型表现为持续性杂音、脉压增宽和脉搏搏动增强。由于动脉导管的生理性闭合通常由胎盘前列腺素E₂（PGE₂）的减少启动，因此有症状PDA的治疗包括环氧合酶抑制剂（例如，吲哚美辛），这些抑制剂可减少PGE₂的产生。"

It requires understanding of prostaglandin synthesis and the mechanism of action of NSAIDs in promoting ductal closure. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the signs of PDA in a premature infant and recalling that NSAIDs, specifically cyclooxygenase inhibitors, are used to treat PDA by reducing prostaglandin E2 production, which promotes ductal closure.",
