    "en": "Intradermal injection of *Candida* antigens triggers a type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction, which allows evaluation of the cell-mediated immune response. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nInjected *Candida* antigens are taken up by cutaneous antigen presenting cells (APCs), which display the antigens on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules to naive CD4 cells. These cells are then induced to differentiate into type I helper (Th1) cells that secrete tumor necrosis factor and interferon-gamma, which recruit and activate macrophages. The macrophages phagocytose *Candida* antigens and secrete additional inflammatory mediators, producing a cutaneous inflammatory response that appears as an indurated wheal within 24-48 hours.\n\nBecause exposure to *Candida* is ubiquitous, all healthy patients have memory T-cells against *Candida*. Failure to generate an appropriate cutaneous response indicates that the cell-mediated immune response is impaired (ie, T-cell anergy). Patients with SCID have T-cell dysfunction; therefore, they will show anergy in response to *Candida* challenge.\n\n(Choices A and B) B lymphocytes produce antibodies and are the main effectors of humoral immunity. Antibodies play a prominent role in type I (IgE-mediated), type II (eg, drug-induced hemolytic anemia), and type III (eg, serum sickness) hypersensitivity reactions (but not type IV reactions).\n\n(Choices C and E) Eosinophils and fibroblasts are not involved in type IV hypersensitivity reactions. Eosinophils are part of the innate immune system and are increased with atopic or parasitic diseases. Fibroblasts are found in connective tissue and are integral in wound healing through the production of extracellular matrix and collagen.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe *Candida* antigen skin test assesses the activity of cell-mediated immunity because it requires an intact CD4 cell response. Failure to respond to candida antigen testing is typical in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency.",
