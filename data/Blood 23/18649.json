  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with an ulcerative lesion in the floor of mouth and ipsilateral lymphadenopathy in the submandibular area has a biopsy that shows malignant cells with atypical mitotic figures and keratin pearls, findings which are consistent with head and neck mucosal squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).\n\nMost carcinomas, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, first spread from the primary site of the tumor to regional lymph nodes via the lymphatics. In this patient with a floor of mouth squamous cell carcinoma, the spread is to the upper anterior cervical lymph nodes, manifesting as submandibular lymphadenopathy.\n\nAssessment of regional lymph node status is important for tumor staging based on the TNM staging system, which evaluates the size and characteristics of the Tumor, regional lymph Node involvement, and distant Metastases. The presence of metastases is indicative of advanced cancer and often confers a poor prognosis.\n\n(Choice A) Direct invasion through the floor of mouth can occur in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and result in extension to the submandibular space. However, it is likely to present as a large, fungating mass with local destruction (eg, bony invasion).\n\n(Choice B) Field cancerization refers to widespread, premalignant damage to cells in a large area. It is thought to be responsible for the high rate of synchronous tumors in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.\n\n(Choice D) Perineural invasion occurs in many cancers, including head and neck cancer, and conveys a poor prognosis. It may contribute to some symptoms of cancer, including numbness or pain, but is not responsible for disease in the lymph nodes of this patient.\n\n(Choice E) Hematogenous spread of cancer typically follows venous drainage routes and is common in sarcomas and a few carcinomas (eg, renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma); however, it is not typical in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nEducational objective:\nHead and neck squamous cell carcinomas typically spread first to the anterior cervical lymph nodes via the lymphatics. The involvement of anterior cervical lymph nodes affects the staging of the disease. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者口底有溃疡性病灶，下颌下区有同侧淋巴结肿大，活检显示恶性细胞伴非典型有丝分裂像和角质珍珠，这些发现与头颈部粘膜鳞状细胞癌(HNSCC)一致。\n\n大多数癌，包括头颈部鳞状细胞癌，首先通过淋巴管从肿瘤原发部位扩散到区域淋巴结。对于本例口底鳞状细胞癌患者，扩散到上颈前淋巴结，表现为下颌下淋巴结肿大。\n\n基于TNM分期系统评估区域淋巴结状况对肿瘤分期很重要，该系统评估肿瘤的大小和特征、区域淋巴结受累情况以及远处转移情况。转移的存在表明癌症已进展，通常预后不良。\n\n(选项 A) 通过口底的直接侵犯可能发生在头颈部鳞状细胞癌中，并导致蔓延到下颌下间隙。然而，它很可能表现为局部破坏的大型、蕈样肿块（例如，骨侵犯）。\n\n(选项 B) 原位癌变是指大面积细胞的广泛、癌前病变。这被认为是头颈部鳞状细胞癌患者同步肿瘤高发的原因。\n\n(选项 D) 神经周围侵犯发生在许多癌症中，包括头颈癌，预后不良。它可能导致某些癌症症状，包括麻木或疼痛，但与该患者的淋巴结疾病无关。\n\n(选项 E) 癌的血行播散通常遵循静脉引流途径，常见于肉瘤和少数癌（例如，肾细胞癌、肝细胞癌）；然而，这在头颈部鳞状细胞癌中并不典型。\n\n教育目的：\n头颈部鳞状细胞癌通常首先通过淋巴管扩散到颈前淋巴结。颈前淋巴结的受累会影响疾病的分期。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the common routes of metastasis for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, specifically the propensity for lymphatic spread to regional lymph nodes.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's risk factors (tobacco use, ulcerative lesion), the presence of a submandibular mass, and the likely diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. Recall that carcinomas typically spread via lymphatic drainage.",
