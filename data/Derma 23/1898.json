    "en": "A 34-year-old woman comes to the office due to 3 days of discomfort and swelling in the right axilla. The patient has no known medical problems. She is a veterinarian and volunteers as a swim coach at her children's school. She owns a parrot and a hamster. Temperature is 36.9 C (98.4 F). On physical examination, there is an enlarged, tender axillary lymph node on the right, measuring about 3 cm and with slight surrounding erythema but no skin breakdown. There is no other area of lymphadenopathy. Several scratch marks are seen on the right arm. The organism responsible for the lymphadenopathy is also associated with which of the following conditions?",
    "zh": "一位34岁的女性因右腋窝不适和肿胀3天前来就诊。患者无已知疾病。她是一名兽医，并在她孩子的学校担任游泳教练志愿者。她拥有一只鹦鹉和一只仓鼠。体温36.9摄氏度（98.4华氏度）。体格检查显示，右侧腋窝淋巴结肿大、触痛，约3厘米，周围轻微红斑，但无皮肤破损。无其他部位淋巴结肿大。右臂可见几处抓痕。导致淋巴结肿大的病原体也与以下哪种疾病有关？"

    "en": "This patient with extensive animal exposure and scratch marks on her arm likely has CAT-SCRATCH DISEASE (cat-scratch fever), a condition caused by *Bartonella henselae*. This organism resides in the oral cavity of cats and is transmitted to humans by cat scratches and bites. Typically, a primary inoculation lesion evolves from vesicular to erythematous to papular, followed by the development of TENDER REGIONAL LYMPHADENOPATHY (often involving a single lymph node) proximal to the lesion. Axillary lymphadenopathy is extremely common.\n\n*B henselae* can also cause BACILLARY ANGIOMATOSIS (BA) in immunocompromised patients. BA presents with red-purple papular skin lesions. These vascular proliferations may also be found within the viscera. BA can be fatal if left untreated.\n\n(Choice B) *Schistosoma haematobium*, which can present acutely as swimmer's itch (organism penetration into skin) or Katayama fever (fever, urticaria, angioedema, eosinophilia), can affect the bladder (causing terminal hematuria, fibrosis); chronic infection is a risk factor for bladder cancer.\n\n(Choice C) Condylomata acuminata (anogenital warts) are caused by *Human papillomavirus* 6 and 11. They present as soft, skin-colored, cauliflowerlike masses on the penis, vulva, and perianal areas.\n\n(Choice D) Hemolytic uremic syndrome is the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal insufficiency caused by *Escherichia coli* strain O157:H7.\n\n(Choice E) *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* can cause malignant otitis externa in individuals using contaminated swimming pools and hot tubs. Pseudomonal hot tub folliculitis typically manifests as a rash rather than lymphadenopathy.\n\n(Choice F) Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*. TSS presents with fever, vomiting, diarrhea, desquamation, and hypotension.",
    "zh": "这位患者有广泛的动物接触史，手臂上有抓痕，很可能患有猫抓病（猫抓热），这是一种由汉赛巴尔通体*Bartonella henselae*引起的疾病。这种病原体寄生在猫的口腔中，通过猫抓伤和咬伤传播给人类。典型的原发性接种病变从水疱发展为红斑，再到丘疹，然后发展为病变附近的压痛性局部淋巴结肿大（通常涉及单个淋巴结）。腋窝淋巴结肿大非常常见。\n\n汉赛巴尔通体*B henselae*也会导致免疫功能低下的患者发生杆菌性血管瘤病（BA）。BA表现为红紫色丘疹性皮肤病变。这些血管增生也可能发生在内脏中。BA如果不及时治疗，可能会致命。\n\n（选项B）血吸虫病（*Schistosoma haematobium*）可急性表现为游泳者瘙痒症（病原体侵入皮肤）或片山热（发烧、荨麻疹、血管性水肿、嗜酸性粒细胞增多症），可影响膀胱（引起终末血尿、纤维化）；慢性感染是膀胱癌的危险因素。\n\n（选项C）尖锐湿疣（肛门生殖器疣）由人乳头瘤病毒6型和11型引起。它们表现为阴茎、外阴和肛周区域的柔软、肤色、菜花状肿块。\n\n（选项D）溶血性尿毒症综合征是微血管病性溶血性贫血、血小板减少症和肾功能不全的三联征，由大肠杆菌O157:H7株引起。\n\n（选项E）铜绿假单胞菌（*Pseudomonas aeruginosa*）可引起使用受污染游泳池和热水浴缸的个体发生恶性外耳炎。铜绿假单胞菌热水浴缸毛囊炎通常表现为皮疹而不是淋巴结肿大。\n\n（选项F）中毒性休克综合征（TSS）由金黄色葡萄球菌（*Staphylococcus aureus*）引起。TSS表现为发烧、呕吐、腹泻、脱屑和低血压。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Cat-scratch disease (CSD) and its causative agent, Bartonella henselae, as well as associated conditions like bacillary angiomatosis. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of CSD and understanding the potential complications and other diseases caused by the same organism.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key features of the case (animal exposure, scratch marks, lymphadenopathy) to suspect CSD. Then, recall that Bartonella henselae, the causative agent, is also associated with bacillary angiomatosis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.",
