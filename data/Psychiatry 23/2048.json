    "en": "A 22-year-old college student comes to the office due to tension headaches and neck pain. He has had these symptoms for many years, but they have increased in frequency over the past 7 months since he started working at a coffee shop. The patient attends college and says that although his grades are passing, he feels overwhelmed and fatigued: \"I can't concentrate on my schoolwork and worry that I will flunk out of school and never get a good job.\" He sleeps very fitfully and frequently worries about his grades, health, and social life. He obsesses about minor comments his friends have made about how \"serious\" he is, and gets depressed thinking that he is not attractive enough to get a girlfriend.",

    "en": "This patient's excessive chronic anxiety, muscle tension (tension headaches, neck pain), sleep disturbance, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating all support a diagnosis of GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD). Patients with GAD experience excessive and UNCONTROLLABLE WORRY about MULTIPLE ISSUES. A symptom duration of ≥ 6 months is required for diagnosis, but many patients with GAD describe lifelong anxiety. In addition to muscle tension, other somatic symptoms are commonly seen (eg, sweating, gastrointestinal distress) and may prompt the patient to seek medical attention. First-line treatment includes cognitive-behavioral therapy and antidepressants (ie, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors).\n\n(Choice A) In adjustment disorder, behavioral symptoms develop within 3 months of an identifiable stressor and do not meet criteria for any other DSM-5 disorder. This patient's symptoms are not the result of a specific inciting factor.\n\n(Choice C) Although some symptoms of GAD overlap with depression (ie, sleep disturbance, low energy, poor concentration), this patient is predominantly anxious. His depression is related to his worries about social acceptance; he does not meet the full criteria for a major depressive disorder.\n\n(Choice D) Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is characterized by a need for perfectionism, control, and orderliness.\n\n(Choice E) In social anxiety disorder, anxiety occurs exclusively in response to social interactions in which the patient fears negative evaluation by others. In contrast, this patient's concerns extend to multiple situations.\n\n(Choice F) In somatic symptom disorder, the distress is centered on ≥ 1 somatic symptoms. Patients with GAD frequently have anxiety about their health but among a range of other concerns.",
    "zh": "该患者的过度慢性焦虑、肌肉紧张（紧张性头痛、颈部疼痛）、睡眠障碍、疲劳和注意力难以集中均支持诊断为广泛性焦虑症（GAD）。GAD患者会经历对多重问题的过度且无法控制的担忧。诊断需要≥6个月的症状持续时间，但许多GAD患者描述了终生焦虑。除了肌肉紧张外，还常见其他躯体症状（例如，出汗、胃肠道不适），这可能会促使患者寻求医疗护理。一线治疗包括认知行为疗法和抗抑郁药（即，选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂，5-羟色胺-去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂）。\n\n（选项A）在适应障碍中，行为症状在可识别的应激源的3个月内发展，并且不符合任何其他DSM-5障碍的标准。该患者的症状并非特定诱发因素的结果。\n\n（选项C）尽管GAD的一些症状与抑郁症重叠（即，睡眠障碍、低能量、注意力不集中），但该患者主要表现为焦虑。他的抑郁与他对社会认同的担忧有关；他没有完全符合重度抑郁症的标准。\n\n（选项D）强迫型人格障碍的特征是对完美主义、控制欲和秩序的需要。\n\n（选项E）在社交焦虑症中，焦虑仅在患者害怕受到他人负面评价的社交互动中发生。相比之下，该患者的担忧延伸到多种情况。\n\n（选项F）在躯体症状障碍中，痛苦集中于≥1个躯体症状。GAD患者经常会担心自己的健康，但也有其他一系列担忧。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), its diagnostic criteria, clinical features, and differentiation from other anxiety and mood disorders. It assesses the ability to recognize excessive and uncontrollable worry about multiple issues, along with associated physical and cognitive symptoms.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully analyze the patient's chief complaint, history of present illness, and associated symptoms. Key elements to identify include the nature and duration of worry, the presence of multiple worries, and associated physical and psychological manifestations. Differentiating GAD from other conditions like adjustment disorder, major depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and somatic symptom disorder based on specific diagnostic criteria is crucial.",
