    "en": "A new inhaled anesthetic under development by a pharmaceutical company is tested in a series of experiments to determine its pharmacokinetic properties. During one of the experiments, the anesthetic agent is administered at a constant partial pressure while arterial and venous concentrations are monitored. The study results show that the anesthetic has a very large arteriovenous concentration gradient shortly after beginning inhalation. Which of the following best describes the properties of the new anesthetic?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Before gas anesthetics can reach the target organ (brain), they must move through a number of compartments (inhaled air → lungs → blood → brain). The onset of anesthesia occurs when a sufficient quantity of anesthetic is transferred to the brain. The factors shown in the table influence the rate of transfer of anesthetic through the compartments and determine the onset of action.\n\nThe arteriovenous concentration gradient is the difference between the concentration of a gas anesthetic in arterial and venous blood. The solubility of the anesthetic in the peripheral tissues is a major factor in determining the size of the arteriovenous gradient. If tissue solubility is high, a large amount of anesthetic is taken up from arterial blood, which results in low venous concentration. As a result, saturation of the blood requires further absorption of anesthetic in order to replace that which is absorbed by the peripheral tissues. Because blood saturation takes longer, brain saturation is also delayed and onset of action is slower.\n\nIn contrast, anesthetic gases with low peripheral tissue solubility have smaller arteriovenous gradients as there is less peripheral tissue uptake (Choices B and C). Less anesthetic is required to replace the amount absorbed by the peripheral tissue and so blood saturation occurs quickly, allowing concentrations in the brain to equilibrate faster (Choice A).\n\n(Choice D) Potency of the anesthetic is defined by the minimal alveolar concentration (MAC), the alveolar concentration that prevents movement in 50% of patients exposed to noxious stimuli. Potent anesthetics have low MACs. The arteriovenous concentration gradient influences the rate of induction, not anesthetic potency.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe arteriovenous concentration gradient reflects the overall tissue solubility of an anesthetic. Anesthetics with high tissue solubility are characterized by large arteriovenous concentration gradients and slower onsets of action.",
    "zh": "在气体麻醉剂到达靶器官（大脑）之前，它们必须穿过多个隔室（吸入空气 → 肺 → 血液 → 大脑）。当足够量的麻醉剂转移到大脑时，麻醉起效。表中所示的因素会影响麻醉剂通过这些隔室的转移速率，并决定起效时间。\n\n动静脉浓度梯度是动脉血和静脉血中气体麻醉剂浓度之间的差异。麻醉剂在外周组织中的溶解度是决定动静脉梯度大小的一个主要因素。如果组织溶解度高，则会从动脉血中吸收大量麻醉剂，导致静脉浓度降低。因此，血液饱和需要进一步吸收麻醉剂以取代被外周组织吸收的麻醉剂。由于血液饱和需要更长的时间，大脑饱和也会延迟，起效时间也会变慢。\n\n相反，外周组织溶解度低的麻醉气体具有较小的动静脉梯度，因为外周组织摄取量较少（选项 B 和 C）。只需要较少的麻醉剂来补充被外周组织吸收的量，因此血液饱和会很快发生，从而使大脑中的浓度更快地达到平衡（选项 A）。\n\n（选项 D）麻醉剂的效能由最小肺泡浓度 (MAC) 定义，即在暴露于有害刺激的 50% 患者中阻止运动的肺泡浓度。高效麻醉剂的 MAC 较低。动静脉浓度梯度影响诱导速度，而不是麻醉效能。\n\n教育目标：动静脉浓度梯度反映了麻醉剂的整体组织溶解度。组织溶解度高的麻醉剂的特征是动静脉浓度梯度大，起效慢。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pharmacokinetic principles governing the induction of inhaled anesthesia, specifically how tissue solubility and the resulting arteriovenous concentration gradient influence the onset of action.\n\nTo solve this question, one must correlate a large arteriovenous concentration gradient with high peripheral tissue solubility, which leads to slower uptake by tissues, delayed blood saturation, and consequently, a slower onset of anesthetic action. The relationship between these factors and the other options should also be considered to eliminate incorrect choices.",
    "zh": "本题考察了对控制吸入麻醉诱导的药代动力学原理的理解，特别是组织溶解度和由此产生的动静脉浓度梯度如何影响起效时间。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须将较大的动静脉浓度梯度与较高的外周组织溶解度相关联，这会导致组织摄取减慢，血液饱和延迟，从而导致麻醉起效时间变慢。还应该考虑这些因素与其他选项之间的关系，以排除不正确的选择。"
