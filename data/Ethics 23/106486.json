  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Confidentiality is a basic tenet of medical ethics and a prerequisite for a trusting physician-patient relationship. Physicians are ethically obligated to protect patient privacy and maintain confidentiality in most situations, including during interactions with other physicians who are not directly involved in the patient's medical care. This includes colleagues who may share an office or group practice but who are not part of the patient's immediate treatment team.\n\nThe gynecologist's inquiry into this patient's condition is based on personal (eg, close friend to the patient's parents) and not professional interest or medical necessity. Therefore, the physician cannot divulge any information regarding this patient's condition or treatment because the gynecologist is not involved in, or necessary to, the patient's medical care. Doing so would be a breach of PATIENT PRIVACY.\n\n(Choices B, C, D, and E) Though these statements do not share details of the patient's condition, they insinuate that she has a medical diagnosis, specifically one that is \"unexpected\" and/or poor (eg, \"she's had a pretty tough week\"). Such statements would be violations of the patient's privacy. In addition, they encourage the colleague to follow up with the patient personally (eg, \"you should ask her\"), which is inappropriate because the patient may not wish to share her diagnosis or receive support from others at this time.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe ethical obligation to maintain patient confidentiality prohibits physicians from disclosing information about a patient's diagnosis or treatment (ie, protected health information) to anyone not directly involved in, or necessary to, the patient's medical care.",
    "zh": "保密是医学伦理学的一项基本原则，也是建立信任的医患关系的前提。医生在大多数情况下都有伦理义务保护患者隐私并维护保密性，包括与其他未直接参与患者医疗护理的医生进行互动时。这包括可能共用一个办公室或联合诊所的同事，但他们不是患者的直接治疗团队成员。\n\n妇科医生对这位患者情况的询问是基于个人（例如，患者父母的密友）而非职业兴趣或医疗需要。因此，医生不能透露关于这位患者病情或治疗的任何信息，因为妇科医生未参与或不需要参与患者的医疗护理。这样做将违反患者隐私。\n\n（选项 B、C、D 和 E）虽然这些陈述没有分享患者病情的细节，但它们暗示她有医学诊断，特别是“意想不到”和/或不良的诊断（例如，“她度过了非常艰难的一周”）。此类陈述将侵犯患者的隐私。此外，它们鼓励同事亲自跟进患者（例如，“你应该问她”），这是不合适的，因为患者可能不希望分享她的诊断结果或此时接受他人的支持。\n\n教育目标：\n维持患者保密的伦理义务禁止医生向任何未直接参与或不需要参与患者医疗护理的人员透露有关患者诊断或治疗的信息（即受保护的健康信息）。"
