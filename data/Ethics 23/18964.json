    "en": "A 56-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up of type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has an extensive family history of complicated type 2 diabetes, and multiple family members have required lower extremity amputations for nonhealing ulcers. The patient has tried multiple oral medications and his most recent hemoglobin A1c is 9.6%. He is now being considered for basal insulin therapy. After an extended discussion of injection technique, the patient tells the clinician that he does not want to initiate insulin. He says, \"My diabetes is my own fault. My mother always said I was too fat and was going to get diabetes like my dad. Maybe if I stop eating too much, I wouldn't have to waste your time giving me insulin.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient's statement?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Failure of oral medications is common in long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus due to progressive loss of pancreatic beta cell function. Basal insulin therapy is often necessary, especially when multiple agents have failed or when a patient has a hemoglobin A1c >9%.\n\nIt is common for patients to have reservations about initiating insulin due to treatment complexity, risk of hypoglycemia, or injection pain. However, this patient is expressing concern that the failure of oral agents represents a personal inadequacy; in other words, he thinks that his diabetes is uncontrolled because he has failed to follow lifestyle recommendations (ie, diet).\n\nIn counseling patients with treatment failure, especially those who have overpersonalized their medical condition, it is appropriate to review the natural history of the condition. In this case, the clinician should explain that type 2 diabetes is a progressive disorder and that escalating treatment regimens are often the norm. Lifestyle factors (eg, diet, weight loss) should not be neglected but should be discussed in a compassionate, nonjudgmental way, and self-blame should not be encouraged.\n\n(Choice A) Although the clinician should assist the patient in developing weight loss strategies, this patient's hesitation in initiating insulin is primarily related to guilt and self-worth. Once the psychosocial aspects of treatment are addressed, weight loss counseling is likely to be more fruitful.\n\n(Choice C) This patient's frustrations pertain to diabetes and insulin. Once that issue is addressed, if the patient has additional concerns or depressive symptoms in other domains, a more detailed depression assessment could be performed.\n\n(Choice D) This response conveys empathy but diverts attention from the patient to the provider. Such a statement might be appropriate as a cheerful end to the conversation but is not an effective way to initiate further discussion.\n\n(Choice E) This patient's feelings of guilt may be related to his family background, but his concerns focus specifically on his lifestyle habits and diabetic control rather than genetic factors in the etiology of diabetes.\n\nEducational objective:\nFailure of oral medications is common in long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus due to progressive loss of pancreatic beta cell function. Patients should be counseled that because of the natural history of the condition, the need for supplemental insulin is common and does not represent a personal failure.",
    "zh": "由于胰腺 β 细胞功能进行性丧失，口服药物的失效在长期 2 型糖尿病中很常见。基础胰岛素治疗通常是必要的，尤其是在多种药物无效或患者的糖化血红蛋白 A1c >9% 时。\n\n由于治疗复杂性、低血糖风险或注射疼痛，患者通常对开始使用胰岛素持保留态度。然而，这位患者表达了担忧，认为口服药物的失败代表着个人不足；换句话说，他认为他的糖尿病没有得到控制，因为他未能遵守生活方式建议（即饮食）。\n\n在对治疗失败的患者进行咨询时，尤其是那些过度个性化他们疾病状况的患者，回顾该疾病的自然史是合适的。在这种情况下，临床医生应解释说，2 型糖尿病是一种进行性疾病，并且升级治疗方案通常是常态。生活方式因素（例如，饮食、减肥）不应被忽视，但应以富有同情心、不带偏见的方式进行讨论，并且不应鼓励自责。\n\n(选项 A) 虽然临床医生应协助患者制定减肥策略，但这位患者对开始使用胰岛素的犹豫主要与内疚感和自我价值有关。一旦解决了治疗的社会心理方面，减肥咨询可能会更有成效。\n\n(选项 C) 这位患者的沮丧情绪与糖尿病和胰岛素有关。一旦解决了这个问题，如果患者在其他方面有额外的担忧或抑郁症状，则可以进行更详细的抑郁评估。\n\n(选项 D) 这种反应传达了同情，但将注意力从患者转移到提供者身上。这样的声明可能适合作为对话的愉快结尾，但不是发起进一步讨论的有效方式。\n\n(选项 E) 这位患者的内疚感可能与他的家庭背景有关，但他的担忧主要集中在他的生活方式习惯和糖尿病控制上，而不是糖尿病病因的遗传因素。\n\n教育目标：\n由于胰腺 β 细胞功能进行性丧失，口服药物的失效在长期 2 型糖尿病中很常见。应向患者提供咨询，因为根据该疾病的自然病程，补充胰岛素的需求很常见，并不代表个人失败。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to counsel a patient with type 2 diabetes who is experiencing treatment failure and expresses feelings of guilt and self-blame regarding the need for insulin therapy. It emphasizes the importance of addressing the patient's emotional concerns and providing reassurance about the natural progression of the disease. \n\nThe best approach is to acknowledge the patient's feelings, normalize the need for insulin as a common progression in type 2 diabetes, and emphasize that it is not a personal failure. Avoid focusing solely on weight loss or immediately assessing for depression without addressing the underlying concerns about treatment failure.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试了对患有 2 型糖尿病且正在经历治疗失败并表达了对胰岛素治疗需求的内疚感和自责感的患者进行咨询的能力。它强调了解决患者的情感担忧以及提供关于疾病自然进展的保证的重要性。\n\n最佳方法是承认患者的感受，将对胰岛素的需求正常化为 2 型糖尿病的常见进展，并强调这并非个人失败。避免仅仅关注减肥或在没有解决关于治疗失败的潜在担忧的情况下立即评估抑郁症。"
