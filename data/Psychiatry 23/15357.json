    "en": "A 19-year-old man comes to the office for evaluation of a hand injury. He says, \"I was just minding my own business at work when this dog bit me.\" The patient recently started operating a dog-fighting club and adds that his \"entrepreneurial skills\" have made him \"richer than a doctor.\" He has been fired from multiple jobs, most recently while working as a car salesman, due to getting into arguments with coworkers and being repeatedly late to shifts. The patient says, \"I was only late a few times. Haven't you ever been late before, doc?\" During middle school, he was recurrently truant and spent time at a juvenile detention center for tampering with his teacher's car brakes after failing a class.",

    "en": "This patient's operation of an illegal dog-fighting ring, unstable employment history, irritability with coworkers, and repeated tardiness to work are most consistent with a diagnosis of ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER (ASPD). This disorder is characterized by a pattern of disregard for and VIOLATION of the RIGHTS OF OTHERS, beginning by early adolescence and persisting into adulthood (AGE ≥18 required for diagnosis). An essential feature for diagnosis of ASPD is evidence of CONDUCT DISORDER PRIOR TO AGE 15 (eg, this patient's history of truancy and vindictive behavior toward his teacher).\n\nIndividuals with ASPD display consistent IRRESPONSIBILITY along with IMPULSIVITY and irritability, which may result in PHYSICAL AGGRESSION. Engagement in criminal activities (eg, theft, illegal occupations) and LACK OF REMORSE for transgressions are typical in this disorder.\n\n(Choice B) Borderline personality disorder also consists of a pattern of impulsivity and manipulation. These individuals have marked emotional lability, tend to be less physically aggressive, and display exploitative behaviors that are often driven by abandonment fears as opposed to personal gain and/or profit.\n\n(Choice C) When individuals with conduct disorder continue to display a pattern of violating the rights of others into adulthood (age ≥18), they are diagnosed with ASPD.\n\n(Choice D) Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by severe, persistent irritability in childhood, accompanied by frequent verbal and/or aggressive outbursts. This diagnosis is usually restricted to individuals age <18.\n\n(Choice E) Intermittent explosive disorder also consists of recurrent impulsive and destructive outbursts, but they are neither premeditated nor related to achieving secondary gain (eg, profit, intimidation).\n\n(Choice F) Although this patient exhibits some grandiosity, lack of empathy, and exploitative behaviors that are also characteristic of narcissistic personality disorder, these would not explain his lifelong pattern of involvement in violent and/or criminal activities.\n\n(Choice G) Oppositional defiant disorder similarly consists of irritability and vindictiveness as well as a lack of personal accountability for behaviors. However, individuals with this disorder do not have a pattern of engaging in criminal activities.\n\nEducational objective:\nAntisocial personality disorder involves a pattern of violating the rights of others, engaging in unlawful behaviors (eg, physical aggression, illegal occupations), and lacking remorse for transgressions. Individuals must be age ≥18 for diagnosis and have a history of conduct disorder prior to age 15.",
    "zh": "该患者经营非法的斗狗俱乐部、不稳定的就业史、对同事的易怒以及反复迟到与反社会型人格障碍 (ASPD) 的诊断最为一致。 这种疾病的特征是无视和侵犯他人权利，始于青春期早期并持续到成年期（诊断要求年龄≥18岁）。 诊断ASPD的一个重要特征是15岁之前存在品行障碍的证据（例如，该患者有逃学和对老师的报复行为的病史）。\n\nASPD患者表现出持续的不负责任以及冲动和易怒，这可能导致身体攻击。 从事犯罪活动（例如，盗窃、非法职业）和对违规行为缺乏悔恨是这种疾病的典型特征。\n\n(选项 B) 边缘型人格障碍也包括冲动和操纵的模式。 这些人情绪不稳定，身体攻击性较低，并且表现出剥削行为，这些行为往往是由被抛弃的恐惧驱动，而不是个人利益和/或利润。\n\n(选项 C) 当患有品行障碍的个体成年后（年龄≥18岁）继续表现出侵犯他人权利的模式时，他们会被诊断为ASPD。\n\n(选项 D) 破坏性情绪失调障碍的特征是儿童时期严重、持续的易怒，伴有频繁的言语和/或攻击性爆发。 该诊断通常仅限于18岁以下的个体。\n\n(选项 E) 间歇性爆发性障碍也包括反复发生的冲动性和破坏性爆发，但它们既不是预谋的，也与实现次要收益（例如，利润、恐吓）无关。\n\n(选项 F) 尽管该患者表现出一些夸大、缺乏同情心和剥削行为，这些也是自恋型人格障碍的特征，但这并不能解释他一生中参与暴力和/或犯罪活动的模式。\n\n(选项 G) 对立违抗性障碍也同样包括易怒和报复心，以及对行为缺乏个人责任感。 然而，患有这种疾病的个体并没有从事犯罪活动的模式。\n\n教育目标：\n反社会型人格障碍涉及侵犯他人权利、从事非法行为（例如，身体攻击、非法职业）以及对违规行为缺乏悔恨。 个体必须年满18岁才能被诊断，并且有15岁之前品行障碍的病史。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of personality disorders, specifically differentiating Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) from other related conditions based on a patient's history and behaviors. It requires recognizing the diagnostic criteria for ASPD, including the presence of conduct disorder before age 15 and persistent disregard for others' rights in adulthood.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully review the patient's history for patterns of behavior that align with the diagnostic criteria for personality disorders. Pay close attention to the age of onset of symptoms, the nature of the behaviors (e.g., violation of rights, impulsivity, lack of remorse), and the presence of prerequisite conditions like conduct disorder.",
