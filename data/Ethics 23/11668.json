  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "To keep expenditures below the total income from premiums, health insurance plans must limit total expenses (utilization) by enrolled patients. The 2 main strategies include increasing the patient's share of cost for the services they receive (eg, copayments, deductibles) and limiting the range of services patients may receive. A health maintenance organization (HMO) insurance plan has low monthly premiums, low copayments and deductibles, and low total cost for the patient. HMOs reduce utilization by confining patients to a limited panel of providers, requiring referrals from a primary care provider prior to specialist consultations, and denying payment for services that do not meet established evidence-based guidelines.\n\nThis patient's chronic conditions require daily medications, regular physician visits, and serial laboratory testing. In addition, diabetes can increase the risk of additional complications, increase utilization, and require specialty consultation. As a result, an HMO plan may provide this patient with the lowest monthly cost as long as she is willing to see only providers within the limited panel approved by the plan.\n\n(Choice B) Medicaid is a joint federal and state program to cover low-income patients. This patient is unlikely to qualify for Medicaid due to her full-time employment and employer-sponsored health insurance.\n\n(Choice C) Medicare is a federal health insurance program for patients who are age ≥65, disabled, or have end-stage renal disease.\n\n(Choice D) Point-of-service (POS) plans are similar to HMOs in that they require patients to have a primary care provider and obtain referrals for specialty consultations. However, unlike an HMO, patients may also see out-of-network providers. POS plans typically have higher premiums than HMOs and significant costs if patients choose to see out-of-network specialists.\n\n(Choice E) Preferred provider organization (PPO) plans usually offer the most flexible choices for both in-network and out-of-network providers. PPOs typically have higher premiums and deductibles than HMO plans.\n\nEducational objective:\nA health maintenance organization (HMO) is an insurance plan with low monthly premiums, low copayments and deductibles, and low total cost for the patient. HMOs reduce utilization by confining patients to a limited panel of providers, requiring referral from a primary care provider prior to specialist consultations, and denying payment for services that do not meet established guidelines.",
    "zh": "为了使支出低于保费总收入，健康保险计划必须限制参保患者的总支出（使用）。 两个主要策略包括增加患者对所接受服务的费用分担（例如，共同支付、免赔额）并限制患者可能接受的服务范围。 健康维护组织（HMO）保险计划具有较低的月保费、较低的共同支付和免赔额，以及较低的患者总费用。 HMO 通过将患者限制在有限的提供者小组中、要求患者在专科医生会诊前从初级保健医生处获得转诊以及拒绝为不符合既定循证指南的服务付款来减少使用。\n\n该患者的慢性病需要每日用药、定期就诊和系列实验室检查。 此外，糖尿病会增加额外并发症的风险，增加使用，并需要专科会诊。 因此，只要她愿意只看该计划批准的有限小组内的提供者，HMO 计划就可以为该患者提供最低的月费用。\n\n（选项 B）医疗补助计划是一项联邦和州政府联合计划，用于为低收入患者提供保障。由于该患者的全职工作和雇主赞助的健康保险，她不太可能符合医疗补助计划的资格。\n\n（选项 C）医疗保险是一项针对年龄≥65岁、残疾或患有终末期肾病的患者的联邦健康保险计划。\n\n（选项 D）服务点（POS）计划与 HMO 类似，要求患者拥有初级保健医生并获得专科医生会诊的转诊。 然而，与 HMO 不同的是，患者也可以看网络外的提供者。 如果患者选择看网络外的专家，POS 计划的保费通常高于 HMO，并且费用很高。\n\n（选项 E）优选提供者组织（PPO）计划通常为网络内和网络外提供者提供最灵活的选择。 PPO 的保费和免赔额通常高于 HMO 计划。\n\n教育目标：\n健康维护组织 (HMO) 是一种保险计划，具有较低的月保费、较低的共同支付和免赔额，以及较低的患者总费用。 HMO 通过将患者限制在有限的提供者小组中、要求从初级保健医生处转诊，并在服务不符合既定指南的情况下拒绝付款来减少使用。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of different types of health insurance plans and their associated costs and benefits, specifically focusing on which plan would be most suitable for a patient with chronic conditions and a preference for low monthly payments. \n\nThe best approach is to consider the patient's priorities (low monthly payments) and healthcare needs (chronic conditions requiring regular care).
