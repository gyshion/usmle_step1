    "en": "A 12-year-old boy is evaluated due to fever, fatigue, and easy bruising. Physical examination shows pallor, generalized lymphadenopathy, and bone tenderness. Laboratory evaluation reveals anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis with atypical lymphoblasts. Bone marrow biopsy is consistent with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient is treated with combination chemotherapy, and 6-mercaptopurine is administered for maintenance of remission. Which of the following enzymes inactivates this drug? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) is a prodrug that is metabolized into active metabolites by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) and into inactive metabolites by xanthine oxidase and thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). Xanthine oxidase inactivates 6-MP, and coadministration of 6-MP with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (e.g., allopurinol, febuxostat) slows the inactivation of 6-MP and shunts metabolism toward the production of 6-TG active metabolites; therefore, the dose of 6-MP must be significantly reduced. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "6-巯基嘌呤 (6-MP) 是一种前药，由次黄嘌呤-鸟嘌呤磷酸核糖转移酶 (HGPRT) 代谢为活性代谢物，由黄嘌呤氧化酶和硫嘌呤甲基转移酶 (TPMT) 代谢为非活性代谢物。黄嘌呤氧化酶使6-MP失活，并且6-MP与黄嘌呤氧化酶抑制剂（例如，别嘌呤醇、非布司他）的共同给药会减缓6-MP的失活，并将代谢转向产生6-TG活性代谢物；因此，必须显著降低6-MP的剂量。{{exhibit_1}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "The question asks to identify the enzyme that inactivates 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). The explanation states that xanthine oxidase is one of the two enzymes that metabolize 6-MP into inactive metabolites. Therefore, xanthine oxidase inactivates 6-MP.",
    "zh": "该问题旨在确定使6-巯基嘌呤 (6-MP) 失活的酶。解释说明黄嘌呤氧化酶是将6-MP代谢为非活性代谢物的两种酶之一。因此，黄嘌呤氧化酶使6-MP失活。"
