    "en": "A 12-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to a skin infection. Temperature is 38.4 C (101.1 F). Physical examination shows an area of erythema, warmth, and tenderness on his right distal leg. Laboratory results are notable for leukocytosis. The patient is started on intravenous nafcillin. Two days later, he shows limited response to antibiotic therapy. Light microscopy of pus obtained from the site shows gram-positive cocci in clusters, and sensitivity testing demonstrates little response to nafcillin but good response to vancomycin. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for nafcillin treatment failure in this patient?",

    "en": "The presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters that do not respond to nafcillin but show sensitivity to vancomycin suggests infection with methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA). *S. aureus* is a common cause of skin infections in the United States. Most skin infections are minor, but *S. aureus* can cause serious infections (eg, surgical wound infections, bloodstream infections in the presence of central intravenous catheters, pneumonia).\n\n*S aureus* strains that are resistant to oxacillin, nafcillin, and methicillin have been historically termed MRSA, but they are also resistant to all β-lactam agents, including penicillin, cephalosporins (except ceftaroline, a fifth-generation cephalosporin), and carbapenems. Methicillin (nafcillin) resistance is typically mediated by alterations in the structure of penicillin-binding proteins (PBP), the enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis. Altered PBPs, especially PBP2a, have greatly reduced affinity for β-lactam antimicrobial agents (except ceftaroline).\n\n(Choice A) Resistance to tetracycline and sulfonamides is due at least in part to a decrease in the levels of drug accumulation due to decreased uptake and/or increased efflux.\n\n(Choice B) Approximately 95% of *S aureus* isolates in the United States produce penicillinase, which causes penicillin resistance by breaking penicillin's β-lactam ring. However, nafcillin is penicillinase-stable (along with oxacillin and methicillin).\n\n(Choices C and D) Mutations in DNA gyrase cause resistance to quinolone antibiotics. Mutations in RNA polymerase cause resistance to rifampin.\n\nEducational objective: Methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* is resistant to all β-lactam antibiotics, including beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics, as it has an altered penicillin-binding protein that does not bind β-lactams effectively.",
    "zh": "成簇的革兰氏阳性球菌对萘夫西林无反应但对万古霉素敏感，提示感染了耐甲氧西林金黄色葡萄球菌（MRSA）。金黄色葡萄球菌是美国皮肤感染的常见原因。大多数皮肤感染是轻微的，但金黄色葡萄球菌可引起严重感染（例如，手术切口感染、存在中心静脉导管时的血流感染、肺炎）。\n\n历史上，对苯唑西林、萘夫西林和甲氧西林耐药的金黄色葡萄球菌菌株被称为MRSA，但它们也对所有β-内酰胺类药物（包括青霉素、头孢菌素[西头孢菌素，第五代头孢菌素]和碳青霉烯类药物）具有耐药性。甲氧西林（萘夫西林）耐药性通常由青霉素结合蛋白（PBP）的结构改变介导，青霉素结合蛋白是参与细胞壁合成的酶。改变的PBP，尤其是PBP2a，对β-内酰胺类抗菌剂的亲和力大大降低（西头孢菌素除外）。\n\n（选项A）对四环素和磺胺类药物的耐药性部分是由于摄取减少和/或外排增加导致药物积聚水平降低。\n\n（选项B）美国约95%的金黄色葡萄球菌分离株产生青霉素酶，通过破坏青霉素的β-内酰胺环引起青霉素耐药性。然而，萘夫西林是青霉素酶稳定的（与苯唑西林和甲氧西林一样）。\n\n（选项C和D）DNA促旋酶突变引起对喹诺酮类抗生素的耐药性。RNA聚合酶突变引起对利福平的耐药性。\n\n教育目标：耐甲氧西林金黄色葡萄球菌对所有β-内酰胺类抗生素（包括耐β-内酰胺酶抗生素）具有耐药性，因为它具有改变的青霉素结合蛋白，不能有效结合β-内酰胺类药物。"
