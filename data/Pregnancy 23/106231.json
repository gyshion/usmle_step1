    "en": "A 35-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 0, at 40 weeks gestation undergoes a cesarean delivery. Shortly after delivery of the infant, the patient becomes anxious, short of breath, and then unresponsive. Blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg and pulse is 120/min. Oxygen saturation is 83% on room air. There is profuse bleeding from the abdominal incision and intravenous lines. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Intraarterial blood pressure monitoring is established, and pulmonary artery catheterization is performed. Initial measurements are as follows:\n\nCentral venous pressure 14 mm Hg (normal: 6-8)\nPulmonary capillary wedge pressure 5 mm Hg (normal: 6-12)",

    "en": "This newly postpartum patient most likely has amniotic fluid embolism syndrome (AFES), which is a rare but catastrophic obstetric emergency. AFES occurs when amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation through sites of maternofetal connections (eg, endocervical veins, uterine incisions) and initiates an anaphylactoid reaction with the widespread release of proinflammatory and vasoactive substances, resulting in cardiovascular collapse.\n\nThe hemodynamic effects of AFES are complex, but the primary disturbance is typically within the pulmonary vasculature, with marked elevation in pulmonary pressures due to potent pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction and possible vascular obstruction by cellular and acellular debris; the hemodynamic effects of this increased pulmonary vascular resistance are most consistent with obstructive shock.\n\nImpeded cardiopulmonary blood flow leads to elevated central venous pressure, which is a reflection of right atrial pressure and right ventricular preload (Choice A). The decreased forward flow leads to reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which is a reflection of left atrial pressure and representative of left ventricular preload (Choice C). As less blood is pumped to the left side of the heart, the cardiac index decreases, resulting in hypotension (Choice B). In response, systemic vascular resistance is increased in an attempt to maintain adequate tissue perfusion pressure.\n\nAFES also commonly involves a consumptive coagulopathy (ie, disseminated intravascular coagulation), which manifests clinically with uterine hemorrhage and bleeding from incisions and intravenous lines.\n\nEducational objective:\nAmniotic fluid embolism syndrome is a rare but catastrophic obstetric emergency that leads to respiratory failure and obstructive shock with an elevated central venous pressure and a decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac index. It also commonly involves a consumptive coagulopathy with widespread hemorrhage.",
    "zh": "这位新产后患者很可能患有羊水栓塞综合征 (AFES)，这是一种罕见但灾难性的产科急症。当羊水通过母胎连接部位（例如，宫颈内静脉、子宫切口）进入母体循环时，就会发生AFES，并引发类过敏反应，广泛释放促炎和血管活性物质，导致心血管功能衰竭。\n\nAFES的血流动力学影响是复杂的，但主要紊乱通常发生在肺血管系统中，由于强效的肺动脉血管收缩和细胞及无细胞碎片可能引起的血管阻塞，导致肺压显着升高；这种肺血管阻力增加的血流动力学影响与梗阻性休克最为一致。\n\n心肺血流受阻会导致中心静脉压升高，这反映了右心房压力和右心室前负荷（选项A）。前向血流减少导致肺毛细血管楔压降低，这反映了左心房压力，代表左心室前负荷（选项C）。由于泵入心脏左侧的血量减少，心脏指数降低，导致低血压（选项B）。作为响应，全身血管阻力增加，以试图维持足够的组织灌注压力。\n\nAFES也常涉及消耗性凝血病（即，弥漫性血管内凝血），其临床表现为子宫出血以及切口和静脉输液管出血。\n\n教育目标：\n羊水栓塞综合征是一种罕见但灾难性的产科急症，可导致呼吸衰竭和梗阻性休克，表现为中心静脉压升高、肺毛细血管楔压和心脏指数降低。它通常还涉及消耗性凝血病，并伴有广泛出血。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology and hemodynamic manifestations of amniotic fluid embolism syndrome (AFES) in the postpartum period. It requires the integration of clinical presentation, vital signs, and hemodynamic monitoring data to identify the most likely underlying abnormality.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the clinical picture suggestive of AFES, including sudden onset of respiratory distress, hypotension, and coagulopathy after delivery. Then, analyze the provided hemodynamic parameters (elevated CVP, low PCWP) in the context of potential causes of obstructive shock, leading to the identification of increased pulmonary vascular resistance as the primary hemodynamic derangement.",
