    "en": "A 31-year-old woman is brought to the hospital due to respiratory difficulty. She has had trouble performing her daily activities for the past few weeks due to fatigue. In particular, her arms seem to \"just drop\" when she combs her hair or brushes her teeth. The patient's symptoms are generally better in the morning and worsen throughout the day. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Examination shows diplopia. Chest auscultation shows normal heart and breath sounds. Deep tendon reflexes are normal. Babinski sign is absent. The results of arterial blood gas analysis are as follows: {{exhibit_1}} pH 7.32, {{exhibit_2}} pCO2 60 mm Hg, {{exhibit_3}} pO2 60 mm Hg. Which of the following is most likely abnormal in this patient?",
    "zh": "一名31岁的女性因呼吸困难被送往医院。在过去的几周里，由于疲劳，她很难完成日常活动。特别是，当她梳头或刷牙时，她的手臂似乎会“突然无力”。患者的症状通常在早上好转，并在白天恶化。她不吸烟，不饮酒，也不吸毒。检查显示复视。胸部听诊显示心音和呼吸音正常。深腱反射正常。Babinski征阴性。动脉血气分析结果如下：{{exhibit_1}} pH 7.32，{{exhibit_2}} pCO2 60 mmHg，{{exhibit_3}} pO2 60 mmHg。该患者最有可能出现以下哪种异常？"

    "en": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by fatigable, fluctuating weakness of the skeletal muscles. The most commonly affected muscles include ocular (diplopia, ptosis), bulbar (dysarthria, fatigable chewing), facial (loss of smile), and proximal (neck/shoulder weakness) muscles. However, respiratory failure (↓ pH, ↑ pCO2, ↓ O2) can also occur due to diaphragmatic weakness (ie, myasthenic crisis), and may be the presenting symptom in some patients. MG is caused by an autoantibody-mediated, T cell-dependent attack on the acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) of the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction. Antibody-mediated blockade of the active site of AChRs prevents acetylcholine from binding and also triggers endocytosis of AChRs (receptor internalization) as well as complement-mediated membrane damage. Over time, these changes result in reduced numbers of AChRs and impaired neuromuscular transmission. {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "重症肌无力 (MG) 是一种获得性自身免疫性疾病，其特征是骨骼肌的易疲劳、波动性无力。最常受影响的肌肉包括眼肌（复视、眼睑下垂）、延髓肌（构音障碍、咀嚼疲劳）、面部肌肉（微笑消失）和近端肌肉（颈部/肩部无力）。然而，由于膈肌无力（即肌无力危象），也可能发生呼吸衰竭（↓ pH、↑ pCO2、↓ O2），并且可能是某些患者的首发症状。MG 是由自身抗体介导的、T 细胞依赖性攻击突触后神经肌肉接头的乙酰胆碱受体 (AChRs) 引起的。抗体介导的 AChRs 活性位点阻滞阻止乙酰胆碱结合，并触发 AChRs 的内吞作用（受体内在化）以及补体介导的膜损伤。随着时间的推移，这些变化导致 AChRs 数量减少和神经肌肉传递受损。{{exhibit_4}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of myasthenia gravis, including fatigable weakness that worsens throughout the day and affects ocular and proximal muscles, along with respiratory difficulty indicated by abnormal arterial blood gas results. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder where antibodies attack acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to a reduced number of functional receptors and impaired neuromuscular transmission. Therefore, the number of acetylcholine receptors is most likely abnormal.",
