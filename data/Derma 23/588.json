  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Langerhans cells (not to be confused with Langhans giant cells, a type of multinucleated cell formed from macrophages) are the form of dendritic cell most commonly found in the skin and mucous membranes. Dendritic cells are professional antigen presenting cells that interact closely with T lymphocytes. Dendritic are the most effective form of antigen presenting cell because they constitutively express MHC Class II and the co-stimulatory B7 cell surface molecules. They also take up antigen by constant endocytosis and pinocytosis from their environment.\n\nLangerhans cells are derived from the myeloid cell line and express myeloid cell surface markers. They contain characteristic \"racquet-shaped\" intracytoplasmic granules (Birbeck granules) that are only visible on electron microscopy.\n\n(Choice A) Kupffer cells are macrophage-derived cells present in the liver that compose part of the reticuloendothelial system. Kupffer cells lie within the hepatic sinusoids and, like any other macrophage, serve a phagocytic role in the liver.\n\n(Choice C) Merkel cells are neuroendocrine cells of the basal layer of the epidermis, often found in association with nerve projections, that play a role in perception of touch. They are associated with a rare but highly malignant form of skin cancer known as Merkel cell carcinoma.\n\n(Choice D) Melanocytes are pigment producing cells of the epidermis that arise from the neural crest cells and migrate to the basal layer of the epidermis during embryogenesis. They possess dendritic processes that intercalate between the remaining cells of the epidermis and facilitate the delivery of pigment-laden melanosomes from the melanocyte to the keratinocytes.\n\n(Choices E and F) Macrophages can be found in the skin, possess myeloid cell surface markers, and when stimulated, are able to produce dendrite-like extensions of their cytoplasm. Macrophages can also differentiate into multinucleated (Langhans) giant cells and epithelioid cells in the setting of granulomatous inflammation. However, monocytes and their derivatives do not produce Birbeck granules.",
    "zh": "朗格汉斯细胞（不要与朗格汉斯巨细胞混淆，后者是由巨噬细胞形成的一种多核细胞）是皮肤和黏膜中最常见的树突状细胞。树突状细胞是专业的抗原呈递细胞，与 T 淋巴细胞密切相互作用。树突状细胞是最有效的抗原呈递细胞，因为它们组成性地表达 MHC II 类分子和共刺激 B7 细胞表面分子。它们还通过持续的胞吞作用和胞饮作用从其环境中摄取抗原。\n\n朗格汉斯细胞源自髓系细胞系，并表达髓系细胞表面标志物。它们含有特征性的“球拍状”细胞质内颗粒（Birbeck 颗粒），仅在电子显微镜下可见。\n\n（选项 A）枯否细胞是存在于肝脏中的巨噬细胞衍生的细胞，是网状内皮系统的一部分。枯否细胞位于肝窦内，与其他巨噬细胞一样，在肝脏中发挥吞噬作用。\n\n（选项 C）梅克尔细胞是表皮基底层的神经内分泌细胞，常与神经突起相关，在触觉感知中发挥作用。它们与一种罕见但高度恶性的皮肤癌有关，称为梅克尔细胞癌。\n\n（选项 D）黑素细胞是表皮的色素生成细胞，源自神经嵴细胞，并在胚胎发生过程中迁移到表皮基底层。它们具有树突状突起，插入表皮的其余细胞之间，并促进将富含色素的黑素体从黑素细胞输送到角质形成细胞。\n\n（选项 E 和 F）巨噬细胞可在皮肤中找到，具有髓系细胞表面标志物，并且在受到刺激时，能够产生细胞质的树突状延伸。在肉芽肿性炎症的情况下，巨噬细胞还可以分化为多核（朗格汉斯）巨细胞和上皮样细胞。然而，单核细胞及其衍生物不产生 Birbeck 颗粒。"
