    "en": "A 68-year-old woman comes to the office due to a burning sensation in her chest and throat for the past 2 weeks. Associated symptoms include trouble swallowing. Medical history is significant for osteoporosis, and she has no known drug allergies. The patient has smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for 50 years, and does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 70/min. BMI is 20 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary examination shows clear lungs and normal S1 and S2. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Laboratory results are normal. It is determined that the patient's current symptoms are caused by one of her medications, which is discontinued. Her symptoms subsequently resolve. The medication responsible for this patient's presentation is also associated with which of the following side effects?",

    "en": "This patient has esophagitis, with burning pain in the chest and dysphagia. MEDICATION-INDUCED ESOPHAGITIS is a common adverse effect of BISPHOSPHONATES (eg, alendronate, risedronate) thought to be caused by disruption of the protective phospholipid barrier in the lower esophagus. This allows refluxing gastric acid to cause mucosal erosion and ulceration. Bisphosphonates are contraindicated in conditions that impair esophageal motility (eg, stricture, achalasia). When bisphosphonates are used, the risk of esophagitis can be lessened by taking the medication with a full glass of water (to ensure the pill is delivered fully into the stomach) and remaining upright for 30 minutes following administration (to avoid reflux of gastric contents).\n\nBisphosphonates are also associated with OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAW (mandible or maxilla) and atypical bone fractures (eg, stress fractures of the subtrochanteric zone and femoral shaft). The precise pathophysiology is debated and may vary, but proposed mechanisms include suppression of bone remodeling, impaired healing of microfractures, and decreased angiogenesis.\n\n(Choice A) Medication-induced nephropathy can be due to interstitial nephritis (eg, cyclosporine), crystal nephropathy (eg, acyclovir), renal vasoconstriction (eg, amphotericin B, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), or tubular injury (eg, aminoglycosides). Bisphosphonates are eliminated by the kidney and should be used with caution in patients with chronic kidney disease, but do not have substantial nephrotoxicity.\n\n(Choice B) Bisphosphonates decrease bone resorption, thus lowering serum calcium levels. They are sometimes used in the treatment of severe HYPERCALCEMIA (eg, hypercalcemia of malignancy).\n\n(Choice D) Venous thromboembolism is a recognized complication of selective estrogen receptor modulators (eg, raloxifene), but these medications do not often cause esophagitis. Bisphosphonates do not appreciably increase the risk of thromboembolism.\n\n(Choice E) Vitamin B12 deficiency can be seen in long-term proton pump inhibitor (eg, omeprazole) therapy, possibly due to decreased acid-dependent cleavage of vitamin B12 from dietary proteins. Although proton pump inhibitors may be taken by patients with bisphosphonate-induced esophagitis, bisphosphonates do not affect vitamin B12 metabolism.",
    "zh": "该患者患有食管炎，表现为胸部烧灼痛和吞咽困难。药物诱导的食管炎是双膦酸盐（如阿仑膦酸钠、利塞膦酸钠）的常见不良反应，被认为是由下食管保护性磷脂屏障的破坏引起的。这使得反流的胃酸导致黏膜糜烂和溃疡。双膦酸盐禁用于影响食管蠕动的疾病（如狭窄、贲门失弛缓症）。当使用双膦酸盐时，可以通过用一大杯水服用药物（以确保药丸完全进入胃中）并在给药后保持直立30分钟（以避免胃内容物反流）来降低食管炎的风险。\n\n双膦酸盐也与颌骨坏死（下颌骨或上颌骨）和非典型骨折（例如，股骨转子下区和股骨干的应力性骨折）有关。确切的病理生理学存在争议，可能有所不同，但提出的机制包括抑制骨重塑、微骨折愈合受损和血管生成减少。\n\n（选项A）药物引起的肾病可由间质性肾炎（例如，环孢素）、晶体肾病（例如，阿昔洛韦）、肾血管收缩（例如，两性霉素B、非甾体抗炎药）或肾小管损伤（例如，氨基糖苷类）引起。双膦酸盐通过肾脏消除，应谨慎用于慢性肾脏病患者，但没有明显的肾毒性。\n\n（选项B）双膦酸盐降低骨吸收，从而降低血清钙水平。它们有时用于治疗严重的血钙过多症（例如，恶性肿瘤的高钙血症）。\n\n（选项D）静脉血栓栓塞是选择性雌激素受体调节剂（例如，雷洛昔芬）的公认并发症，但这些药物通常不会引起食管炎。双膦酸盐不会明显增加血栓栓塞的风险。\n\n（选项E）维生素B12缺乏症可见于长期质子泵抑制剂（例如，奥美拉唑）治疗，这可能由于维生素B12从膳食蛋白质中依赖酸的裂解减少所致。虽然双膦酸盐诱发的食管炎患者可以服用质子泵抑制剂，但双膦酸盐不影响维生素B12的代谢。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of medication-induced esophagitis, its common causes, and associated side effects of the responsible drug class. Specifically, it assesses knowledge of bisphosphonates, their mechanism of causing esophagitis, and their other significant adverse effects like osteonecrosis of the jaw.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the likely medication causing the patient's symptoms of burning chest pain and dysphagia, which points towards medication-induced esophagitis. Then, recall or deduce the drug class responsible for this side effect and its other known adverse effects, such as osteonecrosis of the jaw.",
