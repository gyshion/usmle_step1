    "en": "A 38-year-old man comes to the office for evaluation of discomfort in his wrists. He thinks his symptoms may be related to \"typing all day, every day.\" The patient is a software engineer and prefers to work remotely from home to \"avoid wasting time talking and interacting with coworkers.\" He rarely leaves his apartment and spends his spare time on his computer, reading online forums about space exploration and the possibility of alien life. When asked about relationships he says, \"I've always liked being on my own.\" He spent a large portion of his childhood disassembling and rebuilding electronic devices and had few friends. His affect appears constricted and his responses to questions are limited.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is E. This patient's preference for working on his own, disinterest in relationships, and constricted range of affect are suggestive of schizoid personality disorder. Individuals with this disorder have a persistent pattern of SOCIAL DETACHMENT, preference for SOLITARY ACTIVITIES, and LIMITED EMOTIONAL EXPRESSIVITY when interacting with others. They have few close relationships, usually only with family members, and show little interest in intimacy or sexual experiences. Individuals with schizoid personality disorder may have occupational difficulties as they can appear indifferent to feedback and tend to prefer working alone.\n\n(Choice A) Antisocial personality disorder involves a pattern of violating the rights of others and engaging in unlawful behaviors (eg, physical aggression, property destruction) without feeling remorseful for transgressions.\n(Choice B) Individuals with avoidant personality disorder also have limited social interactions, but they strongly desire relationships and social acceptance. They tend to avoid socialization due to fear of rejection and feelings of inadequacy.\n(Choice C) Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder involves a pattern of fixation with orderliness, control, and perfectionism resulting in interpersonal inflexibility and moral rigidity.\n(Choice D) Individuals with paranoid personality disorder also have few relationships and social interactions, but this stems from suspiciousness and distrust of others' intentions rather than disinterest.\n(Choice F) Although individuals with schizoid personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder lack close friends and can be socially awkward, those with schizotypal personality disorder have a long-standing pattern of eccentric behaviors, perceptual disturbances, and magical thinking (eg, clairvoyance, telepathy).\n\nEducational objective:\nSchizoid personality disorder consists of a persistent pattern of social detachment, preference for solitary activities, and constricted range of affect in social interactions.",
    "zh": "正确答案是E。该患者喜欢独处、对人际关系不感兴趣以及情感范围受限，提示患有分裂样人格障碍。患有这种障碍的个体在与他人互动时，会持续表现出社会脱离、偏爱独处活动和情感表达受限。他们很少有亲密关系，通常只与家人保持联系，并且对亲密关系或性体验不感兴趣。分裂样人格障碍患者可能在职业方面遇到困难，因为他们对反馈漠不关心，并且倾向于独自工作。\n\n（选项A）反社会型人格障碍涉及一种侵犯他人权利并从事非法行为（例如，身体攻击、财产破坏）的模式，而不会为自己的过错感到悔恨。\n（选项B）回避型人格障碍患者也有有限的社交互动，但他们强烈渴望人际关系和社会接纳。他们倾向于避免社交，因为害怕被拒绝和感到自己不够好。\n（选项C）强迫型人格障碍涉及一种对秩序、控制和完美主义的执念，导致人际关系缺乏灵活性和道德上的僵化。\n（选项D）偏执型人格障碍患者也很少有亲密关系和社交互动，但这源于对他人意图的怀疑和不信任，而不是不感兴趣。\n（选项F）虽然分裂样人格障碍和分裂型人格障碍患者都缺乏亲密朋友，并且可能在社交上显得笨拙，但分裂型人格障碍患者具有长期的怪异行为、知觉障碍和魔幻思维模式（例如，千里眼、心灵感应）。\n\n教育目标：\n分裂样人格障碍包括持续的社会脱离模式、对独处活动的偏爱以及在社交互动中情感范围受限。"
