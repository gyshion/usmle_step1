    "en": "An 81-year-old man comes to the office after an upper respiratory tract infection. His symptoms have largely resolved except for a mild, nonproductive cough that is especially bothersome at night. Medical history includes hypertension and knee osteoarthritis. The patient is still physically active and plays golf on the weekends. He is a retired insurance executive and has no known environmental exposures. He has no history of smoking. Physical examination is unremarkable, and chest x-ray is normal. Pulmonary function testing is considered in this patient. Compared to midlife, which of the following changes are most likely expected as a result of normal aging in this patient? {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "一位81岁男性在出现上呼吸道感染后前来就诊。他的症状已基本缓解，仅残留轻微的、无痰咳嗽，夜间尤为恼人。病史包括高血压和膝关节骨性关节炎。患者仍然积极参与体育活动，周末打高尔夫球。他是一名退休的保险主管，没有已知的环境暴露。他没有吸烟史。体格检查无特殊发现，胸部X线检查正常。在该患者中考虑进行肺功能测试。与中年相比，该患者的正常衰老最有可能出现以下哪些变化？{{exhibit_1}}"
