She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for over 20 years. Her temperature is 40 C (104 F), blood pressure is 104/63 mm Hg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 24/min. Lung examination reveals lower lobe crackles with no wheezing. Her abdomen is soft, non-distended, and non-tender. Chest x-ray shows bilateral lower lobe interstitial infiltrates.",

    "en": "Legionellosis can be divided into Pontiac fever (an acute, flu-like, self-limited disease) and the more common Legionnaires' disease. Legionnaires' disease should be suspected in patients with recent exposure to contaminated water (sporadic cases or common-source outbreaks in cruise ships, spas, hospitals, or air-conditioned hotels), radiographic evidence of pneumonia (typically patchy infiltrates that may progress to consolidation), high fever (>39 C [102.2 F]) sometimes associated with relative bradycardia, neurologic symptoms (eg, confusion, headache), and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (eg, diarrhea). Risk groups include the elderly or immunocompromised, smokers, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nBecause Legionella pneumophila is a faintly staining gram-negative bacillus that is facultatively intracellular, Gram stain typically shows many neutrophils but few or no organisms. Legionella is often diagnosed by urinary antigen testing; it grows on selective medium (buffered charcoal yeast extract [BCYE]). The most common laboratory abnormality is hyponatremia, frequently associated with Legionella but not other causes of pneumonia. The hyponatremia may be related to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and/or renal tubulointerstitial disease impairing sodium reabsorption (possibly due to either direct effect of Legionella, cytokines, or natriuretic peptides). Elevated transaminases are also common.\n\n(Choice A) This patient does not have asthma, making allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (pulmonary infiltrates/bronchiectasis with eosinophilia and elevated IgE and anti-Aspergillus antibody titers) unlikely. Some helminthic infections are associated with pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophilia (Löffler). However, high fever, neurologic symptoms, and concurrent GI and pulmonary symptoms are unusual.\n\n(Choices B and D) Streptococcus pneumoniae (gram-positive diplococci on Gram stain) is the most common overall cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Lobar consolidation is classic. Patients with influenza A typically experience the abrupt onset of fever, headache, myalgias, and malaise that gradually improve over 2-5 days, with a subset developing secondary bacterial pneumonia (exacerbation of fever and respiratory symptoms after initial improvement). However, dry cough, GI and neurologic symptoms, and interstitial infiltrates in the setting of a recent cruise make Legionella more likely.\n\n(Choice E) Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can result in cold agglutinin formation. However, M pneumoniae predominantly affects young adults and is more likely to cause tracheobronchitis than pneumonia. Clinical presentation is typically mild with bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray appearing more severe than expected based on clinical findings.\n\nEducational objective: Legionella pneumophila is a facultative intracellular gram-negative bacillus that can cause a systemic infection. Symptoms frequently include high fever, cough, confusion, and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormality seen with Legionella pneumonia is hyponatremia, and sputum Gram stain often shows many neutrophils but few or no organisms.",
    "zh": "军团病可分为庞蒂亚克热（一种急性的、类似流感的、自限性疾病）和更常见的军团病。对于近期暴露于受污染水域的患者（游轮、水疗中心、医院或空调酒店的散发病例或共同源性爆发），具有肺炎的放射学证据（通常是斑片状浸润，可能进展为实变）、高热（>39摄氏度[102.2华氏度]），有时伴有相对性心动过缓、神经系统症状（如意识模糊、头痛）和胃肠道（GI）症状（如腹泻）的患者，应怀疑是军团病。危险人群包括老年人或免疫功能低下者、吸烟者和患有慢性阻塞性肺病 (COPD) 的患者。\n\n由于嗜肺军团菌是一种染色很浅的革兰氏阴性杆菌，属于兼性细胞内细菌，革兰染色通常显示许多中性粒细胞，但细菌很少或没有。军团病通常通过尿抗原检测诊断；它在选择性培养基（缓冲炭酵母提取物 [BCYE]）上生长。最常见的实验室异常是低钠血症，通常与军团病有关，但与其他原因引起的肺炎无关。低钠血症可能与抗利尿激素分泌不当和/或肾小管间质疾病损害钠重吸收有关（可能由于军团菌的直接作用、细胞因子或利钠肽）。转氨酶升高也很常见。\n\n（选项 A）该患者没有哮喘，因此不太可能发生过敏性支气管肺曲霉病（肺浸润/支气管扩张伴嗜酸性粒细胞增多，IgE和抗曲霉抗体滴度升高）。一些蠕虫感染与肺浸润和嗜酸性粒细胞增多症（Löffler综合征）有关。然而，高热、神经系统症状以及同时出现的胃肠道和肺部症状是不寻常的。\n\n（选项 B 和 D）肺炎链球菌（革兰染色呈革兰阳性双球菌）是社区获得性肺炎最常见的原因。大叶实变是典型特征。甲型流感患者通常会突然出现发烧、头痛、肌痛和不适，这些症状会在2-5天内逐渐改善，其中一部分人会发生继发性细菌性肺炎（最初改善后发烧和呼吸道症状加重）。然而，干咳、胃肠道和神经系统症状，以及近期游轮旅行情况下的间质浸润，使军团病更有可能。\n\n（选项 E）肺炎支原体感染可导致冷凝集素的形成。然而，肺炎支原体主要影响年轻人，更可能引起气管支气管炎而不是肺炎。临床表现通常较轻，胸部X光片显示双侧浸润，其严重程度似乎高于临床发现的预期。\n\n教育目标：嗜肺军团菌是一种兼性细胞内革兰氏阴性杆菌，可引起全身感染。症状通常包括高热、咳嗽、意识模糊和腹泻。军团菌肺炎最常见的实验室异常是低钠血症，痰涂片革兰染色通常显示许多中性粒细胞，但细菌很少或没有。"
