    "en": "A 22-year-old woman comes to the office due to worsening dyspnea and heart pounding with exercise for the last week. She has no chronic medical conditions but reports aches and pains over the past several weeks. The patient takes ibuprofen as needed but no other medications. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 138/86 mm Hg, and pulse is 90/min. BMI is 18 kg/m². Physical examination shows an erythematous rash in sun-exposed regions. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A midsystolic click and systolic murmur are heard best at the apex without radiation. There is mild tenderness of joints. Laboratory results are as follows:{{exhibit_1}}\n\n",

    "en": "(Choices A and C) The presence of significant reticulocytosis (eg, >4-5%) rules out causes of anemia associated with an impaired bone marrow response, including bone marrow suppression from cancer or infection (eg, parvovirus), anemia of chronic disease (cytokine-mediated retention of iron), and vitamin deficiency (eg, vitamin B₁₂ deficiency from intrinsic factor antibodies, iron deficiency).\n\n(Choice D) A normal platelet count effectively rules out anemia due to a microangiopathic process associated with intravascular platelet consumption (eg, thrombotic microangiopathy).\n\n(Choice E) Although traumatic intravascular hemolysis can occur with a mechanical heart valve or severe aortic stenosis, it is uncommon in otherwise healthy young individuals. Furthermore, this patient's heart murmur is most consistent with mitral valve prolapse, which is common in patients with SLE but rarely causes traumatic hemolysis.\n\nEducational objective:\nAnemia with an elevated reticulocyte count (ie, reticulocytosis) indicates that the bone marrow is responding appropriately to the anemia by generating new erythrocytes. Reticulocytosis is commonly seen in patients with hemolysis or acute bleeding. Many other causes of anemias are associated with low reticulocyte count, including bone marrow suppression (eg, parvovirus), iron deficiency anemia, vitamin B₁₂/folate deficiency, and anemia of chronic disease.",
    "zh": "(选项A和C) 存在显着的网织红细胞增多症（例如，>4-5%）排除了与骨髓反应受损相关的贫血原因，包括来自癌症或感染（例如，细小病毒）的骨髓抑制，慢性病性贫血（细胞因子介导的铁的滞留）和维生素缺乏症（例如，由于内因子抗体引起的维生素B₁₂缺乏症、缺铁性贫血）。\n\n(选项D) 血小板计数正常有效地排除了由与血管内血小板消耗相关的微血管病变引起的贫血（例如，血栓性微血管病）。\n\n(选项E) 虽然创伤性血管内溶血可能发生在机械性心脏瓣膜或严重主动脉瓣狭窄患者中，但在其他方面健康的年轻人中并不常见。此外，该患者的心脏杂音最符合二尖瓣脱垂，这在患有SLE的患者中很常见，但很少引起创伤性溶血。\n\n教育目标：\n贫血伴有网织红细胞计数升高（即网织红细胞增多症）表明骨髓通过产生新的红细胞对贫血的反应是适当的。网织红细胞增多症常见于溶血或急性出血的患者。许多其他贫血的原因与网织红细胞计数低有关，包括骨髓抑制（例如，细小病毒）、缺铁性贫血、维生素B₁₂/叶酸缺乏症和慢性病性贫血。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the differential diagnosis of anemia, specifically focusing on the interpretation of reticulocyte count in the context of other clinical findings. It requires recognizing the signs and symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its association with autoimmune hemolytic anemia.\n\nThe best approach is to first identify the key findings: anemia, reticulocytosis, photosensitive rash, joint pain, and heart murmur. Then, consider the possible causes of anemia with reticulocytosis and evaluate each option based on the clinical context. Rule out options that are inconsistent with the findings, such as bone marrow suppression or thrombotic microangiopathy.",
