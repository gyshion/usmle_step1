    "en": "A researcher is conducting a retrospective study on breast cancer recurrence. Records of a number of patients with hormone receptor-positive, early-stage breast cancer who received adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen were evaluated. Various clinical, demographic, and drug concentration data were analyzed. A comparison of patients who had disease recurrence with those who remained cancer-free showed that some of the relapsed patients had lower serum concentrations of endoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen, the active metabolites of tamoxifen.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are a group of heme-containing proteins that are responsible for the majority of drug metabolism, which occurs predominantly in the liver. Various CYP subtypes exist, with CYP3A, CYP2D, and CYP2C as the most active subtypes involved in drug metabolism. These enzymes generally function to deactivate drugs and facilitate excretion from the body by improving water solubility. However, they also metabolize certain compounds to their active forms.\n\nPolymorphisms may occur in the genes coding for these enzymes, altering their expression or activity. Three important phenotypes exist: poor, intermediate, and rapid metabolizer. Identifying these variations on an individual basis provides a framework for optimizing therapy, predicting treatment efficacy, and minimizing toxicity.\n\nTamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, is a prodrug metabolized by CYP2D6 to its active metabolite, endoxifen. Patients with genetic polymorphisms resulting in poor CYP2D activity are exposed to decreased levels of the active metabolite and have a higher risk of disease relapse.\n\n(Choice A) Activation of downstream signal transducer proteins, such as KRAS, leads to activation of transcription factors that promote cell growth. Mutations in the KRAS gene are associated with the development of colorectal and lung cancers.\n\n(Choice B) Decreased activity of hepatic N-acetyltransferase results in a diminished ability to metabolize drugs such as isoniazid and sulfonamides, leading to an increased likelihood of toxicity.\n\n(Choice C) Thiopurine methyltransferase is responsible for the metabolism of thiopurine compounds such as the immunosuppressive drug 6-mercaptopurine. Enzyme deficiency leads to increased drug toxicity.\n\n(Choice D) P-glycoprotein is a cell membrane protein that drives efflux of a number of substances out of the cell. Overexpression of P-glycoprotein in tumor cells has been identified as a cause of multidrug resistance.\n\nEducational objective:\nCytochrome P450 enzymes found in the liver are responsible for the majority of drug metabolism. Polymorphisms occurring in the genes coding for these enzymes result in various phenotypes that differ in their rates of metabolism; individual differences in phenotype alter treatment efficacy and drug toxicity.",
    "zh": "细胞色素 P450 (CYP) 酶是一组含血红素的蛋白质，负责大部分药物代谢，主要发生在肝脏中。存在各种 CYP 亚型，其中 CYP3A、CYP2D 和 CYP2C 是参与药物代谢的最活跃亚型。这些酶通常发挥使药物失活的作用，并通过提高水溶性来促进药物从体内排出。然而，它们也会将某些化合物代谢成其活性形式。\n\n编码这些酶的基因中可能发生多态性，从而改变其表达或活性。存在三种重要的表型：慢代谢者、中等代谢者和快代谢者。在个体基础上识别这些变异提供了优化治疗、预测治疗效果和最大限度减少毒性的框架。\n\n他莫昔芬是一种选择性雌激素受体调节剂，用于治疗雌激素受体阳性乳腺癌，它是一种前药，由 CYP2D6 代谢成其活性代谢物内分泌芬。具有导致 CYP2D 活性降低的基因多态性的患者会接触到活性代谢物的水平降低，并且疾病复发的风险更高。\n\n（选项 A）下游信号转导蛋白（如 KRAS）的激活会导致促进细胞生长的转录因子的激活。 KRAS 基因突变与结直肠癌和肺癌的发生有关。\n\n（选项 B）肝脏 N-乙酰转移酶活性降低会导致代谢异烟肼和磺胺类药物等药物的能力下降，从而导致毒性增加的可能性。\n\n（选项 C）硫嘌呤甲基转移酶负责代谢硫嘌呤化合物，如免疫抑制药物 6-巯基嘌呤。酶缺乏会导致药物毒性增加。\n\n（选项 D）P-糖蛋白是一种细胞膜蛋白，它驱动许多物质从细胞中流出。肿瘤细胞中 P-糖蛋白的过度表达已被确定为多药耐药性的原因。\n\n教育目标：\n肝脏中发现的细胞色素 P450 酶负责大部分药物代谢。编码这些酶的基因中发生的多态性会导致各种表型，这些表型在代谢速率上有所不同；表型的个体差异会改变治疗效果和药物毒性。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of pharmacogenomics, specifically how genetic variations in drug-metabolizing enzymes like Cytochrome P450 can affect the efficacy of medications such as tamoxifen. It assesses the knowledge of how polymorphisms in CYP2D6 can lead to reduced levels of active tamoxifen metabolites, resulting in treatment failure.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify that tamoxifen is a prodrug requiring metabolic activation by CYP enzymes. Recognizing that reduced levels of active metabolites in relapsed patients suggest impaired metabolism, and then linking this to genetic polymorphisms in the relevant CYP enzyme (CYP2D6) is the key to selecting the correct answer.",
