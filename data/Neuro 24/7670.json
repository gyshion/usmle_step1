    "en": "This patient has a large pituitary adenoma (macroadenoma) {{exhibit_2}}. In addition to metabolic effects related to alterations in pituitary hormone production, large adenomas can cause symptoms due to compression of surrounding structures; mass effect headaches are common.\n\nBecause of the close approximation of the pituitary to the optic chiasm, pituitary tumors can cause compression of optic nerve fibers (CN II) as they decussate at the chiasm, leading to impaired vision in the temporal fields (ie, bitemporal hemianopia). This is the most likely visual field defect given the location of the tumor.\n\n(Choice A) Facial (eg, Bell) palsy typically results from inflammation (eg, herpes simplex virus) or surgical injury to the facial nerve (CN VII).\n\n(Choice C) Pituitary adenomas are not associated with hemiparesis, which is more commonly caused by stroke.\n\n(Choice D) Unilateral ataxia would result from unilateral damage to the cerebellum or sensory pathways, not from a lesion in the pituitary.\n\n(Choice E) Upward gaze palsy occurs as a component of Parinaud (ie, dorsal midbrain) syndrome, which results from damage to the posterior commissure.\n\nEducational objective:\nLarge pituitary adenomas can cause bitemporal hemianopia due to compression of the optic chiasm. {{exhibit_3}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical manifestations of a large pituitary adenoma, specifically focusing on the neurological deficits caused by mass effect on adjacent structures.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the likely diagnosis from the clinical vignette and MRI findings, and then correlating the location of the lesion with potential neurological deficits. Understanding the anatomical relationships of the pituitary gland to the optic chiasm is crucial for determining the most probable physical examination finding.",
    "zh": "此题考察对大型垂体腺瘤临床表现的理解，特别是侧重于由占位效应引起的对邻近结构的神经功能缺损。\n\n解决此题的方法包括从临床摘要和MRI结果中识别可能的诊断，然后将病变的位置与潜在的神经功能缺损相关联。了解垂体与视交叉的解剖关系对于确定最可能的体格检查结果至关重要。"
