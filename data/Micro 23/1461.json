    "en": "A virologist is researching acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus (HSV). Viral DNA analysis reveals a mutation in the thymidine kinase gene, resulting in a mutated enzyme that does not phosphorylate acyclovir to its active form. In an experiment, a resistant HSV type 2 strain containing {{exhibit_1}} this mutation is cultured in a cell line, and the cell culture is coinfected with a nonresistant HSV type 1 strain. It is found that some of the newly produced type 1 virions acquire resistance to acyclovir, and subsequent progeny continue to be resistant. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the observed findings?",

    "en": "The scenario describes the exchange of genetic information between 2 virus strains that have nonsegmented, double-stranded DNA genomes. Recombination refers to the exchange of genes between 2 chromosomes via crossover within homologous regions. The resulting progeny can have recombined genes with traits from both parent viruses. In this case, the thymidine kinase genes in HSV type 1 and 2 virions are likely to have significant sequence similarity, allowing cross over to occur with relatively high frequency. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该情景描述了两种具有非分节段、双链DNA基因组的病毒株之间的遗传信息交换。重组是指通过同源区域内的交叉，在两个染色体之间交换基因。 产生的子代可以具有来自两个亲本病毒的具有性状重组的基因。在这种情况下，HSV 1型和2型病毒颗粒中的胸苷激酶基因可能具有显着的序列相似性，允许交叉以相对较高的频率发生。{{exhibit_2}}"
