    "en": "This girl with fatigue, conjunctival pallor, and a low hemoglobin level has anemia. Women of childbearing age are at risk for IRON-DEFICIENCY ANEMIA due to menstrual cycle blood loss, especially teenage girls who have higher iron requirements due to growth. In this patient, decreased consumption of dietary iron (eg, vegetarianism) is an additional risk factor. As iron deficiency develops, the following sequence can be seen:\n\n1.  Decreased bone marrow iron stores (ferritin and hemosiderin)\n2.  Decreased serum ferritin\n3.  Increased serum total iron-binding capacity, reflecting increased transferrin (Choice C)\n4.  Decreased serum iron concentration\n5.  Decreased hemoglobin\n6.  Appearance of microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells (low mean corpuscular volume [MCV])\n\nFerritin is an intracellular iron-storage protein that is used as a serum marker of total body iron stores. It is decreased in iron deficiency and elevated in iron overload or during infection/inflammation (acute phase reaction). Transferrin transports iron through the plasma. When iron levels are normal, approximately one third of circulating transferrin is bound to iron. In iron deficiency, hepatic synthesis of transferrin increases but transferrin saturation drops due to decreased release of iron into the plasma from intracellular stores.\n\n(Choice A) The earliest signs of iron deficiency are low serum ferritin and high serum transferrin, which manifest before overt anemia develops. This pattern of findings is more consistent with α- or β-thalassemia, which usually cause microcytic anemia with normal ferritin and transferrin levels.\n\n(Choice D) Low hemoglobin in the setting of a normal MCV, low circulating transferrin, and high serum ferritin is suggestive of anemia of chronic disease, which is often associated with infections and inflammatory conditions. Other acute phase reactants (eg, C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate) are usually elevated in these patients.\n\n(Choices E and F) Hypersegmented neutrophils are characteristic of megaloblastic anemias, which can be caused by folate and vitamin B₁₂ deficiency. Folate deficiency is unlikely in this patient, as folate is found in many vegetable products. Although vegetarians are at risk for vitamin B₁₂ deficiency, depletion of hepatic B₁₂ stores takes several years, and this patient has been a vegetarian only for the past 6 months. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}\n\nEducational objective:\nAnemia in women of childbearing age is typically caused by iron deficiency secondary to menstrual blood loss. Iron deficiency is associated with decreased serum ferritin, increased total iron-binding capacity (transferrin), and microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells.",
    "zh": "这名女孩出现疲劳、结膜苍白和血红蛋白水平低下的情况，患有贫血。育龄妇女由于月经周期性失血而有患缺铁性贫血的风险，尤其是由于生长而对铁的需求量更高的少女。在该患者中，减少膳食铁的摄入（例如，素食主义）是另一个危险因素。随着铁缺乏的发展，可以看到以下顺序：\n\n1. 骨髓铁储存减少（铁蛋白和含铁血黄素）\n2. 血清铁蛋白降低\n3. 血清总铁结合力增加，反映转铁蛋白增加（选项C）\n4. 血清铁浓度降低\n5. 血红蛋白降低\n6. 出现小细胞性、低色素性红细胞（平均红细胞体积[MCV]偏低）\n\n铁蛋白是一种细胞内铁储存蛋白，用作全身铁储存的血清标志物。它在缺铁时降低，在铁超负荷或感染/炎症（急性期反应）期间升高。转铁蛋白通过血浆转运铁。当铁水平正常时，大约三分之一的循环转铁蛋白与铁结合。在缺铁时，肝脏转铁蛋白的合成增加，但由于细胞内储存释放到血浆中的铁减少，转铁蛋白饱和度下降。\n\n（选项A）缺铁的最早征兆是血清铁蛋白低和血清转铁蛋白高，这在明显贫血发生之前就已显现。这种发现模式与α-或β-地中海贫血更一致，后者通常会导致小细胞性贫血，但铁蛋白和转铁蛋白水平正常。\n\n（选项D）在MCV正常、循环转铁蛋白低和血清铁蛋白高的情况下，血红蛋白低提示慢性病贫血，这通常与感染和炎症有关。其他急性期反应物（例如，C反应蛋白、沉降率）通常在这些患者中升高。\n\n（选项E和F）多分叶中性粒细胞是巨幼红细胞性贫血的特征，后者可由叶酸和维生素B₁₂缺乏引起。该患者不太可能出现叶酸缺乏，因为叶酸存在于许多蔬菜产品中。尽管素食主义者有患维生素B₁₂缺乏的风险，但肝脏B₁₂储存的耗竭需要数年时间，而该患者作为素食主义者仅有6个月。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}\n\n教学目标：\n育龄妇女的贫血通常由月经失血继发的缺铁引起。缺铁与血清铁蛋白降低、总铁结合力（转铁蛋白）增加和小细胞性贫血有关。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of iron deficiency anemia in a young woman, including the expected changes in serum ferritin, transferrin, and MCV. It also tests the ability to differentiate iron deficiency anemia from other causes of anemia based on laboratory findings. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the risk factors for iron deficiency anemia (menstruation, vegetarian diet). Recall that iron deficiency leads to decreased ferritin (iron stores), increased transferrin (to bind more iron), and microcytic anemia (low MCV). Eliminate options that do not fit this pattern.",
