  "explanation": {
    "en": "The question asks about the mechanism most likely responsible for the infectivity of the virus in humans. The patient's history includes working in the poultry industry and a recent trip to China, where an upper respiratory infection epidemic was occurring. The passage states that influenza epidemics and pandemics are typically caused by reassortment of the RNA segments coding for hemagglutinin or neuraminidase proteins (major antigenic shifts). This process can occur between human and animal strains of influenza A virus in avian or swine hosts. {{exhibit_1}} shows the process of reassortment. Therefore, genetic reassortment is the most likely mechanism responsible for the infectivity of this virus in humans.",
    "zh": "题目询问最有可能导致病毒在人类中感染性的机制。患者的病史包括在禽类行业工作，以及最近前往中国旅行，那里正在发生上呼吸道感染的流行。文章指出，流感疫情和全球大流行通常是由编码血凝素或神经氨酸酶蛋白（主要抗原转移）的RNA片段的重排引起的。这一过程可能发生在人类和动物流感A病毒的禽类或猪宿主之间。{{exhibit_1}} 展示了重排的过程。因此，基因重排是最有可能导致该病毒在人类中感染性的机制。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "A patient presents with symptoms suggestive of influenza after traveling to China and working in the poultry industry. The most likely mechanism for the virus's infectivity in humans is genetic reassortment, which is common in influenza viruses and can lead to antigenic shifts.",
    "zh": "一名患者在前往中国并在禽类行业工作后出现提示流感的症状。病毒在人类中感染性的最可能机制是基因重排，这在流感病毒中很常见，并可能导致抗原转移。"
