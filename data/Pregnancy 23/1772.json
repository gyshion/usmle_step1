    "en": "A 34-year-old woman, gravida 0, comes to the office for evaluation of pregnancy. Menarche was at age 12, and her menstrual cycles are regular; they occur every 30 days with 5 days of menses. The patient and her husband have been trying to conceive for the past 6 months and plan intercourse during her fertile window according to an ovulation predictor kit. She has no medical conditions, takes no medications, and has no allergies. BMI is 23 kg/m². Vital signs and physical examination are normal. If fertilization and implantation occurred in this cycle, when would the {{exhibit_1}} $\\beta$-hCG level first be detectable in the serum?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The syncytiotrophoblast invades the endometrial tissue 6-7 days after fertilization and begins secreting $\\beta$-hCG, which enters the maternal circulation and contains corpus luteum progesterone secretion. Accordingly, $\\beta$-hCG may appear in the maternal serum as early as 6 days after fertilization; however, additional time (typically 8 days) is often required for the serum to rise to a detectable level. $\\beta$-hCG is detectable in the maternal serum at <5 IU/L, making serum $\\beta$-hCG testing the most sensitive method of detecting pregnancy. (Choice D) A urine pregnancy test is less sensitive than a serum pregnancy test; it is positive when $\\beta$-hCG reaches 20 IU/L, which typically occurs 14 days following fertilization. Therefore, a serum pregnancy test will be positive before a urine pregnancy test. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "合体滋养层在受精后6-7天侵入子宫内膜组织，并开始分泌β-hCG，β-hCG进入母体循环，维持黄体分泌孕酮。因此，β-hCG最早可能在受精后6天出现在母体血清中；然而，血清水平通常需要更长的时间（通常为8天）才能升高到可检测水平。母体血清中β-hCG的检测水平为<5 IU/L，使得血清β-hCG检测成为检测妊娠最敏感的方法。（选项D）尿妊娠试验不如血清妊娠试验敏感；当β-hCG达到20 IU/L时呈阳性，这通常发生在受精后14天。因此，血清妊娠试验会在尿妊娠试验之前呈阳性。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "The question asks when $\\beta$-hCG would first be detectable in serum after fertilization and implantation. The explanation states that $\\beta$-hCG is secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast 6-7 days after fertilization, and typically becomes detectable in serum around 8 days after fertilization.",
    "zh": "本题询问受精和着床后，β-hCG何时会在血清中首次被检测到。解释指出，β-hCG由合体滋养层在受精后6-7天分泌，通常在受精后8天左右在血清中被检测到。"
