  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with a family history of skin cancer has a skin lesion with features characteristic of MELANOMA (eg, asymmetry, color variability, diameter ≥6 mm). In addition, her recent onset of right upper extremity weakness and generalized tonic-clonic seizure are concerning for spread to the central nervous system, a common site of melanoma metastases.\n\nMelanoma is a malignancy of melanocytes, which are derivatives of neural crest cells. Neural crest cells are multipotent, migratory cells that originate in the ectoderm and gives rise to a diverse cell lineage. In addition to melanocytes, neural ganglia are also derived from neural crest cells and include dorsal root ganglia and sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia. Other important structures that arise from neural crest cells are the adrenal medulla and the bones and cartilage of the face and neck (ie, branchial arch derivatives).\n\n(Choice A) The mesoderm gives rise to the adrenal cortex as well as most bones, muscles, blood vessels, and visceral tissue.\n\n(Choices B and E) The surface ectoderm gives rise to the anterior pituitary as well as the epidermis and its appendages (eg, sweat glands).\n\n(Choice D) The endoderm gives rise to structures derived from the inner lining of the primitive gut tube. These include the gastrointestinal tract, liver and biliary tree, and pancreas.\n\nEducational objective: \nMelanoma is a malignancy of melanocytes, which are embryologically derived from neural crest cells. Neural crest cells originate from the ectoderm and give rise to a diverse cell lineage, including neural ganglia (eg, dorsal root ganglia, sympathetic/parasympathetic ganglia) and the adrenal medulla.",

It also assesses the clinical presentation of melanoma and its potential for metastasis.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that melanocytes are derived from neural crest cells.
