Once you click Proceed to Next Item, you will not be able to add or change an answer.\n\nA 13-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to cough and increased work of breathing. The patient's parents immigrated to the United States when he was 6 months old. He has a history of recurrent otitis media, pneumonia, and thrush as well as chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive. On physical examination, he is tachypneic and has perioral cyanosis. A chest radiograph shows bilateral interstitial opacities. The patient is admitted to the hospital and undergoes bronchoscopy. Analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid reveals *Pneumocystis jirovecii*.",

    "en": "Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a group of X-linked and autosomal recessive genetic disorders marked by the impaired development and activity of both T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes.\n\nLoss of T-lymphocyte activity results in deficient cell-mediated immunity, leading to recurrent viral, fungal, and opportunistic (eg, *Pneumocystis jirovecii*) infections. Because T-lymphocytes are required for B-cells to produce IgG and IgA (T-cell-induced immunoglobulin class switching), patients with SCID also have a dramatic impairment in humoral immunity; this is typically marked by recurrent sinopulmonary bacterial infections (eg, pneumonia, otitis media) and chronic diarrhea due to the lack of IgG and IgA. Recurrent infections often cause failure to thrive.\n\nLaboratory findings of SCID include lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia. Stem cell transplant is the only treatment.\n\n(Choice A) Agammaglobulinemia is an isolated B cell defect that manifests with recurrent sinopulmonary bacterial infections. Infection with *Pneumocystis jirovecii* is not seen in isolated B cell defects because this infection is primarily countered by the cell-mediated immune response.\n\n(Choice B) Chronic granulomatous disease is a disorder of phagocyte dysfunction due to defective NADPH oxidase. This predisposes to infection with certain bacterial (eg, *Staphylococcus aureus*) and fungal (eg, *Aspergillus*) organisms; skin abscesses, pneumonia, and osteomyelitis are common.\n\n(Choice C) Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by thick airway secretions and pancreatic insufficiency, which result in recurrent respiratory infections and chronic diarrhea, respectively. *Pneumocystis* and thrush would not be expected.\n\n(Choice D) Primary ciliary dyskinesia is an autosomal recessive disease that results in poor mucociliary function in the respiratory tract, middle ear, and reproductive organs. Affected patients have recurrent sinopulmonary infections in childhood and decreased fertility in adulthood. Viral or opportunistic infections are not seen.\n\n(Choice F) Terminal complement deficiency (any of C5-C9) prevents formation of the membrane attack complex and results in increased susceptibility to infections by *Neisseria*.\n\nEducational objective:\nSevere combined immunodeficiency is caused by a genetic defect in T cell development, leading to loss of both cellular and humoral immunity. Patients present in infancy with recurrent bacterial, viral, fungal, and opportunistic infections as well as failure to thrive and chronic diarrhea.",
    "zh": "重症联合免疫缺陷 (SCID) 是一组 X 连锁和常染色体隐性遗传疾病，其特征是 T 淋巴细胞和 B 淋巴细胞的发育和活性受损。\n\nT 淋巴细胞活性的丧失导致细胞介导的免疫缺陷，从而导致反复发生的病毒、真菌和机会性（例如，*肺孢子虫*）感染。 由于 B 细胞需要 T 淋巴细胞才能产生 IgG 和 IgA（T 细胞诱导的免疫球蛋白类别转换），患有 SCID 的患者的体液免疫功能也会受到严重损害； 这通常表现为复发性鼻窦肺细菌感染（例如，肺炎、中耳炎）和由于缺乏 IgG 和 IgA 引起的慢性腹泻。 复发性感染常常导致生长迟缓。\n\nSCID 的实验室检查结果包括淋巴细胞减少症和低丙种球蛋白血症。 干细胞移植是唯一的治疗方法。\n\n（选项 A）无丙种球蛋白血症是一种孤立的 B 细胞缺陷，表现为复发性鼻窦肺细菌感染。 在孤立的 B 细胞缺陷中未见 *肺孢子虫* 感染，因为这种感染主要由细胞介导的免疫反应来抵抗。\n\n（选项 B）慢性肉芽肿病是由于 NADPH 氧化酶缺陷导致吞噬细胞功能障碍。 这容易感染某些细菌（例如，*金黄色葡萄球菌*）和真菌（例如，*曲霉*）； 皮肤脓肿、肺炎和骨髓炎很常见。\n\n（选项 C）囊性纤维化是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是气道分泌物粘稠和胰腺功能不全，分别导致复发性呼吸道感染和慢性腹泻。 不会期望出现 *肺孢子虫* 和鹅口疮。\n\n（选项 D）原发性纤毛运动障碍是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，导致呼吸道、中耳和生殖器官的纤毛粘膜功能不佳。 受影响的患者在儿童时期会反复发生鼻窦肺感染，成年后生育力下降。 未见病毒或机会性感染。\n\n（选项 F）末端补体缺陷（任何 C5-C9）会阻止膜攻击复合物的形成，并导致对 *奈瑟菌* 感染的易感性增加。\n\n教育目标：\n重症联合免疫缺陷是由 T 细胞发育的基因缺陷引起的，导致细胞免疫和体液免疫均丧失。 患者在婴儿期表现为反复发生的细菌、病毒、真菌和机会性感染，以及生长迟缓和慢性腹泻。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), its pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic features. It requires understanding of the immune system defects and the resulting susceptibility to various infections. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the constellation of recurrent infections (bacterial, fungal, viral, opportunistic) along with failure to thrive and chronic diarrhea in an infant.
