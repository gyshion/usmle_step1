    "en": "This patient with positive *Escherichia coli* blood cultures has altered mental status, hypotension, and tachycardia, findings consistent with SEPTIC SHOCK.\n\nPathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock caused by gram-negative bacteria (eg, *E coli*) involves the release of bacterial ENDOTOXINS into the bloodstream, which induce a massive release of inflammatory cytokines. The most potent endotoxin of gram-negative bacteria is LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE (LPS), a heat-stable component in the outer membrane that is released with destruction of the bacterial cell wall or during cell division.\n\nThe major virulence component of LPS is LIPID A, which is located on the inner portion of the molecule and provides an anchor into the cell membrane. It activates toll-like receptors on innate immune cells (eg, macrophages), triggering the release of endogenous pyrogens (eg, IL-1, IL-6, prostaglandins) and inflammatory mediators (eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon). These cytokines disrupt endothelial cells and increase vascular permeability, resulting in profound hypotension and end-organ dysfunction/failure.\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n(Choices A and C) Core polysaccharide and O antigen are also components of LPS. However, core polysaccharide, which contains a short chain of sugars that differs among bacteria, is not involved in the virulence of LPS. Similarly, O antigen is a variable polysaccharide on the outer surface and is a target for recognition by the host immune system but is not directly responsible for the manifestations of septic shock.\n\n(Choice D) Peptidoglycan is a component of the bacterial cell wall that provides structural integrity and protection from environmental forces (eg, osmotic stress). Peptidoglycan does not play a role in the development of gram-negative septic shock.\n\n(Choice E) Many gram-negative bacteria (including *E coli*) have surface lipoproteins (SLPs), or proteins attached to a lipid anchor, projecting from the inner or outer membrane. These SLPs help move nutrients into the cell and facilitate immune evasion but are not responsible for causing septic shock.\n\nEducational objective:\nPathogenesis of *Escherichia coli* sepsis involves the release of lipopolysaccharide (ie, endotoxin) from bacterial cells. Lipid A is the major virulence factor of lipopolysaccharides that induces macrophages to release cytokines (eg, IL-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), leading to the manifestations of septic shock (eg, end-organ dysfunction).",
    "zh": "该患者血培养对*大肠杆菌*呈阳性，表现为精神状态改变、低血压和心动过速，这些发现与脓毒性休克一致。\n\n革兰阴性菌（如*大肠杆菌*）引起的脓毒症和脓毒性休克的发病机制涉及细菌内毒素释放到血液中，从而诱导大量炎症细胞因子释放。革兰阴性菌中最有效的内毒素是脂多糖（LPS），这是一种在细胞外膜中热稳定的成分，在细菌细胞壁破坏或细胞分裂过程中释放。\n\nLPS的主要毒力成分是脂质A，它位于分子的内侧部分，并提供细胞膜的锚定。它激活先天免疫细胞（如巨噬细胞）上的Toll样受体，触发内源性致热原（如IL-1、IL-6、前列腺素）和炎症介质（如肿瘤坏死因子-α、干扰素）的释放。这些细胞因子破坏内皮细胞并增加血管通透性，导致严重的低血压和终末器官功能障碍/衰竭。\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n（选项A和C）核心多糖和O抗原也是LPS的组成部分。然而，核心多糖包含细菌之间不同的短链糖，不参与LPS的毒力。同样，O抗原是外表面的可变多糖，是宿主免疫系统识别的靶标，但不能直接导致脓毒性休克的表现。\n\n（选项D）肽聚糖是细菌细胞壁的组成部分，可提供结构完整性并防止环境力量（如渗透压应激）。肽聚糖在革兰阴性菌脓毒性休克的发展中不起作用。\n\n（选项E）许多革兰阴性菌（包括*大肠杆菌*）具有表面脂蛋白（SLPs），即连接到脂质锚定的蛋白质，从内膜或外膜突出。这些SLPs有助于将营养物质移动到细胞中并促进免疫逃避，但不能引起脓毒性休克。\n\n教育目标：\n*大肠杆菌*脓毒症的发病机制涉及脂多糖（即内毒素）从细菌细胞中释放。脂质A是脂多糖的主要毒力因子，可诱导巨噬细胞释放细胞因子（如IL-1、肿瘤坏死因子-α），从而导致脓毒性休克的表现（如终末器官功能障碍）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathogenesis of septic shock caused by gram-negative bacteria, specifically the role of Lipid A in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and its activation of the immune system. It also requires understanding the different components of the bacterial cell wall and their respective roles in virulence and immune response.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's presentation as septic shock and identify *E. coli* as a gram-negative bacterium. Recall that Lipid A is the major virulence factor of LPS, which triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines and leads to the manifestations of septic shock.",
