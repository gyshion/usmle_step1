    "en": "A 72-year-old man comes to the office due to constipation. His stools have become increasingly hard, small-volume, and difficult to pass. This has been associated with bloating but not vomiting. Symptoms have not improved despite fiber supplementation, polyethylene glycol, and bisacodyl. The patient was recently diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic cancer and was prescribed palliative chemotherapy 2 months ago. His cancer causes severe abdominal pain, which requires high-dose oxycodone to control. Vital signs are within normal limits. The abdomen is mildly distended with decreased bowel sounds.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has opioid-induced constipation (OIC). Opiates (eg, oxycodone) exert their analgesic effects by binding to opiate receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems, reducing nociceptive transmission and the perception of pain. Constipation, the most common side effect of opiate therapy, occurs due to the activation of μ-opiate receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. This results in decreased intestinal peristaltic activity and inhibition of ion and fluid secretion, leading to desiccated, pellet-like stool. Unlike many other opiate side effects, tolerance to constipation does not readily occur. Therefore, all patients on opiate therapy should be considered for prophylactic laxative therapy (eg, docusate, polyethylene glycol, bisacodyl).\n\nThose with refractory OIC may benefit from methylnaltrexone, a peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist that reverses the anti-peristaltic effect of opiates. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not induce opiate-related withdrawal symptoms, allowing for treatment of OIC without disrupting analgesic effects.\n\n(Choices A and B) Diphenoxylate and loperamide are both opiate-based medications designed to inhibit peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract. These medications are used to treat diarrhea and would worsen this patient's constipation.\n\n(Choice C) Lubiprostone is a chloride channel agonist that increases intestinal secretions. Although it is not a μ-opioid receptor antagonist, it can be used to treat OIC and would not put patients at risk for opiate-related withdrawal.\n\n(Choice E) Naloxone is also an opioid receptor antagonist; however, unlike methylnaltrexone, naloxone crosses the blood-brain barrier. It induces symptoms of withdrawal and reversal of analgesia and is used to treat acute opioid toxicity (eg, respiratory depression, somnolence).\n\nEducational objective: \nConstipation is the most common side effect of opiate therapy and occurs due to the binding of μ-opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, which decreases intestinal motility and inhibits ion and fluid secretion. Methylnaltrexone, a peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, can alleviate opioid-induced constipation without inducing opiate-related withdrawal symptoms.",
    "zh": "该患者患有阿片类药物引起的便秘 (OIC)。阿片类药物（如羟考酮）通过与中枢和外周神经系统中的阿片受体结合发挥镇痛作用，从而减少伤害性传递和疼痛感知。便秘是阿片类药物治疗最常见的副作用，是由于胃肠道中μ-阿片受体的激活引起的。这导致肠蠕动减少以及离子和液体分泌的抑制，导致粪便干燥、呈颗粒状。与许多其他阿片类药物的副作用不同，对便秘的耐受性不易发生。因此，所有接受阿片类药物治疗的患者都应考虑预防性泻药治疗（例如，多库酯、聚乙二醇、比沙可啶）。\n\n难治性OIC患者可能受益于甲基纳曲酮，这是一种外周作用的μ-阿片受体拮抗剂，可逆转阿片类药物的抑制肠蠕动作用。它不会穿过血脑屏障；因此，它不会引起阿片类药物相关的戒断症状，从而可以治疗OIC，而不会干扰镇痛效果。\n\n（选项A和B）地芬诺酯和洛哌丁胺都是基于阿片类药物的药物，旨在抑制胃肠道蠕动。这些药物用于治疗腹泻，会加重该患者的便秘。\n\n（选项C）利那洛肽是一种氯离子通道激动剂，可增加肠道分泌。虽然它不是μ-阿片受体拮抗剂，但可用于治疗OIC，并且不会使患者面临阿片类药物相关戒断的风险。\n\n（选项E）纳洛酮也是一种阿片受体拮抗剂；然而，与甲基纳曲酮不同，纳洛酮会穿过血脑屏障。它会引起戒断症状并逆转镇痛作用，用于治疗急性阿片类药物毒性（例如，呼吸抑制、嗜睡）。\n\n教学目标：\n便秘是阿片类药物治疗最常见的副作用，是由于胃肠道中μ-阿片受体的结合引起的，从而减少肠道蠕动并抑制离子和液体分泌。甲基纳曲酮是一种外周作用的μ-阿片受体拮抗剂，不会穿过血脑屏障，可以缓解阿片类药物引起的便秘，而不会引起阿片类药物相关的戒断症状。"
