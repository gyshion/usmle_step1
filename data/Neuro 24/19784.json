    "en": "A 56-year-old man comes to the office for evaluation of right leg pain and numbness. The pain started 2 days ago during an 8-hour car ride during which the patient was a backseat passenger in a small car. Midway through the car ride, he began to have numbness and burning pain over the lateral aspect of the right thigh. {{exhibit_1}} The patient has tried stretching to relieve the pain, but it has only worsened and he is now unable to wear a belt due to the discomfort. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and has gained 11.3 kg (25 lb) over the past year. BMI is 42 kg/m². On examination, lower extremity strength is 5/5 bilaterally. The right leg has a large area of numbness over the upper lateral thigh. Straight leg raise is negative. Reflexes are symmetrical and intact. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} Compression of which of the following nerves is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient presents with pain and decreased sensation in the distribution of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN), consistent with meralgia paresthetica (MP). The LFCN is a branch of the lumbar plexus, originating from L2-L3. It runs lateral to the psoas muscle and exits the abdomen beneath the inguinal ligament. MP is a compression mononeuropathy of the LFCN at the inguinal ligament, typically caused by tight clothing (eg, belts) or by injury during surgery (eg, hip arthroplasty). Those with obesity, increased lumbar lordosis (eg, pregnancy), or diabetes mellitus are at increased risk. MP presents with pain, paresthesia, and numbness in the lateral thigh above the knee. However, strength is normal because the LFCN does not contain motor fibers. The diagnosis is usually based on clinical findings. Most patients are managed with weight loss and avoidance of tight clothing. (Choice A) The ilioinguinal nerve primarily provides sensory innervation to the upper medial thigh and genital region. It accompanies the spermatic cord through the superficial inguinal ring; injury during pelvic or hernia surgery can lead to chronic suprapubic or groin pain. (Choice C) The obturator nerve is typically injured in anterior hip dislocation or pelvic surgery. Sensory symptoms occur in the medial thigh and are often associated with weakness in the adductor muscles. (Choice D) The pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2-S4) provide parasympathetic innervation to the hindgut, bladder, and urinary sphincters and regulate peristalsis, bladder emptying, and defecation. They are commonly involved in cauda equina syndrome (eg, lumbar epidural metastasis) but are not vulnerable to external compression and would not cause lateral thigh symptoms. (Choice E) The sciatic nerve arises from the L4-S3 nerve roots. Compression of the nerve (or contributing nerve roots) can occur at the spine (eg, herniated disc), piriformis muscle, greater sciatic foramen, or posterior thigh. Sciatica is a classic (though nonspecific) syndrome characterized by back and buttock pain that radiates down the posterior thigh to the foot; associated features include lower extremity weakness and a positive straight leg raise test.",
    "zh": "该患者表现为股外侧皮神经 (LFCN) 分布区域的疼痛和感觉减退，与股外侧皮神经痛 (MP) 一致。LFCN 是腰丛的一个分支，起源于 L2-L3。它位于腰大肌的外侧，从腹股沟韧带下方离开腹部。MP 是 LFCN 在腹股沟韧带处的压迫性单神经病变，通常由紧身衣物（如腰带）或手术（如髋关节置换术）引起的损伤所致。肥胖、腰椎前凸增加（如妊娠）或糖尿病患者的风险增加。MP 表现为膝盖上方大腿外侧疼痛、感觉异常和麻木。然而，肌力是正常的，因为 LFCN 不包含运动纤维。诊断通常基于临床发现。大多数患者通过减轻体重和避免穿紧身衣物来治疗。（选项A）髂腹股沟神经主要为大腿内上方和生殖器区域提供感觉神经支配。它与精索一起穿过腹股沟浅环；在盆腔或疝气手术中的损伤可导致慢性耻骨上或腹股沟疼痛。（选项C）闭孔神经通常在髋关节前脱位或盆腔手术中受伤。感觉症状发生在大腿内侧，通常与内收肌无力相关。（选项D）盆腔内脏神经 (S2-S4) 为后肠、膀胱和尿道括约肌提供副交感神经支配，并调节肠蠕动、膀胱排空和排便。它们通常参与马尾综合征（例如，腰椎硬膜外转移瘤），但对外部压迫不敏感，不会引起大腿外侧症状。（选项E）坐骨神经源自 L4-S3 神经根。神经（或相关的神经根）的压迫可发生在脊柱（例如，椎间盘突出）、梨状肌、坐骨大孔或大腿后部。坐骨神经痛是一种经典的（尽管非特异性的）综合征，其特征是背部和臀部疼痛放射到大腿后部到足部；相关特征包括下肢无力和直腿抬高试验阳性。"
