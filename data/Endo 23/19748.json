    "en": "A 2-hour-old newborn has a blood glucose concentration of 30 mg/dL. The patient was delivered via caesarean to a 32-year-old woman at 38 weeks gestation. Birth weight is 4.5 kg (9 lb 14 oz). The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes treated with insulin. However, glycemic control remained suboptimal due to maternal noncompliance with insulin treatment and poor adherence to dietary recommendations. Examination of the neonate is unremarkable.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Glucose levels fall in all newborns after birth, but usually remain ≥40 mg/dL due to mobilization of hepatic glycogen stores and initiation of feeding; glucose <40 mg/dL is indicative of neonatal hypoglycemia, a common metabolic derangement seen in infants of diabetic mothers {{exhibit_1}}.\n\nDuring gestation, glucose is transferred continuously from mother to fetus via the placenta. Mothers with diabetes, particularly those with poor glycemic control, often have hyperglycemia, causing fetal hyperglycemia. In utero, this results in compensatory hyperfunctioning of pancreatic beta cells, which then produce increased amounts of insulin to handle the excessive glucose load. Once the maternal glucose supply is interrupted at delivery, persistent hyperinsulinemia causes increased glucose consumption and transient neonatal hypoglycemia.\n\nMost neonates with hypoglycemia are asymptomatic but may develop autonomic symptoms (eg, jitteriness, irritability) and, if severe, hypotonia and seizures. Macrosomia (>4 kg [8 lb 14 oz] birth weight) is also common in infants of diabetic mothers due to increased exposure to growth factors (eg, insulin, insulin-like growth factors, growth hormone) that stimulate fetal growth and increased deposition of glycogen and fat in developing tissues (Choice A).\n\n(Choice C) Hypoglycemia due to impaired hepatic glycogenolysis is characteristic of certain glycogen storage diseases (eg, von Gierke disease, Cori disease), which typically present within the first several months of life with failure to thrive, ketotic hypoglycemia, and hepatomegaly (ie, protruding abdomen) due to increased hepatic glycogen content.\n\n(Choices D and E) Critically ill infants may produce increased cortisol due to stress (eg, sepsis, mechanical ventilation) with resultant hyperglycemia. Insulin resistance, which is not typically seen in infants but is related to obesity in children and adults, also causes hyperglycemia. However, this neonate is hypoglycemic.\n\nEducational objective:\nNeonatal hypoglycemia is common in infants of diabetic mothers. The pathophysiology involves maternal hyperglycemia, which in turn causes fetal hyperglycemia and compensatory hyperfunctioning of the pancreas (ie, hyperinsulinemia). After birth, persistently elevated insulin levels lead to transient hypoglycemia.",
    "zh": "新生儿出生后血糖水平都会下降，但通常保持在≥40 mg/dL，这归因于肝糖原储存的动员和开始喂养；血糖<40 mg/dL提示新生儿低血糖，这是糖尿病母亲所生婴儿中常见的代谢紊乱{{exhibit_1}}。\n\n在妊娠期间，葡萄糖通过胎盘持续地从母亲转移到胎儿。患有糖尿病的母亲，特别是那些血糖控制不佳的母亲，通常会出现高血糖，导致胎儿高血糖。在子宫内，这导致胰腺β细胞的代偿性功能亢进，从而产生更多的胰岛素来处理过量的葡萄糖负荷。一旦在分娩时中断了母亲的葡萄糖供应，持续的高胰岛素血症会导致葡萄糖消耗增加和短暂的新生儿低血糖。\n\n大多数患有低血糖的新生儿没有症状，但可能会出现自主神经症状（例如，烦躁、易怒），如果严重，还会出现肌张力减退和癫痫发作。糖尿病母亲所生婴儿也常见巨大儿（>4 kg [8磅14盎司]出生体重），这归因于增加了对生长因子（例如，胰岛素、胰岛素样生长因子、生长激素）的暴露，这些生长因子刺激胎儿生长，并在发育中的组织中增加糖原和脂肪的沉积（选项A）。\n\n（选项C）由于肝糖原分解受损引起的低血糖是某些糖原贮积病（例如，von Gierke病、Cori病）的特征，这些病通常在出生后头几个月出现生长迟缓、酮症性低血糖和肝肿大（即，腹部突出），这归因于肝糖原含量增加。\n\n（选项D和E）重症婴儿可能由于应激（例如，脓毒症、机械通气）产生皮质醇增加，导致高血糖。胰岛素抵抗，通常在婴儿中不常见，但与儿童和成人的肥胖有关，也会导致高血糖。然而，该新生儿处于低血糖状态。\n\n教育目标：\n糖尿病母亲所生的婴儿中，新生儿低血糖很常见。其病理生理学涉及母亲高血糖，进而导致胎儿高血糖和代偿性胰腺功能亢进（即，高胰岛素血症）。出生后，持续升高的胰岛素水平导致短暂的低血糖。"
