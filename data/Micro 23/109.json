    "en": "A 48-year-old previously healthy man is evaluated for progressive fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and excessive bruising. Physical examination reveals mucosal pallor and scattered ecchymoses. Blood cell count shows anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis with numerous circulating myeloblasts. Bone marrow biopsy confirms acute myeloid leukemia. The patient receives induction chemotherapy. Four days after completion of chemotherapy, the patient develops fever and malaise. New clusters of macular skin lesions are noted. Complete blood count shows severe neutropenia. Blood cultures grow smooth, creamy white, glistening colonies of small yeast forms. Incubating the pathogen in human serum at 37 C for 2-3 hours leads to formation of small projections from the cell surface with no constriction, as shown in the exhibit. Which of the following is the most likely organism responsible for this patient's condition?",

    "en": "This patient with acute myeloid leukemia underwent induction chemotherapy prior to hematologic stem cell transplantation. Because induction chemotherapy ablates bone marrow cells, patients typically develop profound pancytopenia within a few days. Although anemia can cause dyspnea and fatigue, and thrombocytopenia can cause bruising and bleeding, the most life-threatening issue following induction chemotherapy is severe neutropenia, which dramatically increases risk of infection with virulent (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, gram-negative rods) and less virulent (eg, Candida albicans) organisms.\n\nIn this case, the patient has a bloodstream infection with C albicans, a normal commensal of the mouth, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Although mucocutaneous Candida infections are common in otherwise healthy individuals, invasive infection typically occurs only in those with indwelling central catheters or significant neutropenia. Manifestations can include organ abscesses (eg, kidney, heart, brain, eye, liver) and clusters of macular skin lesions.\n\nBlood cultures will reveal smooth, creamy white, glistening colonies. Microscopic evaluation will show small, ovoid budding yeasts. Pseudohyphae, an important diagnostic clue, form when yeasts do not separate after budding, creating a sausage-like chain of elongated yeasts joined together end-to-end with constrictions. Incubating the sample in human serum at 37 C for 2-3 hours (ie, germ tube test) leads to the formation of true hyphae, projections from the yeast with no constrictions. A positive germ tube test is diagnostic of C albicans and distinguishes it from other Candida species (eg, C tropicalis, C glabrata).\n\n(Choice A) Aspergillus fumigatus is a mold that forms powdery colonies. Microscopy reveals septate hyphae: yeasts are not seen.\n\n(Choice C) Coccidioides immitis is a dimorphic fungus that grows in mold form when cultured at 25 C (77 F). It appears as yeast (spherules containing endospores) at body temperature. Coccidioides does not form germ tubes.\n\n(Choice D) Cryptococcus neoformans, which grows as white mucoid colonies, also shows budding yeast on microscopy. However, it does not form germ tubes or pseudohyphae. In addition, special stains (eg, India ink) reveal a thick capsule.\n\n(Choice E) Histoplasma capsulatum is a slow-growing, dimorphic fungus that grows in mold form when cultured at 25 C. It appears as oval-shaped, budding yeasts at body temperature. Histoplasma does not form germ tubes.\n\n(Choice F) Rhizopus is a mold that grows as white, cotton-like colonies that turn gray-brown over time. Microscopy reveals broad, nonseptate hyphae: yeasts are not seen.\n\nEducational objective:\nMicroscopic examination of Candida albicans, a common invasive infection in patients with neutropenia, reveals budding yeasts and pseudohyphae. It can be differentiated from other Candida species by a positive germ tube test.",
    "zh": "这位患有急性髓系白血病的患者在进行血液干细胞移植前接受了诱导化疗。由于诱导化疗会消融骨髓细胞，患者通常在几天内出现严重的血细胞减少。虽然贫血可引起呼吸困难和疲劳，血小板减少可引起瘀伤和出血，但诱导化疗后最具生命威胁的问题是严重的中性粒细胞减少，这会大大增加对毒力强的（例如，肺炎链球菌、革兰氏阴性杆菌）和毒力较低（例如，白色念珠菌）的生物体感染的风险。\n\n在这种情况下，患者患有白色念珠菌的血流感染，白色念珠菌是口腔、皮肤和胃肠道的正常共生菌。虽然黏膜皮肤念珠菌感染在其他方面健康的个体中很常见，但侵袭性感染通常仅发生在那些有留置中心静脉导管或严重中性粒细胞减少的患者中。表现可包括器官脓肿（例如，肾脏、心脏、大脑、眼睛、肝脏）和斑丘疹。\n\n血培养将显示光滑、乳白色、有光泽的菌落。显微镜评估将显示小的、卵圆形的出芽酵母。假菌丝，一个重要的诊断线索，当酵母在出芽后没有分离时形成，产生一个香肠状的细长酵母链，端对端连接，有收缩。在37°C下将样本在人血清中孵育2-3小时（即，芽管试验）会导致真菌菌丝的形成，即酵母的突起，没有收缩。阳性芽管试验可诊断白色念珠菌，并将其与其他念珠菌属区分开来（例如，热带念珠菌、光滑念珠菌）。\n\n（选项A）烟曲霉是一种形成粉末状菌落的霉菌。显微镜显示有分隔的菌丝：未见酵母。\n\n（选项C）粗球孢子菌是一种二态性真菌，在25°C（77°F）培养时以霉菌形式生长。它在体温下显示为酵母（含有内生孢子的球体）。粗球孢子菌不形成芽管。\n\n（选项D）新型隐球菌生长为白色黏液样菌落，在显微镜下也显示出芽酵母。但是，它不形成芽管或假菌丝。此外，特殊染色（例如，墨汁）显示厚厚的荚膜。\n\n（选项E）荚膜组织胞浆菌是一种生长缓慢的二态性真菌，在25°C培养时以霉菌形式生长。它在体温下显示为卵圆形的出芽酵母。组织胞浆菌不形成芽管。\n\n（选项F）根霉是一种霉菌，生长为白色、棉絮状菌落，随着时间的推移变成灰棕色。显微镜显示宽阔、无分隔的菌丝：未见酵母。\n\n教育目标：\n对白色念珠菌的显微镜检查，这是一种在中性粒细胞减少患者中常见的侵袭性感染，显示出芽酵母和假菌丝。它可以通过阳性芽管试验与其他念珠菌属区分开来。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of opportunistic fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, specifically Candida albicans. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of disseminated candidiasis in a neutropenic patient and identifying the characteristic features of Candida albicans on blood culture and germ tube testing.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to recognize the patient's immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and to associate the clinical findings (fever, malaise, macular skin lesions, creamy white colonies on blood culture) with Candida albicans. The germ tube test result further confirms the diagnosis.",
