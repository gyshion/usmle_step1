    "en": "A 20-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to intractable vomiting and abdominal pain. She has a several-week history of anorexia and weight loss. The patient has well-controlled primary hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine but has not taken her medication for 2 days because of vomiting. Temperature is 37.6 C (99.7 F), blood pressure is 80/40 mm Hg, pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical examination, she is mildly lethargic but oriented. Generalized hyperpigmentation is present and is most conspicuous over the face, neck, and dorsal surface of the hands. Urinalysis and chest x-ray are within normal limits. Finger-stick blood glucose is 60 mg/dL. A 1-L bolus of normal saline is rapidly infused, and high-flow intravenous fluids are continued. This patient also requires immediate treatment with which of the following medications?",

    "en": "This patient most likely has acute adrenal crisis. Her history of hypothyroidism puts her at increased risk for other autoimmune endocrinopathies (eg, autoimmune adrenalitis), and her weight loss and hyperpigmentation are suggestive of chronic primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease). In normal individuals, the adrenal glands respond to acute stress (eg, illness, surgery) with a compensatory increase in glucocorticoid production, but patients with adrenal insufficiency cannot mount such a response.\n\nAdrenal crisis is characterized by severe hypotension and refractory shock. Associated symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, weakness, and fever. In addition to aggressive fluid resuscitation, treatment of adrenal crisis requires immediate glucocorticoid supplementation with hydrocortisone or dexamethasone. Treatment should begin immediately without waiting for results of diagnostic studies, and the response is usually rapid.\n\n(Choice A) Antibiotics may be necessary if evidence of infection is found. However, treatment with glucocorticoids is warranted immediately, whereas the decision to start an antibiotic may be made when the presence of infection is more clearly established.\n\n(Choices C and D) Dopamine is used in the treatment of shock and refractory cardiac failure. Epinephrine is used in the treatment of anaphylaxis, severe asthma, and cardiac arrest. However, hypotension in adrenal crisis is often refractory to vasopressors because glucocorticoids have a permissive effect on vasoconstriction.\n\n(Choice E) Clinical features of hypothyroid crisis may include hypoglycemia and hypotension, as seen in this patient, but would usually also include altered sensorium, hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypoventilation. In addition, due to the long plasma half life of levothyroxine, missing 2 days of therapy would be unlikely to cause a symptomatic drop in thyroid hormone levels.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients with adrenal insufficiency are not able to increase glucocorticoid production in response to acute stress (eg, illness, surgery). Adrenal crisis is characterized by severe hypotension, abdominal pain, vomiting, weakness, and fever. In addition to aggressive fluid resuscitation, treatment requires immediate glucocorticoid supplementation.",
    "zh": "该患者很可能患有急性肾上腺危象。她的甲状腺功能减退症病史使她面临其他自身免疫性内分泌疾病（如自身免疫性肾上腺炎）的风险增加，并且她的体重减轻和色素沉着过度提示慢性原发性肾上腺皮质功能不全（艾迪生病）。在正常个体中，肾上腺对急性应激（如疾病、手术）的反应是代偿性地增加糖皮质激素的产生，但肾上腺功能不全的患者无法产生这种反应。\n\n肾上腺危象的特征是严重低血压和难治性休克。相关症状包括腹痛、呕吐、乏力和发热。除了积极的液体复苏外，肾上腺危象的治疗还需要立即补充糖皮质激素，如氢化可的松或地塞米松。治疗应立即开始，无需等待诊断研究的结果，并且反应通常迅速。\n\n（选项A）如果发现感染证据，可能需要使用抗生素。然而，立即使用糖皮质激素是必要的，而开始使用抗生素的决定可以在更清楚地确定感染存在时做出。\n\n（选项C和D）多巴胺用于治疗休克和难治性心力衰竭。肾上腺素用于治疗过敏性休克、严重哮喘和心脏骤停。然而，肾上腺危象中的低血压通常对血管加压药无效，因为糖皮质激素对血管收缩有允许作用。\n\n（选项E）甲状腺功能减退危象的临床特征可能包括低血糖和低血压，如该患者所示，但通常还包括意识改变、体温过低、心动过缓和通气不足。此外，由于左甲状腺素的血浆半衰期较长，漏服2天的治疗不太可能导致甲状腺激素水平的症状性下降。\n\n教育目标：\n肾上腺功能不全的患者无法在急性应激（如疾病、手术）的情况下增加糖皮质激素的产生。肾上腺危象的特征是严重低血压、腹痛、呕吐、乏力和发热。除了积极的液体复苏外，治疗还需要立即补充糖皮质激素。"

Key findings include hypotension, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypoglycemia, hyperpigmentation, and a history of autoimmune disease (hypothyroidism). \n\nThe best approach is to recognize the signs and symptoms of adrenal crisis, understand the underlying pathophysiology of glucocorticoid deficiency, and select the appropriate treatment, which is immediate glucocorticoid supplementation with hydrocortisone or dexamethasone.",
