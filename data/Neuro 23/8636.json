  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is D. The patient presents with right nasal hemianopia, which is a loss of vision in the nasal half of the right visual field. This corresponds to a loss of vision in the temporal half of the right retina. The MRI and MR angiography revealed a right internal carotid artery aneurysm. An aneurysm of the internal carotid artery can impinge on the optic chiasm, specifically affecting the uncrossed fibers from the temporal retina. These fibers travel in the lateral aspect of the optic chiasm and, when damaged, lead to ipsilateral nasal hemianopia. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choices A and B) A partial lesion involving the retina is more likely to produce focal monocular scotoma than nasal hemianopia because a lesion with the latter would need to involve the entire temporal retina, which does not follow the arterial patterns of blood supply to the retina. Likewise, a lesion of the optic nerve classically causes monocular total vision loss; nasal hemianopia would be unusual.\n\n(Choice C) Fibers from the nasal retina carry information from the temporal visual fields and cross at the optic chiasm, so a lesion in this area (eg, pituitary adenoma) classically causes bitemporal hemianopia.\n\n(Choice E) The optic tract carries information from the contralateral hemivisual field. Lesions in this area would lead to homonymous hemianopia.\n\n(Choice F) The inferior optic radiations (which carry information from the inferior retina/superior visual field) travel through the temporal lobe (Meyer loop). Lesions in this area lead to superior quadrant visual field defects (ie, contralateral homonymous superior quadrantanopia).\n\n(Choice G) The superior optic radiations, which carry information from the superior retina/inferior visual field, travel through the parietal lobe. Lesions localized to this area can lead to contralateral lower quadrantanopia.\n\n(Choice H) Lesions to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe also lead to a contralateral homonymous hemianopia. If this occurs due to occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery, the macula is typically spared due to collateral circulation from the middle cerebral artery to the occipital pole.\n\nEducational objective:\nAn aneurysm of the internal carotid artery can laterally impinge on the optic chiasm. This can cause ipsilateral nasal hemianopia by damaging uncrossed optic nerve fibers from the temporal portion of the retina.",
    "zh": "正确答案是D。患者表现为右鼻侧偏盲，即右视野鼻侧一半的视力丧失。这对应于右视网膜颞侧一半的视力丧失。MRI和磁共振血管造影显示右侧颈内动脉瘤。颈内动脉瘤可压迫视交叉，特别是影响来自颞侧视网膜的未交叉纤维。这些纤维在视交叉的侧面走行，当受损时，会导致同侧鼻侧偏盲。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n（选项A和B）涉及视网膜的部分病变更有可能产生局灶性单眼暗点而不是鼻侧偏盲，因为后者的病变需要涉及整个颞侧视网膜，这不遵循视网膜的血液供应动脉模式。同样，视神经病变通常会导致单眼完全性视力丧失；鼻侧偏盲是不寻常的。\n\n（选项C）来自鼻侧视网膜的纤维携带来自颞侧视野的信息，并在视交叉处交叉，因此该区域的病变（例如，垂体腺瘤）通常会导致双颞侧偏盲。\n\n（选项E）视束携带来自对侧半视野的信息。该区域的病变将导致同侧偏盲。\n\n（选项F）下视放射（携带来自下视网膜/上视野的信息）穿过颞叶（Meyer环）。该区域的病变导致上象限视野缺损（即，对侧同侧上象限偏盲）。\n\n（选项G）上视放射，携带来自上视网膜/下视野的信息，穿过顶叶。局部于该区域的病变可导致对侧下象限偏盲。\n\n（选项H）枕叶的主要视觉皮层病变也会导致对侧同侧偏盲。如果这发生于大脑后动脉闭塞，由于来自大脑中动脉到枕极的侧支循环，黄斑通常会得以保留。\n\n教育目标：\n颈内动脉瘤可在侧向压迫视交叉。这可以通过损伤来自视网膜颞侧部分的未交叉视神经纤维引起同侧鼻侧偏盲。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of visual pathway anatomy and the correlation between specific lesions and resulting visual field defects, particularly in the context of an internal carotid artery aneurysm impinging on the optic chiasm.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the type of visual field defect (right nasal hemianopia) and then relate it to the anatomical location of the lesion within the visual pathway. Knowledge of which fibers carry information from which part of the visual field and where they are located in the optic chiasm is crucial.",
