    "en": "A 72-year-old man is brought to the hospital due to a 1-week history of progressive confusion and lethargy. He has also had a persistent cough for the past several weeks with 2 episodes of blood in the sputum. The patient has hyperlipidemia, well-controlled hypertension, and a 48-pack-year smoking history. On examination, mucous membranes are moist. Lung auscultation reveals wheezing in the left lung. Serum sodium is 123 mEq/dL. Chest x-ray reveals a mass in the upper lobe of the left lung. A bronchoscopic biopsy of the mass is performed, and light microscopy of the tissue confirms an aggressive lung cancer.",

    "en": "This patient with an aggressive lung cancer has symptomatic hyponatremia (eg, confusion, lethargy) despite appearing euvolemic (moist mucous membranes). This presentation suggests small cell carcinoma of the lung complicated by paraneoplastic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).\n\nSmall cell carcinoma, the most aggressive type of lung cancer, typically occurs in patients with a history of heavy smoking. It is characterized by a rapid doubling time and early distant spread; most patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Although small cell carcinoma is sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation, most patients relapse within months, and the 5-year survival rate is very low. This malignancy frequently synthesizes hormones or hormone-like substances, resulting in paraneoplastic syndromes (eg, vasopressin resulting in SIADH, adrenocorticotropic hormone resulting in Cushing syndrome).\n\nSmall cell carcinomas show evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation. These tumors stain for neuroendocrine markers, such as neural cell adhesion molecule (CD56), neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin, and synaptophysin. Neurosecretory granules can be identified in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells on electron microscopy.\n\n(Choice A) Epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations are present in some non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), most commonly in adenocarcinoma in nonsmokers. This mutation can predict responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs (eg, erlotinib, afatinib). It is not present in small cell lung cancer.\n\n(Choice B) Glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive fibrils are seen with some astrocytomas.\n\n(Choice C) KRAS is an activating mutation that is present in up to 25% of lung adenocarcinomas and is associated with smoking. It is also frequently seen in colorectal and pancreatic cancer.\n\n(Choice D) Mucin is a glycoprotein that frequently provides a protective barrier to epithelial cells. However, the MUC gene is overexpressed in a variety of malignancies (eg, breast, NSCLC, pancreatic) and is a marker for poor prognosis.\n\n(Choice F) Vimentin is an intermediate filament found within cells of mesenchymal origin and is used in diagnosing sarcomas.\n\nEducational objective:\nSmall cell carcinoma of the lung is the most aggressive type of lung cancer and is commonly associated with paraneoplastic syndromes (eg, SIADH, Cushing syndrome). It is thought to have a neuroendocrine origin; tumor cells express neuroendocrine markers (eg, neural cell adhesion molecule, chromogranin, synaptophysin) and contain neurosecretory granules in the cytoplasm.",
    "zh": "这位患有侵袭性肺癌的患者出现症状性低钠血症（如意识模糊、嗜睡），尽管其表现为血容量正常（粘膜湿润）。这种表现提示小细胞肺癌，并伴有不适当抗利尿激素分泌综合征（SIADH）的副肿瘤综合征。\n\n小细胞癌是最具侵袭性的肺癌，通常发生在有大量吸烟史的患者中。其特征是倍增时间快，早期远处转移；大多数患者在诊断时已有转移性疾病。虽然小细胞癌对化疗和放疗敏感，但大多数患者在几个月内复发，5年生存率非常低。这种恶性肿瘤经常合成激素或类似激素的物质，导致副肿瘤综合征（如血管加压素导致SIADH，促肾上腺皮质激素导致库欣综合征）。\n\n小细胞癌显示神经内分泌分化的证据。这些肿瘤可被神经内分泌标志物染色，如神经细胞粘附分子（CD56）、神经元特异性烯醇化酶、嗜铬颗粒蛋白和突触结合蛋白。在肿瘤细胞的细胞质中，可以通过电子显微镜识别出神经分泌颗粒。\n\n（选项 A）表皮生长因子受体基因突变存在于一些非小细胞肺癌 (NSCLC) 中，最常见于非吸烟者的腺癌中。这种突变可以预测对酪氨酸激酶抑制剂药物（如厄洛替尼、阿法替尼）的反应。它不存在于小细胞肺癌中。\n\n（选项 B）在一些星形细胞瘤中可见胶质纤维酸性蛋白阳性原纤维。\n\n（选项 C）KRAS是一种激活突变，存在于高达25%的肺腺癌中，并与吸烟有关。它也经常出现在结直肠癌和胰腺癌中。\n\n（选项 D）黏蛋白是一种糖蛋白，经常为上皮细胞提供保护性屏障。然而，MUC基因在多种恶性肿瘤（如乳腺癌、NSCLC、胰腺癌）中过度表达，是预后不良的标志。\n\n（选项 F）波形蛋白是一种存在于间质起源细胞内的中间丝，用于诊断肉瘤。\n\n教学目标：\n小细胞肺癌是最具侵袭性的肺癌，通常与副肿瘤综合征（如SIADH、库欣综合征）相关。它被认为具有神经内分泌起源；肿瘤细胞表达神经内分泌标志物（如神经细胞粘附分子、嗜铬颗粒蛋白、突触结合蛋白）并在细胞质中含有神经分泌颗粒。"
