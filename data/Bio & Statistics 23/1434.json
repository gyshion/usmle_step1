  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "DNA polymerases are the primary enzymes responsible for DNA synthesis, which occurs in the 5' to 3' direction. Prokaryotes such as *Escherichia coli* have 3 major DNA polymerases: I, II, and III. DNA replication requires a high degree of fidelity to preserve the genetic code in daughter cells and prevent potentially lethal mutations. The first line of defense against DNA replication errors is accomplished by the 3' to 5' proofreading exonuclease activity of all 3 DNA polymerases; upon detecting a replication error, they can reverse direction by one base pair and excise the mismatched base before continuing with DNA polymerization.\n\nDNA polymerase I is unique as it is the only prokaryotic polymerase that also has 5' to 3' exonuclease activity. This activity functions to remove the RNA primer created by primase and repair damaged DNA sequences.\n\n(Choice B) DNA polymerase III has 3' to 5' exonuclease activity; however, it does not possess 5' to 3' exonuclease activity.\n\n(Choice C) The enzyme topoisomerase II, also known as DNA gyrase in prokaryotes, relieves tension created during DNA strand unwinding by introducing negative supercoils into the circular DNA. Fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin) are a class of antibiotics that work by inhibiting DNA gyrase.\n\n(Choice D) Before DNA replication begins, helicase unwinds the DNA double helix, facilitating separation of the 2 DNA strands which are then stabilized by single-stranded DNA-binding proteins.\n\n(Choice E) Okazaki fragments of the lagging strand are bound together by the enzyme ligase.\n\n(Choice F) DNA polymerases cannot begin synthesizing complementary DNA on a single-stranded template without an RNA primer. Primase is an RNA polymerase that synthesizes this primer, which is made up of short stretches of RNA base paired to the DNA template.\n\nEducational objective:\nIn prokaryotes, only DNA polymerase I has both 5' to 3' and 3' to 5' exonuclease activities. The 3' to 5' exonuclease activity allows for a proofreading function during DNA replication, while the 5' to 3' exonuclease activity is involved in removal of RNA primers and repair of damaged DNA sequences.",
    "zh": "DNA聚合酶是负责DNA合成的主要酶，其合成方向为5'到3'。原核生物，如*大肠杆菌*，有3种主要的DNA聚合酶：I、II和III。DNA复制需要高度保真度以保持子细胞中的遗传密码，并防止潜在的致命突变。抵抗DNA复制错误的**第一道防线**由所有3种DNA聚合酶的3'到5'校对外切酶活性完成；一旦检测到复制错误，它们就可以反向移动一个碱基对，并在继续DNA聚合之前切除错配的碱基。\n\nDNA聚合酶I是独特的，因为它是唯一一种也具有5'到3'外切酶活性的原核聚合酶。这种活性用于去除引物酶产生的RNA引物，并修复受损的DNA序列。\n\n(选项 B) DNA聚合酶III具有3'到5'外切酶活性；但是，它没有5'到3'外切酶活性。\n\n(选项 C) 酶拓扑异构酶II，也称为原核生物中的DNA促旋酶，通过将负超螺旋引入环状DNA中来缓解DNA链解旋过程中产生的张力。氟喹诺酮类药物（如环丙沙星）是一类通过抑制DNA促旋酶起作用的抗生素。\n\n(选项 D) 在DNA复制开始之前，解旋酶解开DNA双螺旋，促进2条DNA链的分离，然后由单链DNA结合蛋白稳定。\n\n(选项 E) 滞后链的冈崎片段由连接酶结合在一起。\n\n(选项 F) 在没有RNA引物的情况下，DNA聚合酶不能在单链模板上开始合成互补DNA。引物酶是一种RNA聚合酶，它合成这种引物，引物由与DNA模板配对的短链RNA组成。\n\n教学目标：\n在原核生物中，只有DNA聚合酶I同时具有5'到3'和3'到5'外切酶活性。3'到5'外切酶活性允许在DNA复制过程中进行校对功能，而5'到3'外切酶活性涉及去除RNA引物和修复受损的DNA序列。"
