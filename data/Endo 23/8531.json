    "en": "A 43-year-old woman comes to the office due to episodic confusion, blurred vision, tremors, and sweating. The episodes have increased in intensity in the past few months and seem to occur any time during the day. Her symptoms are relieved by drinking orange juice. During a recent episode, the patient's blood glucose level was 32 mg/dL as measured by her husband's home glucose meter. Medical history includes major depression and irritable bowel syndrome. Laboratory studies performed during the next episode of symptoms show the following results:\n\nGlucose 35 mg/dL\nInsulin 18 μU/mL (normal: <3 μU/mL)\nC-peptide 4.01 ng/mL (normal: <0.6ng/mL)",

    "en": "Evaluation of hypoglycemia {{exhibit_1}}\n\nThis patient has symptomatic HYPOGLYCEMIA, confirmed by the Whipple triad:\n\nSymptoms consistent with hypoglycemia (eg, tremor, diaphoresis, confusion)\nLow blood glucose level\nRelief of hypoglycemic symptoms when the blood glucose level is corrected\nInsulin is initially synthesized as preproinsulin, after which the signal peptide is removed, yielding proinsulin. In the secretory granules, proinsulin is cleaved into insulin and C-peptide, which are then released together in equimolar amounts. Normally, as blood glucose falls, endogenous insulin secretion is suppressed, and serum levels of both insulin and C-peptide drop.\n\nHypoglycemia due to excessive endogenous insulin production is associated with elevated levels of C-peptide. This can occur due to autonomous insulin-producing tumors (insulinomas) or intake of insulin secretagogues (eg, sulfonylureas). Self-induced hypoglycemia via oral hypoglycemics is often a manifestation of a factitious disorder and is typically seen in health care workers and family members of patients with diabetes using these medications (which is likely in this patient whose husband has home glucose-testing supplies).\n\nSulfonylurea abuse can be confirmed by testing the urine or blood for specific hypoglycemic agents.\n\n(Choice A) Glucagonoma is a rare tumor of pancreatic alpha cells that secretes excessive amounts of glucagon. This results in hyperglycemia, weight loss, anemia, and necrolytic migratory erythema (a raised, erythematous rash affecting the face, groin, and extremities).\n\n(Choice B) Hypoglycemia due to exogenous insulin injection, which does not contain C-peptide, is associated with an elevated serum insulin level but an undetectable C-peptide level.\n\n(Choice C) Somatostatinoma is a rare tumor of pancreatic delta cells that is associated with hyperglycemia, weight loss, abdominal pain, steatorrhea, cholelithiasis, and hypochlorhydria. These manifestations are due to somatostatin-induced inhibition of insulin, gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin secretion, as well as decreased gastrointestinal motility.\n\n(Choice E) VIPomas are non-beta cell pancreatic islet cell tumors that hypersecrete vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Features include watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and impaired gastric acid secretion.\n\nEducational objective:\nHypoglycemia is characterized by tremor, diaphoresis, and confusion in association with a low blood glucose level and resolution of symptoms when the blood glucose level is corrected. Hypoglycemia with elevated insulin and low C-peptide levels suggests exogenous insulin injection, whereas elevated C-peptide suggests an insulin secretagogue or insulin-secreting tumor.",
    "zh": "低血糖症的评估 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n该患者有症状性低血糖症，由Whipple三联征证实：\n\n与低血糖症相符的症状（例如，震颤、出汗、意识模糊）\n低血糖水平\n纠正血糖水平后低血糖症状缓解\n胰岛素最初被合成为前胰岛素原，之后信号肽被移除，产生胰岛素原。在分泌颗粒中，胰岛素原被裂解成胰岛素和C肽，然后以等摩尔量一起释放。通常，随着血糖下降，内源性胰岛素分泌受到抑制，血清中胰岛素和C肽的水平都会下降。\n\n由于内源性胰岛素过度产生的低血糖症与C肽水平升高有关。这可能由于自主性胰岛素生成肿瘤（胰岛素瘤）或摄入胰岛素促分泌剂（例如，磺脲类药物）引起。通过口服降血糖药物引起的自发性低血糖症通常是人为疾病的表现，并且通常见于医护人员和使用这些药物的糖尿病患者的家人（对于丈夫有家用血糖测试用品的患者来说，这很可能）。\n\n磺脲类药物滥用可以通过检测尿液或血液中特定的降血糖药物来证实。\n\n（选项A）胰高血糖素瘤是一种罕见的胰腺α细胞肿瘤，分泌过量的胰高血糖素。这会导致高血糖、体重减轻、贫血和游走性坏死性红斑（一种影响面部、腹股沟和四肢的隆起性红斑皮疹）。\n\n（选项B）由于外源性胰岛素注射引起的低血糖症，不含C肽，与血清胰岛素水平升高但C肽水平无法检测到有关。\n\n（选项C）生长抑素瘤是一种罕见的胰腺δ细胞肿瘤，与高血糖、体重减轻、腹痛、脂肪泻、胆石病和胃酸缺乏症有关。这些表现是由于生长抑素诱导的胰岛素、胃泌素、促胰液素和胆囊收缩素分泌受到抑制，以及胃肠蠕动减弱。\n\n（选项E）VIPomas是非β细胞胰岛细胞肿瘤，过度分泌血管活性肠肽（VIP）。特征包括水样腹泻、低钾血症和胃酸分泌受损。\n\n教育目标：\n低血糖症的特征是震颤、出汗和意识模糊，并伴有低血糖水平，并且在纠正血糖水平后症状会缓解。低血糖伴有胰岛素升高和C肽水平低提示外源性胰岛素注射，而C肽升高提示胰岛素促分泌剂或胰岛素分泌肿瘤。"
