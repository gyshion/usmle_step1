  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's liver biopsy shows steatosis, a nonspecific condition characterized by triglyceride accumulation within the hepatocellular cytoplasm, which is likely related to his recent alcohol consumption. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nEthanol is metabolized in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes, producing NADH and an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio. Excess NADH production contributes to the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis primarily by inhibiting free fatty acid oxidation. It also enhances fatty acid formation and glycerol-3-phosphate production, thus promoting triglyceride synthesis (Choice B). Additional contributing pathogenic factors include increased peripheral fat catabolism and impaired lipoprotein assembly and secretion (Choice C).\n\nOn microscopic examination, fat accumulation appears as clear cytoplasmic vacuoles (lipids frequently dissolve during histologic processing) that often displace the hepatocyte nucleus. The lipids can also be highlighted by specialized staining with oil red O or Sudan black.\n\n(Choice D) An increased hepatic NADH/NAD+ ratio due to alcohol consumption inhibits gluconeogenesis reactions that require NAD+ (eg, conversion of malate to oxaloacetate and lactate to pyruvate).\n\n(Choice E) Increased cellular glucose uptake occurs with high circulating insulin levels; however, hyperinsulinemia does not significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis. In contrast, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia play a key role in development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\n(Choice F) Alcohol use increases peripheral fat (not phospholipid) catabolism. The resulting increase in circulating free fatty acids contributes to alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis by increasing hepatocellular triglyceride synthesis.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe pathogenesis of alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis involves excess NADH production (via ethanol metabolism), which inhibits free fatty acid oxidation and promotes lipogenesis. Steatosis is microscopically characterized by clear cytoplasmic vacuoles within hepatocytes.",
    "zh": "该患者的肝活检显示脂肪变性，这是一种非特异性疾病，其特征是在肝细胞胞质内甘油三酯的积累，这可能与他最近的饮酒有关。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n乙醇在肝脏中被醇脱氢酶和乙醛脱氢酶代谢，产生NADH和升高的NADH/NAD+比率。过量的NADH产生主要通过抑制游离脂肪酸氧化，从而促进肝脂肪变性的发病机制。它也增强脂肪酸的形成和甘油-3-磷酸的产生，从而促进甘油三酯的合成（选项B）。其他促成病理的因素包括周围脂肪分解代谢增加以及脂蛋白组装和分泌受损（选项C）。\n\n在显微镜检查中，脂肪堆积表现为清晰的胞质空泡（脂质在组织学处理过程中经常溶解），这些空泡经常取代肝细胞核。脂质也可以通过油红O或苏丹黑等特殊染色进行突出显示。\n\n（选项D）由于饮酒导致的肝脏NADH/NAD+比率升高会抑制需要NAD+的糖异生反应（例如，苹果酸转化为草酰乙酸和乳酸转化为丙酮酸）。\n\n（选项E）细胞内葡萄糖摄取增加发生在高循环胰岛素水平下；然而，高胰岛素血症对酒精引起的肝脂肪变性的发病机制没有显着影响。相反，胰岛素抵抗和高胰岛素血症在非酒精性脂肪肝疾病的发展中起着关键作用。\n\n（选项F）饮酒会增加周围脂肪（而非磷脂）分解代谢。由此产生的循环游离脂肪酸的增加通过增加肝细胞甘油三酯的合成而促成酒精引起的肝脂肪变性。\n\n教育目标：酒精引起的肝脂肪变性的发病机制涉及过量的NADH产生（通过乙醇代谢），从而抑制游离脂肪酸氧化并促进脂肪生成。脂肪变性的显微镜特征是在肝细胞内出现清晰的胞质空泡。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis, specifically the role of NADH production and its effects on fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride synthesis. It also assesses the ability to interpret liver biopsy findings consistent with steatosis.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the link between alcohol consumption, increased NADH levels, and the subsequent inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, leading to triglyceride accumulation in the liver. Understanding the metabolic consequences of alcohol metabolism is crucial.",
    "zh": "此题考察对酒精引起的肝脂肪变性的发病机制的理解，特别是NADH产生及其对脂肪酸氧化和甘油三酯合成的影响。它还评估了解读与脂肪变性一致的肝活检结果的能力。\n\n解决此题的关键是认识到饮酒、NADH水平升高以及随后抑制脂肪酸氧化之间的联系，从而导致肝脏中甘油三酯的积累。了解酒精代谢的代谢后果至关重要。"
