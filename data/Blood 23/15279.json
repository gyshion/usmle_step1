    "en": "A 48-year-old woman is evaluated for a painless left breast mass. Physical examination shows a 4-cm mass with dimpling of the overlying skin; left axillary lymphadenopathy also is noted. Breast imaging reveals a spiculated soft tissue mass with microcalcifications. Biopsy of the mass demonstrates invasive ductal carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry of the tissue sample shows the tumor cells are negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors but overexpress the *HER2* epidermal growth factor receptor. The patient is treated with systemic chemotherapy and a monoclonal antibody drug that binds the extracellular domain of the growth factor receptor. Repeat evaluation 6 weeks later shows a decrease in the size of the breast mass.",

    "en": "Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity\n\n*HER2* is an epidermal growth factor receptor overexpressed by aggressive breast cancers. Treatment with a monoclonal antibody (eg, trastuzumab) that targets the *HER2* surface receptor often results in tumor regression. Although antibody binding can trigger cancer cell death through a variety of mechanisms (eg, receptor downregulation, complement deposition), much of the response is due to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).\n\nADCC classically involves the following:\n\n1. A naturally occurring or monoclonal IgG binds to a complementary surface antigen on a host or foreign cell.\n2. A patrolling natural killer (NK) cell binds the Fc portion of the attached IgG using CD16.\n3. Binding triggers the NK cell to release its granules, which contain perforin and granzymes (proteases) that induce apoptosis/osmotic lysis of the antibody-bound cell.\n\nAlthough NK cells are derived from the same lymphocyte lineage as B- and T-cells, they are considered part of the innate immune system because they do not engage with major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) to differentiate self from nonself. Unlike cytotoxic T-cells, NK cells can often identify neoplasms that have downregulated surface expression of MHC-I molecules.\n\n(Choice A) Tumor-infiltrating B cells release inflammatory cytokines, display tumor-associated antigens, and generate tumor-specific immunoglobulin; however, neither B cells nor IgM are involved in mediating responses to exogenously administered monoclonal antibodies.\n\n(Choice B) CD8 cells release effector cytokines (eg, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor) and cytotoxic granules (eg, perforin, granzymes) that destroy tumor cells. However, they interact with the MHC class I receptors, not monoclonal immunoglobulins.\n\n(Choice D) Macrophages and neutrophils also have CD16 and engage in ADCC and CD16-mediated phagocytosis of foreign organisms. However, their role in antitumor activity is unclear. The efficacy of monoclonal antibody therapy is thought to be largely mediated by NK-cell ADCC.\n\nEducational objective:\nCancer immunotherapy often includes the administration of monoclonal antibodies against a target overexpressed on the cancer cell surface. The Fc portion of the bound antibody is identified by natural killer cells via CD16, leading to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity via the release of granzymes and perforin. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "抗体依赖性细胞介导的细胞毒性\n\n*HER2*是一种被侵袭性乳腺癌过度表达的表皮生长因子受体。用靶向*HER2*表面受体的单克隆抗体（例如，曲妥珠单抗）治疗通常会导致肿瘤消退。尽管抗体结合可以通过多种机制（例如，受体下调、补体沉积）触发癌细胞死亡，但大部分反应是由于抗体依赖性细胞介导的细胞毒性(ADCC)。\n\nADCC通常涉及以下过程：\n\n1. 天然存在或单克隆IgG与宿主或外来细胞上的互补表面抗原结合。\n2. 巡逻的自然杀伤(NK)细胞使用CD16结合已附着IgG的Fc部分。\n3. 结合触发NK细胞释放其颗粒，这些颗粒含有穿孔素和颗粒酶（蛋白酶），诱导抗体结合细胞的凋亡/渗透性溶解。\n\n虽然NK细胞源自与B细胞和T细胞相同的淋巴细胞谱系，但它们被认为是先天免疫系统的一部分，因为它们不与主要组织相容性复合物(MHC)结合以区分自身和非自身。与细胞毒性T细胞不同，NK细胞通常可以识别表面表达MHC-I分子下调的肿瘤。\n\n(选项A) 肿瘤浸润B细胞释放炎症细胞因子，显示肿瘤相关抗原，并产生肿瘤特异性免疫球蛋白；然而，B细胞和IgM均不参与介导对外源性给予的单克隆抗体的反应。\n\n(选项B) CD8细胞释放效应细胞因子（例如，干扰素γ、肿瘤坏死因子）和细胞毒性颗粒（例如，穿孔素、颗粒酶），以破坏肿瘤细胞。然而，它们与MHC I类受体相互作用，而不是单克隆免疫球蛋白。\n\n(选项D) 巨噬细胞和中性粒细胞也有CD16，并参与ADCC和CD16介导的对外来生物体的吞噬作用。然而，它们在抗肿瘤活性中的作用尚不清楚。单克隆抗体治疗的疗效被认为主要由NK细胞ADCC介导。\n\n教育目标：\n癌症免疫治疗通常包括给予针对癌细胞表面过度表达的靶标的单克隆抗体。结合的抗体的Fc部分通过CD16被自然杀伤细胞识别，导致抗体依赖性细胞介导的细胞毒性，通过释放颗粒酶和穿孔素。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}"

It assesses understanding of the mechanism by which monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, induce tumor regression through the activation of NK cells. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the monoclonal antibody binds to the HER2 receptor on the tumor cell surface.
