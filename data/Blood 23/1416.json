    "en": "A 28-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to anxiety, weakness, dyspnea, and headaches. He is a graduate student in chemistry and was accidentally exposed to nitrites in his research laboratory. Physical examination is notable for cyanosis that is not improved by administration of supplemental oxygen via facemask. Analysis of a sample of arterial blood drawn from this patient prior to any oxygen supplementation is most likely to reveal normal values for which of the following?",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Nitrites cause poisoning by inducing the conversion of heme iron to the oxidized ferric (Fe3+) state, leading to the formation of methemoglobin. With iron in the oxidized ferric state, methemoglobin is unable to bind oxygen. In addition, the affinity of any residual ferrous iron in the hemoglobin tetramer is increased, causing a leftward shift of the oxygen-dissociation curve. However, the partial pressure of oxygen in blood, which represents the amount of oxygen dissolved in the plasma, is unchanged. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nMethemoglobinemia causes dusky discoloration of the skin (similar to cyanosis), and because methemoglobin is unable to carry oxygen, a state of functional anemia is induced. However, the blood partial pressure of oxygen will be unchanged as it is a measure of oxygen dissolved in plasma and is unrelated to hemoglobin function.\n\n(Choices A, B, C, and D) Methemoglobin cannot bind to oxygen and therefore the oxygen content and oxygen carrying capacity of the arterial blood will decrease. The bound fraction of oxygen and oxygen delivery to the peripheral tissues will also decrease due to methemoglobin's inability to carry and deliver oxygen.",
    "zh": "亚硝酸盐通过诱导血红素铁转化为氧化铁（Fe3+）状态，从而导致中毒，导致高铁血红蛋白的形成。当铁处于氧化铁状态时，高铁血红蛋白无法与氧结合。此外，血红蛋白四聚体中任何残留的亚铁的亲和力都会增加，导致氧离曲线左移。然而，血液中的氧分压（代表溶解在血浆中的氧气量）保持不变。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n高铁血红蛋白血症会导致皮肤呈暗灰色（类似于发绀），并且由于高铁血红蛋白无法携带氧气，因此会诱发功能性贫血。然而，血液中的氧分压将保持不变，因为它是溶解在血浆中的氧气的量度，与血红蛋白功能无关。\n\n（选项A、B、C和D）高铁血红蛋白不能与氧结合，因此动脉血的氧含量和氧容量将会下降。由于高铁血红蛋白无法携带和输送氧气，因此与氧结合的氧分数和输送到外周组织的氧气也会减少。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of methemoglobinemia, its causes (nitrite exposure), and its effect on oxygen-carrying capacity and partial pressure of oxygen in the blood. It requires understanding that methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen, leading to functional anemia and cyanosis unresponsive to supplemental oxygen.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the scenario as methemoglobinemia due to nitrite exposure. Knowing that methemoglobin affects oxygen binding to hemoglobin but not the dissolved oxygen in plasma (partial pressure) leads to the correct answer.",
