    "en": "A 14-year-old boy experiences severe, prolonged bleeding following a tooth extraction. He also has a history of multiple episodes of painful joint swelling following minor trauma. His parents have no bleeding problems. Evaluation shows that the patient has an inherited disorder and that one of his parents is a genetic carrier. His older sister, who does not have this condition, is pregnant. She does not know the sex of her child. She asks about the risk that her child will be affected. Which of the following is the best estimate that this child will have the disease?",

    "en": "This patient is a boy with excessive bleeding and hemarthroses, suggesting a diagnosis of HEMOPHILIA A or B. Both diseases are X-linked recessive coagulation factor deficiencies. The probability that his sister will give birth to an affected child can be calculated by multiplying the following probabilities:\n\n*   The probability (p1) that the sister is a carrier = 0.5. The patient's father does not carry the mutation on his X chromosome because he would be affected by the disease if he did. That means the mother carries the mutation on 1 of her 2 X chromosomes. This gives the daughter a 50% chance of having inherited the mutated X chromosome and therefore being a carrier.\n*   The probability (p2) that the offspring of a female carrier will inherit the X chromosome with the hemophilia gene = 0.5. Assuming the daughter is a carrier, the probability of passing on the mutant allele is 50% as only 1 of her 2 X chromosomes is passed to her offspring.\n*   The probability (p3) that his sister will have a boy = 0.5. If the sister's child is female, the child could be a carrier of the disease but would not be affected by it. If a male child inherits the mutated X chromosome, he will have the disease.\n\nThe probability that the sister will have an affected son is the probability that all 3 of the above events will take place (i.e. the product of their individual probabilities): p1 x p2 x p3 = 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nGiven phenotypically normal parents, the probability that a female sibling of a male affected by an X-linked recessive disease will give birth to an affected child is 1/8. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该患者是一名男孩，出现过度出血和关节积血，提示诊断为甲型或乙型血友病。这两种疾病都是X连锁隐性凝血因子缺乏症。可以计算出他的姐姐生下患病孩子的概率，方法是将以下概率相乘：\n\n*   姐姐是携带者的概率 (p1) = 0.5。患者的父亲的X染色体上没有携带突变，因为如果他携带，他将会受到该疾病的影响。这意味着母亲在其两条X染色体中的一条上携带突变。这使得女儿有50%的机会遗传突变的X染色体，从而成为携带者。\n*   女性携带者的后代会遗传带有血友病基因的X染色体的概率 (p2) = 0.5。假设女儿是携带者，传递突变等位基因的概率是50%，因为她的两条X染色体中只有一条会传递给她的后代。\n*   他的姐姐将生下一个男孩的概率 (p3) = 0.5。如果姐姐的孩子是女孩，该孩子可能是该疾病的携带者，但不会受到影响。如果男性孩子遗传了突变的X染色体，他将患有该疾病。\n\n姐姐生下受影响儿子的概率是上述所有3个事件发生的概率（即它们各自概率的乘积）：p1 x p2 x p3 = 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8。\n\n教育目标：\n\n给定表型正常的父母，男性患有X连锁隐性遗传病的女性兄弟姐妹生下受影响孩子的概率为1/8。{{exhibit_1}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of X-linked recessive inheritance patterns, specifically in the context of hemophilia. It requires calculating the probability of a child inheriting the disease given the family history.\n\nThe approach to solve this question involves breaking down the problem into individual probabilities (sister being a carrier, offspring inheriting the affected X chromosome, offspring being male) and then multiplying these probabilities together to find the overall risk.",
