    "en": "A 36-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department with sudden-onset right side weakness and speech difficulty. During the last 3 weeks, the patient has experienced progressive fatigue, malaise, and low-grade fevers. Despite the symptoms, she did not seek medical attention and did not take any medications. She had a dental extraction 6 weeks ago, which was uncomplicated. The patient has never previously been significantly ill or hospitalized. She works as a receptionist at a legal firm and has never traveled outside the United States. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. The patient is admitted to the hospital, but despite adequate resuscitative measures, she dies 2 hours later. Gross autopsy shows large, friable irregular masses attached to the atrial surface of a valve. Which of the following underlying conditions most likely predisposed this patient to developing these cardiac changes? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient had SUBACUTE INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS (IE) complicated by an embolic stroke. The large, friable irregular masses seen on autopsy are most likely vegetations and are the most probable source of this patient's left middle cerebral artery embolus (eg, right-sided weakness, speech difficulty).\n\nThe mitral valve is the valve most frequently affected by IE. MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE (MVP) is the most common underlying valvular disease predisposing to the development of IE in developed countries, particularly when it is associated with coexistent mitral regurgitation. Microscopic deposits of platelets and fibrin occur spontaneously in individuals with valvular disease secondary to endocardial injury from turbulent blood flow. These deposits then become colonized by microorganisms (eg, viridans streptococci) during episodes of bacteremia (eg, following dental extraction).\n\nIn developing countries, the most common acquired heart disease leading to IE development is RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE (RHD). RHD is a late (10-20 years) complication of acute rheumatic fever (eg, migratory arthritis, carditis/valvulitis, erythema marginatum). RHD was historically considered a frequent predisposing factor for IE; however, MVP, valvular sclerosis, and mechanical valves are now more common causes in developed nations due to the recognition and treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.\n\n(Choice A) Congenital heart lesions that predispose to increased risk of IE include bicuspid aortic valve, ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, and unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot. Isolated atrial septal defects are not commonly associated with an increased risk of IE, likely due to the low-pressure differential between the atria and the absence of high-velocity intracardiac flow jets that can damage the endocardium.\n\n(Choice B) Coronary heart disease can cause ischemic papillary muscle dysfunction with resultant mitral regurgitation. However, the clinical presentation and autopsy findings in this patient are most consistent with MVP and IE.\n\n(Choice C) IE is a rare complication of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is almost always seen in patients with outflow obstruction. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by asymmetric ventricular hypertrophy leading to reduced left ventricular cavity size.\n\n(Choice D) Mitral annular calcification refers to degeneration and progressive calcium deposition involving the fibrous annulus of the mitral valve. Mitral annular calcification is usually seen in older adults (age >60), and the annulus is not a common location for IE.\n\nEducational objective: Mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation is the most common predisposing condition for native valve infective endocarditis (IE) in developed nations. Rheumatic heart disease remains a frequent cause of IE in developing nations.",
    "zh": "该患者患有亚急性感染性心内膜炎 (IE)，并伴有栓塞性中风。尸检中看到的大而易碎的不规则肿块很可能是赘生物，并且是该患者左侧大脑中动脉栓塞的最可能来源（例如，右侧肢体无力，言语困难）。\n\n二尖瓣是 IE 最常受累的瓣膜。二尖瓣脱垂 (MVP) 是发达国家发生 IE 的最常见潜在瓣膜疾病，特别是当它与合并性二尖瓣反流相关时。血小板和纤维蛋白的微观沉积自发地发生在患有瓣膜疾病的个体中，继发于湍流血流引起的内膜损伤。这些沉积物随后在菌血症发作期间被微生物（例如，草绿色链球菌）定植（例如，拔牙后）。\n\n在发展中国家，导致 IE 发生的最常见获得性心脏病是风湿性心脏病 (RHD)。RHD 是急性风湿热的晚期（10-20 年）并发症（例如，游走性关节炎、心肌炎/瓣膜炎、环状红斑）。RHD 历来被认为是 IE 的一个常见易感因素；然而，由于对 A 组链球菌咽炎的识别和治疗，MVP、瓣膜硬化和机械瓣膜现在是发达国家更常见的原因。\n\n（选项A） 易于增加 IE 风险的先天性心脏病变包括二叶式主动脉瓣、室间隔缺损、动脉导管未闭和未修复的法洛四联症。孤立的房间隔缺损通常与 IE 风险增加无关，这可能是由于心房之间的低压差以及缺乏会损害心内膜的高速心内血流喷射流。\n\n（选项 B）冠心病可导致缺血性乳头肌功能障碍，从而导致二尖瓣反流。然而，该患者的临床表现和尸检结果与 MVP 和 IE 最为一致。\n\n（选项 C） IE 是肥厚型心肌病的罕见并发症，几乎总是见于有流出道梗阻的患者。肥厚型心肌病的特征是心室不对称肥大，导致左心室腔大小减小。\n\n（选项 D）二尖瓣环钙化是指涉及二尖瓣纤维环的退行性变和进行性钙沉积。二尖瓣环钙化通常见于老年人（年龄 >60 岁），并且环不是 IE 的常见位置。\n\n教育目标：在发达国家，伴有反流的二尖瓣脱垂是原生瓣膜感染性心内膜炎 (IE) 的最常见易感病症。风湿性心脏病仍然是发展中国家 IE 的常见原因。"
