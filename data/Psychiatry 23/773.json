    "en": "The pathophysiology of depression is hypothesized to involve the dysregulation of monoamine (eg, serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine) neurotransmission. Most antidepressant medications act by various mechanisms to increase synaptic concentrations of these neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme located in presynaptic nerve terminals that is responsible for the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters. Phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, works by irreversibly binding and inhibiting both types of MAO: A and B. This results in increased presynaptic availability of monoamine neurotransmitters, thereby increasing their release into the synaptic cleft. Because phenelzine irreversibly inhibits MAO, it may take up to 2 weeks following discontinuation of the drug before MAO is resynthesized to a level appropriate for normal monoamine degradation.\n\nSertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that specifically increases synaptic serotonin levels. Coadministration of an SSRI and an MAO inhibitor is contraindicated due to the risk of SEROTONIN SYNDROME, a potentially fatal condition characterized by altered mental status, neuromuscular excitation (eg, hyperreflexia, clonus), and autonomic hyperactivity (eg, hyperthermia, tachycardia, diaphoresis). To avoid serotonin syndrome, patients must wait at least 2 weeks after MAO inhibitor discontinuation before initiating SSRI therapy, thereby allowing sufficient time for regeneration of the MAO enzyme.\n\n(Choice A) Monoamine (eg, serotonin) receptors are G protein-coupled receptors. Internalization of activated G protein-coupled receptors plays a role in downregulating postsynaptic signal transduction when synaptic monoamine levels are chronically increased. However, this is not the reason for the 2-week washout period from phenelzine, which is required to resynthesize the irreversibly inhibited MAO enzyme.\n\n(Choice B) Inositol monophosphatase inhibition is hypothesized to be one of the mechanisms by which lithium exerts its antidepressant and antimanic effects. Inositol monophosphatase is not affected by MAO inhibitors.\n\n(Choice C) MAO inhibition arrests the breakdown of monoamines, thereby increasing their release into the synaptic cleft. Overall MAO functioning gradually increases after discontinuation of irreversible MAO inhibitors (eg, tranylcypromine, phenelzine) as new MAO is synthesized.\n\n(Choice D) Increased monoamine neurotransmission due to antidepressant treatment causes downregulation of postsynaptic monoamine (eg, serotonin) receptors, decreasing their density within the synaptic cleft. This (along with other chronic, downstream neuromodulatory changes) is responsible for the delayed clinical effects of antidepressants.\n\n(Choice E) Presynaptic monoaminergic neurons actively take up norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin through reuptake transporters and repackage them into synaptic vesicles for future neurotransmission. Monoamine reuptake inhibitors, such as tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs, work by blocking this reuptake.\n\nEducational objective:\nCoadministration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors can produce excessive synaptic serotonin levels secondary to decreased reuptake and decreased degradation of serotonin, potentially causing serotonin syndrome. To avoid this risk, a 2-week washout period after discontinuing an MAO inhibitor and before initiating SSRI therapy is required to allow sufficient time for MAO regeneration.",
    "zh": "抑郁症的病理生理学被认为涉及单胺（例如，血清素、去甲肾上腺素、多巴胺）神经传递的失调。大多数抗抑郁药物通过各种机制增加这些神经递质的突触浓度，特别是血清素。单胺氧化酶 (MAO) 是一种位于突触前神经末梢的酶，负责分解单胺类神经递质。苯乙肼，一种单胺氧化酶抑制剂，通过不可逆地结合和抑制两种类型的 MAO 发挥作用：A 和 B。这导致突触前单胺类神经递质的可用性增加，从而增加它们释放到突触间隙中。由于苯乙肼不可逆地抑制 MAO，因此在停药后可能需要长达 2 周的时间，MAO 才能重新合成到足以进行正常单胺降解的水平。\n\n舍曲林是一种选择性血清素再摄取抑制剂 (SSRI)，可特异性增加突触血清素水平。由于存在血清素综合征的风险，禁止同时使用 SSRI 和 MAO 抑制剂，血清素综合征是一种潜在的致命疾病，其特征是精神状态改变、神经肌肉兴奋（例如，反射亢进、阵挛）和自主神经系统活动亢进（例如，高热、心动过速、出汗）。为了避免血清素综合征，患者必须在停用 MAO 抑制剂后至少等待 2 周，然后才能开始 SSRI 治疗，从而为 MAO 酶的再生提供足够的时间。\n\n(选项 A) 单胺（例如，血清素）受体是 G 蛋白偶联受体。当突触单胺水平长期升高时，活化 G 蛋白偶联受体的内化在下调突触后信号转导中起作用。然而，这并不是 2 周的苯乙肼清洗期的原因，该清洗期需要重新合成不可逆抑制的 MAO 酶。\n\n(选项 B) 磷酸肌醇单磷酸酶抑制被认为是锂发挥其抗抑郁和抗躁狂作用的机制之一。磷酸肌醇单磷酸酶不受 MAO 抑制剂的影响。\n\n(选项 C) MAO 抑制阻止了单胺的分解，从而增加了它们释放到突触间隙中。在停用不可逆 MAO 抑制剂（例如，反苯环丙胺、苯乙肼）后，随着新 MAO 的合成，MAO 的整体功能逐渐增加。\n\n(选项 D) 由于抗抑郁治疗引起的单胺神经传递增加导致突触后单胺（例如，血清素）受体下调，降低了它们在突触间隙内的密度。这（与其他慢性、下游神经调节变化一起）是抗抑郁药延迟临床效应的原因。\n\n(选项 E) 突触前单胺能神经元通过再摄取转运蛋白主动摄取去甲肾上腺素、多巴胺和血清素，并将它们重新包装到突触囊泡中，以备将来神经传递之用。单胺再摄取抑制剂，如三环类抗抑郁药和 SSRI，通过阻断这种再摄取发挥作用。\n\n教学目标：\n选择性血清素再摄取抑制剂 (SSRI) 和单胺氧化酶 (MAO) 抑制剂的共同给药会导致继发于血清素再摄取减少和血清素降解减少的突触血清素水平过高，可能导致血清素综合征。为了避免这种风险，在停用 MAO 抑制剂后并在开始 SSRI 治疗之前，需要 2 周的清洗期，以便为 MAO 再生提供足够的时间。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of drug interactions between monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), specifically the rationale behind the required washout period. It assesses knowledge of MAO enzyme function, irreversible inhibition, and the mechanism of serotonin syndrome.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify phenelzine as an irreversible MAOI and sertraline as an SSRI. Understanding that MAOIs inhibit the breakdown of monoamines, and that irreversible inhibition requires enzyme resynthesis for recovery, is key. The 2-week washout period is necessary for MAO enzyme regeneration to prevent serotonin syndrome when an SSRI is introduced.",
