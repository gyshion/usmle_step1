    "en": "A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to central chest pain for the past 2 hours. The patient describes the pain as “very severe” and “going back all the way to my spine.” He has never had similar pain. Medical history is significant for hypertension; the patient has been nonadherent with prescribed medical therapy and follow-up visits. He has a 20-pack-year smoking history. Blood pressure is 195/101 mm Hg, and pulse is 93/min and regular. Chest examination reveals clear lungs. ECG shows sinus rhythm and voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Portable chest x-ray reveals a widened mediastinum. The patient is immediately treated with intravenous esmolol.",

    "en": "This patient’s severe chest pain radiating to the back and a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray are consistent with acute aortic dissection. Uncontrolled hypertension, suggested by the patient’s nonadherence with medical therapy and ECG evidence of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, is the strongest risk factor for aortic dissection.\n\nWith each LV contraction, the ejected stroke volume rapidly increases aortic pressure and generates shear stress on the aortic wall. Medical therapy for aortic dissection is aimed at reducing aortic wall shear stress to limit extension of the dissection. This is accomplished via anti-impulse therapy to decrease the rate of change in aortic blood pressure per time (ie, reduce dP/dt).\n\nEsmolol is a selective beta-1 receptor blocker that is given by intravenous infusion. It is first-line therapy for acute aortic dissection as it has a short half-life (allowing for easy dose titration) and reduces shear stress in 2 ways:\n\nNegative inotropy decreases LV contraction velocity. This decreases the rate of blood ejection and reduces stroke volume (Choice E) to decrease the rise in blood pressure with each contraction (ie, decreased rate and magnitude of blood pressure change).\nNegative chronotropy decreases heart rate, subjecting the aortic wall to fewer LV contractions per minute (ie, decreased number of blood pressure changes).\nOnce shear stress has been minimized with adequate reduction in LV contractility and heart rate, decreasing peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) to further reduce blood pressure is also beneficial. Because esmolol has little effect on PVR (Choice C), vasodilators (eg, nitroprusside, nicardipine) may be added for this purpose. Vasodilators should never be given prior to a negative chronotropic agent because vasodilation causes reflex tachycardia that increases aortic wall shear stress.\n\n(Choice B) Reduced LV contractility and heart rate decrease myocardial oxygen demand. Although this is the major goal of medical therapy for treating myocardial ischemia, reducing aortic wall shear stress is much more important for treating aortic dissection.\n\n(Choice D) Reduced LV contractility and heart rate may slightly increase LV filling pressure (due to less blood being ejected with each contraction and increased LV filling time), but this effect is of minimal consequence in treating aortic dissection.\n\nEducational objective: The primary goal of medical therapy for acute dissection is to reduce aortic wall shear stress by minimizing the change in aortic blood pressure per time (dP/dt). Esmolol, a selective beta-1 receptor blocker, decreases left ventricular contraction velocity and heart rate to reduce dP/dt.",
    "zh": "该患者的严重胸痛放射到背部，加上胸片上纵隔增宽，与急性主动脉夹层相符。患者未坚持治疗且心电图显示左心室(LV)肥大，提示其高血压控制不佳，是主动脉夹层最强的危险因素。\n\n每次左心室收缩时，射出的每搏输出量会迅速增加主动脉压力，并在主动脉壁上产生剪切应力。主动脉夹层的药物治疗旨在减少主动脉壁的剪切应力，以限制夹层的延伸。这可以通过抗冲动治疗来实现，以降低主动脉血压随时间的变化率（即，降低 dP/dt）。\n\n依司莫洛是一种选择性β-1受体阻滞剂，通过静脉输注给药。它是急性主动脉夹层的首选治疗药物，因为它半衰期短（便于剂量滴定），并通过两种方式降低剪切应力：\n\n负性肌力作用降低了左心室收缩速度。这降低了血液射出的速率，并降低了每搏输出量（选项E），从而减少每次收缩时血压的升高（即，降低血压变化的速度和幅度）。\n负性变时性降低心率，使主动脉壁每分钟受到较少的左心室收缩（即，减少血压变化次数）。\n一旦通过充分降低左心室收缩力和心率将剪切应力降至最低，降低外周血管阻力(PVR)以进一步降低血压也是有益的。由于依司莫洛对外周血管阻力影响很小（选项C），因此可以为此目的添加血管扩张剂（例如，硝普钠、尼卡地平）。血管扩张剂不应在负性变时性药物之前使用，因为血管扩张会导致反射性心动过速，从而增加主动脉壁的剪切应力。\n\n（选项B）降低左心室收缩力和心率降低心肌耗氧量。虽然这是治疗心肌缺血的药物治疗的主要目标，但降低主动脉壁的剪切应力对于治疗主动脉夹层更重要。\n\n（选项D）降低左心室收缩力和心率可能会略微增加左心室充盈压（由于每次收缩时射出的血量减少和左心室充盈时间增加），但这种作用在治疗主动脉夹层中影响很小。\n\n教育目标：急性夹层药物治疗的主要目标是通过最大限度地减少主动脉血压随时间的变化（dP/dt）来降低主动脉壁的剪切应力。依司莫洛，一种选择性β-1受体阻滞剂，可降低左心室收缩速度和心率以降低 dP/dt。"
