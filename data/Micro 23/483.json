    "en": "A 35-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 12 weeks gestation comes to the office for evaluation of genital warts. She first noticed the warts last week and is concerned that it has persisted. The patient has occasional mild pruritus but no pain. She is currently sexually active with her boyfriend and engages in oral and vaginal intercourse. Examination shows several verrucous, skin-colored lesions over the labia majora. The patient asks whether the lesion could affect her future child. The virus involved in this patient's condition also has an affinity to infect which of the following structures?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's verrucous, skin-colored genital lesion is most consistent with condylomata acuminatum, also known as anogenital warts. Condylomata acuminatum is caused by HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV), a small DOUBLE-STRANDED DNA VIRUS with >100 subtypes. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted disease and can be transmitted by vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse. Most infections are cleared by host immunity, but types 6 and 11 can result in warts.\n\nHPV infects basal epithelial cells through small breaks in the skin or mucosal surfaces. It has a predilection for STRATIFIED SQUAMOUS EPITHELIUM, which is found in the anal canal, vagina, and cervix. In the respiratory tract, the TRUE VOCAL CORDS are the only area covered with stratified squamous epithelium. The vocal cords undergo near-constant friction and abrasion to produce speech. Stratified squamous epithelium is protective, as deeper cells can replace surface cells that are damaged.\n\nInfants can acquire respiratory papillomatosis via passage through the birth canal of mothers infected with the virus. Warty growths on the true vocal cords can lead to a weak cry, hoarseness, and stridor.\n\n(Choice A) The alveoli are comprised of simple squamous epithelium. This thin and flat epithelium facilitates rapid transmembrane exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\n\n(Choice B) The false vocal cords, also known as ventricular folds, are folds of mucous membrane lined in respiratory epithelium, which is ciliated, pseudostratified, columnar, and mucus-secreting. The false vocal cords are adjacent to the true vocal cords and help to lubricate the true vocal cords with mucus from foreign bodies.\n\n(Choices C and D) The paranasal sinuses and trachea also are lined in respiratory epithelium. This ciliated, pseudostratified, columnar, and mucus-secreting epithelium protects the respiratory tract from debris and pathogens. Goblet cells secrete mucus to trap particulate matter, and the cilia beat in a rhythmic fashion to propel this mucus/debris toward the oral cavity, where it can be swallowed or coughed up.\n\nEducational objective:\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV) is a small DNA virus with a tropism for stratified squamous epithelium, which protectively lines anatomical areas that undergo frequent friction and abrasion, including the true vocal cords, cervix, and anus. Infants can acquire respiratory papillomatosis via passage through an HPV-infected birth canal.",
    "zh": "该患者的疣状、肤色生殖器病变最符合尖锐湿疣，也称为肛门生殖器疣。尖锐湿疣由人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）引起，这是一种小的双链DNA病毒，有>100个亚型。HPV是最常见的性传播疾病，可通过阴道、肛门和口交传播。大多数感染由宿主免疫清除，但6型和11型可导致疣。\n\nHPV通过皮肤或粘膜表面的微小破损感染基底上皮细胞。它具有对复层鳞状上皮的易感性，这在上皮细胞中可以发现在肛管、阴道和子宫颈中。在呼吸道中，真声带是唯一覆盖有复层鳞状上皮的区域。声带产生声音时会受到近乎恒定的摩擦和磨损。复层鳞状上皮具有保护作用，因为较深层的细胞可以替换受损的表面细胞。\n\n婴儿可以通过感染病毒的母亲的产道获得呼吸道乳头状瘤病。真声带上的疣状生长可导致声音嘶哑、声音嘶哑和喘鸣。\n\n（选项A）肺泡由单层鳞状上皮组成。这种薄而扁平的上皮促进氧气和二氧化碳的快速跨膜交换。\n\n（选项B）假声带，也称为室襞，是呼吸道上皮（有纤毛、假复层、柱状和分泌粘液）覆盖的粘膜褶皱。假声带与真声带相邻，有助于用粘液润滑真声带，防止异物进入。\n\n（选项C和D）鼻旁窦和气管也衬有呼吸道上皮。这种有纤毛、假复层、柱状和分泌粘液的上皮可保护呼吸道免受碎屑和病原体的侵害。杯状细胞分泌粘液以捕获颗粒物质，纤毛以有节奏的方式跳动，将这些粘液/碎屑推向口腔，在那里可以被吞咽或咳出。\n\n教育目标：人乳头瘤病毒 (HPV) 是一种小型 DNA 病毒，对复层鳞状上皮具有亲嗜性，这种上皮保护性地覆盖了经常受到摩擦和磨损的解剖区域，包括真声带、子宫颈和肛门。婴儿可以通过感染 HPV 的产道获得呼吸道乳头状瘤病。"
