    "en": "Phase 4: Resting potential (diastole). Resting potential is determined largely by membrane permeability to K+ ions when in the resting state. The resting potential of cardiac myocytes is approximately -90mV, while the resting potential of skeletal myocytes is approximately -75mV. The highly negative resting potential of cardiac myocytes reduces the risk of arrhythmias, as a larger stimulus is needed to excite the cells.\n\nPhase 0: Rapid depolarization. As in skeletal myocytes, the action potential onset occurs when voltage-gated Na+ channels open and Na+ ions rush into the cell.\n\nPhase 1: Initial rapid repolarization. This phase is associated with the rapid closure of Na+ channels.\n\nPhase 2: Plateau. This phase is a distinctive feature of the cardiac action potential not seen in other tissues. It is characterized by the opening of L-type dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca++ channels and the closure of some K+ channels. Consequently, the membrane becomes highly permeable to Ca++ ions and minimally permeable to K- ions.\n\nPhase 3: Late rapid repolarization. This phase features closure of Ca++ channels and the opening of K+ channels. Efflux of K- from the cell restores the membrane resting potential.\n\nIn sum, the cardiac myocyte action potential includes the following three key events: Na+ ion influx (corresponding to the red curve on the ion conductivity graph); Ca++ ion influx (corresponding to the blue curve on the ion conductivity graph); and decreased K+ permeability during the action potential upstroke (corresponding to the green curve on the ion conductivity graph) {{exhibit_2}}.\n\n(Choices A, C, D, and E) The other ion sequences listed do not correlate with the action potential phases observed in cardiac myocytes.",
    "zh": "第4期：静息电位（舒张期）。静息电位主要由静息状态下细胞膜对K+离子的通透性决定。心肌细胞的静息电位约为-90mV，而骨骼肌细胞的静息电位约为-75mV。心肌细胞的高度负静息电位降低了心律失常的风险，因为需要更大的刺激才能兴奋细胞。\n\n第0期：快速去极化。与骨骼肌细胞一样，动作电位的发生是由于电压门控Na+通道开放，Na+离子涌入细胞。\n\n第1期：初始快速复极化。这一阶段与Na+通道的快速关闭有关。\n\n第2期：平台期。这一阶段是心肌动作电位的一个显著特征，在其他组织中未见。其特征是L型二氢吡啶敏感的Ca++通道开放和一些K+通道关闭。因此，细胞膜对Ca++离子具有高度通透性，而对K-离子具有极低的通透性。\n\n第3期：晚期快速复极化。这一阶段的特点是Ca++通道关闭和K+通道开放。K-从细胞外流恢复了膜静息电位。\n\n总而言之，心肌细胞动作电位包括以下三个关键事件：Na+离子内流（对应于离子电导图上的红色曲线）；Ca++离子内流（对应于离子电导图上的蓝色曲线）；动作电位上升期间K+通透性降低（对应于离子电导图上的绿色曲线）{{exhibit_2}}。\n\n（选项A、C、D和E）列出的其他离子序列与心肌细胞中观察到的动作电位各期不相关。"
