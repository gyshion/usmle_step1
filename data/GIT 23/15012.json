  "explanation": {
    "en": "Liver neoplasms are most often due to metastases to the liver from distant tumors rather than primary liver cancer (eg, hepatocellular carcinoma). Metastatic disease to the liver is particularly likely when multiple tumors are present (as seen in this case) and there is no history of underlying hepatic disease such as alcohol-induced cirrhosis or hepatitis C. The liver is vulnerable to the metastatic spread of cancer due to the following anatomic considerations:\n\n*   The presence of fenestrated hepatic sinusoidal epithelium, which allows tumor cells to easily pass from the bloodstream through to the parenchyma.\n*   Dual blood supply from the portal and systemic circulation, which increases the likelihood of circulating tumor cells depositing in the liver.\n\nThe most common cause of liver metastases is colorectal cancer, which spreads directly from the colon or superior rectum through the portal venous system to the liver. This patient, who has not received recommended cancer screening (eg, colonoscopy), likely developed hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. Gastric and pancreatic cancers also frequently spread through the portal system to the liver.\n\n(Choice A) Lymphatic spread of tumor cells is a common mechanism of metastases, but it is not the primary source of most metastatic liver lesions.\n\n(Choice B) Tumors (eg, breast, lung, melanoma) can spread to the liver through the systemic circulation via the hepatic artery (rather than the portal circulation). The hepatic vein drains out of the liver; it does not bring blood into the liver.\n\n(Choice D) Primary hepatic cancer is thirtyfold less common than metastatic disease. Most primary lesions are solitary tumors and arise in individuals with underlying liver disease. This patient, who did not have recommended cancer screening (eg, colonoscopy) and has multiple liver tumors, most likely has metastatic disease.\n\n(Choice E) Although gastrointestinal cancers can spread to the peritoneum and then invade the liver, this is much less common than hematogenous dissemination through the portal system. Metastasis through the peritoneal space most commonly occurs with ovarian cancer and gastric (Krukenberg) tumors.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nMost hepatic neoplasms are due to metastatic disease from a distant site. Colorectal cancer is the most common cause of hepatic metastases due to direct blood flow from the colon (and superior rectum) to the liver via the portal venous circulation. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "肝脏肿瘤通常是由于远处肿瘤转移到肝脏，而不是原发性肝癌（如肝细胞癌）。当存在多个肿瘤（如本例所示）且没有潜在的肝脏疾病史，如酒精引起的肝硬化或丙型肝炎时，肝脏转移性疾病的可能性特别大。由于以下解剖学因素，肝脏容易发生癌症转移：\n\n*   存在有孔的肝窦内皮细胞，这使得肿瘤细胞可以容易地从血流通过进入实质。\n*   来自门静脉和体循环的双重血液供应，这增加了循环肿瘤细胞沉积在肝脏中的可能性。\n\n肝脏转移的最常见原因是结直肠癌，它直接从结肠或上直肠通过门静脉系统扩散到肝脏。该患者未接受推荐的癌症筛查（例如，结肠镜检查），很可能发展为结直肠癌引起的肝转移。胃癌和胰腺癌也经常通过门静脉系统扩散到肝脏。\n\n（选项A）肿瘤细胞的淋巴转移是转移的常见机制，但它不是大多数转移性肝脏病变的主要来源。\n\n（选项B）肿瘤（例如，乳腺癌、肺癌、黑色素瘤）可以通过体循环通过肝动脉（而不是门静脉循环）扩散到肝脏。肝静脉将血液从肝脏引出；它不会将血液带入肝脏。\n\n（选项D）原发性肝癌比转移性疾病少三十倍。大多数原发性病变是孤立的肿瘤，发生在有潜在肝脏疾病的个体中。该患者未接受推荐的癌症筛查（例如，结肠镜检查）并且有多个肝脏肿瘤，最有可能患有转移性疾病。\n\n（选项E）虽然胃肠道癌可以扩散到腹膜，然后侵犯肝脏，但这远不如通过门静脉系统的血行播散常见。通过腹膜腔转移最常发生在卵巢癌和胃癌（Krukenberg）肿瘤中。\n\n教育目标：\n\n大多数肝脏肿瘤是由于来自远处部位的转移性疾病引起的。结直肠癌是肝脏转移的最常见原因，因为它通过门静脉循环从结肠（和上直肠）直接流向肝脏。{{exhibit_2}}"
