  "explanation": {
    "en": "Crohn disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by patchy inflammation that can occur throughout the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract; patients commonly complain of relapsing and remitting abdominal pain, diarrhea (with or without blood), and weight loss. CD typically involves the ileum; however, up to 20% of patients have only colonic involvement. Unlike ulcerative colitis, which is characterized by continuous inflammation of the colon limited to the mucosa and submucosa, inflammation in CD is transmural (full thickness) and segmental in nature. This leads to recognizable manifestations on gross pathology, including:\n\n- Skip lesions – sharply delineated ulcerations surrounded by normal bowel\n\n- Cobblestone appearance – serpiginous (ie, wavy, snakelike) depressed ulcerations that separate elevated islands of healthy tissue (giving the mucosa an appearance of a cobblestone street)\n\n- Bowel wall thickening – due to inflammation involving all layers of the bowel wall leading to edema, hypertrophy of the muscularis mucosa, and fibrosis\n\n- Creeping fat – mesenteric fat becomes wrapped around the bowel, possibly in response to intestinal bacteria translocation\n\nIn addition, the transmural inflammation frequently leads to complications such as abscesses, strictures, and fistulas.\n\n(Choice A) Amoebic dysentery caused by *Entamoeba histolytica* causes hematochezia, abdominal pain, and ulcerations; however, the ulcers are classically flask-shaped and smaller than those seen with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n(Choice B) Collagenous colitis can cause chronic watery diarrhea (>5-10 episodes daily) but is commonly seen in middle-aged women and is not associated with bleeding, ulcerations, inflammation, or abdominal pain.\n\n(Choice D) Graft-versus-host disease of the GI tract can cause abdominal pain and ulcerations, but it typically causes severe diarrhea (up to 10 L daily) and occurs as a complication of allogeneic stem cell transplant.\n\n(Choice E) Pseudomembranous colitis occurs from *Clostridioides difficile* infection (CDI). It causes abdominal pain and diarrhea that can result in toxic megacolon. A white/yellow, patchy pseudomembrane, composed of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and cellular debris, is visualized. In addition, CDI is typically associated with recent antibiotic use.\n\n(Choice F) Ulcerative colitis is characterized by contiguous inflammation that extends from the rectum. Ulcerations are shallow and involve only the mucosa and submucosa; pseudopolyps (areas of inflamed mucosa and/or granulation tissue that appear polyp-like due to surrounding ulcerations) are seen; bowel wall thickening is not as prominent as with CD.\n\nEducational objective:\nCrohn disease is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by patchy inflammation that can occur throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract. Gross pathology demonstrates skip lesions, cobblestoning of the mucosa, bowel wall thickening, and creeping fat. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "克罗恩病(CD)是一种炎症性肠病，其特征是可在整个胃肠道(GI)内出现的斑片状炎症；患者常主诉复发性和缓解性腹痛、腹泻（伴或不伴有血便）和体重减轻。CD通常累及回肠；然而，高达20%的患者仅有结肠受累。与溃疡性结肠炎（其特征是仅限于黏膜和黏膜下层的结肠持续性炎症）不同，CD中的炎症是全层（全厚度）和节段性的。这导致了肉眼病理学上可识别的表现，包括：\n\n- 跳跃病变——由正常肠道包绕的界限清晰的溃疡\n\n- 鹅卵石样外观——蛇形（即波浪状，蛇形）凹陷性溃疡，将隆起的健康组织岛隔开（使黏膜呈现鹅卵石街道的外观）\n\n- 肠壁增厚——由于炎症累及肠壁的所有层，导致水肿、肌层肥大和纤维化\n\n- 蠕动脂肪——肠系膜脂肪包裹在肠道周围，这可能是对肠道细菌易位的反应\n\n此外，全层炎症常导致脓肿、狭窄和瘘管等并发症。\n\n(选项A)由溶组织内阿米巴引起的阿米巴痢疾可引起便血、腹痛和溃疡；然而，溃疡的典型形状呈烧瓶状，并且小于炎症性肠病所见的溃疡。\n\n(选项B)胶原性结肠炎可引起慢性水样腹泻（每天超过5-10次），但常见于中年女性，并且与出血、溃疡、炎症或腹痛无关。\n\n(选项D)胃肠道移植物抗宿主病可引起腹痛和溃疡，但其通常引起严重腹泻（每天高达10L），并且是同种异体干细胞移植的并发症。\n\n(选项E)假膜性结肠炎由艰难梭菌感染(CDI)引起。它引起腹痛和腹泻，可导致中毒性巨结肠。可以看到由炎症细胞、纤维蛋白和细胞碎片组成的白色/黄色、斑片状假膜。此外，CDI通常与近期使用抗生素有关。\n\n(选项F)溃疡性结肠炎的特征是炎症连续，从直肠延伸。溃疡较浅，仅累及黏膜和黏膜下层；可见假息肉（由于周围溃疡而呈息肉样的发炎黏膜和/或肉芽组织区域）；肠壁增厚不如CD明显。\n\n教育目标：\n克罗恩病是一种炎症性肠病，其特征是可在整个胃肠道内出现的斑片状炎症。肉眼病理学显示跳跃病变、黏膜鹅卵石样改变、肠壁增厚和蠕动脂肪。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease, and its characteristic pathological findings such as transmural inflammation, skip lesions, cobblestoning, bowel wall thickening, and creeping fat. It requires differentiating Crohn's disease from other causes of colitis based on clinical presentation and pathological features.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the patient's history of relapsing-remitting bloody diarrhea and right-sided abdominal pain, along with the colonoscopy findings of inflammation and dysplasia. The key is to recognize the significance of bowel wall thickening in the context of chronic inflammatory bowel disease and to differentiate Crohn's from ulcerative colitis and other causes of colitis.",
