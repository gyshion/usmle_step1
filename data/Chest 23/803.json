    "en": "A 2-day-old boy develops abdominal distension and refuses to breastfeed. He was born via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at 39 weeks gestation to a primigravid mother. Examination shows significant abdominal distension with palpable intestinal loops. The rectum has no stool and rectal tone is normal. During the examination, the infant has several episodes of dark green emesis. Plain films of the abdomen show air-fluid levels and small bowel dilation. Contrast enema fails to relieve the obstruction, and the patient is taken for emergency laparotomy, which shows an inspissated, green fecal mass obstructing the distal ileum. The infant recovers from the surgery uneventfully.",

    "en": "This patient's abdominal distension, bilious emesis, and x-ray findings (air-fluid levels, small bowel dilation) are consistent with BOWEL OBSTRUCTION. The intraoperative finding of a green INSPISSATED mass (dehydrated meconium) in the distal ileum points to the diagnosis of meconium ileus as the source of obstruction. Meconium ileus is a very specific finding for CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF). Although only 10%-20% of infants with CF will have meconium ileus at birth, almost all full-term infants with meconium ileus are eventually diagnosed with CF. Abnormalities in chloride, sodium, and water transport by the ductal epithelium of intestinal mucous glands cause isotonic dehydration of the lumen contents. This results in secretion of ABNORMALLY VISCOUS MUCUS into the small bowel. In the United States, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, and cor pulmonale account for most deaths due to CF.\n\n(Choice A) Patients with Hirschsprung disease (HD) typically present with signs of intestinal obstruction in the newborn period that are similar to meconium ileus. However, HD typically presents with increased rectal tone, \"squirt sign\" (forceful expulsion of stool after rectal examination), and obstruction at the rectosigmoid region with a transition zone between the aganglionic rectum and proximal dilated colon. Enterocolitis (diarrhea, abdominal pain/distension, and fever) is the most common cause of mortality in patients with HD.\n\n(Choice B) Focal biliary or multilobular cirrhosis due to plugging of bile canaliculi by dehydrated mucinous material develops in approximately 5% of CF patients. Death from cirrhotic liver failure is much less likely than terminal pneumonia.\n\n(Choice C) Most patients with CF have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, which causes malabsorption and steatorrhea. Infants often have large foul-smelling stools, abdominal distension, and poor weight gain. Consequences include deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins, hypoproteinemia with generalized edema, and persistent diarrhea with rectal prolapse. However, pancreatic involvement is rarely fatal with pancreatic enzyme supplementation.\n\n(Choice E) Although the CFTR protein is expressed in nephrons, patients with CF usually do not manifest serious renal dysfunction or failure. Patients with CF, however, are at elevated risk for nephrolithiasis and renal damage from nephrotoxic medications (eg, aminoglycosides).\n\nEducational objective:\nMeconium ileus is a distal small bowel obstruction due to abnormally dehydrated meconium in a patient with cystic fibrosis (CF). Persistent, treatment-resistant infectious pneumonias, bronchiectasis, and cor pulmonale account for most deaths due to CF.",
    "zh": "该患者的腹胀、胆汁性呕吐和X线表现（气液平面，小肠扩张）与肠梗阻一致。术中发现远端回肠内存在绿色的干结团块（脱水胎粪）提示诊断为胎粪性 ileus 作为梗阻的来源。胎粪性 ileus 是囊性纤维化 (CF) 的一个非常特异性的发现。尽管只有 10%-20% 的 CF 婴儿在出生时会患有胎粪性 ileus，但几乎所有患有胎粪性 ileus 的足月婴儿最终都被诊断为 CF。肠粘液腺导管上皮细胞对氯离子、钠离子和水的转运异常导致管腔内容物的等渗脱水。这导致异常粘稠的粘液分泌到小肠中。在美国，肺炎、支气管扩张和肺心病是 CF 大部分死亡的原因。\n\n(选项A) 患有 Hirschsprung 病 (HD) 的患者通常会在新生儿期出现与胎粪 ileus 相似的肠梗阻征象。然而，HD 通常表现为直肠张力增加，“喷射征”（直肠检查后粪便的用力排出）以及直乙状结肠区域的梗阻，其无神经节直肠和近端扩张结肠之间存在过渡带。肠炎（腹泻、腹痛/腹胀和发热）是 HD 患者最常见的死亡原因。\n\n(选项B) 大约 5% 的 CF 患者会出现由于脱水粘液物质阻塞胆小管引起的局灶性胆汁性或多小叶性肝硬化。与终末期肺炎相比，因肝硬化肝衰竭而死亡的可能性要小得多。\n\n(选项C) 大多数 CF 患者患有外分泌性胰腺功能不全，这会导致吸收不良和脂肪泻。婴儿通常有大量恶臭的粪便、腹胀和体重增长不良。后果包括脂溶性维生素缺乏、低蛋白血症伴全身水肿和持续性腹泻伴直肠脱垂。然而，胰腺受累很少会因补充胰酶而致命。\n\n(选项E) 尽管 CFTR 蛋白在肾单位中表达，但 CF 患者通常不会表现出严重的肾功能障碍或衰竭。然而，CF 患者发生肾结石症和因肾毒性药物（如氨基糖苷类药物）引起的肾损伤的风险升高。\n\n教育目标：\n胎粪性 ileus 是由于囊性纤维化 (CF) 患者中异常脱水的胎粪引起的远端小肠梗阻。持续性、耐药性感染性肺炎、支气管扩张和肺心病是 CF 大部分死亡的原因。"

Specifically, it assesses the understanding that respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, are the leading cause of death in these patients.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the clinical scenario as meconium ileus, associate it with cystic fibrosis, and then recall the major causes of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis patients.
