    "en": "A 66-year-old, right-handed man is brought to the emergency department due to possible stroke. This morning, his wife noticed that the patient's face appeared drooped and he was not moving his left arm. On physical examination, the patient is awake and alert and preferentially looks toward the right. Muscle strength is decreased in the left lower face and left upper and lower extremities. When asked to draw an analog clock face to show 3 o'clock, the patient places the numbers and hands on the right half, leaving an empty space on the left. Occlusion of which of the following labeled arteries in the image below is the most likely cause of this patient's current condition? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient with a stroke has the following defects that suggest impairment in specific areas of the cerebral cortex:\n\n*   Weakness of the left arm, leg, and face (upper motor neuron pattern- spares the upper face and occurs on the same side as the arm and leg weakness) suggests a defect impacting the contralateral (right) primary motor cortex.\n*   Gaze deviation to the right is usually due to a lesion impacting the frontal eye fields (location overlaps the premotor and prefrontal cortices). Gaze preference is typically toward the side of the lesion, suggesting a lesion in the right frontal cortex.\n*   Left hemineglect is unawareness of the left side of the world and/or body (as seen in this patient's clock drawing), usually due to a lesion in the nondominant (right) parietal cortex.\n*   Anosognosia is unawareness of one's condition (eg, patient's spouse brought him in and he was unconcerned), consistent with a lesion in the nondominant (usually right) parietal cortex.\n\nThe posterior portions of the right frontal lobe and anterior portions of the right parietal lobe are supplied by the right middle cerebral artery (MCA), which arises from the internal carotid artery. In this normal angiogram of the Circle of Willis, Choice C indicates the right MCA {{exhibit_2}}.\n\n(Choices A and B) A stroke due to anterior cerebral artery occlusion can lead to contralateral motor or sensory deficits, which are more pronounced in the lower limb than in the upper limb and face. Urinary incontinence can also be seen due to disruption of the frontal micturition center. Behavioral changes due to dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex can include abulia, emotional disturbances, executive dysfunction, and the appearance of primitive reflexes (eg, grasp reflex).\n\n(Choice D) Occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery would lead to right hemiparesis or hemisensory loss and gaze deviation to the left. In addition, because the left hemisphere is typically dominant, patients with left MCA occlusion often have aphasia.\n\n(Choice E) Occlusion of the basilar artery most often leads to a stroke impacting the pons. Strokes in the brainstem, including the pons, often cause crossed signs of contralateral hemiparesis or hemisensory loss with ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits.\n\nEducational objective:\nA stroke involving the middle cerebral artery often leads to contralateral hemiparesis and/or hemisensory loss. If it is in the nondominant (typically right) hemisphere, hemineglect and an unawareness of the condition are often present; aphasia is absent. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "这位中风患者有以下缺陷，提示大脑皮层特定区域受损：\n\n*   左臂、腿和面部无力（上运动神经元模式——保留面部上半部分，并与手臂和腿部无力发生在同一侧）提示影响对侧（右侧）主要运动皮层的缺陷。\n*   凝视偏向右侧通常是由于影响额叶眼动区（位置与前运动皮层和前额叶皮层重叠）的病变所致。凝视偏向通常指向病变侧，提示右额叶皮层有病变。\n*   左侧忽略是对世界和/或身体左侧的无意识（如该患者的画钟所示），通常是由于非优势半球（右侧）顶叶皮层的病变所致。\n*   失认症是对自身状况的无意识（例如，患者的配偶带他来就诊，但他并不担心），与非优势半球（通常是右侧）顶叶皮层的病变一致。\n\n右额叶后部和右顶叶前部由右侧大脑中动脉 (MCA) 供血，后者起自颈内动脉。在这个威利氏环的正常血管造影中，选项 C 表示右侧 MCA {{exhibit_2}}。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）由于大脑前动脉闭塞导致的中风可导致对侧运动或感觉障碍，这些障碍在下肢比在上肢和面部更明显。由于额叶排尿中枢的破坏，也可出现尿失禁。由于前额叶皮层功能障碍引起的行为改变可包括意愿缺乏、情绪障碍、执行功能障碍以及原始反射的出现（例如，抓握反射）。\n\n（选项 D）左侧大脑中动脉闭塞将导致右侧轻偏瘫或感觉缺失，以及凝视偏向左侧。此外，由于左半球通常占优势，左侧 MCA 闭塞的患者通常会失语。\n\n（选项 E）基底动脉闭塞最常导致影响脑桥的中风。包括脑桥在内的脑干中风通常会导致对侧轻偏瘫或感觉缺失，以及同侧脑神经缺陷。\n\n教育目标：\n涉及大脑中动脉的中风通常会导致对侧轻偏瘫和/或感觉缺失。如果发生在非优势（通常是右侧）半球，通常存在偏瘫和对病情的无意识；无失语。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of stroke localization based on clinical findings, specifically focusing on the deficits associated with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in the non-dominant hemisphere. It requires understanding of the cortical areas supplied by the MCA and the resulting neurological deficits when these areas are affected.\n\nTo solve this question, correlate the patient's symptoms (left hemiparesis, left hemineglect, right gaze preference) with the areas of the brain affected by occlusion of specific arteries. Recognize that right MCA occlusion in the non-dominant hemisphere leads to left-sided deficits and hemineglect.",
