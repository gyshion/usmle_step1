    "en": "A 62-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to acute-onset constipation. His last bowel movement was 4 days ago; before that time, his stools were always regular. Review of systems is positive for dry cough, increasing low back pain, a 9-kg (20-lb) weight loss in the past month, and increasing difficulty with urination. He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. Point tenderness is elicited with palpation over the lower spine. Bilateral lower extremity weakness is present, and sensation is impaired in the perineal region. Chest x-ray reveals a right lung mass {{exhibit_1}}. Dysfunction of which of the following nerves best explains this patient's constipation?",

    "en": "This patient with a lung mass has progressive low back pain, bilateral lower extremity weakness, bowel/bladder dysfunction, and impaired perineal sensation; this presentation is highly concerning for CAUDA EQUINA SYNDROME. The cauda equina is formed from lumbosacral nerve roots which can be compressed by EPIDURAL METASTASIS (most commonly from lung cancer), trauma, or disc herniation. The symptoms of cauda equina syndrome result from disruption of nerve roots to the sciatic nerve (eg, lower extremity weakness, radicular low back pain), pudendal nerve (eg, saddle anesthesia), and/or pelvic splanchnic nerves.\n\nThe PELVIC SPLANCHNIC NERVES (S2-S4) provide PARASYMPATHETIC innervation to the hindgut, bladder, and urinary sphincters that promotes peristalsis, bladder emptying, and pelvic floor relaxation during defecation. CONSTIPATION and DIFFICULTY URINATING are prominent symptoms in cauda equina syndrome due to loss of parasympathetic input to the bowel and bladder.\n\n(Choices A and C) The greater splanchnic nerve (T5-T10) and lesser splanchnic nerve (T9-T12) provide sympathetic innervation to the foregut and midgut, respectively. In contrast to the parasympathetic nervous system, the sympathetic nervous system inhibits the gastrointestinal tract by slowing peristalsis. Disruption of these nerves can lead to increased gut motility, not constipation.\n\n(Choice B) The ilioinguinal nerve (L1) provides sensation to the superior medial thigh and part of the genitals, as well as motor innervation to the transverse abdominus and oblique abdominal musculature. Although it can be affected in cauda equina syndrome, it does not provide sympathetic or parasympathetic innervation to the gastrointestinal system.\n\n(Choice E) The vagus nerve (CN X) originates in the medulla and provides parasympathetic innervation to the proximal gastrointestinal tract, ending at the level of the splenic flexure. Impairment of the vagus nerve is more likely to cause delayed gastric emptying and would not be caused by a lumbosacral spinal cord lesion.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2-S4) provide parasympathetic innervation to the bowel and bladder, and their impairment in cauda equina syndrome can cause constipation and difficulty urinating. Other signs of cauda equina syndrome include radicular low back pain and leg weakness (sciatic nerve) as well as saddle anesthesia (pudendal, ilioinguinal nerves).",
    "zh": "这位有肺部肿块的患者有进行性下背痛、双下肢无力、肠/膀胱功能障碍以及会阴感觉受损；这种表现高度提示马尾综合征。马尾由腰骶神经根构成，可被硬膜外转移（最常见于肺癌）、外伤或椎间盘突出压迫。马尾综合征的症状源于对坐骨神经（例如，下肢无力、放射性下背痛）、阴部神经（例如，鞍区麻木）和/或盆内脏神经的神经根的破坏。\n\n盆内脏神经（S2-S4）向后肠、膀胱和尿道括约肌提供副交感神经支配，促进肠蠕动、膀胱排空和排便时的盆底松弛。便秘和排尿困难是马尾综合征的突出症状，这是由于肠和膀胱失去副交感神经的支配。\n\n（选项 A 和 C）大内脏神经（T5-T10）和小内脏神经（T9-T12）分别向前肠和中肠提供交感神经支配。与副交感神经系统相反，交感神经系统通过减慢肠蠕动来抑制胃肠道。这些神经的破坏可能导致肠道蠕动增加，而不是便秘。\n\n（选项 B）髂腹股沟神经（L1）向大腿上内侧和部分生殖器提供感觉，以及向腹横肌和腹斜肌提供运动神经支配。虽然在马尾综合征中可能受到影响，但它不向胃肠系统提供交感或副交感神经支配。\n\n（选项 E）迷走神经（CN X）起源于延髓，并向近端胃肠道提供副交感神经支配，止于脾曲水平。迷走神经受损更有可能导致胃排空延迟，而不会由腰骶脊髓病变引起。\n\n教育目标：\n盆内脏神经（S2-S4）向肠和膀胱提供副交感神经支配，其在马尾综合征中的损伤可引起便秘和排尿困难。马尾综合征的其他体征包括放射性下背痛和腿部无力（坐骨神经）以及鞍区麻木（阴部神经、髂腹股沟神经）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cauda equina syndrome and the autonomic innervation of the bowel and bladder. Specifically, it assesses the role of the pelvic splanchnic nerves in parasympathetic control of the hindgut and the consequences of their disruption. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of cauda equina syndrome (bowel/bladder dysfunction, saddle anesthesia, lower extremity weakness). Then, recall that the pelvic splanchnic nerves provide parasympathetic innervation to the hindgut, and their dysfunction leads to constipation.",
    "zh": "此题考察对马尾综合征以及肠和膀胱自主神经支配的了解。具体而言，它评估了盆内脏神经在副交感神经对后肠的控制中的作用及其破坏的后果。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要识别马尾综合征的临床表现（肠/膀胱功能障碍、鞍区麻木、下肢无力）。然后，回忆盆内脏神经为后肠提供副交感神经支配，其功能障碍会导致便秘。"
