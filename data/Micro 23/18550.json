    "en": "A 64-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up after a recent hospitalization. Ten days ago, he was admitted due to fever, dysuria, urinary urgency, and perineal pain. Evaluation revealed acute prostatitis, and urine culture was positive for *Escherichia coli* that was sensitive to all tested antibiotics. He received intravenous ciprofloxacin with improvement in his symptoms and was subsequently discharged on oral ciprofloxacin. The patient has been taking the antibiotic as prescribed, but over the past 2 days he has had recurrent fever and dysuria. He takes diltiazem for palpitations, atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and an over-the-counter antacid for frequent heartburn. Temperature is 37.3 C (99.1 F), blood pressure is 116/68 mm Hg, and pulse is 90/min. Physical examination shows a mildly enlarged and tender prostate. Repeat urine culture grows *E coli*. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's recurrent symptoms?",
    "zh": "一名64岁男性因近期住院后的随访来到诊所。十天前，他因发热、排尿困难、尿急和会阴部疼痛而入院。评估显示为急性前列腺炎，尿培养对所有测试的抗生素均呈敏感性的*大肠杆菌*阳性。他接受了静脉注射环丙沙星，症状有所改善，随后出院并口服环丙沙星。患者一直在按处方服用抗生素，但在过去2天里，他出现了反复发热和排尿困难。他服用地尔硫卓治疗心悸、阿托伐他汀治疗高脂血症，并服用非处方抗酸剂治疗频繁的胃灼热。体温为37.3°C (99.1°F)，血压为116/68 mmHg，脉搏为90次/分钟。体格检查显示前列腺轻度增大和触痛。复查尿培养发现*大肠杆菌*。以下哪项最可能是该患者反复出现症状的原因？"

    "en": "This patient has had a relapse of acute prostatitis despite an adequate initial response and good medication adherence. This treatment failure is likely due to a drug-drug interaction with his home medications.\n\nFluoroquinolones normally have very high bioavailability and near-complete absorption. However, they can form insoluble chelate complexes with polyvalent cations (eg, calcium, iron, aluminum, magnesium) in the gastrointestinal tract. This leads to impaired absorption and a significant decrease in drug bioavailability. In this patient's case, his initial response to the antibiotic reflects the parenteral dosing, which bypasses the gastrointestinal tract and avoids this potential interaction.\n\nOver-the-counter antacids typically contain calcium, magnesium, and/or aluminum salts and are used by many patients for treatment of heartburn due to gastroesophageal reflux. Calcium salts (eg, calcium carbonate, calcium citrate) are also widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis. However, since these medications are available without a prescription and are often taken intermittently, the potential for interaction may not be apparent at the time antibiotic treatment is initiated.\n\n(Choice A) Antimicrobial sensitivity testing of this patient's initial culture showed no significant fluoroquinolone resistance. In addition, he had a positive initial clinical response. Loss of effectiveness after changing to an oral formulation is more consistent with decreased bioavailability rather than antibiotic resistance.\n\n(Choice C) Prostatitis due to sexually transmitted organisms is typically seen with *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* and *Chlamydia trachomatis* and is more common with younger rather than older men. Reinfection with *E coli* via sexual contact is unlikely.\n\n(Choice D) Ciprofloxacin is primarily cleared by renal excretion, and the dosage may need to be decreased in patients with significant renal impairment. However, switching this patient from parenteral to oral antibiotic therapy would not affect renal drug clearance.\n\n(Choice E) Diltiazem is a cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) inhibitor (not inducer) that can cause increased systemic levels of numerous drugs, leading to drug toxicity (eg, myopathy due to statins). Regardless, ciprofloxacin is primarily eliminated by renal excretion, and drug levels are unlikely to be significantly affected by P450 inducers.\n\nEducational objective:\nFluoroquinolones can form insoluble chelate complexes with polyvalent cations (eg, calcium, iron, aluminum, magnesium) in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to impaired absorption. This effect can be seen with over-the-counter antacids containing calcium, magnesium, and/or aluminum salts and in patients taking calcium salts (eg, calcium carbonate, calcium citrate) for treatment of osteoporosis.",
    "zh": "尽管初始反应充分且药物依从性良好，该患者的急性前列腺炎仍复发。这种治疗失败很可能是由于与他家庭用药的药物相互作用所致。\n\n氟喹诺酮类药物通常具有非常高的生物利用度，并且几乎完全吸收。然而，它们可以在胃肠道中与多价阳离子（例如，钙、铁、铝、镁）形成不溶性螯合物。这会导致吸收受损，药物生物利用度显着降低。对于该患者，他对抗菌药物的初始反应反映了胃肠外给药，该给药方式绕过了胃肠道，避免了这种潜在的相互作用。\n\n非处方抗酸剂通常含有钙、镁和/或铝盐，许多患者使用它们治疗由胃食管反流引起的胃灼热。钙盐（例如，碳酸钙、柠檬酸钙）也广泛用于治疗骨质疏松症。然而，由于这些药物无需处方即可获得，并且通常间歇性服用，因此在开始抗生素治疗时，相互作用的可能性可能并不明显。\n\n（选项A）该患者初始培养物的抗菌药物敏感性测试未显示出显着的氟喹诺酮耐药性。此外，他有阳性的初始临床反应。从口服制剂改为口服制剂后疗效丧失更符合生物利用度降低而不是耐药性。\n\n（选项C）由性传播病原体引起的前列腺炎通常见于淋病奈瑟菌和沙眼衣原体，并且在年轻人中比老年人中更常见。不太可能通过性接触再次感染*大肠杆菌*。\n\n（选项D）环丙沙星主要通过肾脏排泄清除，对于患有严重肾功能不全的患者，可能需要降低剂量。然而，将该患者从胃肠外给药改为口服抗生素治疗不会影响肾脏药物清除率。\n\n（选项E）地尔硫卓是一种细胞色素P450 (CYP3A4) 抑制剂（而非诱导剂），可导致多种药物的全身水平升高，从而导致药物毒性（例如，他汀类药物引起的肌病）。无论如何，环丙沙星主要通过肾脏排泄清除，药物水平不太可能受到P450诱导剂的显着影响。\n\n教育目标：\n氟喹诺酮类药物可在胃肠道中与多价阳离子（例如，钙、铁、铝、镁）形成不溶性螯合物，从而导致吸收受损。这种影响可见于含有钙、镁和/或铝盐的非处方抗酸剂，以及服用钙盐（例如，碳酸钙、柠檬酸钙）治疗骨质疏松症的患者。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of drug-drug interactions, specifically the interaction between fluoroquinolones and polyvalent cations like calcium, magnesium, and aluminum, which can decrease the bioavailability of the antibiotic. It also tests the understanding of acute prostatitis and its common causes. \n\nThe key to solving this question is to recognize the patient's use of an over-the-counter antacid containing calcium, which can chelate with the oral ciprofloxacin, reducing its absorption and leading to treatment failure. Consider the patient's medication list and potential interactions when evaluating treatment failure.",
