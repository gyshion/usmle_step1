    "en": "A 1-hour-old girl born to a 40-year-old woman is brought to the nursery for evaluation. The pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. Physical examination shows mid-face hypoplasia with a flat nasal bridge, up-slanting palpebral fissures, a small mouth, and a single palmar crease bilaterally. Cardiac auscultation reveals a blowing holosystolic murmur heard best along the sternal border.",

    "en": "The patient has many of the characteristic features of DOWN SYNDROME (DS), a condition that results from an INCREASED GENE DOSAGE effect due to an EXTRA COPY of chromosome 21. Three cytogenetic abnormalities can lead to DS: meiotic nondisjunction, unbalanced translocations, and MOSAICISM. Of the available answer options, only mosaicism is consistent with a THIRD COPY of chromosome 21 existing in at least a portion of the patient's cells.",
    "zh": "该患者具有唐氏综合征 (DS) 的许多特征，这种情况是由于21号染色体的额外拷贝导致基因剂量效应增加所致。三种细胞遗传学异常可导致 DS：减数分裂不分离、不平衡易位和嵌合体。 在可用的答案选项中，只有嵌合体与患者至少部分细胞中存在21号染色体的第三个拷贝一致。"
