    "en": "The QRS complex represents rapid ventricular depolarization and corresponds to phase 0 of the ventricular myocyte action potential. The QT interval represents both ventricular depolarization and repolarization (total duration of ventricular action potential). However, since ventricular depolarization (QRS duration) contributes only a small amount of time to the interval, the QT interval is primarily a measure of ventricular repolarization.\n\nVentricular depolarization occurs due to the opening of voltage-dependent sodium channels. In general, class I antiarrhythmics act by blocking these channels, inhibiting the initial depolarization and prolonging QRS duration. Specific actions are as follows:\n\n* Class 1A (eg, procainamide) drugs have intermediate sodium channel blocking activity that increases QRS duration. Their moderate potassium channel-blocking activity also causes significant QT interval prolongation.\n* Class 1B drugs (eg, lidocaine) have no significant effect on the QRS duration and do not prolong the QT interval due to their rapid dissociation from the receptor.\n* Class IC drugs (eg, flecainide, propafenone) are strong sodium channel blockers that prolong QRS duration in a rate-dependent manner. The QT interval may become slightly prolonged due to QRS widening.\n\n(Choice A) Antiarrhythmic drugs do not affect phase 4 of the myocyte action potential, but they can affect phase 4 of the pacemaker cell action potential, which is characterized by slow depolarization due to sodium influx.\n\n(Choice C) Phase 1 of the myocyte action potential refers to a brief period of repolarization caused by a sharp decrease in sodium conductance and an increase in potassium permeability. It is not modulated to an appreciable extent by antiarrhythmic medications.\n\n(Choice D) Calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) inhibit the L-type calcium channels during phase 2 depolarization of the myocardial action potential with additional effects on cardiac slow response tissue. They slow the sinus rate, prolong conduction through the atrioventricular node, and depress myocardial contractility (negative inotropic effect).\n\n(Choice E) Class III antiarrhythmic drugs (eg, amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide) predominantly block potassium channels and inhibit the outward repolarizing currents during phase 3 of the myocyte action potential. This leads to increased action potential duration and QT interval prolongation.\n\nEducational objective:\nClass IC antiarrhythmic agents (flecainide) block the fast sodium channels responsible for ventricular depolarization (phase 0), prolonging QRS duration with little effect on the QT interval. Class 1A and class III agents cause the most QT prolongation.",
    "zh": "QRS波群代表快速的心室去极化，对应于心室肌细胞动作电位的0期。QT间期代表心室去极化和复极化（心室动作电位的总持续时间）。然而，由于心室去极化（QRS时限）对间期的贡献很小，QT间期主要衡量的是心室复极化。\n\n心室去极化是由于电压依赖性钠离子通道的开放而发生的。一般来说，I类抗心律失常药通过阻断这些通道来发挥作用，抑制初始去极化并延长QRS时限。具体作用如下：\n\n* I A类（如普鲁卡因酰胺）药物具有中度的钠通道阻滞活性，可增加QRS时限。它们的中度钾通道阻滞活性也会导致显著的QT间期延长。\n* I B类药物（如利多卡因）对QRS时限没有显著影响，并且由于它们与受体的快速解离，不会延长QT间期。\n* I C类药物（如氟卡尼，普罗帕酮）是强效的钠通道阻滞剂，以依赖于速率的方式延长QRS时限。由于QRS波群增宽，QT间期可能会略有延长。\n\n（选项A）抗心律失常药物不影响心肌细胞动作电位的4期，但它们可以影响起搏细胞动作电位的4期，其特征是由于钠内流引起的缓慢去极化。\n\n（选项C）心肌细胞动作电位的1期是指由钠电导急剧下降和钾通透性增加引起的短暂复极化期。它不受抗心律失常药物的明显调节。\n\n（选项D）钙通道阻滞剂（如维拉帕米、地尔硫卓）在心肌动作电位的2期去极化期间抑制L型钙通道，并对心脏慢反应组织产生额外的影响。它们减慢窦性心率，延长通过房室结的传导，并抑制心肌收缩力（负性肌力作用）。\n\n（选项E）III类抗心律失常药物（如胺碘酮、索他洛尔、多非利特）主要阻滞钾通道，抑制心肌细胞动作电位3期期间向外的复极化电流。这会导致动作电位持续时间增加和QT间期延长。\n\n教学目标：\nI C类抗心律失常药物（氟卡尼）阻断负责心室去极化（0期）的快速钠通道，延长QRS时限，对QT间期的影响很小。1A类和3类药物会导致最显著的QT间期延长。"
