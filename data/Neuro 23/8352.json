Two hours earlier, he ate fish at a new Japanese restaurant. Neurological examination shows reduced muscle strength and decreased deep-tendon reflexes. Which of the following parts of the action potential curve is most likely impaired in this patient?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's symptoms of weakness, dizziness, paresthesias, and decreased reflexes, along with a history of eating fish at a Japanese restaurant, are highly suggestive of tetrodotoxin poisoning. Tetrodotoxin is a potent neurotoxin found in pufferfish that binds to voltage-gated sodium channels, preventing sodium influx and depolarization. This impairment of sodium influx directly affects the rising phase of the action potential, which is represented by segment B in the provided curve. Segment B corresponds to the rapid depolarization of the membrane due to the influx of sodium ions. If sodium channels are blocked, this influx will be inhibited, leading to a blunted or absent rising phase of the action potential. Choice A represents the resting potential, which is maintained by potassium efflux. Choice C represents the overshoot, where the membrane potential becomes positive due to sodium influx. Choice D represents repolarization, which is primarily mediated by potassium efflux. Choice E represents hyperpolarization, which occurs briefly after repolarization. Therefore, the impairment of sodium influx due to tetrodotoxin poisoning would most directly affect segment B of the action potential curve.",
    "zh": "患者的无力、头晕、感觉异常和反射减退等症状，以及在日本餐厅吃鱼的病史，高度提示河豚毒素中毒。河豚毒素是一种存在于河豚中的强效神经毒素，可与电压门控钠离子通道结合，阻止钠离子内流和去极化。这种钠离子内流的损害直接影响动作电位的上升期，这由提供的曲线中的B段表示。B段对应于由于钠离子内流引起的膜的快速去极化。如果钠离子通道被阻断，这种内流将被抑制，导致动作电位的上升期减弱或缺失。选项A代表静息电位，由钾离子外流维持。选项C代表超调，其中膜电位由于钠离子内流而变为正值。选项D代表复极化，主要由钾离子外流介导。选项E代表超极化，发生在复极化后不久。因此，河豚毒素中毒引起的钠离子内流受损将最直接地影响动作电位曲线的B段。"
