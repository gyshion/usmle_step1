    "en": "A 10-year-old boy is brought to the clinic due to stiffness and weakness in his hands. A few weeks ago, the parents first noticed that the child was having trouble letting go of his toothbrush after brushing his teeth. The patient's teacher has also mentioned that the boy seems to have difficulty maintaining a firm grip on his pencil when doing schoolwork. He has a history of intellectual disability and takes no medications. Examination shows bilateral cataracts. Laboratory evaluation shows unstable cytosine-thymine-guanine trinucleotide repeats, resulting in the transcription and accumulation of untranslatable mutant mRNAs, which negatively affect cellular function. Which of the following cell types is likely to be most affected by this patient's condition?",

    "en": "This patient has myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), an autosomal dominant muscular dystrophy characterized by unstable expansion of cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) trinucleotide repeats in the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene. This disorder particularly affects the brain, skeletal muscles, and myocardium, and the pathophysiology is likely due to toxic effects of mutant mRNAs with expanded CTG repeats.\n\nFollowing transcription, the mutant mRNAs are not translated. Rather, they form hairpin structures and accumulate in the nucleus. The mutant mRNAs bind and sequester RNA-binding proteins such as muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins. These proteins normally play a role in mRNA splicing, and as more MBNL proteins are sequestered in the nucleus, aberrant splicing occurs, resulting in dysfunctional protein products.\n\nPatients with DM1 demonstrate somatic mosaicism. The CTG expansion is notably unstable in nondividing cells, including skeletal muscle, the brain, and myocardium (repeat lengths are several-fold longer in these cells). In addition, cellular mRNA content decreases with mitosis and increases when the cell is not dividing, therefore, cells that remain senescent (eg, myocardial cells) tend to accumulate more mutant mRNAs over time. These processes help explain why patients with DM1 are more likely to develop symptoms as they age, such as cardiac conduction disturbances.\n\n(Choices A, B, C, and E) CTG trinucleotide repeats are present in other cells in DM1 patients. However, the proliferating cells (ie, airway basal cells, erythroblasts, intestinal epithelial cells, osteogenic cells) are not typically affected in DM1. This may be due to having more stable and shorter CTG repeats, along with having less accumulation of mutant mRNAs compared to nondividing cells.\n\nEducational objective: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is due to a cytosine-thymine-guanine trinucleotide repeat expansion in the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene, resulting in untranslatable mutant mRNAs. The mutant mRNAs form hairpin structures and accumulate in the nucleus, sequestering certain RNA-binding proteins and leading to aberrant splicing. Nondividing cells of the brain, skeletal muscles, and myocardium are particularly affected.",
    "zh": "该患者患有1型强直性肌营养不良症 (DM1)，这是一种常染色体显性遗传性肌营养不良症，其特征在于肌强直蛋白激酶 (DMPK) 基因中胞嘧啶-胸腺嘧啶-鸟嘌呤 (CTG) 三核苷酸重复序列的不稳定扩增。这种疾病特别影响大脑、骨骼肌和心肌，其病理生理学可能归因于具有扩增的CTG重复序列的突变mRNA的毒性作用。\n\n转录后，突变mRNA不会被翻译。相反，它们形成发夹结构并在细胞核中积累。突变mRNA与RNA结合蛋白结合并隔离，例如肌肉盲样 (MBNL) 蛋白。这些蛋白通常在mRNA剪接中起作用，并且随着越来越多的MBNL蛋白被隔离在细胞核中，发生异常剪接，导致功能失调的蛋白质产物。\n\nDM1患者表现出体细胞镶嵌现象。CTG扩增在非分裂细胞中尤为不稳定，包括骨骼肌、大脑和心肌（在这些细胞中，重复序列长度要长几倍）。此外，细胞mRNA含量随着有丝分裂而减少，并在细胞不分裂时增加，因此，保持衰老的细胞（例如，心肌细胞）往往会随着时间的推移积累更多的突变mRNA。这些过程有助于解释为什么DM1患者随着年龄的增长更容易出现症状，例如心脏传导障碍。\n\n(选项 A、B、C 和 E) CTG三核苷酸重复序列存在于DM1患者的其他细胞中。然而，增殖细胞（即，气道基底细胞、成红细胞、肠上皮细胞、成骨细胞）通常不会受到DM1的影响。这可能是由于具有更稳定和更短的CTG重复序列，以及与非分裂细胞相比，突变mRNA的积累较少。\n\n教育目标：1型强直性肌营养不良症是由于肌强直蛋白激酶 (DMPK) 基因中的胞嘧啶-胸腺嘧啶-鸟嘌呤三核苷酸重复序列扩增引起的，导致不可翻译的突变mRNA。突变mRNA形成发夹结构并在细胞核中积累，隔离某些RNA结合蛋白并导致异常剪接。大脑、骨骼肌和心肌的非分裂细胞特别受到影响。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology of myotonic dystrophy type 1, specifically focusing on the cellular mechanisms of CTG repeat expansion and its differential impact on dividing versus nondividing cells. It assesses the ability to correlate genetic defects with clinical manifestations in specific organ systems.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the underlying genetic defect (CTG repeat expansion) and understand how it leads to toxic mRNA accumulation and aberrant splicing. The key is to recognize that nondividing cells, such as myocardial cells, are disproportionately affected due to the instability of the repeat expansion and the accumulation of mutant mRNAs over time, leading to more severe cellular dysfunction.",
