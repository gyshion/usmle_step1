    "en": "This patient's x-ray {{exhibit_2}} shows the distal end of the orogastric tube at the level of the proximal esophagus, a finding consistent with esophageal atresia, or a blind-ending esophageal pouch.\n\nAlmost all cases of esophageal atresia are associated with a tracheoesophageal fistula, a congenital anomaly resulting from improper division of the foregut during early gestation. These defects can present in various arrangements, the most common of which is proximal esophageal atresia with a fistula between the trachea and distal esophagus. The condition is often isolated, but up to half of patients have associated anomalies (eg, VACTERL association).\n\nPrenatal ultrasonography usually reveals polyhydramnios because the fetus cannot swallow amniotic fluid. Immediately after birth, neonates exhibit excessive drooling as well as coughing and regurgitation with feeding attempts due to aspiration of breast milk/formula from the esophageal pouch into the proximal trachea. In addition, refluxed digestive fluids from the stomach can enter the trachea through the fistula, resulting in respiratory distress and episodic cyanosis.\n\nInability to pass a feeding tube into the stomach and the presence of the enteric tube tip in the proximal esophagus on x-ray are diagnostic.\n\n(Choice A) Bilateral choanal atresia, or bony/membranous obstruction of the posterior nasal cavity, presents with cyanosis during feeding that improves with crying. Inability to pass a catheter through the nares (eg, nasogastric tube) is characteristic, but an orogastric tube would pass from the mouth through the esophagus and into the stomach.\n\n(Choice C) Congenital diaphragmatic hernia presents with cyanosis and respiratory distress immediately after birth. However, characteristic x-ray findings include bowel in the thorax, a displaced cardiac silhouette, and a gasless abdomen {{exhibit_3}}.\n\n(Choices D and E) Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), a defect that includes right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and transposition of the great arteries (TGA), or parallel pulmonary and systemic circulations, often present with neonatal cyanosis. However, an enteric tube would pass into the stomach with either condition {{exhibit_4}}.\n\nEducational objective:\nTracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia typically presents in the immediate newborn period with choking/coughing with feeding. A feeding tube cannot be passed into the stomach; curling of the distal end of the enteric tube in the proximal esophagus on x-ray is diagnostic {{exhibit_5}}. {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}",
    "zh": "该患者的 X 光片 {{exhibit_2}} 显示经口胃管的远端位于近端食管水平，这与食管闭锁或食管盲端一致。\n\n几乎所有食管闭锁病例都伴有气管食管瘘，这是一种先天性异常，是妊娠早期前肠不正确分裂的结果。这些缺陷可以以各种形式出现，最常见的是近端食管闭锁，并伴有气管和远端食管之间的瘘管。这种情况通常是孤立的，但多达一半的患者伴有相关异常（例如，VACTERL 联合征）。\n\n产前超声检查通常显示羊水过多，因为胎儿无法吞咽羊水。出生后，新生儿表现出过多的流口水以及喂养尝试时的咳嗽和反流，这是由于食管盲端内的母乳/配方奶吸入近端气管所致。此外，来自胃部的反流消化液可以通过瘘管进入气管，导致呼吸窘迫和发作性发绀。\n\n无法将喂养管插入胃中以及 X 光片上肠管尖端存在于近端食管中具有诊断意义。\n\n（选项 A）双侧后鼻孔闭锁，即后鼻腔的骨性/膜性阻塞，表现为喂养期间出现发绀，哭泣后改善。无法通过鼻孔插入导管（例如，鼻胃管）是其特征，但经口胃管将从口腔穿过食管进入胃中。\n\n（选项 C）先天性膈疝表现为出生后立即出现发绀和呼吸窘迫。然而，特征性 X 光表现包括胸腔内肠道、心脏阴影移位和无气腹 {{exhibit_3}}。\n\n（选项 D 和 E）法洛四联症 (TOF)（一种包括右心室流出道梗阻的缺陷）和大动脉转位 (TGA) 或肺循环和体循环平行，通常表现为新生儿发绀。然而，肠管将通过任一情况进入胃 {{exhibit_4}}。\n\n教育目标：\n食管闭锁伴气管食管瘘通常在新生儿期立即表现为喂养时呛咳。喂养管无法插入胃中；X 光片上肠管远端在近端食管内卷曲具有诊断意义 {{exhibit_5}}。{{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula, including clinical presentation, diagnostic findings, and associated anomalies. It requires recognizing the radiographic finding of a feeding tube coiled in the proximal esophagus.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the newborn's symptoms (respiratory distress, cyanosis), the placement of the orogastric tube, and the radiographic findings. Rule out other causes of neonatal respiratory distress based on their typical presentations and radiographic features.",
