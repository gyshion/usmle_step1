    "en": "The arrow in the above CT scan points to an extraocular muscle that originates at the annular tendon and inserts onto the temporal (ie, lateral) surface of the globe. The extraocular muscles control movement of the globe; dysfunction leads to double vision. They are innervated by the following:\n\n*   The oculomotor nerve (CN III) innervates the superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, inferior oblique, and levator palpebrae superioris. It also contributes parasympathetic innervation to the ciliary muscle and iris sphincter for the efferent path of the pupillary reflex (Choice B).\n*   The trochlear nerve (CN IV) innervates only the superior oblique muscle, which causes the eye to intort (internally rotate) and depress while adducted (Choice C).\n*   The abducens nerve (CN VI) innervates the lateral rectus muscle, which abducts the eye.\n\nAcute sinusitis can have significant complications, including CAVERNOUS SINUS THROMBOSIS due to contiguous spread of an infection through the valveless facial venous system. This can cause dysfunction of nerves that travel through the cavernous sinus, including those that innervate the extraocular muscles.\n\n(Choice A) The optic nerve (CN II) transmits visual information to the brain; damage to this nerve causes loss of vision. The optic nerve has no role in movement of the globe.\n\n(Choice D) The ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) conveys sensory information from the forehead, side of the nose, periorbital area, and cornea. It does not contribute motor innervation to the extraocular muscles.\n\nEducational objective: The abducens nerve (CN VI) innervates the lateral rectus muscle, which originates at the annular tendon and inserts on the temporal (ie, lateral) surface of the globe. It functions to abduct the eye. {{exhibit_2}}{{exhibit_3}}{{exhibit_4}}{{exhibit_5}}{{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "上述CT扫描中的箭头指向一条眼外肌，该肌起自环状腱，并附着于眼球的颞侧（即外侧）表面。眼外肌控制眼球的运动；功能障碍会导致复视。它们由以下神经支配：\n\n*   动眼神经（CN III）支配上直肌、内直肌、下直肌、下斜肌和上睑提肌。它还为睫状肌和虹膜括约肌提供副交感神经支配，用于瞳孔反射的传出通路（选项B）。\n*   滑车神经（CN IV）仅支配上斜肌，上斜肌使眼睛在内收时内旋（内旋）和下压（选项C）。\n*   外展神经（CN VI）支配外直肌，外直肌使眼睛外展。\n\n急性鼻窦炎可能出现严重的并发症，包括海绵窦血栓形成，这是由于感染通过无瓣膜的面静脉系统蔓延所致。这可能导致穿过海绵窦的神经功能障碍，包括支配眼外肌的神经。\n\n（选项 A）视神经（CN II）将视觉信息传递到大脑；该神经的损伤会导致视力丧失。视神经在眼球运动中没有作用。\n\n（选项 D）三叉神经的眼支（CN V）传递来自额头、鼻侧、眶周区域和角膜的感官信息。它不为眼外肌提供运动神经支配。\n\n教学目标：外展神经（CN VI）支配外直肌，该肌起自环状腱，并附着于眼球的颞侧（即外侧）表面。其功能是外展眼球。{{exhibit_2}}{{exhibit_3}}{{exhibit_4}}{{exhibit_5}}{{exhibit_6}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cranial nerve anatomy, specifically the innervation of extraocular muscles, and the complications of acute sinusitis, such as cavernous sinus thrombosis. It also assesses the ability to correlate clinical findings (headache, double vision, muscle weakness) with the affected cranial nerve.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the affected muscle (lateral rectus) based on the CT scan and clinical description. Recall which cranial nerve innervates the lateral rectus muscle (abducens nerve). Consider the potential for cavernous sinus thrombosis due to sinusitis affecting multiple cranial nerves.",
    "zh": "此题考察对脑神经解剖学的知识，特别是眼外肌的神经支配，以及急性鼻窦炎的并发症，如海绵窦血栓形成。它还评估将临床发现（头痛、复视、肌肉无力）与受累颅神经相关联的能力。\n\n要解决这个问题，请根据CT扫描和临床描述确定受累肌肉（外直肌）。回想一下哪条颅神经支配外直肌（外展神经）。考虑鼻窦炎引起的海绵窦血栓形成的潜力，因为它会影响多条颅神经。"
