    "en": "A 46-year-old man presents to your office with a slowly growing neck mass. The mass is stony hard on palpation and seems to be fixed to the adjacent tissues. After initial evaluation, combination chemotherapy is prescribed to the patient. Several weeks later the mass significantly decreases in size, and biopsy demonstrates many shrunken eosinophilic cells within the tumor. Which of the following substances released from mitochondria most likely triggered the observed cellular changes?",

    "en": "Apoptosis is a means of carefully regulated cell death in which the cell activates enzymes to degrade its own nuclear DNA and proteins. Although the cell membrane remains intact during apoptosis, the cell becomes an appealing target for phagocytosis. Because no cell contents are leaked into the surrounding tissue, there is no associated inflammation.\n\nThe process of apoptosis is separated into an initiation phase and an execution phase. During the initiation phase, protein-hydrolyzing caspases are activated. In the execution phase, these caspases bring about the cell death by cleaving cellular proteins and activating DNases.\n\nThe initiation of apoptosis occurs via signals from two separate pathways: the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway and the extrinsic (death receptor) pathway. In the intrinsic pathway, the mitochondria become more permeable and pro-apoptotic substances are released into the cytoplasm in response to stress or the cessation of survival signals. Once the cell is exposed to stress or the cessation of survival signals, the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x that reside in the mitochondrial membranes and cytoplasm are replaced with pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bak, Bax, and Bim. The pro-apoptotic proteins allow for the increased permeability of the mitochondria, which results in the release of caspase-activating substances like cytochrome c.\n\n(Choice A) Hemosiderin accumulation is common in patients who have hemolytic anemia or who undergo frequent blood transfusions. It is not associated with apoptosis.\n\n(Choice B) The extrinsic pathway requires engagement of death receptors on the cell surface. These death receptors are in the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, with the type 1 TNF receptor (TNFR1) and a related protein named Fas (CD95) the two best known members of this family. After cross-linkage of Fas with its ligand, multiple molecules of Fas come together to form a binding site for a death-domain containing adapter protein called FADD. FADD then binds an inactive form of a caspase, again bringing multiple caspase proteins together that through a cascade effect eventually induce caspase activation.\n\n(Choice D) Succinate dehydrogenase is a mitochondrial enzyme in the electron transport chain that acts by oxidizing succinate into fumarate and reducing FAD to FADH2. This enzyme is not involved in apoptosis.\n\n(Choice E) Superoxide dismutase catalyzes the reduction of superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide. This enzyme is not involved in apoptosis.\n\n(Choice F) Lipoxygenase plays a key role in the synthesis of leukotrienes, a class of inflammatory mediators.\n\nEducational Objective:\nCytochrome c is a mitochondrial enzyme that activates caspases and indirectly brings about cell death through intrinsic pathway apoptosis.",
    "zh": "细胞凋亡是一种精心调控的细胞死亡方式，细胞激活酶以降解其自身的核DNA和蛋白质。尽管细胞膜在细胞凋亡过程中保持完整，但细胞成为吞噬作用的有吸引力的靶标。由于没有细胞内容物泄漏到周围组织中，因此没有相关的炎症。\n\n细胞凋亡过程分为起始阶段和执行阶段。在起始阶段，蛋白水解酶半胱天冬酶被激活。在执行阶段，这些半胱天冬酶通过切割细胞蛋白质和激活DNase来引起细胞死亡。\n\n细胞凋亡的启动通过来自两个独立途径的信号发生：内在（线粒体）途径和外在（死亡受体）途径。在内在途径中，线粒体变得更具通透性，并且响应于应激或生存信号的停止，促凋亡物质被释放到细胞质中。一旦细胞暴露于应激或生存信号的停止，驻留在线粒体膜和细胞质中的抗凋亡蛋白Bcl-2和Bcl-x被促凋亡蛋白（如Bak、Bax和Bim）取代。促凋亡蛋白允许线粒体通透性增加，这导致了半胱天冬酶激活物质（如细胞色素c）的释放。\n\n（选项A）血铁黄素的积聚常见于患有溶血性贫血或经常接受输血的患者。它与细胞凋亡无关。\n\n（选项B）外在途径需要细胞表面死亡受体的参与。这些死亡受体属于肿瘤坏死因子受体家族，其中1型TNF受体（TNFR1）和一种名为Fas（CD95）的相关蛋白是该家族中最著名的两个成员。在Fas与其配体交联后，多个Fas分子聚集在一起形成一个死亡结构域包含适配器蛋白FADD的结合位点。FADD然后结合一种非活化形式的半胱天冬酶，再次将多个半胱天冬酶蛋白聚集在一起，通过级联效应最终诱导半胱天冬酶的激活。\n\n（选项D）琥珀酸脱氢酶是电子传递链中的一种线粒体酶，通过将琥珀酸氧化成延胡索酸并将FAD还原成FADH2发挥作用。该酶不参与细胞凋亡。\n\n（选项E）超氧化物歧化酶催化超氧阴离子还原为过氧化氢。该酶不参与细胞凋亡。\n\n（选项F）脂氧合酶在白三烯（一类炎症介质）的合成中起关键作用。\n\n教学目标：细胞色素c是一种线粒体酶，可激活半胱天冬酶并通过内在途径凋亡间接引起细胞死亡。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, specifically the role of mitochondrial release of cytochrome c in triggering programmed cell death. It assesses knowledge of the cellular mechanisms involved in chemotherapy-induced cell death.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the cellular changes described (shrunken eosinophilic cells) as indicative of apoptosis. Then, recall the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, which involves the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to activate caspases, leading to cell death. Evaluate each option based on its known role in cellular processes, particularly apoptosis.",
