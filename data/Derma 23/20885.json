    "en": "A 48-year-old woman comes to the office 10 days after undergoing breast reduction surgery. She feels well overall and is taking acetaminophen as needed for pain control. Vital signs are normal. Examination of the breasts reveals intact surgical incisions without drainage; the incisions are pink, shiny, and slightly warm. The surrounding skin has mild edema but no erythema. Which of the following wound healing processes is most likely occurring at this time?",
    "zh": "一名48岁女性在接受缩乳手术10天后来到诊所就诊。她总体感觉良好，并根据需要服用对乙酰氨基酚来控制疼痛。生命体征正常。乳房检查显示手术切口完整，无引流；切口呈粉红色，有光泽，略微温暖。周围皮肤有轻度水肿但无红斑。以下哪种伤口愈合过程最有可能在此期间发生？"

    "en": "Ten days after surgery, the patent's intact, healing surgical incisions are most likely undergoing a type of neovascularization called ANGIOGENESIS, the process by which new blood vessels sprout and grow into the wound from surrounding, uninjured vessels.\n\nAngiogenesis primarily occurs during the proliferation phase of wound healing, which begins around day 3 (overlapping with the end of the inflammatory phase) and lasts approximately 5 weeks. During the proliferation phase, fibroblasts multiply and synthesize ground substance and type III collagen, which form an amorphous gel into which new capillaries can grow. In addition, fibroblasts secrete fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, which stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation—leading to the formation of new capillaries.\n\nBy increasing the number of capillaries within the healing surgical incision, angiogenesis increases blood flow to the area, causing the pink and slightly warm characteristics of the wound at this stage. The incision's newly formed epithelium (ie, reepithelialization) typically has a shiny appearance as well. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices A and C) Degranulation of mast cells and infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes occur during the inflammation phase, which starts within hours of the injury and lasts approximately 5 days. During this phase, there is often moderate edema, redness, and/or warmth of the wound and nearby soft tissues due to high levels of inflammatory mediators (eg, IL-1, TNF-alpha). In contrast, this patient's wound is 10 days out from surgery and most likely in the proliferation phase.\n\n(Choice B) Extensive collagen crosslinking, which increases the tensile strength of the wound, occurs during the final phase of wound healing, maturation. Maturation typically occurs between 3 weeks and 1-2 years (not 10 days post-surgery).\n\n(Choice E) Collagen synthesis begins during the proliferation phase, along with angiogenesis. However, fibroblasts predominantly synthesize type III collagen; type III collagen is then replaced with type I collagen during the maturation phase. Type II collagen is primarily found in articular and hyaline cartilage rather than the skin. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "手术后十天，患者完整的、正在愈合的手术切口最有可能正在经历一种称为血管生成的血管新生，这是一个新的血管从周围未受伤的血管中萌芽并长入伤口的过程。\n\n血管生成主要发生在伤口愈合的增殖期，增殖期大约从第3天开始（与炎症期结束重叠），持续约5周。在增殖期，成纤维细胞增殖并合成基质和III型胶原蛋白，形成一种无定形凝胶，新的毛细血管可以在其中生长。此外，成纤维细胞分泌成纤维细胞生长因子和血管内皮生长因子，刺激内皮细胞增殖、迁移和分化，从而形成新的毛细血管。\n\n通过增加愈合手术切口内的毛细血管数量，血管生成增加了该区域的血流量，导致此阶段伤口呈粉红色且略微温暖的特征。切口新形成的表皮（即，再上皮化）也通常具有有光泽的外观。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项 A 和 C）肥大细胞脱颗粒和多形核白细胞浸润发生在炎症期，炎症期在损伤发生后几小时内开始，持续约 5 天。在此阶段，由于高水平的炎症介质（例如，IL-1、TNF-α），伤口和附近软组织通常会出现中度水肿、发红和/或发热。相比之下，该患者的伤口已接受手术10天，最有可能处于增殖期。\n\n（选项 B）大量胶原蛋白交联，增加了伤口的抗张强度，发生在伤口愈合的最后阶段，即成熟期。成熟期通常发生在术后 3 周到 1-2 年之间（而非术后 10 天）。\n\n（选项 E）胶原蛋白的合成与血管生成同时开始于增殖期。然而，成纤维细胞主要合成 III 型胶原蛋白；III 型胶原蛋白随后在成熟期被 I 型胶原蛋白取代。II 型胶原蛋白主要存在于关节软骨和透明软骨中，而不是皮肤中。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the phases of wound healing, specifically the proliferation phase and the process of angiogenesis. It requires understanding the timeline of wound healing and the cellular events occurring in each phase.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the time frame (10 days post-surgery) and correlate it with the appropriate phase of wound healing. Recognize that angiogenesis and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells are characteristic of the proliferation phase, which occurs approximately 3-5 days after injury.",
