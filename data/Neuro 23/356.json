    "en": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother due to seizures, which are usually characterized by a blank stare and lip-smacking followed by generalized shaking. The patient occasionally bites his tongue during the episodes and feels confused afterward. The seizures have been refractory to various antiepileptic medications, and lamotrigine is prescribed. The patient should be instructed to seek medical care immediately if which of the following symptoms occurs?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Lamotrigine is an antiseizure medication that works by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels. It can be used to treat focal and generalized seizures and is also effective for bipolar disorder. Patients using lamotrigine often develop a benign rash; however, a potentially life-threatening rash due to STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME (SJS) or TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS (TEN) can also occur, particularly children.\n\nSJS and TEN represent different end points along the same disease continuum: SJS manifests with skin detachment involving <10% of the body surface area; TEN has >30% involvement. Patients with SJS/TEN typically develop flu-like symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, myalgia), followed by extensive cutaneous and mucosal lesions. Histopathologically, lesions are characterized by epidermal necrosis and subepidermal bullae.\n\nThe first appearance of any rash requires discontinuation of the drug immediately because SJS/TEN and benign rash cannot be distinguished reliably. Other antiseizure medications associated with SJS/TEN include carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin.\n\n(Choices A and C) Gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea) are relatively common with metformin, as well as some antiseizure medications, but are usually not life-threatening.\n\n(Choice B) ACE inhibitors can cause a nonproductive cough secondary to elevated bradykinin and substance P levels; this adverse effect can be mitigated by switching to an angiotensin II receptor blocker.\n\n(Choice D) Gingival hyperplasia is a common adverse effect of phenytoin, appearing in about half of patients who have been taking the medication for 3-4 months. It occurs due to increased expression of platelet-derived growth factor, which causes the proliferation of gingival cells.\n\n(Choice F) Red-orange urinary discoloration is a harmless side effect of rifampin, a medication used for the treatment of tuberculosis.\n\nEducational objective:\nLamotrigine can be used to treat focal and generalized seizures and works by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels. Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis is a rare, life-threatening adverse effect characterized by flu-like symptoms followed by widespread mucocutaneous epidermal necrosis.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the adverse effects of lamotrigine, specifically the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). It requires recognizing that a new skin rash in a patient taking lamotrigine warrants immediate medical attention due to the potential for these severe reactions.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to recall the serious dermatologic side effects associated with lamotrigine. Consider the potential for life-threatening conditions like SJS/TEN when evaluating new symptoms in patients on this medication, and prioritize symptoms that could indicate these conditions.",
