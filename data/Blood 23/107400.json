  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Peripheral blood smear is shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_2}}. These findings should raise clinical suspicion for ineffective hematopoiesis due to limited dietary folate or vitamin B12.\n\nBoth folate and vitamin B12 are essential cofactors in the generation of pyrimidine and purine nucleic acids; deficiency is marked by slow nuclear maturation in hematopoietic cells, which manifests as hypersegmented neutrophils and macrocytic erythrocytes on peripheral blood smear. The macrocyte cell membrane is somewhat fragile compared with that of normocytic red blood cells. As a result, patients often develop mild hemolysis due to increased intravascular and reticuloendothelial erythrocyte destruction, leading to mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and scleral icterus.\n\n(Choice A) Patients with aplastic anemia have leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in addition to anemia. Although chronic alcohol use can cause bone marrow suppression due to toxic effects on hematopoietic stem cells, severe leukopenia or thrombocytopenia is rare.\n\n(Choice B) Chronic blood loss causes iron deficiency, which leads to normocytic (early) or microcytic (late) anemia. In contrast, the presence of macrocytic anemia and hypersegmented neutrophils indicates megaloblastic anemia, which is caused by folate and vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\n(Choice D) This patient's low reticulocyte count indicates that the bone marrow is unable to appropriately accelerate erythrocyte production in response to his anemia. In contrast, when anemia is due primarily to peripheral hemolysis, reticulocyte is elevated as a result of rapid mobilization of maturing bone marrow erythrocytes.\n\nEducational objective:\nFolate is essential for nucleic acid metabolism, and deficiency causes ineffective hematopoiesis with a low reticulocyte count. Characteristic megaloblastic changes include hypersegmented neutrophils and macrocytic red blood cells. Macrocytic erythrocytes are prone to hemolysis, which can increase serum bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase.",
    "zh": "外周血涂片见于图 {{exhibit_2}}。这些发现应引起临床对由于膳食叶酸或维生素B12摄入不足导致的无效造血的怀疑。\n\n叶酸和维生素B12都是嘧啶和嘌呤核酸生成的重要辅助因子；缺乏症的特征是造血细胞核成熟缓慢，在外周血涂片上表现为核过度分叶的中性粒细胞和大红细胞。与正细胞红细胞相比，大红细胞的细胞膜较为脆弱。因此，患者常因血管内和网状内皮红细胞破坏增加而发生轻度溶血，导致轻度非结合型高胆红素血症、乳酸脱氢酶升高和巩膜黄染。\n\n(选项A) 再生障碍性贫血患者除贫血外，还有白细胞减少症和血小板减少症。虽然长期饮酒会导致骨髓抑制，原因是其对造血干细胞的毒性作用，但严重的白细胞减少症或血小板减少症很少见。\n\n(选项B) 慢性失血会导致缺铁，进而导致正细胞性（早期）或小细胞性（晚期）贫血。相反，巨幼细胞性贫血的特征是出现大细胞性贫血和核过度分叶的中性粒细胞，这是由叶酸和维生素B12缺乏引起的。\n\n(选项D) 该患者的网织红细胞计数低表明骨髓无法适当地加速红细胞生成以应对其贫血。相反，当贫血主要由于外周溶血引起时，网织红细胞会升高，这是由于成熟的骨髓红细胞快速动员的结果。\n\n教育目的：\n叶酸对核酸代谢至关重要，缺乏症会导致无效造血，并伴有网织红细胞计数低。特征性的巨幼细胞性改变包括核过度分叶的中性粒细胞和大红细胞。大细胞红细胞易发生溶血，这会增加血清胆红素和乳酸脱氢酶。"
