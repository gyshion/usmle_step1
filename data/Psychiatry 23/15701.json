The pain resolves within 10 minutes without treatment, and the patient reports, \"I was taking the bus home from work when my chest started feeling really tight. I'm lucky my friend was there and able to help me get to the hospital. What if she's not there next time?\" She describes experiencing similar episodes at random places and times that are characterized by a pounding heart, trembling, dizziness, and sweating.

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient likely has PANIC DISORDER, which presents with distressing cardiopulmonary/neurologic symptoms that reach their peak level of intensity in 10 minutes or less and then subside. Due to the intensity of the symptoms and their tendency to mimic a heart attack, patients may fear they are dying and seek treatment in the emergency department.\n\nPatients with panic disorder can develop AGORAPHOBIA, which is characterized by anxiety about and AVOIDANCE OF MULTIPLE SITUATIONS where they may FEEL TRAPPED AND HELPLESS in the event of a panic attack (eg, crowds, enclosed spaces, public transportation). For example, this patient may start avoiding bus rides due to fears of recurrent panic attacks. In severe cases of agoraphobia, patients may restrict their activities to the point that they leave home only with a companion or they become completely housebound.\n\nAgoraphobia is a distinct condition and can be diagnosed with or without the presence of panic disorder.\n\n(Choice A) In acute stress disorder, exposure to a life-threatening trauma results in symptoms of reexperiencing (ie, intrusive memories, flashbacks), avoidance of reminders, negative mood, dissociation, and hyperarousal. This patient does not have a history of experiencing a traumatic event.\n\n(Choice C) Although patients may have the fear of \"going crazy\" while experiencing a panic attack, they are not at greater risk of developing psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and/or behavior). Acute psychotic symptoms would be more indicative of brief psychotic disorder.\n\n(Choices D and F) This patient is fearful of leaving home unaccompanied due to a concern about future panic attacks rendering her helpless. In dependent personality disorder, individuals have a lifelong pattern of seeking out relationships due to feeling helpless when alone. Separation anxiety disorder in adults consists of ≥6 months of excessive and distressing anxiety only by separation from a significant attachment figure (eg, spouse, child), unrelated to a fear of being debilitated by panic attack symptoms.\n\n(Choice E) Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent and excessive worry about multiple issues (eg, work, health, finances). This patient's anxiety is focused on her panic symptoms and future attacks.\n\nEducational objective:\nPanic disorder consists of recurrent and unexpected panic attacks characterized by an abrupt surge of anxiety and distressing cardiopulmonary/neurologic symptoms. Agoraphobia, a common comorbidity disorder, results in anxiety and avoidance of situations where patients may feel trapped and helpless in the event of a panic attack (eg, crowds, enclosed spaces, public transportation).",
    "zh": "该患者很可能患有**惊恐障碍**，其表现为痛苦的心肺/神经系统症状，这些症状在10分钟或更短的时间内达到峰值，然后消退。由于症状的强度及其模仿心脏病的倾向，患者可能会害怕自己正在死去，并在急诊科寻求治疗。\n\n惊恐障碍患者可能会发展为**广场恐惧症**，其特征是对多种情况的焦虑和回避，在这些情况中，他们可能会在惊恐发作时感到**被困和无助**（例如，人群、封闭空间、公共交通）。例如，该患者可能由于担心反复发作的惊恐发作而开始避免乘坐公共汽车。在严重的广场恐惧症病例中，患者可能会限制他们的活动范围，以至于他们只与同伴一起离开家，或者他们完全足不出户。\n\n广场恐惧症是一种独立的疾病，可以在存在或不存在惊恐障碍的情况下进行诊断。\n\n（选项A）在急性应激障碍中，接触危及生命的创伤会导致再体验症状（即，侵入性记忆、闪回）、回避提醒、负面情绪、解离和过度警觉。该患者没有经历创伤事件的病史。\n\n（选项C）尽管患者在经历惊恐发作时可能害怕“发疯”，但他们患精神病症状（例如，妄想、幻觉、思维和/或行为紊乱）的风险并不高。急性精神病症状更表明短暂性精神病性障碍。\n\n（选项D和F）由于担心未来的惊恐发作会使她无助，该患者害怕独自离开家。在依赖型人格障碍中，个人具有终生寻找关系，因为在独处时感到无助。成人的分离焦虑症包括≥6个月的过度且痛苦的焦虑，仅由与重要依恋对象（例如，配偶、孩子）分离引起，与害怕因惊恐发作症状而虚弱无关。\n\n（选项E）广泛性焦虑症的特征是持续且过度地担心多个问题（例如，工作、健康、财务）。该患者的焦虑集中于她的惊恐症状和未来的发作。\n\n教育目标：\n惊恐障碍包括反复发生的、不可预测的惊恐发作，其特征是焦虑和痛苦的心肺/神经系统症状突然加剧。广场恐惧症是一种常见的共病障碍，会导致患者在惊恐发作时对某些情况（例如，人群、封闭空间、公共交通）的焦虑和回避。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of panic disorder and its common comorbidity, agoraphobia. It requires differentiating these conditions from other anxiety disorders and psychotic disorders based on the patient's presentation of recurrent panic attacks and subsequent fear of specific situations.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the core symptoms of panic attacks, recognizing the patient's fear of being trapped and helpless in certain situations, and understanding how this fear leads to avoidance behavior, which is characteristic of agoraphobia.",
