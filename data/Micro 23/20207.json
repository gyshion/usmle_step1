    "en": "This patient with tender axillary and epitrochlear lymphadenopathy has histopathologic findings consistent with catscratch disease, caused by Bartonella henselae infection. B. henselae is a fastidious, gram-negative coccobacillus that is transmitted to humans (typically children and young adults) through a scratch or bite from an infected cat.\n\nA skin lesion (eg, erythematous papule, vesicle) usually forms at the inoculation site (eg, hand, arm) within days of the scratch; however, this lesion may go unnoticed. Within weeks, patients develop tender lymphadenopathy proximal to the skin lesion (eg, axillary, epitrochlear). Additional symptoms may include fever, malaise, aches, and night sweats. The diagnosis is often made clinically and confirmed with serologic testing, but biopsy of the affected lymph node may be performed in some cases. Histopathology often shows necrotizing granulomas and stellate-shaped microabscesses (ie, collections of neutrophils). A silver stain (eg, Warthin-Starry) can be used to highlight the organisms. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nThe symptoms are typically self-limiting in immunocompetent patients, and the lymphadenopathy often resolves within a few months. However, antimicrobial therapy (eg, azithromycin) is typically recommended to accelerate recovery and decrease the likelihood of systemic disease.\n\n(Choice A) Lymphatic filariasis is caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, a roundworm transmitted by mosquito bite. Although it can present acutely with adenolymphangitis (eg, tender lymphadenopathy, fever), it typically affects the lower extremities and inguinal lymph nodes. Diagnosis can be made by blood smear examination, which demonstrates microfilariae in the circulation.\n\n(Choice B) Toxoplasmosis is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan transmitted by ingestion of undercooked meat or contact with cat feces. Toxoplasmosis often presents with lymphadenopathy and flu-like symptoms. However, gram-negative coccobacilli would not be seen; instead, histopathology of affected lymph nodes may show rare parasites (eg, bradyzoites).\n\n(Choice C) Tuberculous lymphadenitis, a common extrapulmonary manifestation of tuberculosis, is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is transmitted via inhalation. Although histopathology may show necrotizing granulomas, acid-fast bacilli would be expected.\n\n(Choice E) Syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum, which can be transmitted through unprotected sexual intercourse. Although it can cause lymphadenopathy, histopathology of affected lymph nodes often shows follicular hyperplasia, numerous plasma cells, and endarteritis. {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "这位患者出现腋窝和肱骨内上髁淋巴结触痛，其组织病理学检查结果与猫抓病一致，猫抓病由汉赛巴尔通体感染引起。汉赛巴尔通体是一种苛养型革兰阴性球杆菌，通过受感染的猫的抓伤或咬伤传播给人类（通常是儿童和年轻人）。\n\n接种部位（例如，手、手臂）通常会在抓伤几天内形成皮肤病变（例如，红斑性丘疹、水疱）；然而，这种病变可能未被注意到。几周内，患者会出现皮肤病变近端的淋巴结触痛（例如，腋窝、肱骨内上髁）。其他症状可能包括发烧、不适、疼痛和盗汗。诊断通常在临床上做出，并通过血清学检测确认，但在某些情况下，可能会对受影响的淋巴结进行活检。组织病理学检查通常显示坏死性肉芽肿和星形微脓肿（即，中性粒细胞聚集）。银染（例如，沃辛-斯塔里染色）可用于突出显示病原体。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n这些症状在免疫功能正常的患者中通常是自限性的，淋巴结肿大通常在几个月内消退。然而，通常建议进行抗菌治疗（例如，阿奇霉素）以加速恢复并降低发生全身性疾病的可能性。\n\n（选项 A）淋巴丝虫病由班氏吴策利线虫引起，这是一种通过蚊虫叮咬传播的蛔虫。虽然它可能表现为急性腺淋巴管炎（例如，淋巴结触痛、发烧），但它通常影响下肢和腹股沟淋巴结。可以通过血涂片检查进行诊断，该检查显示循环中的微丝蚴。\n\n（选项 B）弓形虫病由刚地弓形虫引起，这是一种通过摄入未煮熟的肉或接触猫粪便传播的原虫。弓形虫病通常表现为淋巴结肿大和流感样症状。然而，不会看到革兰阴性球杆菌；相反，受影响淋巴结的组织病理学检查可能显示罕见的寄生虫（例如，缓殖子）。\n\n（选项 C）结核性淋巴结炎是结核病常见的肺外表现，由结核分枝杆菌引起，通过吸入传播。尽管组织病理学检查可能显示坏死性肉芽肿，但预计会发现抗酸杆菌。\n\n（选项 E）梅毒由苍白密螺旋体引起，可通过无保护的性交传播。尽管它可能导致淋巴结肿大，但受影响淋巴结的组织病理学检查通常显示滤泡增生、大量浆细胞和动脉内膜炎。{{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of cat scratch disease (CSD). It requires recognizing the characteristic features of CSD, including tender lymphadenopathy, histopathologic findings of necrotizing granulomas, and the association with cat scratches or bites.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the patient's symptoms and the histopathologic findings. The presence of tender lymphadenopathy and necrotizing granulomas with gram-negative coccobacilli should prompt consideration of CSD.
