    "en": "A 54-year-old man arrives for an appointment with a new physician. At the front desk, the receptionist tells him that the physician is running behind schedule and gives him several forms to complete regarding his personal and family medical history. The patient politely agrees to fill them out and has a seat in the waiting area. However, when his paperwork is reviewed by the physician, it contains only the patient's signature. The patient says, \"I'm sure a doctor with your education can take a good history.\" When asked if anything is wrong he says, \"Oh, nothing. I'm fine.\"",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's indirect expression of anger about waiting for the physician is an example of PASSIVE AGGRESSION. Rather than directly expressing his feelings, he agrees to fill out the forms and then resists performing the expected task. Other examples of behaviors used to indirectly defuse hostile feelings include procrastination, forgetfulness, and purposeful inefficiency. Backhanded compliments, sarcasm, and denial of being angry are also characteristic of passive-aggressive behavior.\n\n(Choice A) Acting out is an immature defense mechanism that involves expressing unconscious wishes or impulses through overtly aggressive actions (eg, the patient tore up the forms in anger).\n\n(Choice B) In displacement, negative feelings associated with a person or situation are transferred to another person or object that appears less threatening (eg, the patient did not express his anger to the physician but yelled at his wife instead).\n\n(Choice D) In reaction formation, unacceptable feelings are transformed into their opposites (eg, the patient's irritation was redirected into being overly complimentary to the physician).\n\n(Choice E) Splitting involves experiencing the self or others in extremes, either all positive or all negative (eg, the patient was told of the delay in his appointment time and then perceived the physician as horrible with no redeeming qualities).\n\n(Choice F) Suppression involves consciously putting aside unwanted feelings (eg, the patient made a conscious decision to temporarily put aside his anger, completed the paperwork as directed, and was cordial to the physician during the appointment).\n\n(Choice G) Undoing involves symbolically nullifying a guilt-provoking thought or feeling by confession or atonement (eg, this patient brought the physician a gift at his next appointment to negate his angry feelings).\n\nEducational objective:\nPassive aggression is the expression of angry feelings in a nonconfrontational manner.",
    "zh": "这位患者间接表达了对等待医生的愤怒，这是被动攻击的一个例子。他没有直接表达他的感受，而是同意填写表格，然后抵抗执行预期的任务。其他间接化解敌意感受的行为包括拖延、健忘和故意的效率低下。反唇相讥、讽刺和否认生气也是被动攻击行为的特征。\n\n（选项A）发泄是一种不成熟的防御机制，涉及通过公开的攻击性行为来表达无意识的愿望或冲动（例如，患者愤怒地撕毁表格）。\n\n（选项B）在移置中，与某人或某种情况相关的负面情绪被转移到另一个看起来不太具威胁性的人或物体上（例如，患者没有向医生表达他的愤怒，而是对他的妻子大喊大叫）。\n\n（选项D）在反向形成中，不可接受的感受被转化为它们的对立面（例如，患者的恼怒被转移到对医生的过度恭维）。\n\n（选项E）分裂涉及以极端的方式体验自己或他人，要么全都是积极的，要么全都是消极的（例如，患者被告知他的预约时间延误，然后认为医生很糟糕，没有任何优点）。\n\n（选项F）压抑涉及有意识地搁置不想要的感受（例如，患者有意识地决定暂时放下他的愤怒，按照指示完成文书工作，并在预约期间对医生保持友好）。\n\n（选项G）抵消涉及通过忏悔或赎罪来象征性地消除引起内疚感的想法或感受（例如，这位患者在下次预约时给医生带了礼物，以抵消他愤怒的感受）。\n\n教育目标：\n被动攻击是以非对抗的方式表达愤怒的感受。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of defense mechanisms, specifically identifying passive aggression as a behavior characterized by indirect hostility and resistance to demands. It requires differentiating this from other defense mechanisms like acting out, displacement, reaction formation, splitting, suppression, and undoing.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully analyze the patient's behavior in the vignette, noting the discrepancy between his verbal agreement and his actual actions. The key is to recognize the indirect expression of anger and resistance, which are hallmarks of passive aggression, and contrast this with the direct expression of anger (acting out) or redirection of feelings (displacement, reaction formation).",
    "zh": "这道题考察了对防御机制的理解，特别是将被动攻击识别为一种以间接敌意和抵抗要求为特征的行为。它需要将其与其他防御机制区分开来，如发泄、移置、反向形成、分裂、压抑和抵消。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须仔细分析患者在短剧中的行为，注意他口头协议与实际行动之间的差异。关键是要认识到间接表达的愤怒和抵抗，这是被动攻击的标志，并将其与直接表达的愤怒（发泄）或情绪的重定向（移置、反向形成）进行对比。"
