    "en": "This patient's rapidly growing lesion is consistent with an infantile hemangioma, a common, benign vascular tumor characterized by neoplastic proliferation of endothelial cells. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nInfantile hemangiomas occur most often on the head or neck. They present within weeks of birth as a solitary red papule or nodule. The lesion shows characteristic rapid growth for several months followed by spontaneous, gradual regression over several years.\n\nGrowth of infantile hemangiomas is thought to be related to the de novo production of a vascular network (ie, vasculogenesis) and/or the sprouting of new blood vessels from existing ones (ie, angiogenesis). Microscopic examination during the growth phase shows multiple lobules of densely packed capillaries lined by plump endothelium. As the lesion regresses, the endothelial cells undergo apoptosis, and the capillaries are replaced by fibrofatty tissue.\n\n(Choice A) Enchondroma and chondrosarcoma are examples of cartilage-forming neoplasms. Enchondromas are benign and commonly involve the bones of the hands and feet. Chondrosarcomas are malignant lesions that usually involve the axial skeleton of older adults.\n\n(Choice C) Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, cutaneous tumor of neuroendocrine cell origin that presents as a rapidly expanding, firm, pink nodule. This condition is nearly exclusive to older adults.\n\n(Choice D) Leiomyoma (benign) and leiomyosarcoma (malignant) are smooth muscle neoplasms most commonly found in the genitourinary (eg, uterus) or gastrointestinal tract. Lesions can involve the skin but present as small, painful nodules. In addition, these tumors are exceedingly rare in young children and do not grow rapidly.\n\n(Choice E) Squamous epithelial cells may give rise to squamous cell carcinoma, which, in contrast to this case, appears as an ulcerated or hyperkeratotic plaque in adults with sun-damaged skin.\n\nEducational objective:\nInfantile hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors composed of proliferating endothelial cells that most frequently affect the head or neck region. Natural history of these lesions involves rapid growth of a red, cutaneous plaque followed by spontaneous regression.",
    "zh": "该患者快速生长的病灶与婴儿血管瘤一致，婴儿血管瘤是一种常见的良性血管肿瘤，其特征是内皮细胞的肿瘤性增生。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n婴儿血管瘤最常发生在头部或颈部。它们在出生几周内表现为孤立的红色丘疹或结节。病灶显示出特有的快速生长，持续数月，然后自发地、逐渐消退，持续数年。\n\n婴儿血管瘤的生长被认为与血管网络的从头产生（即血管发生）和/或新血管从现有血管中萌芽（即血管生成）有关。在生长阶段的显微镜检查显示，多个小叶由致密的毛细血管组成，这些毛细血管由饱满的内皮细胞排列。当病灶消退时，内皮细胞会凋亡，毛细血管被纤维脂肪组织取代。\n\n（选项 A）内生软骨瘤和软骨肉瘤是形成软骨的肿瘤的例子。内生软骨瘤是良性的，通常涉及手和脚的骨骼。软骨肉瘤是恶性病变，通常涉及老年人的轴向骨骼。\n\n（选项 C）默克尔细胞癌是一种罕见的神经内分泌细胞来源的皮肤肿瘤，表现为快速扩大的、坚硬的、粉红色结节。这种情况几乎仅限于老年人。\n\n（选项 D）平滑肌瘤（良性）和平滑肌肉瘤（恶性）是平滑肌肿瘤，最常见于泌尿生殖系统（例如，子宫）或胃肠道。病变可能涉及皮肤，但表现为小的、疼痛的结节。此外，这些肿瘤在幼儿中极为罕见，且不会迅速生长。\n\n（选项 E）鳞状上皮细胞可能导致鳞状细胞癌，与此病例相反，鳞状细胞癌表现为在日晒受损皮肤的成年人中出现溃疡性或过度角化的斑块。\n\n教育目标：\n婴儿血管瘤是良性血管肿瘤，由增殖的内皮细胞组成，最常影响头部或颈部区域。这些病变的自然病史包括红色皮肤斑块的快速生长，然后自发消退。"

It requires recognizing the characteristic rapid growth and spontaneous regression pattern of these benign vascular tumors.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the patient's age, the lesion's rapid growth, and its appearance.
