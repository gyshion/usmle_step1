  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's rapidly worsening fever, vomiting, altered mental status, and nuchal rigidity are consistent with MENINGOCOCCAL MENINGITIS due to infection with NEISSERIA MENINGITIDIS. Meningococcal infection usually occurs in children and young adults and can present acutely with rapid progression (within hours) to MENINGOCOCCEMIA and SEPTIC SHOCK. These patients frequently have thrombocytopenia and a petechial rash and are at risk for development of disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\nA serious complication of meningococcemia is bilateral hemorrhagic infarction of the adrenal glands, resulting in acute adrenal insufficiency (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome). Manifestations include HYPOGLYCEMIA due to cortisol deficiency as well as HYPONATREMIA and HYPERKALEMIA due to aldosterone deficiency. Loss of cortisol and aldosterone also contributes to worsening shock and can result in RAPID DETERIORATION and death despite aggressive intervention.\n\n(Choices B and E) Both cardiac tamponade and a saddle pulmonary embolus can cause obstructive shock that results in multiorgan failure. However, shock due to these conditions is not usually associated with adrenal insufficiency, and this patient's other clinical features (eg, neck stiffness, rash) suggest meningococcal meningitis as the primary cause.\n\n(Choice C) Intracerebral hemorrhage with increasing intracranial pressure can present with severe headache, vomiting, altered mental status, loss of consciousness, and death. Neck stiffness may be present if the hemorrhage extends into the subarachnoid space and irritates the meninges. However, this patient's fever, petechial rash, and adrenal insufficiency make meningococcal meningitis more likely.\n\n(Choice D) Necrotizing pancreatitis typically presents with worsening abdominal pain and vomiting, and if infected can lead to septic shock and death. However, it is not associated with neck stiffness and a petechial rash.\n\nEducational objective:\nMeningococcal meningitis is a rapidly progressive infection that can spread systemically (ie, meningococcemia) and lead to septic shock, multiorgan failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Meningococcemia is also associated with bilateral hemorrhagic infarction of the adrenal glands, which can result in acute adrenal insufficiency (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome) with worsening shock and rapid clinical deterioration.",
    "zh": "该患者迅速恶化的发烧、呕吐、精神状态改变和颈项强直与脑膜炎奈瑟菌感染引起的脑膜炎奈瑟菌性脑膜炎一致。脑膜炎奈瑟菌感染通常发生在儿童和年轻人中，并且可急性发病，在数小时内迅速进展为脑膜炎球菌血症和感染性休克。这些患者常有血小板减少症和瘀点状皮疹，并且有发生弥散性血管内凝血的风险。\n\n脑膜炎球菌血症的严重并发症是肾上腺的双侧出血性梗死，导致急性肾上腺皮质功能不全（Waterhouse-Friderichsen综合征）。表现包括由于皮质醇缺乏引起的低血糖症，以及由于醛固酮缺乏引起的低钠血症和高钾血症。皮质醇和醛固酮的缺失也会导致休克恶化，尽管进行了积极的干预，仍可能导致病情迅速恶化和死亡。\n\n（选项B和E）心脏压塞和马鞍形肺栓塞均可引起梗阻性休克，导致多器官衰竭。然而，这些情况引起的休克通常与肾上腺皮质功能不全无关，并且该患者的其他临床特征（例如，颈部僵硬、皮疹）提示脑膜炎奈瑟菌性脑膜炎是主要原因。\n\n（选项C）颅内出血伴颅内压增高可表现为剧烈头痛、呕吐、精神状态改变、意识丧失和死亡。如果出血蔓延到蛛网膜下腔并刺激脑膜，则可能出现颈部僵硬。然而，该患者的发烧、瘀点状皮疹和肾上腺皮质功能不全使得脑膜炎奈瑟菌性脑膜炎的可能性更大。\n\n（选项D）坏死性胰腺炎通常表现为腹痛和呕吐加重，如果发生感染，可导致感染性休克和死亡。然而，它与颈部僵硬和瘀点状皮疹无关。\n\n教育目标：脑膜炎奈瑟菌性脑膜炎是一种快速进展的感染，可在全身扩散（即脑膜炎球菌血症），并导致感染性休克、多器官衰竭和弥散性血管内凝血。脑膜炎球菌血症也与肾上腺的双侧出血性梗死有关，这可导致急性肾上腺皮质功能不全（Waterhouse-Friderichsen综合征），休克恶化和病情快速恶化。"
