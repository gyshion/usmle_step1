  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient experienced a severe medication allergy with respiratory distress. Although key information did not accompany the patient at the time of transfer, this event was likely preventable. In cases where important information is missing or incomplete, clinicians have a duty to obtain the information as soon as possible. Because of the harm done to the patient, this clinician is at risk for a medical malpractice claim.\n\nMost patients who experience complications, even avoidable complications, do not initiate a malpractice lawsuit. Patients who sue providers are typically not driven by financial rewards, but are more likely to be motivated by anger, distrust, or a feeling that the clinician is not concerned for their well-being. Often, patients report poor communication from the provider and file a lawsuit simply to get a better understanding of what happened.\n\nWhen speaking with a patient following a medical error, clinicians should directly and honestly discuss that an error occurred; concealing an error can appear dishonest and generate anger if the error is later discovered. The conversation should allow opportunity for the patient to ask questions, and answers should be given with language that the patient can understand. A plan to rectify the error should be provided. The provider should then convey concern for the patient and remain engaged with the patient's care until the issue has been resolved.\n\n(Choice A) Many experts recommend an apology be made to the patient following an error. However, specific blame (including self-blame) is not necessary and may make defending a claim more difficult later.\n\n(Choice C) This statement does not acknowledge that an error occurred and may be taken as blaming the patient. Plans for future prevention should generally come after an open discussion of the initial error.\n\n(Choice D) This statement conveys superficial concern but does not acknowledge the error and is likely to be seen as detached or blasé on the part of the clinician.\n\n(Choice E) Although factually correct, this statement conveys no empathy for the patient. It also deflects blame to the referring provider, which often generates distrust toward all of the involved parties.",
    "zh": "该患者经历了严重的药物过敏并伴有呼吸窘迫。尽管在转诊时没有随附关键信息，但此事件很可能可以预防。在重要信息缺失或不完整的情况下，临床医生有义务尽快获取这些信息。由于对患者造成的损害，该临床医生面临医疗事故索赔的风险。\n\n大多数经历并发症的患者，即使是可避免的并发症，也不会提起医疗事故诉讼。起诉提供者的患者通常不是由经济利益驱动，而是更有可能受到愤怒、不信任或感觉临床医生不关心其福祉的驱使。患者通常报告来自提供者的沟通不畅，并提起诉讼仅仅是为了更好地了解发生了什么。\n\n在医疗错误发生后与患者交谈时，临床医生应直接、诚实地讨论发生了错误；如果后来发现了错误，隐瞒错误可能会显得不诚实并引起愤怒。谈话应允许患者提问，并应使用患者可以理解的语言给出答案。应提供纠正错误的计划。然后，提供者应表达对患者的关心，并保持参与患者的护理，直到问题得到解决。\n\n（选项 A）许多专家建议在错误发生后向患者道歉。但是，不需要具体的指责（包括自我指责），这可能会使日后为索赔辩护变得更加困难。\n\n（选项 C）此陈述并未承认发生了错误，可能被视为责怪患者。未来的预防计划通常应在公开讨论初始错误之后进行。\n\n（选项 D）此陈述表达了肤浅的关心，但并未承认错误，并且很可能被视为临床医生冷漠或漫不经心。\n\n（选项 E）虽然在事实上是正确的，但此陈述并未对患者表达同情。它还将责任推卸给转诊提供者，这通常会导致对所有相关方的怀疑。"
