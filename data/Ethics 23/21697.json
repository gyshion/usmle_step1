    "en": "A 57-year-old man comes to the office accompanied by his wife due to low mood and sleep disturbances for the past 2 months. The patient has also had a loss of interest in his hobbies, concentration difficulties that are affecting his work, and low energy. The patient has no suicidal thoughts. Psychiatric history is significant for a period of depression in his 20s treated with psychotherapy. Medical history is noncontributory. Vital signs and physical examination are within normal limits. The patient has a depressed affect with restricted range and soft speech. Treatment options are discussed, including psychotherapy and antidepressant medications. The patient responds that he is willing to consider psychotherapy but does not believe medication is necessary. His wife says, \"I don't think he understands how serious this is—he's in danger of losing his job. I'll make sure he takes the medication.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Family members can provide useful information about a patient's condition and act as a source of support for the patient. However, when it comes to obtaining valid informed consent, the patient's autonomy (ie, the right to make a decision without undue influence) should be the primary concern.\n\nIn this case, the patient's wife is providing important input into her husband's condition, which is helpful. However, her values and preferences regarding medication do not necessarily reflect those of her husband. The physician should express appreciation for the wife's input and gently ask her to leave the room, explaining the importance of speaking with the patient confidentially {{exhibit_1}}. Speaking confidentially will allow the patient to ask questions or express concerns that he may not be comfortable relaying with his wife present and enable a discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternate treatments without coercion. It is also more likely to engage the patient in creating a treatment plan with which he is comfortable.\n\n(Choices A and D) No matter the preference of family members or the physician, consent to treatment must come from the patient, whose autonomy should be respected. He should not be coerced into accepting treatment that he finds objectionable.\n\n(Choices B and C) The patient should be afforded the opportunity to speak with the physician alone to explore his treatment choice and assess his understanding of the options. If after speaking confidentially, he decides not to start antidepressants, then he should be referred for psychotherapy with regular follow-up to monitor his progress. He can be provided with information that should his symptoms worsen, medication may be an option.\n\nEducational objective:\nWhen family members and patients have different opinions on treatment, the patient should be provided the opportunity to talk confidentially with the physician. This respects the patient's autonomy and facilitates obtaining valid informed consent.",
    "zh": "家庭成员可以提供关于患者病情的有用信息，并作为患者的支持来源。然而，在获得有效的知情同意时，患者的自主权（即在没有不当影响的情况下做出决定的权利）应是首要关注点。\n\n在这种情况下，患者的妻子正在提供关于她丈夫病情的的重要信息，这很有帮助。然而，她关于药物治疗的价值观和偏好不一定反映了她丈夫的观点。医生应该对妻子的意见表示感谢，并礼貌地请她离开房间，解释与患者私下交谈的重要性 {{exhibit_1}}。私下交谈将使患者能够提出他可能不愿意在妻子在场时提出的问题或表达担忧，并能够讨论风险、益处和替代治疗方案，而不会受到胁迫。它也更有可能促使患者参与制定他感到舒适的治疗计划。\n\n（选项A和D）无论家庭成员或医生的偏好如何，治疗的同意必须来自患者，应尊重其自主权。他不应被迫接受他认为反感的治疗。\n\n（选项B和C）应该给患者一个单独与医生交谈的机会，以探讨他的治疗选择并评估他对这些选择的理解。如果私下交谈后，他决定不开始服用抗抑郁药，那么他应该被转诊进行心理治疗，并定期随访以监测他的进展。可以向他提供信息，如果他的症状恶化，药物治疗可能是一种选择。\n\n教育目标：\n当家庭成员和患者对治疗有不同意见时，应为患者提供与医生私下交谈的机会。这尊重了患者的自主权，并有助于获得有效的知情同意。"

    "en": "This question tests the ethical principle of patient autonomy and the importance of confidential communication in the physician-patient relationship, especially when family members are involved. It emphasizes respecting the patient's right to make informed decisions about their treatment, free from coercion.\n\nThe best approach is to prioritize the patient's autonomy by speaking with them privately to understand their perspective and concerns. This allows for a more open discussion about treatment options and ensures that the patient's preferences are respected, leading to better adherence and outcomes.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试了患者自主权的伦理原则以及在医患关系中保密沟通的重要性，特别是在涉及家庭成员时。它强调尊重患者在不受胁迫的情况下就其治疗做出知情决定的权利。\n\n最好的方法是优先考虑患者的自主权，通过与他们私下交谈来了解他们的观点和顾虑。这可以进行更开放的关于治疗方案的讨论，并确保尊重患者的偏好，从而提高依从性和改善结果。"
