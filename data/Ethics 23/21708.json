  "explanation": {
    "en": "Hearing loss is common, impacting almost 20% of US adults; the prevalence increases with age. Hearing loss is associated with increased rates of misdiagnosis, longer lengths of hospitalizations, and increased readmission rates. As such, physicians should employ strategies to improve communication, which include:\n\n•\tDecreasing background noise\n•\tFacing the patient directly when speaking and refraining from touching the face or mouth\n•\tSpeaking clearly and loudly (ie, natural amplification) without shouting or shrieking, which distorts the sound of speech\n•\tSpeaking at a normal pace because speaking too slowly can decrease contextual clues and make it hard for patients to understand\n•\tUsing short and simple sentences and addressing one topic at a time\n•\tUsing facial expressions, gestures, and visual aids when appropriate\n•\tAsking the patient to repeat back specific instructions to ensure understanding\n\nHearing loss patients are HETEROGENEOUS with varying needs. Physicians should ask open-ended questions such as, “What is the best way for me to communicate with you?” and frequently ask for feedback to ensure that communication is effective. In addition, physicians should DOCUMENT successful strategies to improve future encounters.\n\n(Choice B) Although this patient has hearing loss, he is able to verbally communicate effectively with the physician and does not need to write. The physician (rather than the patient) may use written communication if this is in line with the patient’s preferences. In general, writing is not preferred because nuances can be lost, intentions misinterpreted, or information left out for the sake of brevity.\n\n(Choice C) Obtaining history from the wife or next of kin is appropriate if the patient is incapacitated (eg, comatose state). Attempts to communicate directly with the patient are always preferred.\n\n(Choice D) Speaking loudly into one ear may be helpful for some patients with unilateral hearing loss. However, this should only be done after confirming this aligns with the patient’s preferences and asking which ear is best for hearing (ie, the better-hearing ear).\n\n(Choice E) Optimal care of patients with hearing loss who use sign language requires trained interpreters. However, many patients with hearing loss do not use sign language; this assumption can lead to delays in care and embarrassment for the patient.",
    "zh": "听力损失很常见，影响了近20%的美国成年人；发病率随年龄增长而增加。听力损失与误诊率增加、住院时间延长和再入院率增加有关。因此，医生应采取改善沟通的策略，其中包括：\n\n•\t减少背景噪音\n•\t与患者交谈时直接面对患者，并避免触摸面部或嘴巴\n•\t清晰而大声地说话（即自然放大），不要大喊大叫或尖叫，这会扭曲声音\n•\t以正常语速说话，因为说话太慢会减少上下文线索，使患者难以理解\n•\t使用简短而简单的句子，一次只处理一个主题\n•\t在适当的时候使用面部表情、手势和视觉辅助工具\n•\t要求患者重复特定的指示以确保理解\n\n听力损失患者具有异质性，需求各不相同。医生应询问开放式问题，例如：“与您沟通的最佳方式是什么？” 并经常征求反馈意见，以确保沟通有效。此外，医生应记录成功的策略，以改善未来的沟通。\n\n（选项 B） 尽管该患者有听力损失，但他能够有效地与医生进行口头交流，并且不需要书写。如果这符合患者的偏好，医生（而不是患者）可以使用书面交流。总的来说，不推荐书写，因为细微差别可能会丢失，意图被误解，或者为了简洁而省略信息。\n\n（选项 C）如果患者无行为能力（例如，昏迷状态），从妻子或近亲那里获取病史是合适的。最好始终尝试直接与患者沟通。\n\n（选项 D）对某些单侧听力损失的患者来说，对着一只耳朵大声说话可能有所帮助。然而，只有在确认这符合患者的偏好并询问哪只耳朵最适合听力（即，听力更好的耳朵）后才能这样做。\n\n（选项 E）使用手语的听力损失患者的最佳护理需要训练有素的翻译。然而，许多听力损失患者不使用手语；这种假设可能导致护理延迟和患者的尴尬。"
