    "en": "A 17-year-old girl is brought to the office by her parents due to recurrent episodes where \"she seems to be lost in her own world.\" The parents say that the episodes began about 2 years ago, but seem to be occurring more frequently since a difficult breakup with her boyfriend several months ago. The patient acknowledges that she seems to \"space out\" easily. She says, \"I often feel numb, like I'm in a fog or a dream. Sometimes, I feel as if I'm not myself, as if things are happening to someone else.\" The patient uses nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for menstrual cramps. She has no other medical conditions. She smokes cigarettes but does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Physical and neurologic examinations are normal. On mental status examination, the patient is cooperative with a mildly anxious mood and flat affect.",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's symptoms of feeling \"lost in her own world,\" \"space out,\" feeling \"numb,\" \"in a fog or a dream,\" and feeling \"not myself, as if things are happening to someone else\" are classic descriptions of depersonalization and derealization. Depersonalization is a feeling of detachment or estrangement from oneself, while derealization is a sense of detachment from one's surroundings. These experiences are subjective and are not accompanied by a loss of reality testing, meaning the patient knows these feelings are not real. The onset after a stressful event (breakup) is also consistent with this diagnosis. The provided table summarizes dissociative disorders: Depersonalization/derealization disorder involves 1 or both: depersonalization (detachment, unreality of self) and derealization (detachment, unreality of surroundings). Dissociative amnesia involves inability to recall personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature. Dissociative identity disorder involves fragmentation into ≥2 distinct personalities and discontinuity in identity & personal agency.\n\n(Choice A) Absence seizures typically begin in childhood and are frequently associated with staring, repetitive eyelid movements, automatisms, and lack of awareness of the episodes. This patient's symptoms are not described as such.\n\n(Choice B) Brief psychotic disorder involves the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and disorganized or catatonic behavior. This patient's intact reality testing and absence of these symptoms make this diagnosis unlikely.\n\n(Choices D and E) Dissociative amnesia involves gaps in autobiographical memory, usually associated with a traumatic event. Dissociative identity disorder is a rare condition associated with severe trauma that involves fragmentation of identity into ≥2 distinct personality states. The patient's primary complaint is not memory loss or multiple personalities, but rather feelings of detachment and unreality.\n\n(Choice F) Depersonalization/derealization is not diagnosed as a separate disorder when it occurs as a feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, this patient does not meet criteria for PTSD: exposure to life-threatening trauma, intrusion (eg, nightmares, flashbacks), avoidance of reminders, and hyperarousal (eg, insomnia, hypervigilance). While the breakup is a stressful event, it does not constitute the type of trauma typically associated with PTSD.",
    "zh": "患者的症状，如感到“迷失在自己的世界里”、“走神”、“麻木”、“在雾中或梦中”，以及感觉“不像我自己，好像事情发生在别人身上”，是人格解体和现实解体的典型描述。人格解体是指与自身分离或疏离的感觉，而现实解体是指与周围环境疏离的感觉。这些体验是主观的，并且没有伴随现实检验能力的丧失，这意味着患者知道这些感觉是不真实的。在压力事件（分手）后发病也与此诊断一致。下表总结了分离性障碍：人格解体/现实解体障碍包括以下一种或两种情况：人格解体（与自我分离、不真实感）和现实解体（与周围环境分离、不真实感）。分离性遗忘症涉及无法回忆个人信息，通常是创伤性或压力性事件。分离性身份识别障碍涉及分裂成≥2个不同的性格和身份与个人自主性的中断。\n\n（选项A）失神发作通常始于儿童时期，并常伴有凝视、重复的眼睑运动、自动症以及对发作的意识丧失。该患者的症状未被描述为这样。\n\n（选项B）短暂性精神病障碍涉及精神病症状的突然发作，如妄想、幻觉、言语紊乱以及行为紊乱或紧张症。该患者的现实检验能力完好且无这些症状，因此此诊断不太可能。\n\n（选项D和E）分离性遗忘症涉及自传式记忆的空白，通常与创伤性事件相关。分离性身份识别障碍是一种罕见疾病，与严重创伤相关，涉及身份分裂成≥2种不同的性格状态。患者的主要诉求不是记忆丧失或多重人格，而是分离感和不真实感。\n\n（选项F）当人格解体/现实解体作为创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）的一个特征出现时，不会被诊断为单独的障碍。然而，该患者不符合PTSD的标准：接触危及生命的创伤、闯入（例如，噩梦、闪回）、避免提醒和过度唤醒（例如，失眠、过度警觉）。虽然分手是一个压力事件，但它不构成通常与PTSD相关的创伤类型。"
