    "en": "A 29-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to high fever and a rash. The illness began 5 days ago with acute-onset high fever, headache, retroorbital pain, and joint and muscle pain. Yesterday, the patient developed a diffuse rash, and this morning she had a nosebleed. The patient returned from a trip to Brazil 10 days ago. Her boyfriend traveled with her and is asymptomatic. Examination shows a diffuse maculopapular rash and scattered petechiae over her extremities. Laboratory evaluation reveals thrombocytopenia. Transmission of the pathogen causing this patient's current symptoms occurs in a manner that is most similar to which of the following diseases?",

    "en": "This patient traveled to Brazil and subsequently developed a high fever and hemorrhagic manifestations (eg, petechiae, thrombocytopenia, mucosal bleeding). The likely diagnosis is dengue, a Flavivirus infection transmitted by female Aedes mosquitoes. Dengue virus causes approximately 400 million infections per year and is especially prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and South America (eg, Brazil). \n\nManifestations typically arise 4-7 days after transmission and include sudden-onset high fever, headache, retroorbital pain, arthralgia, and myalgia. Hemorrhagic manifestations such as petechiae, purpura, or mucosal bleeding (eg, epistaxis, melena) often occur within days of symptom onset and can be life-threatening. Laboratory evaluation frequently reveals thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and hemoconcentration.\n\nBecause Aedes mosquitoes also transmit the viruses that cause yellow fever, Zika, and chikungunya, there are often SIMULTANEOUS OUTBREAKS in endemic areas during the rainy seasons when mosquito populations peak. Patients are also at high risk for coinfection with multiple mosquito-borne viral pathogens during these periods.\n\n(Choice B) Lymphogranuloma venereum is an ulcerative genital disease caused by specific serovars for Chlamydia trachomatis, which is transmitted by direct sexual contact with an infected individual.\n\n(Choice C) Meningococcal meningitis is a life-threatening bacterial infection that typically starts with acute-onset myalgia, high fever, and vomiting and rapidly progresses to petechial rash and circulatory collapse. The pathogen (Neisseria meningitidis) is transmitted by respiratory droplets.\n\n(Choice D) Pulmonary tuberculosis typically causes asymptomatic initial infection but may reactivate and lead to cough, hemoptysis, and cavitary pulmonary disease. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is spread primarily through airborne droplet nuclei.\n\n(Choice E) Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne illness caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, a gram-negative obligate intracellular pathogen. It typically presents with fever and nonspecific symptoms followed a few days later by a petechial rash.\n\n(Choice F) Typhoid fever is a Salmonella infection that typically causes a stepwise, progressive illness marked by fever in week 1, abdominal pain and a rose-colored rash in week 2, and hepatosplenomegaly and intestinal perforation in week 3. It is transmitted primarily by contaminated food or water ingestion in areas with poor sanitation.\n\nEducational objective:\nAedes mosquitoes transmit the viruses that cause dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever; simultaneous outbreaks and coinfections are common. Dengue usually presents as an acute febrile illness with headache, retroorbital pain, arthralgia, and myalgic; hemorrhagic signs (eg, thrombocytopenia, petechiae, mucosal bleeding) often occur within days.",
    "zh": "该患者曾前往巴西旅行，随后出现高热和出血表现（如瘀点、血小板减少、黏膜出血）。可能的诊断是登革热，这是一种由雌性埃及伊蚊传播的黄病毒感染。登革病毒每年引起约4亿人感染，在亚洲和南美洲（如巴西）的热带和亚热带地区尤为普遍。\n\n症状通常在传播后4-7天出现，包括突发高热、头痛、眼眶后疼痛、关节痛和肌痛。出血表现，如瘀点、紫癜或黏膜出血（如鼻出血、黑便），通常在症状出现后几天内发生，并可能危及生命。实验室评估通常显示血小板减少、白细胞减少和血液浓缩。\n\n由于埃及伊蚊也传播导致黄热病、寨卡病毒病和基孔肯雅热的病毒，在蚊子数量达到高峰的雨季，在流行地区经常会同时爆发。患者在这些时期也面临着多种蚊媒病毒病原体合并感染的高风险。\n\n(选项 B) 淋巴肉芽肿性性病是由沙眼衣原体特定血清型引起的溃疡性生殖器疾病，通过与感染个体的直接性接触传播。\n\n(选项 C) 脑膜炎奈瑟菌性脑膜炎是一种危及生命的细菌感染，通常始于突发性肌痛、高热和呕吐，并迅速进展为瘀点性皮疹和循环衰竭。病原体（脑膜炎奈瑟菌）通过呼吸道飞沫传播。\n\n(选项 D) 肺结核通常引起无症状的初始感染，但可能复发并导致咳嗽、咯血和空洞性肺病。结核分枝杆菌主要通过空气传播的飞沫核传播。\n\n(选项 E) 落基山斑疹热是一种由落基山立克次体（一种革兰氏阴性专性细胞内病原体）引起的蜱传疾病。它通常表现为发热和非特异性症状，几天后出现瘀点性皮疹。\n\n(选项 F) 伤寒是一种沙门氏菌感染，通常会导致一个逐步发展的疾病，其特征是第一周发热，第二周腹痛和玫瑰色皮疹，第三周肝脾肿大和肠穿孔。它主要通过在卫生条件差的地区摄入受污染的食物或水传播。\n\n教育目标：\n埃及伊蚊传播导致登革热、基孔肯雅热、寨卡病毒病和黄热病的病毒；同时爆发和合并感染很常见。登革热通常表现为急性发热性疾病，伴有头痛、眼眶后疼痛、关节痛和肌痛；出血体征（如血小板减少、瘀点、黏膜出血）通常在几天内发生。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of mosquito-borne viral infections, specifically dengue and chikungunya, and their transmission patterns. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of dengue fever and understanding that both dengue and chikungunya are transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. \n\nThe best approach is to identify the key features of the case (travel to Brazil, high fever, rash, thrombocytopenia) and consider the most likely diagnoses based on these findings. Then, match the transmission method of the suspected disease with the options provided.",
