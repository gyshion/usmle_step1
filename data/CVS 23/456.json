    "en": "The patient's blood pressure readings show a pattern of elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) with relatively low diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and elevated pulse pressure, consistent with ISOLATED SYSTOLIC HYPERTENSION (ISH). ISH is often seen in ELDERLY PATIENTS (eg, age >65), representing 60%-80% of hypertension cases in this population.\n\nAging is associated with increased aortic stiffness caused by endothelial dysfunction and a change in extracellular matrix composition (ie, REPLACEMENT OF ELASTIN WITH COLLAGEN). These changes REDUCE AORTIC COMPLIANCE, which INCREASES PULSE PRESSURE (pulse pressure is directly related to stroke volume and inversely related to aortic compliance). In youth, ample aortic compliance results in delayed retrograge reflection of pressure waves during ventricular systole, with the waves returning to the heart after aortic valve closure and assisting in coronary artery perfusion. The reduced compliance that occurs with age hastens the retrograde reflection of pressure waves, causing the waves to return prior to aortic valve closure and increase the load on the left ventricle (ie, INCREASED SBP).\n\nReduced aortic compliance also causes less blood volume to be retained in the arterial system between left ventricular contractions, SLIGHTLY DECREASING DBP.\n\n(Choice A) The aortic lumen slightly increases (not decreases) in diameter with age. Nonetheless, it is the compliance of the large arteries (rather than the diameter) that affects blood pressure. The diameter of the small arteries (ie, arterioles) determines systemic vascular resistance and is a primary determinant of DBP.\n\n(Choice B) A decrease in stroke volume decreases pulse pressure, leading to reduced SBP. However, stroke volume is generally maintained with age; a physiologic decrease does not occur.\n\n(Choice D) Renal arterial resistance can increase with age due to the development of renal artery atherosclerosis. This causes hypertension by activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to cause sodium retention and arteriolar vasoconstriction, resulting in increased DBP (and increased SBP due to unchanged pulse pressure) rather than ISH.\n\n(Choice E) Increased sympathetic tone causes increased DBP (arteriolar vasoconstriction) and increased pulse pressure (increased contractility leading to increased stroke volume). Increased sympathetic tone often contributes to hypertension in patients age <50, but sympathetic tone decreases with age due to reduced responsiveness of adrenergic receptors.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe isolated systolic hypertension commonly seen in elderly patients results from age-related stiffening (ie, replacement of elastin with collagen) and reduced compliance of the aorta and other large arteries. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "患者的血压读数显示收缩压（SBP）升高，舒张压（DBP）相对较低，脉压增高，这与单纯收缩期高血压（ISH）一致。ISH常在老年患者（例如，年龄>65岁）中出现，占该人群高血压病例的60％-80％。\n\n衰老与内皮功能障碍和细胞外基质成分的变化（即，弹性蛋白被胶原蛋白替代）引起的主动脉硬化增加有关。这些变化降低了主动脉顺应性，从而增加了脉压（脉压与每搏输出量直接相关，与主动脉顺应性成反比）。在年轻人中，充足的主动脉顺应性导致压力波在心室收缩期间延迟逆行反射，这些波在主动脉瓣关闭后返回心脏，并有助于冠状动脉灌注。随着年龄的增长，顺应性降低会加速压力波的逆行反射，导致波在主动脉瓣关闭之前返回，并增加左心室的负荷（即，SBP升高）。\n\n主动脉顺应性降低也会导致在左心室收缩之间动脉系统中保留的血容量减少，轻微降低DBP。\n\n（选项A）主动脉腔的直径随年龄略有增加（而非减小）。尽管如此，影响血压的是大动脉的顺应性（而非直径）。小动脉（即，小动脉）的直径决定了全身血管阻力，是DBP的主要决定因素。\n\n（选项B）每搏输出量的减少会降低脉压，从而导致SBP降低。然而，每搏输出量通常随年龄保持稳定；不会发生生理性下降。\n\n（选项D）由于肾动脉粥样硬化的发展，肾动脉阻力可随年龄增加。这通过激活肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统引起钠潴留和小动脉血管收缩，导致DBP升高（以及由于脉压不变而导致SBP升高）而非ISH，从而引起高血压。\n\n（选项E）交感神经张力增加导致DBP升高（小动脉血管收缩）和脉压增加（收缩力增加导致每搏输出量增加）。交感神经张力增加通常是年龄<50岁患者高血压的促成因素，但由于肾上腺素能受体反应性降低，交感神经张力随年龄的增长而降低。\n\n教育目标：\n老年患者常见的单纯收缩期高血压是由于与年龄相关的动脉硬化（即，弹性蛋白被胶原蛋白替代）以及主动脉和其他大动脉的顺应性降低所致。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the physiological changes in the cardiovascular system associated with aging, specifically the mechanisms leading to isolated systolic hypertension. It requires correlating these age-related changes with the patient's presented blood pressure readings.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the pattern of isolated systolic hypertension from the provided blood pressure values. Then, recall the pathophysiology of aging on the arterial system, particularly the loss of elasticity and its impact on aortic compliance and pulse pressure, to identify the most fitting explanation.",
