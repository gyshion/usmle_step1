He has a known history of coronary artery disease and underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery 3 years ago. As a result of drug therapy, the left ventricular pressure-volume loop changes from a solid to a dashed line, as shown in the graph below (the loop is unchanged in areas where no dashed line is seen): {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "As a result of drug therapy, point 3 on this patient's left ventricular (LV) pressure-volume loop shifts up and to the left; this represents an increase in cardiac contractility that would occur with a positive inotropic agent (eg, digoxin, dobutamine). Although LV preload, represented by the volume at point 1, is unchanged (Choice E), the increase in contractility causes an increase in the fraction of LV volume ejected (ie, increased ejection fraction) and increases stroke volume (the horizontal distance between points 1 and 3). The volume remaining in the left ventricle at the end of systole (end-systolic volume represented by the volume at point 3) is consequently decreased due to the increase in contractility. LV afterload (the maximum pressure reached during blood ejection) is slightly increased due to the increase in contractility. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "由于药物治疗，该患者的左心室（LV）压力-容积环上的点3向上向左移动；这代表心肌收缩力的增加，这种增加会发生在正性肌力药物（例如，地高辛、多巴酚丁胺）的作用下。尽管左心室前负荷，由点1处的容积表示，保持不变（选项E），但收缩力的增加导致左心室射血分数增加（即，射血分数增加），并增加每搏输出量（点1和点3之间的水平距离）。因此，由于收缩力的增加，在收缩末期残留在左心室内的容积（收缩末期容积，由点3处的容积表示）减少。由于收缩力的增加，左心室后负荷（射血期间达到的最大压力）略有增加。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "An increase in cardiac contractility, as depicted by a shift in the left ventricular pressure-volume loop, leads to an increased stroke volume due to a higher ejection fraction, while end-systolic volume decreases. Preload remains unchanged, and afterload may slightly increase.",
