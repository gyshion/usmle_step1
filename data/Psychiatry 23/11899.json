    "en": "An 83-year-old woman is sent to the emergency department from the nursing home where she resides for evaluation of mental status changes. At baseline, she has mild memory impairment but is otherwise cognitively intact, calm, and cooperative with the nursing home staff. Over the past 24 hours, she has become increasingly combative and agitated and stayed up all night. Behavioral interventions and environmental modifications have not been helpful. The patient's medical conditions include hypertension and a history of anxiety and depression. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 84/min, and respirations are 18/min. Neurological examination is normal, but the patient is unable to attend to the conversation, is mildly disoriented, and cannot state the days of the week backwards. Without provocation, she strikes out at a nurse's aide standing next to her. Laboratory results are normal except for urinalysis, which shows an increased presence of white blood cells and is positive for nitrites. Head CT scan is negative. In addition to starting antibiotic therapy, which of the following medications is most appropriate to treat this patient's behavioral symptoms?",

    "en": "Delirium is an acute-onset \"confusional state\" characterized primarily by waxing and waning mental status changes and impaired attention. Disorientation, agitation, psychosis, and sleep disturbances may also occur. Delirium occurs secondary to an underlying medical condition, such as a urinary tract infection, and therefore the primary management is TREATING THE UNDERLYING CAUSE. The elderly and those with preexisting cognitive disorders are at higher risk for delirium and may present with varying degrees of agitation.\n\nHigh-potency, first-generation antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol) and some second-generation antipsychotics (eg, quetiapine) can be used for the ACUTE TREATMENT OF AGITATION AND PSYCHOSIS associated with delirium. Antipsychotic use is appropriate in the treatment of delirium in the elderly if the patient is at RISK OF ACUTE HARM to self or others and behavioral interventions have failed. Under these conditions, the benefits of antipsychotics (ie, the provision of safety) outweigh the potential risks when used at low doses and short durations.\n\n(Choice A) Clozapine is a second-generation antipsychotic that is reserved for patients with treatment-refractory schizophrenia. It is not used for the short-term agitation in delirium due to the risk of agranulocytosis.\n\n(Choice B) Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant with anticholinergic effects that can worsen delirium. It may be used for the treatment of insomnia in other settings.\n\n(Choice D) Lithium is a mood stabilizer. It is not used for the short-term treatment of behavioral dyscontrol in nonmanic patients.\n\n(Choices E and F) Benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, temazepam) can worsen confusional states, particularly in the elderly. Benzodiazepines are appropriate only for the treatment of delirium due to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.\n\nEducational objective:\nDelirium may manifest as acute changes in cognition and behavior. When nonpharmacological interventions are ineffective, low-dose antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol) are the medications of choice to treat the behavioral (eg, severe agitation) and psychotic manifestations of delirium.",
    "zh": "谵妄是一种急性发作的“意识模糊状态”，主要特征是精神状态的变化呈现波动性和注意力受损。也可能出现定向力障碍、激动、精神病和睡眠障碍。谵妄继发于潜在的医学疾病，例如尿路感染，因此主要的治疗是治疗潜在病因。老年人和患有先前存在的认知障碍的人群患谵妄的风险更高，并且可能表现出不同程度的激动。\n\n高效力、第一代抗精神病药（例如氟哌啶醇）和一些第二代抗精神病药（例如喹硫平）可用于谵妄相关的激动和精神病的急性治疗。如果患者有自伤或伤人的急性风险，并且行为干预失败，则在老年人谵妄的治疗中使用抗精神病药是合适的。在这些情况下，当以低剂量和短时间使用时，抗精神病药的益处（即提供安全）超过潜在风险。\n\n(选项 A) 氯氮平是一种第二代抗精神病药，仅用于治疗对治疗难治的 schizo​​phrenia 患者。由于粒细胞缺乏症的风险，它不用于谵妄中的短期激动。\n\n(选项 B) 多虑平是一种具有抗胆碱能作用的三环类抗抑郁药，可加重谵妄。它可用于其他情况下的失眠治疗。\n\n(选项 D) 锂是一种情绪稳定剂。它不用于非躁狂症患者的行为失控的短期治疗。\n\n(选项 E 和 F) 苯二氮卓类药物（例如劳拉西泮、替马西泮）会加重意识模糊状态，尤其是在老年人中。苯二氮卓类药物仅适用于治疗因酒精或苯二氮卓类药物戒断引起的谵妄。\n\n教育目标：\n谵妄可能表现为认知和行为的急性变化。当非药物干预无效时，低剂量抗精神病药（例如氟哌啶醇）是治疗谵妄的行为（例如，严重激动）和精神病表现的首选药物。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the management of delirium, specifically the pharmacological treatment of agitation and psychosis in elderly patients with delirium secondary to an underlying medical condition. It requires differentiating appropriate agents from those that may exacerbate the condition.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves first identifying the diagnosis of delirium based on the acute change in mental status and fluctuating course. Then, recognizing that the underlying cause (likely UTI given urinalysis) needs treatment, and considering the need for pharmacotherapy to manage severe agitation that is unresponsive to non-pharmacological measures. Finally, selecting an antipsychotic agent known to be effective and relatively safe for short-term use in delirium, while avoiding agents that can worsen confusion or have significant side effects.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对谵妄治疗的理解，特别是对老年患者谵妄继发于潜在医学疾病的激动和精神病进行药物治疗。它需要区分合适的药物和可能加重病情的药物。\n\n解决此问题的方法首先是根据精神状态的急性变化和波动过程确定谵妄的诊断。然后，认识到潜在病因（考虑到尿液分析，很可能是尿路感染）需要治疗，并考虑需要药物治疗来控制对非药物措施无反应的严重激动。最后，选择一种已知对谵妄短期使用有效且相对安全的抗精神病药，同时避免使用可能加重意识模糊或有明显副作用的药物。"
