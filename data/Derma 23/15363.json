    "en": "A 17-year-old boy comes to the office due to a facial lesion. The patient noticed a small area of rough skin on his lower lip several weeks ago, which has progressively enlarged. He reports no pain or itching. The patient had eczema during early childhood but has had no other chronic medical conditions. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination findings are shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}. There are no other skin rashes, oral lesions, or enlarged lymph nodes. Which of the following histopathological findings are most likely present in this patient's skin lesion?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a common cutaneous wart (ie, verruca vulgaris). Cutaneous warts are caused by human papillomavirus, which also causes anogenital warts (ie, condyloma acuminata). The virus is usually transmitted by direct contact and is most common in children, adolescents, and young adults.\n\nCutaneous warts typically present as skin-colored papules or well-circumscribed plaques. They may also form complex filiform lesions. On the palms or soles (ie, palmar, plantar warts), they commonly present as tender plaques or nodules that disrupt the normal skin striae.\n\nThe diagnosis of cutaneous warts is often apparent based on gross findings. Key findings on magnified view (ie, dermoscopy) include a roughened surface and small black dots representing thrombosed capillaries. Biopsy is usually not needed but can confirm the diagnosis in atypical cases. Histopathologic findings include:\n\n*   Epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis) with eosinophilic inclusions and keratohyaline granules\n*   Thickened stratum corneum (hyperkeratosis)\n*   Papilloma formation\n*   Perinuclear cytoplasmic vacuolization (koilocytosis)\n\n(Choice A) Intraepidermal fracturing (acantholysis) and formation of multinucleated cells are seen in herpes simplex labialis. Although this condition is often found on the lips and perioral skin, it presents with acute/recurrent blisters and ulcers.\n\n(Choice C) Impetigo is a gram-positive skin infection that generates a neutrophilic infiltrate. It presents with erythema, blistering, and shallow ulcers with honey-colored crusts.\n\n(Choice D) Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disorder associated with antibodies against hemidesmosomes, leading to subepidermal complement activation and cleavage. It is most common at age >60 and typically presents with pruritic plaques, erosions, and tense bullae.\n\nEducational objective: Cutaneous warts (ie, verruca vulgaris) are caused by human papillomavirus and typically present as rough, skin-colored papules. If necessary, biopsy can confirm the diagnosis and shows epidermal hyperplasia, thickened stratum corneum, papilloma formation, and cytoplasmic vacuolization. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有常见的皮肤疣（即寻常疣）。皮肤疣由人乳头瘤病毒引起，该病毒也引起肛门生殖器疣（即尖锐湿疣）。该病毒通常通过直接接触传播，在儿童、青少年和年轻人中最常见。\n\n皮肤疣通常表现为肤色丘疹或界限清楚的斑块。它们也可能形成复杂的丝状病变。在手掌或足底（即掌跖疣）上，它们通常表现为触痛性斑块或结节，破坏正常的皮肤纹理。\n\n皮肤疣的诊断通常基于肉眼观察。放大视图（即皮肤镜检查）的关键发现包括粗糙的表面和代表血栓毛细血管的小黑点。通常不需要活检，但可以在非典型病例中确认诊断。组织病理学发现包括：\n\n*   表皮增生（棘皮症），伴嗜酸性包涵体和角质透明颗粒\n*   角质层增厚（角化过度）\n*   乳头瘤形成\n*   核周细胞质空泡变性（空泡变性）\n\n（选项A）单纯疱疹唇炎可见表皮内断裂（棘解）和多核细胞形成。尽管这种情况经常出现在嘴唇和口周皮肤上，但其表现为急性和复发性水疱和溃疡。\n\n（选项C）脓疱病是一种革兰氏阳性皮肤感染，可产生中性粒细胞浸润。它表现为红斑、水疱和带有蜜色痂的浅溃疡。\n\n（选项D）大疱性类天疱疮是一种自身免疫性疾病，与针对半桥粒的抗体相关，导致表皮下补体激活和裂解。它在60岁以上的人群中最常见，通常表现为瘙痒性斑块、糜烂和紧张性大疱。\n\n教育目标：皮肤疣（即寻常疣）由人乳头瘤病毒引起，通常表现为粗糙的肤色丘疹。如有必要，活检可以确认诊断，并显示表皮增生、角质层增厚、乳头瘤形成和细胞质空泡变性。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}}"
