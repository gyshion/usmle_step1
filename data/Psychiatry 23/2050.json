    "en": "A 26-year-old woman comes to the office due to recent weight gain. She has eaten more than usual over the last 5 months, has gained 3.2 kg (7 lb), and feels guilty and depressed about it. Further questioning reveals that she consumes a large pizza and two large bags of chips in one sitting several times a week. Afterward, the patient feels ashamed about being unable to control her intake and fasts to make up for it. She is very distressed about being unable to lose weight despite exercising 2-3 hours a day. Vital signs are within normal limits. BMI is 23.7 kg/m². Despite being told that her BMI is normal, the patient insists that she is overweight.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's recurrent episodes of eating large amounts of food and sense of loss of control, together with compensatory behaviors (fasting, exercising) to prevent weight gain, is consistent with BULIMIA NERVOSA (BN). Patients with BN are excessively preoccupied with their weight and body shape. Although self-induced vomiting is the most common compensatory behavior, patients may also fast and exercise excessively or misuse laxatives, enemas, diuretics, or diet pills. In DSM-5, both binges and inappropriate compensatory behaviors must occur at least once a week for 3 months for diagnosis. Patients with BN are NORMAL WEIGHT OR OVERWEIGHT, in contrast to individuals with anorexia nervosa.\n\nSigns of BN in patients who vomit regularly may include hypotension, tachycardia, dry skin, menstrual irregularities, erosion of dental enamel, parotid hypertrophy, calloused knuckles, and electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, metabolic alkalosis).\n\n(Choice A) This patient's depressive and guilty feelings after a binge are characteristic of BN.\n(Choice B) Both BN and anorexia nervosa may be characterized by preoccupation with weight, binge eating, and compensatory behavior (there is a binge-eating/purging subtype of anorexia). Patients with anorexia nervosa have significantly low body weight (BMI <18.5 kg/m²). In BN, body weight is typically normal to increased.\n(Choice C) In binge-eating disorder, patients engage in recurrent episodes of binge eating but do not use inappropriate compensatory behaviors as in BN.\n(Choice D) Body dysmorphic disorder is characterized by intense preoccupation with a perceived defect in physical appearance leading to significant functional impairment. It is not diagnosed when weight gain is the preoccupation of an individual who meets the criteria for an eating disorder.\n(Choice F) This patient's 5-month history of frequent binge-eating episodes, followed by fasting and exercising, meets criteria for BN.\n\nEducational objective:\nBulimia nervosa (BN) is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain (eg, fasting, exercising, vomiting, using laxatives). In contrast to anorexia nervosa, BN patients are normal weight or overweight.",
    "zh": "该患者反复出现大量进食，并失去控制感，同时伴有代偿行为（禁食、锻炼）以防止体重增加，这与神经性贪食症（BN）一致。BN患者过度关注体重和体型。虽然自我诱发呕吐是最常见的代偿行为，但患者也可能禁食和过度运动，或滥用泻药、灌肠剂、利尿剂或减肥药。在DSM-5中，暴食和不适当的代偿行为必须每周至少发生一次，持续3个月才能诊断。BN患者体重正常或超重，这与神经性厌食症患者形成对比。\n\n经常呕吐的BN患者的体征可能包括低血压、心动过速、皮肤干燥、月经不规律、牙釉质侵蚀、腮腺肥大、关节粗糙和电解质异常（例如，低钾血症、低氯血症、代谢性碱中毒）。\n\n（选项A）该患者暴食后的抑郁和内疚感是BN的特征。\n（选项B）BN和神经性厌食症都可能以对体重的关注、暴食和代偿行为为特征（厌食症有一种暴食/清除亚型）。神经性厌食症患者的体重明显偏低（BMI <18.5 kg/m²）。在BN中，体重通常正常或增加。\n（选项C）在暴食症中，患者会反复出现暴食发作，但不会像BN那样使用不适当的代偿行为。\n（选项D）躯体变形障碍的特征是强烈关注对身体外观的感知缺陷，从而导致严重的功\n能障碍。当体重增加是满足进食障碍标准的个体的关注点时，不会诊断此病。\n（选项F）该患者5个月来频繁发生暴食发作，然后禁食和锻炼，符合BN的标准。\n\n教育目标：\n神经性贪食症（BN）的特征是反复出现暴食发作，然后进行代偿行为以防止体重增加（例如，禁食、锻炼、呕吐、使用泻药）。与神经性厌食症相比，BN患者的体重正常或超重。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the diagnostic criteria for various eating disorders, specifically differentiating between bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, and anorexia nervosa based on clinical presentation, body weight, and compensatory behaviors.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully analyze the patient's reported eating patterns, compensatory behaviors, body weight, and psychological distress related to body image and weight. Compare these findings against the diagnostic criteria for each eating disorder listed in the options to identify the most fitting diagnosis.",
