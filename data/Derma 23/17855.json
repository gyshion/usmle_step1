  "correct_answer": "D",

    "en": "This patient with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus has a nonhealing wound with evidence of ongoing inflammation (eg, erythema).\n\nWound healing normally progress through the inflammatory, proliferative, and remodeling phases. In the days after the initial injury, neutrophils and other immune cells are recruited to the wound and produce an inflammatory response that helps prevent bacterial overgrowth in the nutrient-rich environment of a healing wound. However, this inflammation also impairs formation of granulation tissue that is needed for normal wound healing. As healing progresses, release of growth factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-10) by macrophages and regulatory T cells suppresses the inflammatory response, facilitating fibroblast proliferation and reepithelialization of the wound.\n\nIn patients with diabetes mellitus, constitutively elevated blood glucose increases inflammation by stimulating the release of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species from neutrophils (Choice E). Elevated glucose also leads to a marked decrease in IL-10 production that contributes to the increased susceptibility for chronic, nonhealing wounds and ulcers in patients with uncontrolled diabetes.\n\n(Choice A) Bradykinin is a vasoactive inflammatory mediator that is normally produced by endothelial cells, macrophages, and platelets during the inflammatory phase of wound healing. Further upregulation of inflammatory mediators in patients with diabetes would most likely have a negative effect on fibroblast proliferation and reepithelization.\n\n(Choice B) Although a baseline level of cortisol production is required for normal wound healing, excess cortisol can impair both the inflammatory and proliferative components of wound healing. Patients with diabetes tend to have elevated cortisol levels; therefore, further cortisol elevation would not improve wound healing.\n\n(Choice C) Excess glucose inhibits fibroblast migration and results in the nonenzymatic glycation of collagen fibers, which can prevent collagen cross-linking and can impair the structural integrity of a wound healing.\n\nEducational objective:\nElevated blood glucose induces the release of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines from neutrophils while inhibiting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines needed for fibroblast proliferation and reepithelialization in a healing wound. As a result, patients with uncontrolled diabetes frequently have nonhealing wounds with evidence of ongoing inflammation.",
    "zh": "该患者有未控制的糖尿病病史，且伤口不愈合，有持续性炎症的证据（例如，红斑）。\n\n伤口愈合通常经历炎症期、增殖期和重塑期。 在最初损伤后的几天内，中性粒细胞和其他免疫细胞被募集到伤口，并产生炎症反应，这有助于防止细菌在富含营养的愈合伤口环境中过度生长。 然而，这种炎症也会损害肉芽组织的形成，而肉芽组织是正常伤口愈合所必需的。 随着愈合的进展，巨噬细胞和调节性T细胞释放生长因子和抗炎细胞因子（例如，IL-10）会抑制炎症反应，促进成纤维细胞增殖和伤口再上皮化。\n\n在糖尿病患者中，持续升高的血糖通过刺激中性粒细胞释放促炎细胞因子和活性氧而增加炎症（选项E）。 血糖升高还会导致IL-10的产生显着减少，这会导致未控制的糖尿病患者更容易发生慢性、不愈合的伤口和溃疡。\n\n（选项A）缓激肽是一种血管活性炎症介质，通常在伤口愈合的炎症期由内皮细胞、巨噬细胞和血小板产生。 在糖尿病患者中，炎症介质的进一步上调最有可能对成纤维细胞增殖和再上皮化产生负面影响。\n\n（选项B）虽然需要基线水平的皮质醇产生才能进行正常的伤口愈合，但过量的皮质醇会损害伤口愈合的炎症和增殖成分。 糖尿病患者往往有皮质醇水平升高； 因此，进一步的皮质醇升高不会改善伤口愈合。\n\n（选项C）过量的葡萄糖会抑制成纤维细胞的迁移，并导致胶原纤维的非酶促糖基化，这会阻止胶原交联并会损害伤口愈合的结构完整性。\n\n教育目标：\n血糖升高会诱导中性粒细胞释放活性氧和促炎细胞因子，同时抑制愈合伤口中成纤维细胞增殖和再上皮化所需的抗炎细胞因子的产生。 因此，未控制的糖尿病患者经常会发生不愈合的伤口，并有持续性炎症的证据。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the wound healing process, specifically the role of inflammation and anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 in promoting fibroblast proliferation and reepithelialization, especially in the context of diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe key to solving this question is understanding that uncontrolled diabetes leads to increased inflammation and decreased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, impairing wound healing. Therefore, upregulating the production of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, would be the most likely to improve fibroblast proliferation and reepithelialization.",
    "zh": "本题考察对伤口愈合过程的了解，特别是炎症和抗炎细胞因子（如IL-10）在促进成纤维细胞增殖和再上皮化中的作用，尤其是在糖尿病的情况下。\n\n解决此问题的关键是了解未控制的糖尿病会导致炎症增加和抗炎细胞因子产生减少，从而损害伤口愈合。 因此，上调抗炎细胞因子IL-10的产生最有可能改善成纤维细胞的增殖和再上皮化。"
