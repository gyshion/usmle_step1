    "en": "A 35-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and fever. Her symptoms began 24 hours ago, and she has been unable to eat or drink anything since. She has a 3-year-old daughter who had similar symptoms 2 days earlier but is now fine. Laboratory studies show a blood glucose level of 82 mg/dL despite her 24-hour fast. Maintenance of this patient's blood glucose levels is facilitated by hepatic conversion of pyruvate into glucose.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "During gluconeogenesis, substances such as lactate and alanine are converted to pyruvate. However, pyruvate cannot be converted to phosphoenolpyruvate directly as pyruvate kinase is unidirectional. To convert pyruvate to phosphenolpyruvate, prvuvate frist undergoes biotin-dependent carboxylation to oxaloacetate in the mitochondria. This reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase. The activity of pyruvate carboxylase is increased by acetyl-CoA. This critical regulatory step diverts prvuvate to prvuvate dehydrogenase when acetyl-CoA levels are too low, preventing the cell from becoming energy starved. When acetyl-CoA levels are high (as with increased beta oxidation of fatty acids during fasting), pyruvate carboxylase can operate at full capacity and convert most of the pyruvate into oxaloacetate for use in gluconeogenesis.\n\n(Choice B) Muscle converts pyruvate to alanine via transamination, which is then transported to the liver where it is converted back to prvuvate for use in gluconeogenesis. Alanine allosterically inhibits pyruvate kinase, preventing phosphoenolpyruvate from being consumed by glycolysis during the gluconeogenic state.\n\n(Choice C) Citrate is formed within mitochondria in the first reaction of the Krebs cycle, and elevated levels act as an indicator of high cellular energy stores and abundant biosynthetic intermediates. Citrate is therefore an important positive regulator of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, key enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis, respectively.\n\n(Choice D) Regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis occurs mainly through the inverse regulation of phosphofructokinase-1 and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. High levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate activate phosphofructokinase-1 and accelerate glycolysis; low levels disinhibit fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and promote gluconeogenesis.\n\n(Choice E) Lactate is an important source of carbon atoms for glucose synthesis during gluconeogenesis. During anaerobic glycolysis in skeletal muscle, pyruvate is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. Lactate formed in the contracting muscles is released into the bloodstream and transported to the liver, where it is converted back into glucose.\n\n(Choice F) Oxaloacetate is the product of pyruvate carboxylase during gluconeogenesis. As such, increased levels of oxaloacetate would decrease the activity of the enzyme.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nAcetyl-CoA stimulates gluconeogenesis by increasing the activity of pyruvate carboxylase when acetyl-CoA is abundant. This regulatory step allows prvuvate to be shunted toward acetyl-CoA production when acetyl-CoA levels are low, preventing the cell from becoming depleted of energy.",
    "zh": "在糖异生过程中，乳酸和丙氨酸等物质会被转化为丙酮酸。然而，丙酮酸不能直接转化为磷酸烯醇丙酮酸，因为丙酮酸激酶是单向的。为了将丙酮酸转化为磷酸烯醇丙酮酸，丙酮酸首先在mitochondria中经过生物素依赖性羧化作用转化为草酰乙酸。该反应由丙酮酸羧化酶催化。乙酰辅酶A会增加丙酮酸羧化酶的活性。当乙酰辅酶A水平过低时，这一关键的调节步骤会将丙酮酸转移到丙酮酸脱氢酶，从而防止细胞能量耗竭。当乙酰辅酶A水平较高时（如禁食期间脂肪酸β氧化增加），丙酮酸羧化酶可以满负荷运转，并将大部分丙酮酸转化为草酰乙酸，用于糖异生。\n\n(选项 B) 肌肉通过转氨作用将丙酮酸转化为丙氨酸，然后将其转运到肝脏，在那里它又被转化为丙酮酸，用于糖异生。丙氨酸变构抑制丙酮酸激酶，防止在糖异生状态下磷酸烯醇丙酮酸被糖酵解消耗。\n\n(选项 C) 柠檬酸在Krebs循环的第一个反应中形成于线粒体内，并且水平升高是细胞能量储存量高和生物合成中间体丰富的指标。因此，柠檬酸是乙酰辅酶A羧化酶和果糖-1,6-二磷酸酶的重要正向调节剂，它们分别是参与脂肪酸合成和糖异生的关键酶。\n\n(选项 D) 糖酵解和糖异生的调节主要通过果糖2,6-二磷酸对磷酸果糖激酶-1和果糖1,6-二磷酸酶的逆向调节来实现。高水平的果糖2,6-二磷酸会激活磷酸果糖激酶-1并加速糖酵解；低水平的果糖2,6-二磷酸会解除对果糖1,6-二磷酸酶的抑制并促进糖异生。\n\n(选项 E) 乳酸是糖异生过程中合成葡萄糖的重要碳原子来源。在骨骼肌的无氧糖酵解过程中，丙酮酸被乳酸脱氢酶还原为乳酸。在收缩的肌肉中形成的乳酸被释放到血液中并输送到肝脏，在那里它又被转化为葡萄糖。\n\n(选项 F) 草酰乙酸是糖异生过程中丙酮酸羧化酶的产物。因此，草酰乙酸水平升高会降低该酶的活性。\n\n教学目标：\n\n当乙酰辅酶A含量丰富时，乙酰辅酶A通过增加丙酮酸羧化酶的活性来刺激糖异生。当乙酰辅酶A水平较低时，这一调节步骤允许丙酮酸被转移到乙酰辅酶A的产生，从而防止细胞耗竭能量。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of gluconeogenesis and the regulation of pyruvate carboxylase. Specifically, it asks about the allosteric activator of pyruvate carboxylase, the first enzyme in the gluconeogenic pathway. \n\nTo solve this question, recall that acetyl-CoA is an allosteric activator of pyruvate carboxylase, which converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate in the mitochondria. Increased levels of acetyl-CoA, often indicative of fatty acid oxidation, signal the need for gluconeogenesis.",
