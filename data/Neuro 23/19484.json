    "en": "A 62-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up. The patient has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Over the past 2 years, he has had burning pain and pins and needle sensations in his feet, which is worse at nighttime. Nortriptyline was prescribed, and the dosage was gradually increased. Currently, the patient takes the maximal recommended dose but states the symptoms are not well controlled. He reports no drug adverse effects. Other medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Blood pressure is 124/70 mm Hg and pulse is 68/min. Physical examination shows decreased light touch and pain sensation in the feet. Ankle reflexes are decreased bilaterally. His most recent hemoglobin A1c level is 7.0%. Appropriate foot care is advised, and additional pharmacotherapy for the patient's symptoms is planned.",
    "zh": "一名62岁男性前来复诊。患者有10年2型糖尿病病史。在过去的2年里，他感到脚部有烧灼痛和针刺感，夜间症状加重。处方了去甲替林，并逐渐增加剂量。目前，患者服用最大推荐剂量，但表示症状控制不佳。他报告没有药物不良反应。其他病史包括高血压和高脂血症。血压为124/70 mmHg，脉搏为68/min。体格检查显示脚部的触觉和痛觉减退。双侧踝反射减弱。他最近的糖化血红蛋白A1c水平为7.0%。建议适当的足部护理，并计划对患者的症状进行额外的药物治疗。"

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient is being treated with nortriptyline, a TCA drug. His symptoms are uncontrolled; therefore, an additional medication with a different mechanism of action should be added to avoid additive or potentially even synergistic adverse effects. Gabapentin does not inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine in the CNS but rather inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters so it is less likely to compound the adverse effects of a TCA.\n\n(Choices A and B) Amitriptyline and desipramine, like nortriptyline, are both TCAs and should not be used concurrently because the combination can result in excess toxicity (eg, delirium, arrhythmias, seizures).\n\n(Choices C and E) Duloxetine and venlafaxine are both SNRIs, which, like TCAs, inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine uptake in the CNS; therefore, TCAs and SNRIs are not typically used in combination.\n\nEducational objective:\nPain due to diabetic neuropathy may be difficult to control and require multiple medications. To reduce the risk of adverse effects and improve pain control, medications should work through different mechanisms. One such combination may include a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, nortriptyline) and an anticonvulsant (eg, gabapentin).",
    "zh": "该患者正在接受去甲替林的治疗，这是一种三环类抗抑郁药(TCA)。他的症状未得到控制；因此，应加入具有不同作用机制的附加药物，以避免累加或甚至协同的不良反应。加巴喷丁不抑制中枢神经系统中的血清素和去甲肾上腺素，而是抑制兴奋性神经递质的释放，因此不太可能加重TCA的不良反应。\n\n（选项A和B）阿米替林和地昔帕明与去甲替林一样，都是TCA，不应同时使用，因为这种组合可能导致过度毒性（例如，谵妄、心律失常、癫痫发作）。\n\n（选项C和E）度洛西汀和文拉法辛都是SNRI，与TCA一样，抑制中枢神经系统中血清素和去甲肾上腺素的摄取；因此，TCA和SNRI通常不联合使用。\n\n教育目标：\n由于糖尿病神经病变引起的疼痛可能难以控制，需要多种药物。为了降低不良反应的风险并改善疼痛控制，药物应通过不同的机制起作用。这种组合可以包括三环类抗抑郁药（例如，去甲替林）和抗惊厥药（例如，加巴喷丁）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pharmacologic management of diabetic neuropathy, specifically the mechanisms of action of different classes of medications used for neuropathic pain and the importance of avoiding drug-drug interactions.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the mechanism of action of the current medication (nortriptyline, a TCA) and then select an option with a different mechanism of action that would not interact with the current medication. Consider the potential for additive adverse effects when combining medications.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试了对糖尿病神经病变的药理学治疗的知识，特别是用于神经性疼痛的各种药物的作用机制以及避免药物相互作用的重要性。\n\n最好的方法是确定当前药物（去甲替林，一种TCA）的作用机制，然后选择具有不同作用机制的选项，该选项不会与当前药物相互作用。当联合用药时，考虑累加不良反应的可能性。"
