    "en": "A 48-year-old man comes to the office with his wife for follow-up of major depressive disorder. The patient has been taking sertraline for 2 years, and due to a recurrence of depression, he started bupropion and weekly cognitive behavioral therapy 3 weeks ago. Since then, his energy level has improved, and he is working on communicating more with his wife about his emotions. The patient has no suicidal ideation and is hopeful that he will feel better with continued treatment. A week later, his wife calls the office and states that her husband died by suicide a few days ago. She is tearful on the phone and says, \"I thought that he was doing better. I don't understand how this happened.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate response?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The sudden, unexpected loss of a loved one produces intense, acute grief. When the cause of death is suicide, the emotional pain may be further complicated by a range of difficult emotions including guilt and anger as well as difficulty comprehending what happened. The need to make sense of the suicide may be especially intense when the family member perceives that the patient was doing better beforehand, as in this case.\n\nAfter a patient's death, disclosure of pertinent medical history (including psychiatric history) is permitted to a personal representative (eg, spouse, parent) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The immediate postsuicide response should acknowledge the bereaved individual's severe emotional distress and offer to answer questions related to clinical course and treatment that may help to make sense of what happened. This discussion should be conducted in an open-ended fashion, without making any assumptions about how the bereaved individual is feeling or what they want to know. It is particularly important to help alleviate any sense of inappropriate guilt that the bereaved individuals may be experiencing and make them aware of additional resources to assist with suicide bereavement if needed (eg, grief counseling, suicide bereavement support groups).\n\n(Choice A) Inquiring if the patient was taking his medication as prescribed inappropriately focuses the conversation on trying to find out specific reasons for the suicide rather than responding to the wife's acute, emotional distress in a compassionate manner that allows for open discussion.\n\n(Choice C) This response attributes the suicide to medication changes when it is unclear to what extent, if any, this was a contributing factor.\n\n(Choice D) This statement empathizes with the wife's shock but asks her to share details of her husband's death, which she may not feel comfortable doing. It is preferable to allow the wife to express her grief and ask any questions she may have about her husband's illness and treatment.\n\n(Choice E) Asking the wife if she noticed anything unusual in the week leading up to the suicide may have the unintended consequence of making her feel that she missed signs and is in some way to blame.\n\nEducational objective:\nResponding to bereaved individuals following a suicide requires a compassionate and open-ended approach. Clinicians should acknowledge the bereaved individual's emotional distress and offer to answer any questions pertaining to clinical course and treatment that may help to make sense of what happened.",
    "zh": "突如其来且意想不到的失去亲人会产生强烈、急性的悲伤。当死亡原因是自杀时，这种情绪痛苦可能会因为一系列困难的情绪而变得更加复杂，包括内疚和愤怒，以及难以理解发生了什么。当家庭成员认为患者事先情况更好时，需要理解自杀的愿望可能会特别强烈，就像在这种情况下一样。\n\n在患者去世后，根据《健康保险流通与责任法案》(HIPAA)，允许向个人代表（例如，配偶、父母）披露相关的病史（包括精神病史）。自杀后的即时反应应承认丧亲者的严重情绪困扰，并主动回答与临床病程和治疗相关的问题，这可能有助于理解发生了什么。这种讨论应该以开放的方式进行，不要对丧亲者的感受或他们想知道什么做出任何假设。特别重要的是，帮助减轻丧亲者可能正在经历的任何不适当的内疚感，并让他们了解额外的资源，以便在需要时协助自杀丧亲（例如，悲伤咨询、自杀丧亲支持小组）。\n\n（选项 A）询问患者是否按处方服药，这种做法不恰当地将谈话的重点放在试图找出自杀的具体原因上，而不是以一种富有同情心的方式回应妻子的急性情绪困扰，从而允许公开讨论。\n\n（选项 C）这种回应将自杀归咎于药物变化，但尚不清楚这在多大程度上（如果有的话）是促成因素。\n\n（选项 D）此声明同情妻子的震惊，但要求她分享她丈夫死亡的细节，她可能不愿意这样做。最好让妻子表达她的悲伤，并提出她可能对她丈夫的疾病和治疗提出的任何问题。\n\n（选项 E）询问妻子在自杀前的一周内是否注意到任何异常情况，这可能会产生意想不到的后果，让她觉得自己错过了迹象，并在某种程度上受到责备。\n\n教育目标：\n对自杀后的丧亲者的回应需要一种富有同情心和开放的方式。临床医生应承认丧亲者的情绪困扰，并主动回答与临床病程和治疗相关的任何问题，这可能有助于理解发生了什么。"

    "en": "This question assesses the appropriate response to a family member following a patient's suicide, emphasizing the importance of empathy, acknowledgment of emotional distress, and offering support.
