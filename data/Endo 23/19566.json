    "en": "Skeletal muscle contraction requires the hydrolysis of ATP, which is only present in small amounts within the sarcoplasma. There are 3 main methods of ATP production during intense exercise, and the primary method varies with exercise duration.\n\nThe phosphocreatine shuttle is the primary source of ATP at the beginning (eg, first 10 sec) of exercise. As ATP is consumed by the muscle cell, creatine kinase removes inorganic phosphate molecules from phosphocreatine and combines them with ADP to regenerate ATP. Phosphocreatine supplies a brief burst of energy before being quickly depleted. Increased dietary intake of creatine can enhance this phase of ATP production by increasing sarcoplasmic phosphocreatine stores.\n\nOnce phosphocreatine is depleted, anaerobic glycolysis becomes the primary source of ATP for the next stage of exercise (eg, 10 to 60 sec). Muscle glycogen is rapidly broken down into glucose, which is converted to pyruvate (generating ATP in the process) and then lactic acid (Choice C). However, the process quickly becomes limited by reduced sarcoplasmic pH caused by the accumulation of lactic acid.\n\nOxidative phosphorylation is the slowest of the 3 sources to reach peak production, but it is the most efficient generator of ATP and serves as the primary energy source for the remainder of exercise (eg, >60 sec). Pyruvate generated during glycolysis along with free fatty acids taken up from the circulation are converted to acetyl-coenzyme A, which is catabolized within the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) (Choice B). This process produces NADH and FADH2, which then enter the electron transport chain, where electrons are transferred to oxygen and large quantities of ATP are generated.\n\n(Choices A and D) Amino acids and ketone bodies are sometimes used as an energy source for oxidative phosphorylation but only after glycogen and free fatty acid stores are depleted. Because amino acids are derived from muscle protein, their use as an energy source leads to muscle breakdown.\n\nEducational objective:\nIntense exercise creates a high demand for ATP, and the primary method of ATP production varies with the duration of exercise. The phosphocreatine shuttle is the primary source of ATP at the beginning of exercise, followed sequentially by anaerobic glycolysis and then oxidative phosphorylation. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "骨骼肌收缩需要ATP的水解，而ATP仅在肌浆中少量存在。剧烈运动期间有3种主要的ATP产生方法，主要方法随运动持续时间而变化。\n\n磷酸肌酸穿梭系统是运动开始时（例如，最初10秒）ATP的主要来源。当肌肉细胞消耗ATP时，肌酸激酶从磷酸肌酸中去除无机磷酸分子，并将其与ADP结合以再生ATP。磷酸肌酸提供短暂的能量爆发，然后迅速耗尽。增加膳食中肌酸的摄入可以通过增加肌浆磷酸肌酸的储存来增强ATP产生的这一阶段。\n\n一旦磷酸肌酸耗尽，无氧糖酵解成为运动下一阶段（例如，10至60秒）ATP的主要来源。肌肉糖原迅速分解成葡萄糖，葡萄糖转化为丙酮酸（在此过程中产生ATP），然后转化为乳酸（选项C）。然而，由于乳酸的积累导致肌浆pH值降低，该过程很快受到限制。\n\n氧化磷酸化是3种来源中最慢达到峰值产生的，但它是最有效的ATP产生器，并作为运动剩余时间的主要能量来源（例如，>60秒）。糖酵解过程中产生的丙酮酸以及从循环中摄取的游离脂肪酸转化为乙酰辅酶A，乙酰辅酶A在柠檬酸循环（Krebs循环）中被分解（选项B）。该过程产生NADH和FADH2，然后进入电子传递链，电子传递给氧气，并产生大量的ATP。\n\n（选项A和D）氨基酸和酮体有时被用作氧化磷酸化的能量来源，但仅在糖原和游离脂肪酸储存耗尽后。由于氨基酸来源于肌肉蛋白，因此将其用作能量来源会导致肌肉分解。\n\n教育目标：\n剧烈运动会产生对ATP的高需求，ATP的主要产生方法随运动持续时间而变化。磷酸肌酸穿梭系统是运动开始时ATP的主要来源，其次是无氧糖酵解，然后是氧化磷酸化。 {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the different energy systems used by skeletal muscle during exercise, specifically the phosphocreatine system, anaerobic glycolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation. It requires understanding the time course and relative contribution of each system during different phases of exercise.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the red curve represents a rapidly declining energy source that is most active at the beginning of exercise. This pattern is characteristic of the phosphocreatine system, which provides a quick burst of energy for the first few seconds of intense activity.",
