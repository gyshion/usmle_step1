  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient is declining diagnostic tests and requesting to leave the hospital. Whenever a patient refuses medical intervention, decision-making capacity must be assessed. Part of this process includes explaining the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the proposed intervention, including the risks of no intervention, so that the patient can make an informed medical decision.\n\nAlcohol intoxication can result in impaired memory, cognition, and judgment, resulting in an impaired ability to understand information or fully appreciate the consequences of one's decisions. Therefore, given this patient's recent alcohol ingestion, the physician must be especially careful to assess the patient's ability to understand the risks of refusing further evaluation. The patient should not be discharged unless his decision-making capacity is first judged to be intact (Choice B). If the patient is able to communicate an understanding of his condition and the risks of declining treatment but still refuses, it would be appropriate to discharge him against medical advice.\n\n(Choice A) A surrogate decision-maker, such as the patient's wife, would be necessary only if the patient was judged to lack decision-making capacity.\n\n(Choices C and E) This patient is not at risk of imminent harm, and the blood alcohol level alone is not a criterion for holding him involuntarily. The patient's capacity to make decisions must be assessed. Patients with decision-making capacity have the right to refuse treatment, even if the decision seems unwise.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients who refuse medical interventions must be assessed for decision-making capacity. Patients with decision-making capacity have the right to refuse treatment.",
    "zh": "该患者拒绝进行诊断性检查并要求离开医院。每当患者拒绝医疗干预时，必须评估其决策能力。此过程的一部分包括解释拟议干预措施的风险、益处和替代方案，包括不干预的风险，以便患者能够做出知情的医疗决定。\n\n酒精中毒可导致记忆力、认知和判断力受损，从而导致理解信息或充分认识自己决定的后果的能力受损。因此，鉴于该患者最近摄入了酒精，医生必须特别小心地评估患者理解拒绝进一步评估的风险的能力。除非首先判断患者的决策能力完好（选项 B），否则不应出院。如果患者能够沟通对自己的病情和拒绝治疗的风险的理解，但仍然拒绝，则可以根据医嘱将其出院。\n\n（选项 A）只有当患者被认为缺乏决策能力时，才需要替代决策者，例如患者的妻子。\n\n（选项 C 和 E）该患者没有迫在眉睫的危险，单独的血醇水平不是非自愿拘留他的标准。必须评估患者的决策能力。具有决策能力的患者有权拒绝治疗，即使该决定看起来不明智。\n\n教育目标：\n拒绝医疗干预的患者必须进行决策能力的评估。具有决策能力的患者有权拒绝治疗。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to assess a patient's decision-making capacity, especially in the context of alcohol intoxication and refusal of medical treatment. It emphasizes the importance of informed consent and patient autonomy.\n\nThe best approach is to first assess the patient's decision-making capacity by explaining the risks and benefits of the proposed intervention and the risks of refusing treatment. If the patient demonstrates understanding and still refuses, they generally have the right to do so, even if the decision seems unwise.",
