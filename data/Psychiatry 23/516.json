    "en": "A 42-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia is brought to the clinic by her parents after attempting to drink rubbing alcohol in response to voices telling her to kill herself. The patient believes that a television newscaster is sending her secret messages and that the devil injects her with poison at night while she is sleeping. She first developed symptoms at age 23 and has had 7 previous psychiatric hospitalizations and 2 suicide attempts. Trials of haloperidol, risperidone, and olanzapine have yielded minimal improvement. Her medical conditions include hypertension and mild obesity. Physical examination is normal. Medication therapy with clozapine is initiated.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is A. The second-generation antipsychotic clozapine is the only antipsychotic that has consistently shown superior efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia and schizophrenia associated with persistent suicidality. Clozapine has affinity for multiple dopamine and serotonin receptors, but the precise pharmacological mechanism responsible for its superior efficacy is unknown. Clozapine binds loosely and transiently to dopamine D2 receptors, causing significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptoms compared to first-generation antipsychotics.\n\nNeutropenia (<1000 cells/mm³) and the potential for life-threatening agranulocytosis are the major adverse effects of clozapine. The risk of agranulocytosis is approximately 1%; therefore, treatment requires regular monitoring of the patient's absolute neutrophil count. Treatment should be stopped if neutropenia occurs. Seizures and myocarditis are other important adverse effects that require provider vigilance.\n\n(Choice B) Clozapine plasma levels can be checked after an initial target dose is reached, but further dosage adjustments are usually based on clinical response. Clozapine levels are not regularly monitored.\n\n(Choices C and H) Creatinine levels and thyroid function tests should be monitored in patients taking lithium due to this drug's potential to adversely affect thyroid and renal function.\n\n(Choice D) Although a baseline ECG is required and physicians should be alert to the development of cardiovascular symptoms suggestive of myocarditis, routine ECGs are not required. Among the second-generation antipsychotics, ziprasidone is most often noted for causing a prolonged QT interval.\n\n(Choices E and F) Liver function tests may be mildly elevated with the use of many psychotropic medications, including antipsychotics and anticonvulsants; thrombocytopenia can be caused by some anticonvulsants. However, routine monitoring of liver function tests and platelets is not required with clozapine.\n\n(Choice G) Prolactin levels are not routinely monitored. Among the second-generation antipsychotics, risperidone has been associated with a greater risk of prolactin elevation.\n\nEducational objective: Patients treated with clozapine are required to have regular monitoring of the absolute neutrophil count due to the risk of life-threatening agranulocytosis.",
    "zh": "正确的答案是 A。第二代抗精神病药氯氮平是唯一一种在难治性精神分裂症和与持续自杀倾向相关的精神分裂症中始终显示出卓越疗效的药物。氯氮平对多种多巴胺和血清素受体具有亲和力，但导致其卓越疗效的确切药理机制尚不清楚。氯氮平与多巴胺 D2 受体松散而短暂地结合，与第一代抗精神病药相比，引起的锥体外系症状明显减少。\n\n中性粒细胞减少症（<1000 个细胞/mm³）和可能危及生命的粒细胞缺乏症是氯氮平的主要不良反应。粒细胞缺乏症的风险约为 1%；因此，治疗需要定期监测患者的中性粒细胞绝对计数。如果发生中性粒细胞减少症，应停止治疗。癫痫发作和心肌炎是需要医护人员警惕的其他重要不良反应。\n\n（选项 B）在达到初始目标剂量后可以检查氯氮平血浆水平，但进一步的剂量调整通常基于临床反应。氯氮平的血药浓度不进行定期监测。\n\n（选项 C 和 H）由于锂可能对甲状腺和肾功能产生不利影响，服用锂的患者应监测肌酐水平和甲状腺功能测试。\n\n（选项 D）虽然需要基线心电图，并且医生应警惕提示心肌炎的心血管症状的发展，但不需要常规心电图。在第二代抗精神病药中，齐拉西酮最常被注意到会导致 QT 间期延长。\n\n（选项 E 和 F）使用许多精神药物，包括抗精神病药和抗惊厥药，肝功能检查可能会轻度升高；血小板减少症可能由一些抗惊厥药引起。但是，氯氮平不需要常规监测肝功能检查和血小板。\n\n（选项 G）催乳素水平不进行常规监测。在第二代抗精神病药中，利培酮与催乳素升高的风险较高。\n\n教育目标：接受氯氮平治疗的患者需要定期监测中性粒细胞绝对计数，因为存在危及生命的粒细胞缺乏症的风险。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of the adverse effects of clozapine and the necessary monitoring required for patients receiving this medication. Specifically, it assesses understanding of the risk of neutropenia and agranulocytosis associated with clozapine.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the medication initiated (clozapine) and recall its significant adverse effects. The most critical adverse effect requiring regular monitoring is neutropenia, which necessitates frequent absolute neutrophil count checks.",
