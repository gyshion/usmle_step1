    "en": "This patient with risk factors for stroke (eg, hypertension) has crossed signs of:\n\nright arm and leg weakness consistent with an upper motor neuron pattern (ie, hyperreflexia, upgoing Babinski).\nleft facial weakness that involves the upper face (forehead) and lower face, corresponding to a lower motor neuron pattern.\nBecause most cranial nerves (other than CN II & IV) do not decussate while most of the body's motor and sensory fibers cross the midline in the medulla, brainstem strokes are characterized by ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits accompanied by contralateral hemiparesis or hemisensory loss (ie, crossed signs).\n\nThe facial nerve (CN VII) originates in the pons; lesions above the pons (eg, midbrain, internal capsule, or cortical strokes) lead to an upper motor neuron pattern of facial weakness (spares contralateral upper face). Lesions at the level of the pons result in a lower motor neuron pattern of facial weakness (affects ipsilateral upper face). Therefore, this patient's lesion is likely in the left pons, resulting in contralateral (right) arm and leg weakness with ipsilateral (left) facial nerve palsy.\n\n(Choice A) Lesions impacting the cortex can lead to weakness of the face and body. However, facial weakness would have an upper motor neuron pattern (contralateral to lesion, sparing the forehead).\n\n(Choice B) A stroke in the midbrain can cause ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits with contralateral hemiparesis. However, the cranial nerves involved would originate in the midbrain, most classically the oculomotor nerve (CN III), which would lead to ipsilateral ptosis and an eye in the down-and-out position.\n\n(Choice C) A stroke in the cerebellum often presents with vertigo, nystagmus, and ataxia. It would not cause cranial nerve defects or hemiparesis.\n\n(Choice E) Medullary infarctions can cause ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits with contralateral hemiparesis. However, the cranial nerves involved originate in the medulla: glossopharyngeal (CN IX) (diminished gag reflex, palate weakness), vagus (CN X) (dysphonia), and hypoglossal (CN XII) (tongue weakness). In addition, medullary infarctions often result in well-known clinical stroke syndromes (eg, lateral medullary syndrome, medial medullary syndrome).\n\nEducational objective:\nA stroke in the pons can lead to contralateral weakness of the arm and leg with ipsilateral facial weakness. Facial weakness occurs in a lower motor neuron pattern (ipsilateral, affects upper face) because the damage occurs at the level of the facial nerve (CN VII) origination.",
    "zh": "该患者具有中风的危险因素（例如，高血压），出现交叉体征：\n\n右侧手臂和腿部无力，符合上运动神经元模式（即，反射亢进，Babinski征阳性）。\n左侧面部无力，累及上脸（额头）和下脸，对应于下运动神经元模式。\n因为大多数脑神经（CN II和IV除外）不交叉，而身体的大部分运动和感觉纤维在中脑延髓中线交叉，脑干中风的特征是同侧脑神经功能缺损伴有对侧偏瘫或偏感觉丧失（即，交叉体征）。\n\n面神经（CN VII）起源于脑桥；脑桥以上的病变（例如，中脑、内囊或皮质中风）会导致上运动神经元模式的面部无力（保留对侧上脸）。脑桥水平的病变会导致下运动神经元模式的面部无力（影响同侧上脸）。因此，该患者的病变可能位于左侧脑桥，导致对侧（右侧）手臂和腿部无力，伴有同侧（左侧）面神经麻痹。\n\n（选项A）影响皮质的病变可导致面部和身体无力。然而，面部无力将具有上运动神经元模式（对侧病变，保留额头）。\n\n（选项B）中脑卒中可引起同侧脑神经功能缺损伴对侧偏瘫。然而，所涉及的脑神经将起源于中脑，最经典的是动眼神经（CN III），这将导致同侧眼睑下垂和眼球向下和向外的位置。\n\n（选项C）小脑卒中常表现为眩晕、眼球震颤和共济失调。它不会引起脑神经缺损或偏瘫。\n\n（选项E）延髓梗死可引起同侧脑神经功能缺损伴对侧偏瘫。然而，所涉及的脑神经起源于延髓：舌咽神经（CN IX）（咽反射减弱，腭无力），迷走神经（CN X）（发音困难）和舌下神经（CN XII）（舌无力）。此外，延髓梗死常导致众所周知的中风临床综合征（例如，外侧延髓综合征，内侧延髓综合征）。\n\n教学目标：\n脑桥卒中可导致对侧手臂和腿部无力，伴有同侧面部无力。面部无力以低位运动神经元模式出现（同侧，影响上脸），因为损伤发生在面神经（CN VII）起源处。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of brainstem stroke syndromes, specifically a pontine stroke presenting with contralateral hemiparesis and ipsilateral facial nerve palsy. It requires understanding of the anatomical location of the facial nerve nucleus and the corticospinal tract's course through the brainstem.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key findings of contralateral motor weakness and ipsilateral facial weakness. Recognize that these \"crossed signs\" are characteristic of brainstem lesions. Recall that the facial nerve originates in the pons and that lesions at this level cause ipsilateral lower motor neuron facial weakness and contralateral hemiparesis due to corticospinal tract involvement.",
