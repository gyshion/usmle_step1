    "en": "An 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for fever, runny nose, and sore throat. The physician reassures the parents and recommends supportive care with plenty of fluids. He sends them home with instructions to follow up if the boy's symptoms worsen. Two days later, the infant is brought to the emergency department with persistent fever, brassy cough, and difficulty breathing. Physical examination reveals stridor.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This child initially had fever, rhinitis, and pharyngitis, which are symptoms typical of an upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Most URIs (with or without pharyngitis) are caused by viruses, with roughly 15%-30% of childhood cases of pharyngitis and 5%-15% of adulthood cases of pharyngitis caused by bacteria.\n\nWhen a child with a history of recent URI develops a brassy, barking cough and breathing difficulties, it is likely that acute laryngotracheitis (croup) has developed. The dyspnea associated with croup occurs when inflamed subglottic tissue obstructs the upper airway. The characteristic stridor of croup is a sign of significant upper airway obstruction. Croup is typically caused by the standard URI viruses, with the parainfluenza viruses (members of Paramyxoviridae) most commonly responsible.\n\n(Choice A) Rhinovirus is the most common viral cause of upper respiratory infections but is an uncommon cause of viral croup.\n\n(Choice C) Togaviruses are responsible for rubella (German measles) and Eastern and Western equine encephalitis.\n\n(Choice D) Parvoviruses are responsible for aplastic crises in sickle cell anemia, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), and hydrops fetalis.\n\n(Choice E) Caliciviruses (Norwalk virus) are responsible for viral gastroenteritis.",
    "zh": "该儿童最初出现发烧、鼻炎和咽炎，这些是上呼吸道感染（URI）的典型症状。大多数 URI（伴有或不伴有咽炎）由病毒引起，大约 15%-30% 的儿童咽炎病例和 5%-15% 的成人咽炎病例由细菌引起。\n\n当有近期 URI 病史的儿童出现金属样、犬吠样咳嗽和呼吸困难时，很可能发生了急性喉气管炎（哮吼）。与哮吼相关的呼吸困难发生在发炎的声门下组织阻塞上呼吸道时。哮吼的特征性喘鸣是上呼吸道显着阻塞的征象。哮吼通常由标准的 URI 病毒引起，其中副流感病毒（副粘病毒科成员）最常见。\n\n（选项 A）鼻病毒是上呼吸道感染最常见的病毒病因，但它不是病毒性哮吼的常见病因。\n\n（选项 C）披膜病毒是风疹（德国麻疹）和东方和西方马脑炎的病因。\n\n（选项 D）细小病毒是镰状细胞性贫血的再生障碍性危象、传染性红斑（第五病）和胎儿水肿的病因。\n\n（选项 E）杯状病毒（诺瓦克病毒）是病毒性胃肠炎的病因。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the etiology and presentation of croup (laryngotracheitis) in children, specifically the most common causative agent. The key to solving this question is recognizing the symptoms of croup (brassy cough, stridor, difficulty breathing) and associating them with the most likely viral pathogen, which is parainfluenza virus.",
