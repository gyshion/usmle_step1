Over the past year, her lung function has worsened significantly, and her probability of survival at 12 months is below 50%.

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Advance care planning (ACP) identifies a patient's personal preferences for health care in case of chronic, serious illness. It is a flexible, patient-centered process (ie, prioritizes patient values) that delineates key patient preferences that can then guide medical decision-making. The process may include (but does not necessitate) creation of legal documents, such as appointment of a surrogate decision maker who acts on the patient's behalf if the patient is incapacitated. ACP often begins with an informal conversation with the patient (and trusted family members, if appropriate) to explore the patient's beliefs about illness, death, and health care interventions.\n\nThe ACP process is meant to promote patient empowerment by ensuring that patients receive care aligned with their expressed values. However, patient participation in ACP remains low (<11% of patients) and occurs even less frequently among patients who belong to ethnic minorities (eg, Hispanic, Black, Asian). Ethnic disparities in ACP initiation and completion may result from distrust of health care systems, cultural norms, misconceptions, and suboptimal physician communication.\n\nThis patient's statement indicates that she has a misconception about ACP—that she must \"sign away\" her life with legally binding documents. It also indicates that she values ownership over her health care decisions—a value that is in fact supported by ACP. Therefore, the physician should respond by explaining the ACP shared goal of patient empowerment (eg, of allowing her preferences to be shared) in simple, nonjudgmental terms. Expressing this patient-centered goal can increase trust, acceptability, and likelihood of patient engagement in subsequent discussions.\n\n(Choice A) Given the patient's low probability of 12-month survival, realistic conversations about end-of-life care are important. However, this statement does not clarify the purpose of ACP and focuses on the physician's opinion more than the patient's expressed values.\n\n(Choice B) The patient has not expressed fear, so this statement is less likely to engage her and may appear condescending. Moreover, the statement does not offer clarity on the purpose and benefits of ACP.\n\n(Choice C) This statement alludes to only one potential outcome of ACP: participation of family members in patient care (eg, as surrogate decision makers). The primary purpose of ACP is to identify and honor the patient's wishes; it is premature to assume that the patient values or prefers family involvement.\n\n(Choice E) If the patient continues to decline engagement, her wishes should be respected. However, the physician should first clarify potential misconceptions about ACP (eg, \"sign away my life\") and attempt to find common ground by highlighting the shared, patient-centered goal of ACP.\n\nEducational objective:\nAdvance care planning (ACP) is the process of identifying a patient's health care goals in case of serious illness. Patient participation in ACP is low, especially among ethnic minorities due to factors such as mistrust or suboptimal physician communication. Physicians should engage patients in ACP by first explaining its primary purpose of patient empowerment (ie, identifying patient preferences that can subsequently guide medical decision-making).",
    "zh": "预先护理计划（ACP）确定患者在患有慢性、严重疾病情况下的个人健康护理偏好。这是一个灵活的、以患者为中心的过程（即，优先考虑患者价值观），它描述了关键的患者偏好，然后可以指导医疗决策。该过程可能包括（但不一定需要）创建法律文件，例如任命一名替代决策人，如果患者无行为能力，则代表患者行事。ACP通常从与患者（以及适当的受信任的家庭成员）的非正式对话开始，以探讨患者对疾病、死亡和医疗干预的看法。\n\nACP流程旨在通过确保患者获得与其表达的价值观相符的护理来促进患者赋权。然而，患者参与ACP的比例仍然很低（<11%的患者），在属于少数民族的患者（例如，西班牙裔、黑人、亚洲人）中，参与频率更低。ACP启动和完成方面的种族差异可能源于对医疗保健系统的怀疑、文化规范、误解和医师沟通不畅。\n\n这位患者的陈述表明，她对ACP存在误解——她必须用具有法律约束力的文件“签署”她的生命。这也表明她重视对其健康护理决策的自主权——而ACP实际上支持这一价值观。因此，医生应通过用简单、非判断性的语言解释ACP的共同目标（即患者赋权，例如允许分享她的偏好）来回应。表达这种以患者为中心的目标可以增加信任、可接受性以及患者参与后续讨论的可能性。\n\n（选项A）鉴于患者12个月生存的概率较低，关于临终关怀的实际对话很重要。但是，此声明并未阐明ACP的目的，并且比患者表达的价值观更侧重于医生的意见。\n\n（选项B）患者没有表达恐惧，因此这种说法不太可能吸引她，并且可能显得居高临下。此外，该声明也没有说明ACP的目的和益处。\n\n（选项C）此声明仅暗示ACP的一种潜在结果：家庭成员参与患者护理（例如，作为替代决策者）。ACP的主要目的是确定并尊重患者的愿望；假设患者重视或更喜欢家人的参与还为时过早。\n\n（选项E）如果患者继续拒绝参与，则应尊重她的意愿。但是，医生应首先澄清对ACP的潜在误解（例如，“签署我的生命”），并通过强调ACP共同的、以患者为中心的目标来尝试寻找共同点。\n\n教育目标：\n预先护理计划（ACP）是在患有严重疾病的情况下确定患者健康护理目标的过程。患者参与ACP的比例很低，尤其是在少数民族中，这归因于不信任或医师沟通不畅等因素。医生应首先通过解释其主要目的（即患者赋权，确定随后可以指导医疗决策的患者偏好）来让患者参与ACP。"
