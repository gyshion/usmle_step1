    "en": "A 62-year-old man with a history of poor medical follow-up comes to the office due to difficulty seeing. He has had blurry vision for the last 2 weeks. A day ago, he noticed a shadow develop suddenly across the visual field of his right eye. The patient has had no recent headaches, double vision, vertigo, light sensitivity, or nausea. On examination, pupils are equal and reactive to light. Visual field testing by confrontation reveals patchy loss of vision. A flame-shaped retinal hemorrhage in the right eye is noted on funduscopic examination, as shown in the image below. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient has an acute retinal hemorrhage (arrow), most likely caused by severe, poorly controlled hypertension. Hypertensive retinal hemorrhage typically causes painless, unilateral visual disturbances, ranging from mild obscuration without loss of visual acuity to permanent blindness. Severe hypertension in retinal precapillary arterioles causes endothelial disruption, leakage of plasma into the arteriolar wall, and BRINOUS NECROSIS. The necrotic vessels can then bleed into the nerve fiber layers, causing dot- and flame-shaped hemorrhages. {{exhibit_2}} Diagnosis of hypertensive retinal hemorrhage is usually confirmed by direct ophthalmoscopic evaluation. Other findings of hypertensive retinopathy include thickening of the arteriolar walls (\"copper or silver wiring\"), compression of the associated veins (arteriovenous nicking), and small, white foci of retinal ischemia (cotton-wool spots). {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(Choices A and D) Central retinal artery occlusion is most commonly due to atherosclerosis, cardioembolic disease, or vasculitis (eg, giant cell arteritis). It causes acute monocular vision loss. Examination can reveal a cherry red spot at the macula due to diffuse retinal ischemia, but hemorrhage is not typically seen.\n\n(Choices B and E) Smoking and hyperlipidemia can increase the risk of developing ischemic retinal and optic vascular disease; however, these are not associated with an increased risk of retinal hemorrhage.\n\n(Choice C) Closed-angle glaucoma is characterized by increased intraocular pressure from impaired aqueous humor drainage. It causes acute headache, eye pain, vision loss, and an afferent pupillary defect. Ophthalmoscopic examination reveals cupping of the optic disc without hemorrhage.\n\n(Choice G) Ocular migraine and migraine with visual aura can present with transient visual disturbances, with or without headache. Ophthalmoscopic examination is normal in patients with migraine.\n\n(Choice H) Thyroid eye disease (eg, Graves disease) can present with diplopia and proptosis; however, it is not associated with an increased risk of retinal hemorrhage.\n\nEducational objective:\nSevere hypertension in retinal precapillary arterioles causes endothelial disruption, leakage of plasma into the arteriolar wall, and BRINOUS NECROSIS. The necrotic vessels can then bleed into the nerve fiber layer, which can be seen on examination as dot- or flame-shaped hemorrhages. {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有急性视网膜出血（箭头所示），最可能由严重、控制不佳的高血压引起。高血压性视网膜出血通常导致无痛性单眼视力障碍，从轻度遮蔽而无视力丧失到永久性失明。视网膜毛细血管前小动脉的严重高血压导致内皮细胞破坏，血浆渗入小动脉壁，并引起纤维素性坏死。坏死血管随后会出血到神经纤维层，引起点状和火焰状出血。{{exhibit_2}} 高血压性视网膜出血的诊断通常通过直接眼底镜检查进行确认。高血压性视网膜病变的其它发现包括小动脉壁增厚（“铜色或银色铜线样改变”）、相关静脉受压（动静脉压迫）以及视网膜缺血的小、白色灶（棉絮斑）。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n(选项A和D) 视网膜中央动脉阻塞最常见的原因是动脉粥样硬化、心源性栓塞或血管炎（例如，巨细胞性动脉炎）。它会导致急性单眼视力丧失。检查可显示黄斑区出现樱桃红色斑点，这是由于弥漫性视网膜缺血所致，但通常看不到出血。\n\n(选项B和E) 吸烟和高脂血症会增加发生缺血性视网膜和视神经血管疾病的风险；然而，这些与视网膜出血风险增加无关。\n\n(选项C) 闭角型青光眼的特征是由于房水引流受损导致眼内压升高。它会引起急性头痛、眼痛、视力丧失和传入性瞳孔缺陷。眼底镜检查显示视盘凹陷而无出血。\n\n(选项G) 眼型偏头痛和伴有先兆的偏头痛可表现为短暂的视力障碍，伴有或不伴有头痛。偏头痛患者的眼底镜检查结果正常。\n\n(选项H) 甲状腺眼病（例如，格雷夫斯病）可表现为复视和眼球突出；然而，这与视网膜出血风险增加无关。\n\n教育目标：\n视网膜毛细血管前小动脉的严重高血压导致内皮细胞破坏，血浆渗入小动脉壁，并引起纤维素性坏死。坏死血管随后会出血到神经纤维层，检查可见点状或火焰状出血。{{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of hypertensive retinopathy and its associated retinal findings, specifically hypertensive retinal hemorrhages. It requires differentiating this condition from other causes of acute visual disturbances.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves correlating the patient's symptoms and funduscopic findings with the most likely underlying cause. Recognizing the characteristic flame-shaped hemorrhages and considering the patient's history of poor medical follow-up points towards uncontrolled hypertension as the etiology.",
