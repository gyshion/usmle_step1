    "en": "A 75-year-old man is hospitalized due to respiratory distress. The patient developed fever, cough, and muscle aches 4 days prior to admission. He is otherwise healthy and has no chronic medical conditions. The patient has received all recommended vaccinations, including a yearly flu vaccine. Temperature is 39 C (102.2 F), blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, pulse is 115/min, and respirations are 29/min. Chest x-ray shows bilateral infiltrates {{exhibit_1}}. The reverse transcriptase PCR of a specimen from a nasopharyngeal swab reveals a strain of influenza A virus that was included in the seasonal trivalent flu vaccine. The patient lives with his 50-year-old son, who received the same vaccine but did not develop the infection.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Most of the protection provided by vaccines depends on antibodies generated by an immune response to pathogen-specific antigens. These antibodies can bind to the pathogen and directly neutralize it or facilitate elimination of the pathogen through phagocytosis, complement fixation, and/or antibody-dependent cytotoxicity. The risk of primary vaccine failure is increased in patients with altered immune function, including those with atopic disorders (eg, asthma, eczema), steroid use, or age-related immune decline (eg, IMMUNOSENESCENCE). \n\nThe loss of telomere length during normal aging particularly affects rapidly dividing immune cells (eg, bone marrow stem cells, lymphocyte precursors), resulting in DECREASED production of naive B and T lymphocytes. Aging is also associated with chronic low-grade inflammation that causes much of the remaining naive lymphocyte pool to differentiate into memory lymphocytes against previously encountered antigens. These changes IMPAIR the adaptive immune response to novel antigens (eg, pathogens, vaccinations) and predispose these patients to vaccine failure and increased susceptibility to infection.\n\n(Choices A and C) Antibody quality (ie, avidity for the target antigen) and levels of memory B and T lymphocytes are preserved with age, allowing most aging individuals to mount an effective immune response to previously encountered antigens.\n\n(Choice D) Neutrophil-induced apoptosis is reduced in aging individuals, increasing susceptibility for nonhealing wounds/infections. However, a change in neutrophil function would not significantly impact the vaccine response.\n\n(Choice E) Phagocytosis and antigen presentation by dendritic cells and macrophages decline with age, further impairing the immune response to novel antigens.\n\nEducational objective:\nImmunosenescence is the normal age-related decline that impairs most aspects of immune function, including the production of naive B and T cells. This results in a diminished antibody-based immune response to novel antigens (eg, infections, vaccinations). The immune response to previously experienced pathogens is typically intact due to normal or increased levels of memory B and T cells and preserved antibody quality.",
    "zh": "疫苗提供的保护主要依赖于对病原体特异性抗原的免疫反应产生的抗体。这些抗体可以与病原体结合并直接中和它，或者通过吞噬作用、补体固定和/或抗体依赖性细胞毒性作用促进病原体的清除。免疫功能改变的患者，包括患有异位性疾病（如哮喘、湿疹）、使用类固醇或与年龄相关的免疫功能下降（如免疫衰老）的患者，初次疫苗接种失败的风险增加。\n\n在正常衰老过程中，端粒长度的损失会特别影响快速分裂的免疫细胞（如骨髓干细胞、淋巴细胞前体），导致幼稚B细胞和T细胞的产生减少。衰老还与慢性低度炎症有关，这种炎症导致剩余的幼稚淋巴细胞库分化成针对先前遇到的抗原的记忆淋巴细胞。这些变化损害了对新型抗原（如病原体、疫苗接种）的适应性免疫反应，并使这些患者更容易发生疫苗接种失败和增加对感染的易感性。\n\n（选项A和C）抗体质量（即对靶抗原的亲和力）和记忆B细胞和T细胞的水平随着年龄的增长而保留，这使得大多数衰老个体能够对先前遇到的抗原产生有效的免疫反应。\n\n（选项D）中性粒细胞诱导的凋亡在衰老个体中减少，增加了对非愈合伤口/感染的易感性。然而，中性粒细胞功能的改变不会显著影响疫苗反应。\n\n（选项E）树突状细胞和巨噬细胞的吞噬作用和抗原呈递随着年龄的增长而下降，进一步损害了对新型抗原的免疫反应。\n\n教育目标：免疫衰老是与年龄相关的正常衰退，它损害了免疫功能的大部分方面，包括幼稚B细胞和T细胞的产生。这导致针对新型抗原（如感染、疫苗接种）的抗体介导的免疫反应减弱。由于记忆B细胞和T细胞的水平正常或增加，以及抗体质量的保持，对先前经历的病原体的免疫反应通常是完整的。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of immunosenescence, the age-related decline in immune function, and its impact on vaccine efficacy. Specifically, it focuses on the reduced production of naive B and T lymphocytes in older adults.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the patient's age is the key factor. Understand that aging impairs the adaptive immune response to novel antigens, primarily due to decreased production of naive lymphocytes, leading to vaccine failure.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试了对免疫衰老的认识，即与年龄相关的免疫功能下降及其对疫苗功效的影响。具体来说，它侧重于老年人中幼稚B细胞和T细胞的产生减少。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要认识到患者的年龄是关键因素。了解衰老会损害对新型抗原的适应性免疫反应，这主要是由于幼稚淋巴细胞的产生减少，从而导致疫苗接种失败。"
