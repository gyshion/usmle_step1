    "en": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to clinic by his mother due to fevers. Three weeks ago, the patient developed a fever, cough, and runny nose. He attends day care, where several children have had viral upper respiratory infections. Symptoms had briefly resolved 10 days ago, but the fever recurred last week after the patient returned to day care. Since then, he has been home due to fever occurring almost daily despite acetaminophen administration. Temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F). Examination shows enlarged lymph nodes in the neck region.",

    "en": "exposure to infections (eg, pharyngitis, upper respiratory infections). The lymphatic system drains bacteria and cellular debris through local lymph nodes, which filter foreign material and contain lymphocytes to fight infection. Lymph then drains to the thoracic and right lymphatic ducts, which empty into the subclavian veins.\n\nAlthough lymphadenopathy usually occurs secondary to the proliferation of inflammatory cells in response to infection, it is less commonly due to a clonal expansion of malignant cells. MALIGNANCY should be suspected when lymph node enlargement is associated with any of the following features:\n\n*   Generalized or supraclavicular location\n*   Firm, immobile, nontender quality\n*   >2 cm or increasing size\n*   Systemic features (eg, weight loss, night sweats)\n\nThe supraclavicular nodes drain the chest (ie, pulmonary system, mediastinum) and abdomen (ie, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts). Therefore, enlargement of these lymph nodes is unlikely to be caused by common childhood infections and always warrants further workup (eg, complete blood count, ultrasound) for an associated malignancy.\n\n(Choices A and B) Anterior and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy is common with upper respiratory infections because these nodes drain the neck and oropharynx.\n\n(Choices C and D) The submandibular nodes drain the cheeks, lips, gums, and part of the tongue. The submental nodes drain the floor of the mouth and part of the lower lip. These nodes are commonly enlarged with infections affecting the oral cavity, including dental infections and common viral infections (eg, coxsackievirus).\n\nEducational objective:\nLymph node enlargement is most commonly due to infection-triggered cellular proliferation but can be caused by clonal expansion of malignant cells. Enlargement of the supraclavicular lymph nodes, which drain the chest and abdomen, is unlikely to be caused by common childhood infections and is concerning for malignancy. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "暴露于感染（如咽炎、上呼吸道感染）。淋巴系统通过局部淋巴结引流细菌和细胞碎片，淋巴结过滤异物并包含淋巴细胞以对抗感染。淋巴然后引流到胸导管和右淋巴导管，最终进入锁骨下静脉。\n\n虽然淋巴结病通常继发于炎症细胞对感染的增殖反应，但较少见的是由恶性细胞的克隆性扩张引起。当淋巴结肿大伴有以下任何特征时，应怀疑恶性肿瘤：\n\n*   全身性或锁骨上位置\n*   质地坚硬、固定、无压痛\n*   >2 cm 或尺寸增大\n*   全身性特征（如体重减轻、盗汗）\n\n锁骨上淋巴结引流胸部（即肺系统、纵隔）和腹部（即胃肠道和泌尿生殖道）。因此，这些淋巴结的肿大不太可能由常见的儿童感染引起，并且总是需要进一步的检查（如全血细胞计数、超声检查）以评估相关恶性肿瘤。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）颈前和颈后淋巴结病常见于上呼吸道感染，因为这些淋巴结引流颈部和口咽。\n\n（选项 C 和 D）下颌下淋巴结引流面颊、嘴唇、牙龈和部分舌头。颏下淋巴结引流口腔底部和部分下唇。这些淋巴结通常因影响口腔的感染而肿大，包括牙齿感染和常见病毒感染（如柯萨奇病毒）。\n\n教育目标：\n淋巴结肿大最常见的原因是感染触发的细胞增殖，但也可由恶性细胞的克隆性扩张引起。锁骨上淋巴结肿大（引流胸部和腹部）不太可能由常见的儿童感染引起，并且令人担忧恶性肿瘤。{{exhibit_1}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of lymph node drainage patterns and the clinical significance of lymphadenopathy in different locations, particularly concerning malignancy. Supraclavicular lymph node enlargement is more likely to be associated with malignancy than other locations, especially in the absence of common childhood infections.\n\nTo solve this question, understand the drainage areas of different lymph node groups. Recognize that supraclavicular nodes drain the chest and abdomen, making their enlargement less likely due to common childhood infections and more concerning for malignancy.",
