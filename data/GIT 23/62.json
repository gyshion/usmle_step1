    "en": "The presence of a fluid-filled cavity in the liver in conjunction with fevers, chills, and right upper abdominal pain is suggestive of a hepatic abscess. In developing countries, hepatic abscesses have a relatively high incidence and are usually caused by parasitic infections (eg, Entamoeba histolytica, echinococcal). In contrast, hepatic abscesses are uncommon in the United States and are caused by bacterial infection in about 80% of cases.\n\nPyogenic bacteria can gain access to the liver through the following routes:\n\n*   Biliary tract infection (eg, ascending cholangitis)\n*   Portal vein pyemia (bowel or peritoneal sources)\n*   Hepatic artery (systemic hematogenous seeding)\n*   Direct invasion from an adjacent source (eg, peritonitis, cholecystitis)\n*   Penetrating trauma or injury\n\nThe types of organisms causing a hepatic abscess depend on the route of hepatic access. Systemic hematogenous seeding of the liver secondary to Staphylococcus aureus infection at a distant site is the most plausible choice of all the answer options.\n\n(Choice A) Ascending cholangitis is usually caused by enteric gram-negative bacilli (eg, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella) and enterococci. Chlamydia trachomatis is transmitted sexually and is not found in the enteric environment.\n\n(Choice B) Hepatic abscesses that arise by direct invasion from a nearby source are usually enteric gram-negative bacilli and enterococci. Cytomegalovirus can cause hepatitis in the immunosuppressed patient, but it is not associated with the development of a hepatic abscess.\n\n(Choice C) Traumatic penetrating injuries to the abdomen (eg, stab wound) typically result in abscesses that contain mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora. Entamoeba histolytica is most often transmitted through foodborne exposure and in areas with poor sanitation. It can cause a hepatic abscess by ascending from the colon through the portal venous system.\n\n(Choice E) Streptococcus pneumoniae colonizes the nasopharynx and typically causes disease within the respiratory tract region (eg, pneumonia, otitis media, sinusitis) and meningitis. However, hepatic abscesses due to portal vein seeding typically arise from abdominal infectious processes (eg, appendicitis, diverticulitis) and S pneumoniae is not an enteric pathogen.\n\nEducational objective:\nStaphylococcus aureus can cause hepatic abscesses via hematogenous seeding of the liver. Enteric bacteria (eg, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and enterococci) can cause hepatic abscesses by ascending the biliary tract (ie, ascending cholangitis), portal vein pyemia, or direct invasion from an adjacent area (eg, cholecystitis). {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "肝脏内出现充满液体的腔隙，并伴有发热、寒战和右上腹疼痛，提示可能存在肝脓肿。在发展中国家，肝脓肿的发生率相对较高，通常由寄生虫感染引起（例如，溶组织内阿米巴、包虫病）。相比之下，肝脓肿在美国并不常见，约80%的病例由细菌感染引起。\n\n化脓性细菌可通过以下途径进入肝脏：\n\n*   胆道感染（例如，胆管炎上行感染）\n*   门静脉脓毒血症（肠道或腹膜来源）\n*   肝动脉（全身血行播散）\n*   来自相邻来源的直接侵袭（例如，腹膜炎、胆囊炎）\n*   穿透性创伤或损伤\n\n引起肝脓肿的病原体类型取决于肝脏的进入途径。金黄色葡萄球菌感染继发于远处部位，通过全身血行播散进入肝脏，是所有备选答案中最合理的选择。\n\n（选项 A）胆管炎上行感染通常由肠道革兰氏阴性杆菌（例如，大肠杆菌、克雷伯菌属）和肠球菌引起。沙眼衣原体通过性传播，不在肠道环境中发现。\n\n（选项 B）通过来自附近来源的直接侵袭而引起的肝脓肿，通常由肠道革兰氏阴性杆菌和肠球菌引起。巨细胞病毒可引起免疫抑制患者的肝炎，但与肝脓肿的发生无关。\n\n（选项 C）腹部穿透性损伤（例如，刺伤）通常会导致脓肿，其中包含混合的需氧菌和厌氧菌群。溶组织内阿米巴最常通过食源性暴露和卫生条件差的地区传播。它可以通过从结肠上行通过门静脉系统引起肝脓肿。\n\n（选项 E）肺炎链球菌定植于鼻咽，通常导致呼吸道区域的疾病（例如，肺炎、中耳炎、鼻窦炎）和脑膜炎。然而，由于门静脉播散引起的肝脓肿通常源自腹部感染过程（例如，阑尾炎、憩室炎），且肺炎链球菌不是肠道病原体。\n\n教育目标：\n金黄色葡萄球菌可通过肝脏的血行播散引起肝脓肿。肠道细菌（例如，大肠杆菌、克雷伯菌属和肠球菌）可通过胆管上行（即，胆管炎上行感染）、门静脉脓毒血症或来自相邻区域的直接侵袭（例如，胆囊炎）引起肝脓肿。{{exhibit_2}}"
