    "en": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the office for evaluation of a breast lump. She noticed the lump a few months ago but thinks it might be getting larger. The patient has a history of right lower limb amputation at age 17 due to osteosarcoma. The patient's mother died of an adrenal tumor, and her younger sister died of leukemia. Examination of the left breast shows a 5-cm, firm immobile mass with irregular borders.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is D. The patient's history of osteosarcoma, breast lump, and family history of adrenal tumor and leukemia are highly suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. This syndrome predisposes individuals to a wide range of cancers, including sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, adrenal cortical tumors, and leukemia, often at a young age. The patient's presentation aligns with the typical cancer spectrum seen in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The table {{exhibit_1}} shows that Li-Fraumeni syndrome is associated with TP53 mutations and a variety of neoplasms including sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, adrenocortical carcinoma, and leukemia. The explanation further details that a history of sarcoma, leukemia, adrenal, and breast cancer is suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which results from an autosomal dominant mutation in TP53. The 2-hit hypothesis is also mentioned, where one mutated allele is inherited, and somatic mutation of the second allele is needed for tumor development.\n\n(Choice A) APC gene mutations are associated with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, which primarily leads to colorectal cancer, desmoids, osteomas, and brain tumors. While osteosarcoma can occur, it is not a primary association, and the other family history elements do not fit as well.\n(Choice B) BRCA1 mutations are strongly associated with breast and ovarian cancers. While the patient has a breast lump, the other cancers in her family (adrenal tumor, leukemia, osteosarcoma) are not typical of BRCA1-related syndromes.\n(Choice C) NF2 gene mutations are associated with Neurofibromatosis type 2, which typically presents with bilateral acoustic neuromas, meningiomas, and ependymomas. This is not consistent with the patient's presentation or family history.\n(Choice E) RB1 gene mutations are associated with Retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma. While the patient has a history of osteosarcoma, the other cancers in her family (adrenal tumor, leukemia) and the breast lump are not the primary manifestations of RB1 mutations.",
    "zh": "正确答案是D。患者的骨肉瘤病史、乳房肿块以及肾上腺肿瘤和白血病的家族史高度提示Li-Fraumeni综合征。Li-Fraumeni综合征是一种常染色体显性遗传病，由TP53肿瘤抑制基因的种系突变引起。这种综合征使个体容易患上各种癌症，包括肉瘤、乳腺癌、脑肿瘤、肾上腺皮质肿瘤和白血病，通常在年轻时。患者的临床表现与Li-Fraumeni综合征中常见的癌症谱一致。表{{exhibit_1}}显示，Li-Fraumeni综合征与TP53突变相关，并与多种肿瘤相关，包括肉瘤、乳腺癌、脑肿瘤、肾上腺皮质癌和白血病。 解释进一步详细说明了肉瘤、白血病、肾上腺癌和乳腺癌病史提示Li-Fraumeni综合征，其由TP53的常染色体显性突变导致。还提到了双击假说，其中一个突变的等位基因被遗传，需要第二个等位基因的体细胞突变才能发生肿瘤发展。\n\n(选项A) APC基因突变与家族性腺瘤性息肉病有关，主要导致结直肠癌、desmoids、骨瘤和脑肿瘤。虽然可能发生骨肉瘤，但它不是主要关联，并且其他家族史元素也不太吻合。\n(选项B) BRCA1突变与乳腺癌和卵巢癌密切相关。虽然患者有乳房肿块，但她家族中的其他癌症（肾上腺肿瘤、白血病、骨肉瘤）并非BRCA1相关综合征的典型表现。\n(选项C) NF2基因突变与2型神经纤维瘤病相关，通常表现为双侧听神经瘤、脑膜瘤和室管膜瘤。这与患者的临床表现或家族史不符。\n(选项E) RB1基因突变与视网膜母细胞瘤和骨肉瘤相关。虽然患者有骨肉瘤病史，但她家族中的其他癌症（肾上腺肿瘤、白血病）和乳房肿块并非RB1突变的主要表现。"
