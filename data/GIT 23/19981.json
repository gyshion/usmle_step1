    "en": "A patient with worsening abdominal pain has CT scan findings concerning for SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (SBO), a process in which a mechanical or functional obstruction disrupts the normal flow of intestinal intraluminal contents. SBO classically causes dilation of bowel proximal to the obstruction (eg, multiple dilated small bowel loops) and decompression of bowel distal to the obstruction (eg, decompressed distal ileum). Patients with SBO typically have abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting (usually bilious), and abdominal distension and tenderness.\n\nCommon causes of mechanical SBO include peritoneal adhesions, hernias, and tumors. Computed tomography is the diagnostic test of choice because it usually can identify the specific site of obstruction (ie, transition point), assess obstruction severity (partial vs complete), and identify potential complications (eg, bowel necrosis, perforation).\n\nThis patient's CT scan demonstrates a small bowel loop extending outside the peritoneal cavity into the left inguinal area, indicative of an inguinal hernia that has become trapped (ie, incarcerated) as the cause of SBO. Incarceration increases the risk of bowel strangulation (ie, ischemia leading to necrosis) and should prompt urgent surgical consultation.\n\n(Choice A) Gallstone ileus occurs when a large gallstone erodes into the intestinal lumen and becomes impacted (eg, at the ileocecal valve), causing mechanical obstruction. CT scan commonly shows obstructing gallstones or pneumobilia due to retrograde passage of intestinal gas into the biliary tract {{exhibit_2}}.\n\n(Choice C) Malrotation is characterized by incomplete physiologic rotation of the bowel in utero. Duodenal obstruction can occur due to abnormally positioned peritoneal bands; however, this occurs more commonly in infancy (vs adulthood). Imaging typically shows predominantly left-sided large bowel and right-sided small bowel {{exhibit_3}}.\n\n(Choice D) Volvulus occurs when an intestinal loop twists around itself and its mesentery. It can result in SBO, but CT scan classically reveals mesenteric twisting (\"whirl sign\") as the transition point (vs an incarcerated inguinal hernia) {{exhibit_4}}.\n\n(Choice E) Peritoneal adhesions (fibrous bands) often form between intraabdominal organs and/or the abdominal wall following abdominal surgery and can cause mechanical SBO by trapping bowel loops during normal intestinal peristalsis. However, CT scan typically reveals an intraperitoneal transition point (vs an extraperitoneal hernia) {{exhibit_5}}.\n\nEducational objective:\nSmall bowel obstruction (SBO) occurs when a mechanical or functional obstruction disrupts the normal flow of intestinal intraluminal contents. A herniated bowel loop (eg, inguinal hernia) can cause SBO if it becomes trapped (ie, incarcerated) outside the peritoneal cavity {{exhibit_6}}.",
    "zh": "腹痛加重的患者，其 CT 扫描结果提示小肠梗阻 (SBO)，这是一个机械性或功能性梗阻扰乱肠腔内容物正常流动过程。SBO 典型表现为梗阻近端肠管扩张（例如，多个扩张的小肠袢）和梗阻远端肠管减压（例如，远端回肠减压）。SBO 患者通常有腹痛、恶心、呕吐（通常为胆汁性）、腹胀和压痛。\n\n机械性 SBO 的常见病因包括腹膜粘连、疝和肿瘤。计算机断层扫描是首选的诊断方法，因为它通常可以识别梗阻的特定部位（即，移行点），评估梗阻的严重程度（部分 vs 完全），并识别潜在的并发症（例如，肠坏死、穿孔）。\n\n该患者的 CT 扫描显示一个肠袢延伸到腹腔外并进入左侧腹股沟区域，提示腹股沟疝被卡住（即，嵌顿）是 SBO 的病因。嵌顿增加了肠绞窄（即，缺血导致坏死）的风险，应立即进行外科会诊。\n\n(选项 A) 胆石性肠梗阻发生在大的胆结石侵蚀到肠腔内并嵌塞（例如，在回盲瓣处），引起机械性梗阻。CT 扫描通常显示梗阻性胆结石或由于肠道气体逆行进入胆道引起的胆道积气 {{exhibit_2}}。\n\n(选项 C) 肠旋转不良的特征是肠在子宫内的生理性旋转不完全。十二指肠梗阻可能由于异常定位的腹膜带而发生；然而，这种情况更常见于婴儿期（vs 成人期）。影像学检查通常显示以左侧大肠和右侧小肠为主 {{exhibit_3}}。\n\n(选项 D) 肠扭转发生在一个肠袢绕其自身及其肠系膜扭转时。它可导致 SBO，但 CT 扫描通常显示肠系膜扭曲（“漩涡征”）作为移行点（vs 嵌顿性腹股沟疝）{{exhibit_4}}。\n\n(选项 E) 腹膜粘连（纤维带）通常在腹部手术后在腹腔内脏器和/或腹壁之间形成，并通过在正常的肠蠕动过程中捕获肠袢引起机械性 SBO。然而，CT 扫描通常显示一个腹腔内移行点（vs 腹膜外疝）{{exhibit_5}}。\n\n教育目标：\n当机械性或功能性梗阻扰乱肠腔内容物的正常流动时，发生小肠梗阻 (SBO)。如果肠袢发生疝并被困在腹腔外（即，嵌顿），则可引起 SBO {{exhibit_6}}。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of small bowel obstruction (SBO) etiology and interpretation of CT imaging findings to identify the cause of obstruction. Specifically, it assesses the ability to recognize an incarcerated hernia as a cause of SBO based on the CT scan showing a bowel loop extending outside the peritoneal cavity. \n\nTo solve this question, carefully analyze the CT scan description and identify key findings such as dilated bowel loops and the location of the abnormal bowel. Consider the patient's history and risk factors, and then correlate the imaging findings with the most likely underlying cause of SBO.",
