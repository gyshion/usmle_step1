    "en": "A 1-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department during winter with cough and difficulty breathing. He has had rhinorrhea, cough, and congestion for the past 3 days. Today, the patient began breathing harder and faster with increased cough. Temperature is 37.8 C (100 F) and respirations are 68/min. Oxygen saturation is 91%. The patient is alert and awake and has subcostal and suprasternal retractions. Mucous membranes are moist, and the anterior fontanelle is open and flat. Physical examination reveals diffuse expiratory wheezes and scattered rales.",

    "en": "This infant with worsening cough and respiratory distress has diffuse wheezing and crackles, findings suggestive of bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis is a lower respiratory tract infection that typically affects children age <2 years, usually during the fall and winter. The most common cause is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).\n\nInitial symptoms include rhinorrhea and congestion, followed by cough, low-grade fever, and increased work of breathing. Classic findings include hypoxemia, tachypnea, and retractions with diffuse wheezes and crackles. Although illness severity typically peaks at 3-5 days, cough may last several weeks.\n\nIn older infants and young children, bronchiolitis is typically a mild, self-limited illness. However, in premature or young (age <2 months) infants, symptoms may be severe (eg, cyanosis, poor perfusion, poor feeding) and lead to apnea and/or respiratory failure.\n\nDiagnosis of bronchiolitis is clinical, and treatment is supportive (eg, supplemental oxygen, nasal suctioning).\n\n(Choices A and D) Adenovirus most commonly causes pharyngitis with conjunctivitis and fever. Parainfluenza virus is the most common cause of croup (laryngotracheobronchitis), which presents with a barky, seal-like cough and inspiratory stridor. Both viruses cause bronchiolitis far less commonly than RSV does.\n\n(Choice B) Bordetella pertussis infection in infants classically causes upper respiratory symptoms (eg, rhinorrhea, congestion) with progression to a whooping cough and bouts of coughing and posttussive emesis. In contrast to this patient's examination, the lungs are usually clear to auscultation.\n\n(Choice C) Pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae typically presents with fever, cough, and rales and wheezing on examination. However, M pneumoniae usually affects children age >5 years and is a rare cause of bronchiolitis.\n\n(Choice F) Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of lobar pneumonia in children and presents with fever and cough. However, examination typically reveals focal rales, not diffuse findings, as seen in this patient.\n\nEducational objective:\nViral bronchiolitis is most commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus and presents with low-grade fever, cough, and respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea, retractions) in children age <2 years. Examination typically shows diffuse wheezes and/or crackles.",
    "zh": "这个咳嗽和呼吸窘迫加重的婴儿有弥漫性喘鸣和啰音，这些发现提示毛细支气管炎。毛细支气管炎是一种下呼吸道感染，通常影响年龄<2岁的儿童，通常在秋冬季节发生。最常见的原因是呼吸道合胞病毒 (RSV)。\n\n最初的症状包括流涕和鼻塞，然后是咳嗽、低烧和呼吸费力。典型发现包括低氧血症、呼吸急促和凹陷，伴有弥漫性喘鸣和啰音。尽管疾病严重程度通常在3-5天达到高峰，但咳嗽可能会持续数周。\n\n在较大的婴儿和幼儿中，毛细支气管炎通常是一种轻度、自限性疾病。然而，在早产儿或幼儿（年龄<2个月）中，症状可能很严重（例如，发绀、灌注不良、喂养不良），并导致呼吸暂停和/或呼吸衰竭。\n\n毛细支气管炎的诊断是临床性的，治疗是支持性的（例如，补充氧气、鼻腔吸痰）。\n\n（选项 A 和 D）腺病毒最常引起咽炎，伴有结膜炎和发烧。副流感病毒是哮吼（喉气管支气管炎）的最常见原因，其表现为犬吠样咳嗽和吸气性喘鸣。这两种病毒引起毛细支气管炎的频率远低于 RSV。\n\n（选项 B）婴儿中百日咳博德特氏菌感染通常会导致上呼吸道症状（例如，流涕、鼻塞），并进展为百日咳、阵发性咳嗽和咳嗽后呕吐。与该患者的检查相反，肺通常在听诊时清晰。\n\n（选项 C）肺炎支原体引起的肺炎通常表现为发烧、咳嗽，并在检查时出现啰音和喘鸣。然而，肺炎支原体通常影响年龄>5岁的儿童，并且是毛细支气管炎的罕见原因。\n\n（选项 F）肺炎链球菌是儿童肺叶性肺炎最常见的原因，表现为发烧和咳嗽。然而，检查通常显示局灶性啰音，而不是该患者所见的弥漫性发现。\n\n教育目标：\n病毒性毛细支气管炎最常由呼吸道合胞病毒引起，表现为年龄<2岁的儿童出现低烧、咳嗽和呼吸窘迫（例如，呼吸急促、凹陷）。检查通常显示弥漫性喘鸣和/或啰音。"
