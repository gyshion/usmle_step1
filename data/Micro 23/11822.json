    "en": "This patient's presentation is consistent with roseola infantum, which is most commonly caused by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). Febrile seizures can be caused by any febrile illness, and HHV-6 is one of the most common causes. However, most patients with HHV-6 infection do not develop seizures. Primary symptoms include high fever for 3-5 days followed by an erythematous maculopapular rash. The rash usually starts on the trunk and spreads to the face and extremities. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, and the infection is typically benign and self-limited. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Coxsackievirus A16 is a common cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease in children. Patients typically have erythematous oropharyngeal ulcers and maculopapular or vesicular lesions on the palms and soles.\n\n(Choice B) Children with primary infection with herpes-simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) have painful gingivostomatitis, often accompanied by fever and irritability. Neonatal HSV, most commonly caused by HSV-2, can present with fever and seizures in the newborn period.\n\n(Choices D and F) Rubella and measles are vaccine-preventable viral infections that typically present with a maculopapular rash on the face that then spreads to the trunk and extremities; both infections can be distinguished from roseola by the pattern of rash development. In addition, patients with rubella often have Forchheimer spots on the soft palate, and measles is characterized by pathognomonic Koplik spots on buccal mucosa.\n\n(Choice E) Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease, which can present as a flu-like illness followed by a characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash and truncal reticular rash. Parvovirus B19 can be associated with aplastic crisis in those with pre-existing hematologic abnormalities (eg, sickle cell anemia).\n\n(Choice G) Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) can cause acute, exudative pharyngitis that is associated with fever, headache, and abdominal pain in school-aged children. It can also be accompanied by scarlet fever, a diffuse sandpaper-textured rash most prominent in skinfolds (eg, groin, axillae, antecubital fossa).\n\nEducational objective:\nHuman herpesvirus 6 infection (roseola) classically presents with fever for 3-5 days followed by a truncal rash. It is also the most common cause of febrile seizures.",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现与幼儿急疹一致，幼儿急疹最常见的原因是人疱疹病毒6型（HHV-6）。任何发热性疾病都可引起热性惊厥，而HHV-6是最常见的原因之一。然而，大多数HHV-6感染的患者不会出现癫痫发作。主要症状包括3-5天的高烧，随后出现红斑丘疹。皮疹通常从躯干开始，蔓延到面部和四肢。诊断基于临床表现，感染通常是良性的，并且自限性。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项A）柯萨奇病毒A16是儿童手足口病的常见病因。患者通常有红斑性口咽溃疡和手掌和足底的斑丘疹或水疱病变。\n\n（选项B）原发性单纯疱疹病毒1型（HSV-1）感染的儿童有疼痛性龈口炎，常伴有发热和烦躁。新生儿HSV，最常见的是HSV-2，可在新生儿期出现发热和癫痫发作。\n\n（选项D和F）风疹和麻疹是可预防疫苗的病毒感染，通常表现为面部出现斑丘疹，然后蔓延到躯干和四肢；两种感染可以通过皮疹的发展模式与幼儿急疹区分。此外，风疹患者常有软腭上的Forchheimer斑点，麻疹的特征是颊粘膜上的特征性Koplik斑点。\n\n（选项E）细小病毒B19引起传染性红斑，即第五病，可表现为流感样疾病，随后出现特征性的“耳光脸”皮疹和躯干网状皮疹。细小病毒B19可能与先前存在血液学异常（例如，镰状细胞性贫血）的患者发生再生障碍性危象。\n\n（选项G）化脓性链球菌（A组链球菌）可引起急性、渗出性咽炎，与学龄儿童的发热、头痛和腹痛有关。它也可能伴有猩红热，这是一种弥漫性砂纸样皮疹，最常见于皮肤褶皱（例如，腹股沟、腋窝、肘前窝）。\n\n教学目标：\n人疱疹病毒6型感染（幼儿急疹）的典型表现为发热3-5天，随后出现躯干皮疹。它也是热性惊厥最常见的原因。"
