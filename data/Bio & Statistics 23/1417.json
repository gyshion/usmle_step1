    "en": "The large complexes containing both protein and RNA that are found freely floating and bound to the endoplasmic reticulum are most likely ribosomes. Ribosome biogenesis occurs primarily within the nucleolus, a dense round structure inside the nucleus that is in direct contact with the rest of the nucleoplasm. The nucleolus contains ribosomal DNA coding for the 28S, 5.8S, and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) components, and it is here where most of the rRNA is transcribed. After synthesis, rRNA is combined with ribosomal protein components that are translated in the cytoplasm and then imported into the nucleus. The immature 60S and 40S ribosomal subunits are then exported from the nucleus to fully mature in the cytoplasm.\n(Choice A) The rough endoplasmic reticulum is identifiable due to its characteristic long, folded membranes that are coated with ribosomes, giving it a speckled or rough appearance.\n(Choice C) The nucleus is identifiable as a membrane-bound structure that contains the nucleolus, electron-lucent euchromatin, and electron-dense heterochromatin (condensed DNA typically found around the periphery). However, most of the ribosomal DNA is found in the form of tandem repeats within the nucleolus; only the 5S rRNA is transcribed outside of the nucleolus.\n(Choice D) Mitochondria are organelles with dual phospholipid bilayer membranes that can be recognized by the presence of foldings (ie, cristae) in their inner membranes. Mitochondria have their own ribosomes, but they are typically found within the mitochondrial matrix or bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n(Choice E) Pancreatic zymogen granules are electron-dense structures containing digestive proenzymes that are released from the cell via exocytosis.\nEducational objective: The nucleolus is a dense intranuclear body visible by light and electron microscopy that functions as the primary site of ribosome synthesis and assembly. All ribosomal RNA except 5S rRNA is transcribed in the nucleolus.",
    "zh": "包含蛋白质和RNA的大型复合物，这些复合物既可以自由漂浮，也可以与内质网结合，最有可能的是核糖体。核糖体的生物发生主要发生在核仁中，核仁是细胞核内的一个致密圆形结构，与核质的其余部分直接接触。核仁包含编码28S、5.8S和18S核糖体RNA (rRNA) 组分的核糖体DNA，并且大多数rRNA在这里转录。合成后，rRNA与在细胞质中翻译的核糖体蛋白组分结合，然后被导入细胞核。未成熟的60S和40S核糖体亚基随后从细胞核导出，在细胞质中完全成熟。\n(选项A) 粗面内质网可以通过其特征性的长而折叠的膜来识别，这些膜被核糖体覆盖，使其呈现斑点状或粗糙的外观。\n(选项C) 细胞核可以被识别为一个膜结合结构，其中包含核仁、电子透明的常染色质和电子致密的异染色质（通常位于外围的浓缩DNA）。然而，大多数核糖体DNA以串联重复的形式存在于核仁中；只有5S rRNA是在核仁外转录的。\n(选项D) 线粒体是具有双磷脂双层膜的细胞器，可以通过其内膜中存在折叠（即嵴）来识别。线粒体有自己的核糖体，但它们通常存在于线粒体基质中或与线粒体内膜结合。\n(选项E) 胰腺酶原颗粒是电子致密结构，包含通过胞吐作用从细胞中释放的消化前酶。\n教学目标：核仁是光学和电子显微镜可见的致密核内体，其功能是核糖体合成和组装的主要场所。除5S rRNA以外的所有核糖体RNA均在核仁中转录。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of ribosome biogenesis and the location within the cell where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is primarily synthesized. The key is to recognize that ribosomes are the complexes described, and rRNA transcription mainly occurs in the nucleolus.\n\nThe approach is to identify the function of the described complexes as ribosomes, then recall the cellular location where rRNA transcription primarily takes place. Eliminate options that are incorrect locations or unrelated structures.",
