    "en": "A 64-year-old man is brought to the office for evaluation of abnormal behaviors during sleep. According to his wife, over the past 3 months the patient has had episodes of repeatedly punching at the pillow and screaming loudly while asleep. When awakened from these episodes, he recalls a disturbing dream in which he is chased by assailants and must defend himself or escape. The episodes usually last less than 1-2 minutes. Vital signs are within normal limits. General physical and mental status examinations show no abnormalities. A formal sleep study (polysomnogram) is ordered.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's repeated nocturnal episodes of violent motor behaviors reflecting dream enactment are consistent with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Normal REM sleep is characterized by vivid dreams, rapid eye movements, and voluntary muscle atonia due to inhibition of motor neurons. In patients with RBD, degeneration of the brainstem nuclei responsible for inhibiting spinal motor neurons during normal REM sleep leads to incomplete or absent muscle atonia (ie, excessive, sustained muscle tone during REM sleep), facilitating dream enactment behaviors. Episodes typically occur at least 90 minutes after sleep onset, coinciding with the onset of REM sleep, and are more frequent in the second half of the night when the percentage of REM sleep increases. Patients can usually be awakened fairly easily and are alert and oriented. They may not recall their movements during sleep but can often recall their dreams. RBD is more likely to occur in older adult men (average age 61 years). It can be caused by medications (eg, antidepressants, narcolepsy medications). It may also be a prodromal sign of neurodegeneration with risk of subsequent onset of Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies.\n\n(Choices B and C) Sleep can trigger seizures in patients with many types of epilepsy. Epileptiform discharges often start from a specific focus (eg, temporal or frontal lobe) and may or may not generalize. This can cause rhythmic jerking and myoclonus, but complex motor behaviors corresponding with dream content (ie, dream enactment) are more consistent with RBD. Furthermore, REM sleep is somewhat protective in epilepsy; seizures most often occur during non-REM (NREM) sleep.\n\n(Choice D) This describes EEG findings that are common in NREM parasomnias (eg, sleep terrors, sleep walking). Although these can present with movement during sleep, patients are not alert upon awakening and have no memory of the event. In addition, NREM parasomnias most commonly present in childhood.\n\n(Choice E) Short sleep latency and sleep-onset REM periods are characteristic of narcolepsy, a disorder characterized by chronic excessive daytime sleepiness, intrusions of REM sleep phenomena (eg, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis), and cataplexy (emotionally triggered muscle weakness). Narcolepsy typically begins in young adulthood.\n\nEducational objective:\nREM sleep behavior disorder is a parasomnia characterized by dream-enactment behaviors due to a loss of atonia during REM sleep. Patients can usually be awakened fairly and are alert and oriented, and can immediately recall their dreams.",
    "zh": "该患者反复出现的夜间暴力运动行为反映了梦境表现，这与REM睡眠行为障碍（RBD）一致。正常的REM睡眠的特征是生动的梦境、快速眼动和由于运动神经元受到抑制而引起的自主肌张力丧失。在RBD患者中，负责在正常REM睡眠期间抑制脊髓运动神经元的脑干核的变性会导致肌张力不完全或缺失（即，REM睡眠期间过度、持续的肌张力），从而促进梦境表现行为。这些事件通常在睡眠开始后至少90分钟发生，与REM睡眠的开始相吻合，并且在夜间后半段REM睡眠的百分比增加时更频繁地发生。患者通常可以相当容易地被唤醒，并且保持警觉和定向。他们可能不记得他们在睡眠期间的动作，但通常可以回忆起他们的梦境。RBD更容易发生在老年男性（平均年龄61岁）。它可能由药物引起（例如，抗抑郁药、发作性睡病药物）。它也可能是神经退行性变的先兆，随后可能发生帕金森病或路易体痴呆。\n\n（选项B和C）睡眠可能会诱发许多类型癫痫患者的癫痫发作。癫痫样放电通常从特定病灶（例如，颞叶或额叶）开始，并且可能或可能不泛化。这可能导致节律性抽搐和肌阵挛，但与梦境内容相对应的复杂运动行为（即，梦境表现）与RBD更为一致。此外，REM睡眠对癫痫有一定的保护作用；癫痫发作最常发生在非REM（NREM）睡眠期间。\n\n（选项D）这描述了NREM睡眠异态睡眠症（例如，夜惊、梦游）中常见的脑电图发现。尽管这些可能表现为睡眠期间的运动，但患者在醒来时并不会保持警觉，并且对事件没有任何记忆。此外，NREM睡眠异态睡眠症最常发生在儿童时期。\n\n（选项E）短睡眠潜伏期和睡眠起始REM期是发作性睡病的特征，这是一种以慢性过度白天嗜睡、REM睡眠现象的侵入（例如，入睡幻觉、睡眠麻痹）和猝倒（情绪触发的肌肉无力）为特征的疾病。发作性睡病通常始于青年期。\n\n教育目标：\nREM睡眠行为障碍是一种异态睡眠症，其特征是由于REM睡眠期间张力丧失而引起的梦境表现行为。患者通常可以相当容易地被唤醒，并且保持警觉和定向，并且可以立即回忆起他们的梦境。"
