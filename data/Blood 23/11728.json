    "en": "A 62-year-old woman is evaluated for refractory nausea and vomiting. She was recently diagnosed with ovarian cancer and underwent total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. The patient was started on highly emetogenic adjuvant chemotherapy. Despite taking ondansetron around the clock, she continues to have nausea and vomiting. She has no abdominal pain or constipation. Vital signs are normal. Examination shows a well-healed abdominal scar. There is no tenderness or abnormal masses. Bowel sounds are normal. Additional therapy blocking which of the following receptors would most likely be helpful in this patient?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Vomiting is a reflex that can be activated by either humoral or neuronal stimuli. The area postrema in the fourth ventricle has a chemoreceptor trigger zone that can respond to many neurotransmitters, drugs, or toxins. The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the medulla receives information from the area postrema, gastrointestinal tract via the vagus nerve, vestibular system, and central nervous system (eg, meninges, hypothalamus). Neurons from the NTS project to other medullary nuclei and coordinate the vomiting process.\n\nThe 5 major receptors involved in stimulating the vomiting reflex in the area postrema and adjacent vomiting center nuclei are M₁ muscarinic, D₂ dopaminergic, H histamine, 5-HT3 serotonergic, and neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (eg, ondansetron) and dopamine receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide) are particularly helpful for chemotherapy-induced vomiting. When these do not control symptoms, NK1 receptor antagonists (prevent substance P release) can be considered; they prevent both acute vomiting and delayed emesis associated with chemotherapy.\n\n(Choice A) Opioid receptor antagonists (eg, naltrexone) competitively bind opioid receptors to prevent action of endogenous or exogenous opioids. They are used mainly for opioid dependence.\n\n(Choice B) Motilin regulates interdigestive migrating contractions. Erythromycin is a motilin receptor agonist used for gastroparesis.\n\n(Choice D) Neuropeptide Y is a polypeptide neurotransmitter found in the central and autonomic nervous systems. It is thought to play a role in appetite and pain perception. Neuropeptide Y antagonists have been investigated as potential antiobesity drugs.\n\n(Choice E) Nicotinic antagonists are primarily used for muscle paralysis during surgery. Some antihistamines (eg, promethazine, meclizine) and antimuscarinics (eg, scopolamine) have anticholinergic activity and inhibitory effects on both the vomiting center and vestibular apparatus (useful for motion sickness).\n\nEducational objective:\nVomiting is a reflex regulated mainly by 5 receptors, including M₁ muscarinic, D₂ dopaminergic, H histamine, 5-HT3 serotonergic, and neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. 5-HT3 and NK1 receptor antagonists are particularly useful for chemotherapy-induced vomiting.",
    "zh": "呕吐是一种反射，可由体液或神经元刺激激活。第四脑室的后区有一个化学感受器触发区，可对多种神经递质、药物或毒素做出反应。延髓的孤束核 (NTS) 接收来自后区、通过迷走神经的胃肠道、前庭系统和中枢神经系统（例如，脑膜、下丘脑）的信息。来自 NTS 的神经元投射到其他延髓核，并协调呕吐过程。\n\n参与刺激后区和邻近呕吐中枢核中呕吐反射的5个主要受体是 M₁ 毒蕈碱受体、D₂ 多巴胺能受体、H组胺受体、5-HT3 5-羟色胺能受体和神经激肽1 (NK1) 受体。5-HT3 受体拮抗剂（例如，昂丹司琼）和多巴胺受体拮抗剂（例如，甲氧氯普胺）对化疗引起的呕吐特别有帮助。当这些药物无法控制症状时，可以考虑使用 NK1 受体拮抗剂（阻止 P 物质释放）；它们可以预防与化疗相关的急性和迟发性呕吐。\n\n（选项 A）阿片受体拮抗剂（例如，纳曲酮）竞争性地结合阿片受体，以阻止内源性或外源性阿片类药物的作用。它们主要用于阿片依赖症。\n\n（选项 B）生长素调节消化间移行性收缩。红霉素是一种生长素受体激动剂，用于胃轻瘫。\n\n（选项 D）神经肽Y是一种在中枢和自主神经系统中发现的多肽神经递质。它被认为在食欲和疼痛知觉中起作用。神经肽Y拮抗剂已被研究作为潜在的抗肥胖药物。\n\n（选项 E）烟碱型拮抗剂主要用于手术期间的肌肉麻痹。一些抗组胺药（例如，异丙嗪、美克利嗪）和抗毒蕈碱药（例如，东莨菪碱）具有抗胆碱能活性，并对呕吐中枢和前庭器官有抑制作用（对晕动病有益）。\n\n教学目标：\n呕吐是一种反射，主要受5个受体调节，包括M₁毒蕈碱受体、D₂多巴胺能受体、H组胺受体、5-HT3 5-羟色胺能受体和神经激肽1 (NK1) 受体。5-HT3和NK1受体拮抗剂对化疗引起的呕吐特别有用。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the neuroreceptors involved in the vomiting reflex, specifically in the context of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It requires understanding the mechanism of action of different antiemetic drugs and their receptor targets.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the patient is already on a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (ondansetron), which is a first-line treatment for CINV. When 5-HT3 antagonists are ineffective, the next step is to consider NK1 receptor antagonists, which prevent both acute and delayed emesis associated with chemotherapy.",
