    "en": "An autopsy is performed on an 8-month-old infant after his unexpected death. Prior to death, the patient had a 1-month history of poor feeding and intermittent fever, which progressed to severe lethargy and coma. The infant was adopted soon after birth, and there is limited information about his family history beyond documentation of an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery at term gestation. Brain biopsy reveals leptomeningeal inflammation and is positive for Enterovirus by PCR. This patient would have been most likely to have which of the following laboratory findings?",

    "en": "Enterovirus is a common infection in children that typically causes self-limited disease, such as herpangina, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, or in some cases, aseptic meningitis. However, because neutralizing antibodies are required to clear Enterovirus, severe life-threatening infection can occur in infants with a primary humoral immunodeficiency such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). {{exhibit_1}}\n\nXLA, or Bruton agammaglobulinemia, is due to a mutation in the *BTK* gene encoding Bruton tyrosine kinase. A defect in this protein prevents pre-B cells from differentiating and exiting the bone marrow. Therefore, patients have LOW CIRCULATING B LYMPHOCYTES and low immunoglobulin levels.\n\nIn addition to enteroviral infection, XLA also increases the risk for recurrent SINOPULMONARY INFECTIONS by encapsulated bacteria (eg, *Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae* type b), which require antibody opsonization for phagocytosis. Patients with impaired humoral immunity are also predisposed to GASTROINTESTINAL INFECTIONS (eg, *Salmonella, Campylobacter*), as well as chronic giardiasis (due to low secretory IgA).\n\n(Choice A) An abnormal dihydrorhodamine test indicates an impaired neutrophil respiratory burst, which occurs in chronic granulomatous disease. Patients have recurrent skin and pulmonary infections with catalase-positive organisms (eg, *Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens*). Severe enteroviral infections are not seen.\n\n(Choice B) Absent peripheral neutrophils, as seen with acquired or congenital neutropenia, increase the risk of bacterial (eg, *Staphylococcus aureus*) and fungal (eg, *Candida*) infections. Neutrophils have little role in eradicating viruses.\n\n(Choice C) Eosinophils are involved in atopic disease and defense against parasitic infections. Lack of tissue eosinophils is not associated with severe, chronic viral infections.\n\n(Choice D) Total hemolytic complement (CH50) measures the serum's ability to lyse sheep erythrocytes coated with IgM antibody. A normal CH50 requires intact activity of all components of the classical complement pathway (C1-C9). Complement deficiency most often predisposes to autoimmunity (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus) or infection with encapsulated bacteria (eg, *Neisseria*).\n\n(Choice F) IgG2 is primarily responsible for opsonization of encapsulated bacteria. IgG2 subclass deficiency typically presents with frequent respiratory infections, not enteroviral meningitis, and the clinical course is generally less severe than with XLA.\n\nEducational objective:\nX-linked agammaglobulinemia, an immunodeficiency characterized by low circulating B lymphocytes and immunoglobulins, should be suspected in an infant with severe, life-threatening enteroviral infection. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "肠道病毒是儿童中常见的感染，通常会引起自限性疾病，如疱疹性咽峡炎、手足口病，或者在某些情况下，无菌性脑膜炎。然而，由于需要中和抗体来清除肠道病毒，在患有原发性体液免疫缺陷（如X连锁无丙种球蛋白血症（XLA））的婴儿中，可能会发生严重的危及生命的感染。{{exhibit_1}}\n\nXLA，或称Bruton无丙种球蛋白血症，是由于编码Bruton酪氨酸激酶的*BTK*基因突变引起的。该蛋白的缺陷阻止了前B细胞分化并离开骨髓。因此，患者具有循环B淋巴细胞低和免疫球蛋白水平低的特点。\n\n除了肠道病毒感染外，XLA还增加了由包膜细菌（例如，肺炎链球菌、b型流感嗜血杆菌）引起的复发性呼吸道感染的风险，这些细菌需要抗体调理才能被吞噬。体液免疫受损的患者也容易发生胃肠道感染（例如，沙门氏菌、弯曲杆菌），以及慢性贾第虫病（由于分泌型IgA低）。\n\n(选项A) 异常的二氢罗丹明试验表明中性粒细胞呼吸爆发受损，这种情况发生在慢性肉芽肿病中。患者会出现由过氧化氢酶阳性生物体（例如，金黄色葡萄球菌、粘质沙雷氏菌）引起的反复皮肤和肺部感染。通常不会出现严重的肠道病毒感染。\n\n(选项B) 外周中性粒细胞缺失，如在获得性或先天性中性粒细胞减少症中可见，会增加细菌（例如，金黄色葡萄球菌）和真菌（例如，念珠菌）感染的风险。中性粒细胞在清除病毒方面作用甚微。\n\n(选项C) 嗜酸性粒细胞参与特应性疾病和防御寄生虫感染。组织嗜酸性粒细胞缺乏与严重的慢性病毒感染无关。\n\n(选项D) 总溶血补体（CH50）衡量血清溶解包被有IgM抗体的绵羊红细胞的能力。正常的CH50需要经典补体途径的所有组分（C1-C9）的完整活性。补体缺陷最常使人易患自身免疫疾病（例如，系统性红斑狼疮）或被包膜细菌（例如，奈瑟菌）感染。\n\n(选项F) IgG2主要负责包膜细菌的调理作用。IgG2亚型缺陷通常表现为频繁的呼吸道感染，而不是肠道病毒性脑膜炎，并且临床病程通常不如XLA严重。\n\n教育目的：\n对于患有严重的、危及生命的肠道病毒感染的婴儿，应怀疑X连锁无丙种球蛋白血症，这是一种以循环B淋巴细胞和免疫球蛋白低为特征的免疫缺陷。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), a primary immunodeficiency, and its typical presentation with severe enteroviral infections due to the lack of neutralizing antibodies. It also assesses understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and laboratory findings associated with XLA. \n\nThe best approach is to recognize the severe enteroviral infection in an infant with limited family history and consider primary immunodeficiencies.
