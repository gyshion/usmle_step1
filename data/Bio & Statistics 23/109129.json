    "en": "A 33-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, comes to the office for a prenatal visit at 20 weeks gestation. She feels well and reports experiencing fetal movements. The patient and her husband have no medical conditions, but their first child, a 3-year-old boy, was born with spina bifida. Physical examination is unremarkable, and uterine size is in accordance with dates established using ultrasonography. The patient is worried that the fetus may develop the same birth defect as her first child. ",
    "zh": "一位33岁的女性，孕2产1，前来诊所进行产前检查，孕周20周。她感觉良好，并报告说感觉到了胎动。患者及其丈夫没有医疗状况，但他们的第一个孩子，一个3岁的男孩，出生时患有脊柱裂。体格检查无特殊发现，子宫大小与超声检查确定的孕周相符。患者担心胎儿可能患上与第一个孩子相同的出生缺陷。"

    "en": "Spina bifida is a neural tube defect in which incomplete fusion of the caudal neural tube leads to a cleft in the vertebral column, with or without an overlying epithelial defect and exposed neural tissue. Isolated spina bifida has a **multifactorial inheritance pattern** that is determined by genetic and environmental factors.\n\n*   **Genetic factors:** Disorders with a multifactorial inheritance pattern tend to **cluster in families,** suggesting that certain genetic variants contribute to the pathogenesis. In spina bifida, genetic factors may include inherited polymorphisms involving folate metabolism and variable epigenetic modifications (eg, methylation). Because this couple's first child has spina bifida, their subsequent children are at a slightly increased risk for the condition compared to the general population.\n*   **Environmental factors:** Maternal **folic acid deficiency** is a preventable risk factor for spina bifida. Similarly, in utero exposure to medications that interfere with folic acid metabolism (eg, valproic acid) is also associated with spina bifida. Other risk factors include maternal obesity and poorly controlled pregestational diabetes mellitus.\n\nLike spina bifida, **Sjögren syndrome** has a multifactorial inheritance pattern. Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disorder in which chronic inflammation leads to exocrine gland (eg, salivary, lacrimal) destruction, causing dry eyes and mouth. Although certain genotypes are associated with Sjögren syndrome, environmental factors also determine its incidence. A recent viral illness, for example, can lead to the production of autoantibodies (eg, anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB) that target exocrine glands.\n\nA multifactorial inheritance pattern is also characteristic of many other birth defects (eg, cleft palate) and autoimmune disorders (eg, type 1 diabetes mellitus) as well as atopic disease (eg, asthma).\n\n(Choice A) Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is characterized by development of multiple arteriovenous malformations (absent capillary beds). It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern *rather* than a multifactorial inheritance pattern.\n\n(Choice B) Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is characterized by impaired purine salvage resulting in neurobehavioral symptoms (eg, developmental delay, self-mutilating behavior). This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern.\n\n(Choice C) Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is due to impaired neutrophil migration, which causes recurrent infections. It is an autosomal recessive disorder.\n\n(Choice D) Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers is a mitochondrial disorder that causes myopathy and CNS disease (eg, myoclonus, epilepsy). Offspring generally *inherit* mitochondrial disorders only from an affected mother.\n\nEducational objective:\nSpina bifida has a multifactorial inheritance pattern, and incidence is determined by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Sjögren syndrome also has a multifactorial inheritance pattern.",
    "zh": "脊柱裂是一种神经管缺陷，其中尾部神经管融合不全导致椎柱裂，伴或不伴有覆盖的上皮缺损和暴露的神经组织。孤立性脊柱裂具有**多因素遗传模式**，由遗传和环境因素决定。\n\n*   **遗传因素：** 具有多因素遗传模式的疾病往往会**在家族中聚集**，这表明某些遗传变异有助于发病机制。在脊柱裂中，遗传因素可能包括涉及叶酸代谢的遗传多态性和可变的表观遗传修饰（例如，甲基化）。由于这对夫妇的第一个孩子患有脊柱裂，他们 subsequent 的孩子与普通人群相比，患此病的风险略有增加。\n*   **环境因素：** 母亲的**叶酸缺乏症**是脊柱裂的可预防危险因素。同样，子宫内暴露于干扰叶酸代谢的药物（例如，丙戊酸）也与脊柱裂相关。其他危险因素包括孕期肥胖和妊娠前糖尿病控制不佳。\n\n与脊柱裂一样，**干燥综合征**也具有多因素遗传模式。干燥综合征是一种自身免疫性疾病，其中慢性炎症导致外分泌腺（例如，唾液腺、泪腺）破坏，引起干眼症和口干。虽然某些基因型与干燥综合征相关，但环境因素也决定了其发生率。例如，最近的病毒感染可导致产生靶向外分泌腺的自身抗体（例如，抗 Ro/SSA、抗 La/SSB）。\n\n多因素遗传模式也是许多其他出生缺陷（例如，腭裂）和自身免疫性疾病（例如，1型糖尿病）以及特应性疾病（例如，哮喘）的特征。\n\n（选项 A）遗传性出血性毛细血管扩张症的特征是多发性动静脉畸形（毛细血管床缺失）的发展。它以常染色体显性模式遗传，*而不是*多因素遗传模式。\n\n（选项 B）Lesch-Nyhan综合征的特征是嘌呤补救受损，导致神经行为症状（例如，发育迟缓、自残行为）。这种情况以 X 连锁隐性遗传模式遗传。\n\n（选项 C）白细胞粘附缺陷是由于中性粒细胞迁移受损，导致反复感染。这是一种常染色体隐性遗传疾病。\n\n（选项 D）伴粗糙红纤维的肌阵挛性癫痫是一种线粒体疾病，可引起肌病和中枢神经系统疾病（例如，肌阵挛、癫痫）。后代通常只从受影响的母亲*遗传*线粒体疾病。\n\n教育目标：\n脊柱裂具有多因素遗传模式，其发生率由遗传和环境因素之间的复杂相互作用决定。干燥综合征也具有多因素遗传模式。"
