The patient's length, weight, and head circumference are at the 30th percentile. Examination shows profound hypotonia, truncal and appendicular weakness, and marked hyporeflexia.

    "en": "Genetic anticipation {{exhibit_1}}\n\nCompared to his mother, this neonate has profound symptoms of muscle weakness. These findings suggest genetic anticipation, in which an inherited condition presents earlier and with more severe disease in successive generations.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis in this case is myotonic dystrophy (DM), an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion:\n\n*   Classic (adult) DM: Muscle weakness affecting the distal extremities and face (eg, absent facial expression, long and narrow face) is classic, as seen in this patient's mother. Myotonia (impaired muscle relaxation) also occurs and is often described by patients as cramping or stiffness.\n\nWith increasing repeat expansion length, DM can cause worsening symptoms in successive generations, as seen in this infant.\n\n*   Congenital DM: Neonates have respiratory distress and poor feeding due to profound muscle weakness and hypotonia. Prenatal findings of DM may include polyhydramnios secondary to impaired swallowing from weakened pharyngeal muscles. Decreased fetal movement can also result in flexion contractures (ie, arthrogryposis) and clubfoot.\n\n(Choice B) Genetic heterogeneity describes different genetic mutations causing the same disease (eg, tuberous sclerosis). This mechanism is inconsistent with this patient's symptoms because affected members of the same family would have the same mutation. Moreover, this mother and child have markedly different disease manifestations.\n\n(Choice C) Germline mosaicism occurs when an unaffected parent has gametes with a mutated allele that is passed to offspring; it is typically suspected when multiple siblings have an autosomal dominant disorder with phenotypically normal parents.\n\n(Choice D) Prader-Willi syndrome often occurs due to maternal imprinting, in which a loss-of-function mutation in the paternal allele is inherited while the maternally inherited allele is silenced. Infants can have profound disease (eg, hypotonia, feeding difficulties), but the mother would not be affected.\n\n(Choice E) Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) refers to a variation at a single base pair within a DNA sequence. SNPs occur frequently throughout the genome and contribute to genetic variation within the population. If located near or within a gene, they may be markers of certain genetic diseases but would not cause the increasingly severe manifestations seen in this family's successive generations.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nAnticipation describes an inherited condition that presents earlier and with more severe disease in successive generations. In myotonic dystrophy, increasing length of the pathogenic trinucleotide repeat expansion accounts for severe hypotonia in a neonate (congenital) and mild symptoms (eg, myotonia, facial weakness) in a parent (classic [adult]).",
    "zh": "遗传性预期 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n与他的母亲相比，这名新生儿有严重的肌无力症状。这些发现提示遗传性预期，在这种情况下，遗传性疾病会在连续几代人中更早地出现，并且病情更严重。\n\n在这种情况下，最可能的诊断是肌强直性营养不良 (DM)，这是一种由三核苷酸重复序列扩增引起的常染色体显性遗传病：\n\n*   典型 (成人) DM：影响肢端和面部的肌无力（例如，面部表情缺失，脸又长又窄）是典型的，正如在该患者的母亲身上所见。肌强直（肌肉松弛受损）也会发生，患者通常将其描述为抽筋或僵硬。\n\n随着重复序列扩增长度的增加，DM 会导致连续几代人的症状恶化，正如在这名婴儿身上所见。\n\n*   先天性 DM：新生儿因严重的肌无力和肌张力减退而出现呼吸窘迫和喂养不良。 DM 的产前发现可能包括继发于咽肌无力导致吞咽受损的羊水过多。胎动减少也可能导致屈曲挛缩（即，关节挛缩症）和马蹄内翻足。\n\n(选项 B) 遗传异质性描述了导致相同疾病的不同基因突变（例如，结节性硬化症）。该机制与该患者的症状不一致，因为同一家庭的受影响成员将具有相同的突变。此外，这位母亲和孩子表现出明显不同的疾病表现。\n\n(选项 C) 种系嵌合发生在未受影响的父母具有将突变等位基因传递给后代的配子时；当多个兄弟姐妹患有常染色体显性遗传病，而父母表型正常时，通常会怀疑它。\n\n(选项 D) Prader-Willi 综合征通常是由于母体印记引起的，其中在父系等位基因中的功能丧失突变被遗传，而母系遗传的等位基因被沉默。婴儿可能患有严重疾病（例如，肌张力减退、喂养困难），但母亲不会受到影响。\n\n(选项 E) 单核苷酸多态性 (SNP) 指的是 DNA 序列内单个碱基对的变异。SNP 在整个基因组中频繁发生，并有助于人群内的遗传变异。如果位于基因附近或基因内，它们可能是某些遗传疾病的标记，但不会导致该家族连续几代人中出现的越来越严重的表现。\n\n教育目标：\n\n预期描述了在连续几代人中更早出现且病情更严重的遗传性疾病。在肌强直性营养不良中，致病性三核苷酸重复序列扩增长度的增加导致新生儿出现严重的肌张力减退（先天性）和父母出现轻微症状（例如，肌强直、面部无力）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of genetic anticipation, specifically in the context of myotonic dystrophy, and how it can lead to varying phenotypic presentations across generations. It requires understanding the underlying mechanism of trinucleotide repeat expansion and its correlation with disease severity. \n\nThe best approach is to recognize the pattern of increasing severity across generations (mother vs. child) and associate it with the concept of genetic anticipation. Rule out other genetic mechanisms that do not explain this specific pattern of inheritance and phenotypic variability.",
