    "en": "This patient's CT scan demonstrates ventriculomegaly out of proportion to sulci enlargement, consistent with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) {{exhibit_1}}. NPH is a form of communicating hydrocephalus associated with decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resorption by the arachnoid granulations. It may be idiopathic or occur secondary to prior brain trauma (as in this patient), infection, or subarachnoid hemorrhage, resulting in scarring of the arachnoid granulations. As CSF accumulates, the ventricles progressively expand to accommodate the increasing volume, thereby maintaining normal intracranial pressure.\n\nSymptoms of NPH are progressive and occur due to the disruption of periventricular white matter tracts by the expanding ventricles. Characteristic features include the following:\n\n*   Gait difficulties appear early in the disease course and are characterized by slow, short steps with decreased height. The feet may appear as though stuck to the ground (magnetic gait). Upper motor neuron signs (eg, spasticity, hyperreflexia) may also be evident.\n*   Cognitive disturbances, such as difficulty concentrating and apathy, usually become more apparent as the disease advances.\n*   Urinary incontinence is typically from urinary urgency. As the disease progresses, patients may develop apathy toward incontinence.\n\nSymptoms often improve in response to large-volume CSF removal, and long-term treatment frequently involves placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.\n\n(Choice A) Alzheimer disease typically presents with memory deficits out of proportion to other cognitive domains. Although ventricular enlargement may be seen on imaging as the disease progresses, it occurs in proportion to sulci enlargement and is the result of generalized brain atrophy (hydrocephalus ex-vacuo).\n\n(Choice B) Frontotemporal dementia causes memory deficits but primarily causes personality changes and aphasia. Neuroimaging demonstrates atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes.\n\n(Choice C) Parkinson disease causes gait abnormalities but is also typically associated with resting tremor and cogwheel rigidity. Cognitive deficits occur later in the disease course.\n\n(Choice D) Major depressive disorder can be associated with impaired concentration and loss of interest in activities (anhedonia). However, other features (eg, depressed mood, sleep disturbance) are not evident in this patient. In addition, neuroimaging and neurologic examination are typically normal.\n\n(Choice F) Noncommunicating (obstructive) hydrocephalus is typically associated with congenital abnormalities (eg, aqueductal stenosis) and tumors. It causes ventriculomegaly but is associated with elevated intracranial pressure (eg, headache, nausea/vomiting).\n\n(Choice G) Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause dementia but is typically associated with peripheral neuropathy (eg, abnormal position, vibration sense) and glossitis. Although MRI of the spinal cord can show degeneration of the posterior columns, CT scan of the head would be expected to be normal.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus presents with progressive gait difficulties, cognitive disturbances, and urinary incontinence. It is a form of communicating hydrocephalus characterized by ventriculomegaly without persistent elevations in intracranial pressure. Brain imaging reveals ventricular enlargement out of proportion to sulci enlargement.",
    "zh": "该患者的CT扫描显示脑室扩大与脑沟扩大不成比例，这与正常压力脑积水（NPH）{{exhibit_1}}一致。 NPH 是一种交通性脑积水，与蛛网膜颗粒对脑脊液 (CSF) 的吸收减少有关。它可以是特发性的，或者继发于既往脑外伤（如本患者）、感染或蛛网膜下腔出血，导致蛛网膜颗粒瘢痕形成。随着脑脊液的积累，脑室逐渐扩大以容纳增加的容量，从而维持正常的颅内压。\n\nNPH的症状是进行性的，是由于扩大脑室破坏室周白质束所致。特征性表现包括：\n\n*   步态困难出现在疾病早期，其特征是步履缓慢、步幅短且高度降低。足部可能看起来像是粘在地上（磁性步态）。上运动神经元征象（例如，痉挛、反射亢进）也可能很明显。\n*   认知障碍，如注意力不集中和冷漠，通常随着疾病的进展而变得更加明显。\n*   尿失禁通常源于尿急。随着疾病的进展，患者可能会对尿失禁产生冷漠。\n\n症状通常在大量脑脊液移除后改善，长期治疗通常涉及放置脑室腹腔分流术。\n\n(选项A) 阿尔茨海默病通常表现为记忆力减退，与其他认知领域不成比例。虽然在疾病进展过程中可能会在影像学检查中看到脑室扩大，但它与脑沟的扩大成比例发生，是全脑萎缩（真空脑积水）的结果。\n\n(选项B) 额颞叶痴呆会导致记忆力减退，但主要引起人格改变和失语。神经影像学检查显示额叶和颞叶萎缩。\n\n(选项C) 帕金森病会导致步态异常，但通常也与静止性震颤和齿轮状僵硬有关。认知障碍发生在疾病的后期。\n\n(选项D) 重度抑郁症可能与注意力受损和对活动的兴趣丧失（快感缺失）有关。然而，本患者没有出现其他特征（例如，情绪低落、睡眠障碍）。此外，神经影像学检查和神经系统检查通常是正常的。\n\n(选项F) 非交通性（梗阻性）脑积水通常与先天性异常（例如，导水管狭窄）和肿瘤有关。它会导致脑室扩大，但与颅内压升高有关（例如，头痛、恶心/呕吐）。\n\n(选项G) 维生素B12缺乏症可引起痴呆，但通常与周围神经病变（例如，异常姿势、振动觉）和舌炎有关。虽然脊髓MRI可以显示后柱的变性，但头部CT扫描预计是正常的。\n\n教育目标：\n\n正常压力脑积水表现为进行性步态困难、认知障碍和尿失禁。它是一种交通性脑积水，其特征是脑室扩大，但颅内压没有持续升高。脑部影像学检查显示脑室扩大，与脑沟扩大不成比例。"
