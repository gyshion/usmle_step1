    "en": "A 35-year-old man comes to the office due to worsening shortness of breath. The patient is an avid hiker; he began to have shortness of breath 18 months ago on challenging hikes, but it now occurs even while he is walking. He has also had mild wheezing and sputum production recently. He has no other medical problems. The patient has smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 5 years. His father died from lung and liver disease at a young age. Spirometry shows decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), decreased forced vital capacity (FVC), and a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio. This patient's lower lung lobes are most likely to demonstrate which of the following findings?",

    "en": "This patient with chronic progressive dyspnea has spirometry findings consistent with obstructive lung disease. His young age and family history of lung and liver disease suggest emphysema due to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The diagnosis is further suggested by his minimal smoking history; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to tobacco exposure alone is most commonly seen in those with a >30-pack-year smoking history.\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin is the major inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, and deficiency leads to unchecked elastase-mediated tissue damage in the lungs. Because alpha-1 antitrypsin is deficient throughout the acinus, the entirety of the acinus is affected, resulting in panacinar emphysema. The lower lung lobes are predominantly affected, likely due to relatively greater perfusion compared to the upper lung lobes, allowing for an increased rate of neutrophil infiltration.\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Centriacinar emphysema is characteristic of tobacco-related emphysema, as only the portion of the acinus most exposed to smoke particles is affected. Tobacco-related centriacinar emphysema predominantly affects the upper lung lobes, possibly due to a higher ventilation-perfusion ratio in those regions.\n\n(Choice B) Colonization of the lung with pathogenic bacteria most commonly occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis and is not a common feature of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.\n\n(Choice C) Compensatory hyperinflation refers to the expansion of normal lung parenchyma that occurs when adjacent lung segments or lobes collapse or are surgically removed.\n\n(Choice E) Subpleural blebs develop in severe emphysema but typically occur in the apices, rather than the bases, of the lung. Their rupture is a cause of spontaneous pneumothorax.\n\nEducational objective:\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin is the major serum inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency typically causes early-onset panacinar emphysema, predominantly affecting the lower lung lobes.",
    "zh": "这位患有慢性进行性呼吸困难的患者的肺活量测定结果与阻塞性肺病一致。他年轻的年龄和肺病和肝病家族史提示可能由于α-1抗胰蛋白酶缺乏引起的肺气肿。他轻微的吸烟史也提示该诊断；仅因接触烟草引起的慢性阻塞性肺病最常见于吸烟史超过30包-年的患者。\n\nα-1抗胰蛋白酶是中性粒细胞弹性蛋白酶的主要抑制剂，缺乏会导致肺部弹性蛋白酶介导的组织损伤不受控制。由于α-1抗胰蛋白酶在整个肺泡中都缺乏，整个肺泡都会受到影响，从而导致全小叶型肺气肿。下肺叶受影响为主，这可能是由于与上肺叶相比，其灌注相对更大，从而增加了中性粒细胞浸润的速率。\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项 A) 小叶中心型肺气肿是烟草相关性肺气肿的特征，因为只有暴露于烟雾颗粒的肺泡部分会受到影响。烟草相关性小叶中心型肺气肿主要影响上肺叶，这可能是由于这些区域的通气/血流比更高。\n\n(选项 B) 肺部病原菌定植最常见于囊性纤维化患者，而不是α-1抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症的常见特征。\n\n(选项 C) 代偿性过度充气是指当邻近的肺段或肺叶塌陷或手术切除时发生的正常肺实质的扩张。\n\n(选项 E) 肺泡下大疱发生在严重的肺气肿中，但通常发生在肺的顶部，而不是底部。它们的破裂是自发性气胸的原因。\n\n教学目标：\nα-1抗胰蛋白酶是中性粒细胞弹性蛋白酶的主要血清抑制剂。α-1抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症通常会导致早发性全小叶型肺气肿，主要影响下肺叶。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of emphysema subtypes and their association with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. It requires differentiating between centriacinar and panacinar emphysema based on clinical presentation, risk factors, and affected lung regions.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's age, smoking history, family history, and spirometry results. Recognize that early-onset emphysema with a family history of liver disease suggests ALPHA-1 ANTITRYPSIN DEFICIENCY, which typically causes PANACINAR EMPHYSEMA predominantly in the lower lobes.",
