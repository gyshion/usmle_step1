  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient at 8 weeks gestation with bruising is affected by intimate partner violence (IPV), which is any type of physical, psychologic, or sexual harm committed by a partner or spouse. During pregnancy and postpartum, patients and their partners experience marked increases in emotional, physical, and financial stressors. Initially, partners may be angry about the pregnancy but can later become supportive and exhibit gentler behavior. However, as pressure and responsibility increase, the partner may begin to blame the patient and pregnancy.\n\nThese factors can cause an increase in IPV during pregnancy, particularly in patients who experienced IPV prepregnancy. Because physical violence is typically directed at both the patient and the fetus (eg, hitting the pregnant abdomen), pregnant women are at significant risk for maternal morbidity (eg, injury, depression), homicide, and pregnancy complications (eg, preterm labor, abruptio placentae) due to abdominal trauma. Therefore, screening for IPV is required at the initial prenatal visit, during each trimester, and postpartum. Patients who screen positive should be assessed for immediate safety and given additional resources (eg, information about a domestic violence program) for long-term safety planning (eg, housing, childcare, finances). In some jurisdictions, there may also be mandatory reporting requirements for IPV during pregnancy.\n\n(Choice A) Advising the patient to stay with a relative for the duration of the pregnancy is not recommended because the provider cannot predict the partner's response (eg, potential increase in violence) or new safety concerns that may arise if the patient abruptly relocates.\n\n(Choice C) Recommending the patient file a restraining order against her boyfriend is inappropriate; the duty of the provider is to assess for imminent risk and provide medical and psychosocial resources, not to offer legal advice. In addition, a restraining order may cause the partner to retaliate.\n\n(Choices D and E) Referring the patient and her boyfriend to couples' therapy or recommending that the patient bring her boyfriend to the next prenatal appointment is inappropriate because confrontation or involvement of the partner at this time could endanger both the patient and the provider.\n\nEducational objective:\nIntimate partner violence (IPV) increases during pregnancy and the postpartum period and can cause significant maternal and pregnancy complications. Pregnant patients affected by IPV require immediate safety planning (eg, information about a domestic violence program) and resources for long-term planning.",
    "zh": "这位孕8周且有瘀伤的患者受到亲密伴侣暴力（IPV）的影响，后者是指伴侣或配偶实施的任何类型的身体、心理或性虐待。在怀孕和产后期间，患者及其伴侣会经历情绪、身体和经济压力的显着增加。最初，伴侣可能对怀孕感到愤怒，但后来会变得支持并表现出更温和的行为。然而，随着压力和责任的增加，伴侣可能开始责备患者和怀孕。\n\n这些因素会导致怀孕期间IPV的增加，尤其是在孕前经历过IPV的患者中。由于身体暴力通常针对患者和胎儿（例如，击打孕妇腹部），孕妇在产妇发病率（例如，受伤、抑郁症）、凶杀和妊娠并发症（例如，早产、胎盘早剥）方面存在显着风险，这源于腹部外伤。因此，需要在初次产前检查、每个孕期和产后进行IPV筛查。筛查呈阳性的患者应评估其即时安全，并提供额外资源（例如，有关家庭暴力项目的信息）以进行长期安全规划（例如，住房、儿童保育、财务）。在某些司法管辖区，可能也有关于孕期IPV的强制报告要求。\n\n(选项A) 不建议建议患者在整个孕期与亲属同住，因为提供者无法预测伴侣的反应（例如，暴力可能增加）或如果患者突然搬迁可能出现新的安全问题。\n\n(选项C) 建议患者对她的男朋友提出禁令是不合适的；提供者的职责是评估迫在眉睫的风险，并提供医疗和社会心理资源，而不是提供法律建议。此外，禁令可能会导致伴侣报复。\n\n(选项D和E) 将患者及其男朋友转诊至夫妻治疗或建议患者在下次产前检查时带上她的男朋友是不合适的，因为此时伴侣的对峙或参与可能会危及患者和提供者。\n\n教育目标：\n在怀孕和产后期间，亲密伴侣暴力（IPV）会增加，并可能导致严重的母体和妊娠并发症。受IPV影响的孕妇需要立即进行安全规划（例如，有关家庭暴力项目的信息）和长期规划的资源。"
