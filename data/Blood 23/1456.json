Examination shows dark blue periorbital ecchymosis on the right side. Ophthalmic and neurologic examinations are otherwise normal. After appropriate evaluation, the patient is discharged home. Several days later, the bruise becomes greenish in color.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a resolving hematoma after a traumatic injury. Following the injury, hemoglobin-containing erythrocytes escape into the periorbital tissues, giving the bruise its initial purple or bluish color. Erythrocyte destruction causes the release of iron-containing heme molecules. **Heme oxygenase** (contained in macrophages, among other cells) degrades heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and ferrous iron while consuming oxygen and electrons provided by NADH and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. Biliverdin is green in color and is further reduced (by the enzyme biliverdin reductase) to the yellow pigment bilirubin, which is then transported to the liver bound to albumin. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Bilirubin glucuronyl transferase, or uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronyl transferase (UGT), is the enzyme necessary for bilirubin conjugation to glucuronic acid. Lack of UGT or the use of medications that interfere with its activity impairs the liver's ability to conjugate bilirubin.\n\n(Choices B, D, and E) Ferrochelatase (inhibited by lead) is the final enzyme in the heme synthetic pathway. Porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG deaminase) and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) are also involved in heme production, not degradation; UROD deficiency can be seen in porphyria cutanea tarda, the most common porphyria, and PBG deaminase deficiency can be seen in acute intermittent porphyria.",
    "zh": "该患者在遭受外伤后出现血肿消退。损伤后，含有血红蛋白的红细胞逸入眶周组织，使瘀伤呈现最初的紫色或蓝灰色。红细胞破坏导致含有铁的血红素分子释放。**血红素加氧酶**（存在于巨噬细胞和其他细胞中）将血红素降解为胆绿素、一氧化碳和亚铁离子，同时消耗来自NADH和NADPH-细胞色素P450还原酶的氧气和电子。胆绿素呈绿色，并被进一步还原（通过酶胆绿素还原酶）为黄色色素胆红素，然后与白蛋白结合转运至肝脏。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项A) 胆红素葡萄糖醛酸转移酶，或尿苷5'-二磷酸-葡萄糖醛酸转移酶（UGT），是将胆红素结合到葡萄糖醛酸中的必要酶。缺乏UGT或使用干扰其活性的药物会损害肝脏结合胆红素的能力。\n\n(选项B、D和E) 铁螯合酶（被铅抑制）是血红素合成途径中的最终酶。卟胆原脱氨酶（PBG脱氨酶）和尿卟啉原脱羧酶（UROD）也参与血红素的生成，而不是降解；UROD缺乏可见于迟发性皮肤卟啉症，这是最常见的卟啉症，PBG脱氨酶缺乏可见于急性间歇性卟啉症。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the enzymatic breakdown of heme and the resulting color changes observed in resolving hematomas. Specifically, it focuses on the role of heme oxygenase in converting heme to biliverdin, which is responsible for the greenish color seen in bruises.\n\nTo solve this question, understand the sequence of events in heme degradation. Recall that heme oxygenase is the enzyme that converts heme to biliverdin, which is green. Knowing this enzymatic step allows you to select the correct answer.",
