    "en": "A 55-year-old man comes to the office due to intermittent shortness of breath, cough, and chest tightness over the past 3 months. The patient has asthma as a child that improved in adolescence, and he has not required inhalers or steroids since. He feels that his current symptoms are similar to his prior asthma symptoms. The patient was recently diagnosed with essential tremor, which has improved with medical therapy; he has no other chronic medical conditions. He is a lifetime nonsmoker and does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, pulse is 58/min, and respirations are 16/min. Physical examination reveals bilateral scattered expiratory wheezes. Heart sounds are normal and there is no extremity edema. This patient's symptom recurrence is most likely attributable to a medication that affects which of the following steps? Catecholamine pathway {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "The patient is experiencing a recurrence of asthma symptoms (shortness of breath, cough, wheezing) which are likely due to his medication for essential tremor. Essential tremor is a common movement disorder, and beta-blockers are often used as first-line therapy. Propranolol, a nonselective beta-blocker, is a common treatment for essential tremor. Beta-blockers work by preventing the interaction of epinephrine and norepinephrine with adrenergic receptors. The image shows the catecholamine pathway, and the question asks which step is affected by the medication. The table \"Effects of adrenergic blockade\" indicates that B2-adrenergic blockade can cause BRONCHOCONSTRICTION in the lungs. Therefore, the medication is likely a beta-blocker that inhibits beta-2 receptors, leading to bronchoconstriction and the patient's asthma symptoms. In the provided diagram, step F represents the interaction of catecholamines with beta-2 adrenergic receptors. The explanation for Choice F states that beta-blockers inhibit beta-2 adrenergic receptors, leading to bronchoconstriction. This directly explains the patient's symptoms. \n\n(Choice A) Step A represents the conversion of tyrosine to tyrosine, which is not a recognized step in catecholamine synthesis and is not directly targeted by common medications for essential tremor. \n(Choice B) Step B represents the conversion of tyrosine to DOPA, catalyzed by tyrosine hydroxylase. While this is a rate-limiting step in catecholamine synthesis, drugs targeting this step are not typically used for essential tremor. \n(Choice C) Step C represents the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine (NE). This step is catalyzed by dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Medications that inhibit this step are not standard treatment for essential tremor. \n(Choice D) Step D represents the breakdown or metabolism of catecholamines, likely through enzymes like MAO or COMT, leading to inactive metabolites. While beta-blockers affect the downstream effects of catecholamines, they do not directly inhibit their breakdown. \n(Choice E) Step E represents the action of catecholamines on adrenergic receptors, specifically beta-2 receptors in this context, leading to physiological effects. Beta-blockers work by blocking these receptors. The diagram shows step F as the blockade of these receptors. \n(Choice F) Step F represents the blockade of beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Propranolol, a nonselective beta-blocker used for essential tremor, blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. Blockade of beta-2 receptors in the lungs leads to bronchoconstriction, exacerbating asthma symptoms. This is the most likely explanation for the patient's recurrent wheezing. \n\nKey clinical pearls: Beta-blockers, especially nonselective ones like propranolol, can precipitate or worsen asthma symptoms due to beta-2 receptor blockade in the lungs. Patients with a history of reactive airway disease should be cautious with beta-blocker use. The diagram illustrates the catecholamine synthesis pathway and the sites of action of various drugs. Understanding the specific receptors targeted by medications is crucial for predicting side effects.",
    "zh": "患者正在经历哮喘症状的复发（呼吸短促、咳嗽、喘息），这很可能是由于他用于治疗原发性震颤的药物所致。原发性震颤是一种常见的运动障碍，β受体阻滞剂通常被用作一线治疗。普萘洛尔是一种非选择性β受体阻滞剂，是原发性震颤的常用治疗方法。β受体阻滞剂通过阻止肾上腺素和去甲肾上腺素与肾上腺素受体的相互作用而发挥作用。该图显示了儿茶酚胺通路，问题询问药物影响了哪个步骤。“肾上腺素阻滞的作用”表表明，B2-肾上腺素阻滞可导致肺部支气管收缩。因此，该药物很可能是抑制β-2受体的β受体阻滞剂，导致支气管收缩和患者的哮喘症状。在提供的图中，步骤F代表儿茶酚胺与β-2肾上腺素受体的相互作用。选项F的解释说明，β受体阻滞剂抑制β-2肾上腺素受体，导致支气管收缩。这直接解释了患者的症状。\n\n（选项A）步骤A代表酪氨酸转化为酪氨酸，这并非儿茶酚胺合成中公认的步骤，并且不受治疗原发性震颤的常用药物的直接靶向。\n（选项B）步骤B代表酪氨酸转化为DOPA，由酪氨酸羟化酶催化。虽然这是儿茶酚胺合成中的限速步骤，但靶向该步骤的药物通常不用来治疗原发性震颤。\n（选项C）步骤C代表多巴胺转化为去甲肾上腺素（NE）。此步骤由多巴胺β-羟化酶催化。抑制此步骤的药物不是治疗原发性震颤的标准方法。\n（选项D）步骤D代表儿茶酚胺的分解或代谢，可能通过单胺氧化酶（MAO）或儿茶酚胺-O-甲基转移酶（COMT）等酶进行，从而产生无活性代谢物。虽然β受体阻滞剂会影响儿茶酚胺的下游效应，但它们不会直接抑制其分解。\n（选项E）步骤E代表儿茶酚胺对肾上腺素受体，特别是在此情况下的β-2受体，的作用，导致生理效应。β受体阻滞剂通过阻断这些受体发挥作用。该图将步骤F显示为这些受体的阻滞。\n（选项F）步骤F代表β-2肾上腺素受体的阻滞。普萘洛尔（一种用于治疗原发性震颤的非选择性β受体阻滞剂）阻断β-1和β-2受体。阻断肺部的β-2受体可导致支气管收缩，加剧哮喘症状。这是患者复发性喘息的最可能解释。\n\n关键临床要点：β受体阻滞剂，尤其是普萘洛尔等非选择性β受体阻滞剂，由于肺部β-2受体阻滞，可诱发或加重哮喘症状。有反应性气道疾病病史的患者应谨慎使用β受体阻滞剂。该图说明了儿茶酚胺合成途径和各种药物的作用位点。了解药物靶向的特定受体对于预测副作用至关重要。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the mechanism of action of beta-blockers, specifically nonselective beta-blockers like propranolol, and their potential adverse effects on patients with reactive airway disease. It assesses the ability to correlate a patient's symptoms with a medication's known side effects by referencing a biochemical pathway.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the likely medication causing the patient's symptoms based on his diagnosis of essential tremor and the recurrence of asthma symptoms. Then, by understanding that beta-blockers are used for essential tremor and can cause bronchoconstriction via beta-2 receptor blockade, one can identify the correct step in the catecholamine pathway that represents this blockade.",
