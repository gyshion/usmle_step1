    "en": "A 59-year-old man comes to the emergency department with diplopia that started several hours ago. His past medical history is significant for long-standing diabetes with poor glycemic control, right-knee osteoarthritis, and peptic ulcer disease. Physical examination shows right-sided ptosis with the right pupil in the inferolateral position. Pupils are equal in size and reactive to light bilaterally. This patient's condition is most likely due to which of the following etiologies?",

    "en": "Diabetic mononeuropathy often involves cranial nerve III. It is caused by predominantly central ischemia, which affects the somatic nerve fibers but spares peripheral parasympathetic fibers. Symptoms include ptosis, a \"down and out\" gaze, and normal light and accommodation reflexes.\n\nNeuropathy is a common chronic complication of diabetes mellitus. The clinical features of diabetic neuropathy vary considerably depending on the pattern of nerve involvement, which can be broadly divided into polyneuropathy, mononeuropathy, and autonomic neuropathy. Mononeuropathies can also be further subdivided into cranial and peripheral types.\n\nAll ocular motor nerves (III, IV, VI) can be affected in diabetes but unilateral cranial nerve III (CN III) involvement is most common. Diabetic CN III mononeuropathy classically presents with acute onset diplopia. On examination, the affected eye assumes a \"down and out\" position due to the unopposed pull by the superior oblique (CN IV) and lateral rectus (CN VI) muscles because all other extraocular muscles (inferior oblique and superior, inferior, and medial recti) are supplied by CN III. Ptosis also occurs due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae.\n\nDiabetic mononeuropathy is caused by ischemic nerve damage, which predominantly involves the core of the CN III with relative sparing of the peripheral part. The somatic component of CN III that innervates the extraocular muscles is located centrally, but the autonomic component responsible for pupillary constriction and accommodation is located in the peripheral aspect of the nerve. Therefore, pupillary size and reactivity is normal in diabetic CN III mononeuropathy.\n\n(Choice A) CN III neuropathy can also occur due to nerve compression. Causes include transtentorial (unc al) herniation, neoplasms, and aneurysms of the posterior cerebral and posterior communicating arteries. In contrast to diabetic CN III mononeuropathy, pupillary dysfunction is often an early manifestation of external nerve compression due to injury of the peripherally located parasympathetic fibers.\n\n(Choices B and E) Neither nerve inflammation nor muscle infiltration contributes to the development of diabetic neuropathy.\n\n(Choice D) Lacunar midbrain strokes can involve the CN III nuclei. Because many neurologic pathways are densely packed in this area, CN III nuclei impairment is almost always associated with other neurologic deficits (eg, contralateral ataxia, hemiparesis, or contralateral extrapyramidal symptoms). In addition, the contralateral superior rectus is affected because the subnucleus fibers deccussate to the contralateral side. Midbrain lesions also cause bilateral ptosis because both levator palpebrae are innervated by a single subnucleus.\n\nEducational objective:\nDiabetic mononeuropathy often involves cranial nerve III. It is caused by predominantly central ischemia, which affects the somatic nerve fibers but spares peripheral parasympathetic fibers. Symptoms include ptosis, a \"down and out\" gaze, and normal light and accommodation reflexes.",
    "zh": "糖尿病性单神经病变常累及颅神经III。其主要由中心性缺血引起，影响躯体神经纤维，但保留周围副交感神经纤维。症状包括眼睑下垂、“向下和向外”的凝视以及正常的对光反应和调节反射。\n\n神经病变是糖尿病常见的慢性并发症。糖尿病神经病变的临床特征差异很大，取决于神经受累的模式，大致可分为多发性神经病变、单神经病变和自主神经病变。单神经病变也可进一步细分为颅神经型和周围神经型。\n\n所有动眼神经（III、IV、VI）都可能受糖尿病影响，但单侧颅神经III（CN III）受累最为常见。糖尿病性CN III单神经病变通常表现为急性起病的复视。检查时，受累眼呈“向下和向外”的位置，这是由于上斜肌（CN IV）和外直肌（CN VI）肌肉的无对抗牵引，因为所有其他眼外肌（下斜肌以及上、下、内直肌）均由CN III支配。眼睑下垂也发生，是由于提上睑肌麻痹所致。\n\n糖尿病性单神经病变由缺血性神经损伤引起，主要累及CN III的核心，而周围部分相对保留。CN III的支配眼外肌的躯体成分位于中枢，而负责瞳孔收缩和调节的自主神经成分位于神经的周围部分。因此，糖尿病性CN III单神经病变中瞳孔大小和反应正常。\n\n（选项A）CN III神经病变也可能因神经压迫引起。病因包括经小脑幕（钩回）疝、肿瘤和后脑动脉和后交通动脉的动脉瘤。与糖尿病性CN III单神经病变相比，由于周围定位的副交感神经纤维受损，瞳孔功能障碍通常是外部神经压迫的早期表现。\n\n（选项B和E）神经炎症和肌肉浸润均不会导致糖尿病神经病变的发展。\n\n（选项D）腔隙性脑干卒中可累及CN III核。由于许多神经通路在该区域密集分布，CN III核损伤几乎总是与其他神经功能缺损相关（例如，对侧共济失调、偏瘫或对侧锥体外系症状）。此外，对侧上直肌也会受到影响，因为亚核纤维交叉至对侧。脑干病变也会引起双侧眼睑下垂，因为两个提上睑肌都由一个单一的亚核支配。\n\n教育目标：\n糖尿病性单神经病变常累及颅神经III。其主要由中心性缺血引起，影响躯体神经纤维，但保留周围副交感神经纤维。症状包括眼睑下垂、“向下和向外”的凝视以及正常的对光反应和调节反射。"
