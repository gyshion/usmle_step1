    "en": "A neonate born to a 26-year-old woman is evaluated in the newborn nursery. The patient was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks gestation, and Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Initial evaluation shows hydrocephalus, jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly. Funduscopic examination reveals retinal exudates and scarring. Histopathologic evaluation of the placenta shows infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages, as well as many areas of calcification. Within the placental tissue, there are numerous intracellular, crescent-shaped organisms with a central nucleus.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This neonate with retinal lesions (chorioretinitis) and hydrocephalus has a placenta containing inflammatory cells, calcifications, and crescent-shaped organisms. These findings are consistent with congenital toxoplasmosis, an infection caused by the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Nonspecific neonatal findings of jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly are often present; diffuse intracranial calcifications are the classic finding on imaging.\n\nParasitic spread of Toxoplasma begins via infected cats (host), which excrete oocysts that contaminate soil and water. Humans typically acquire the infection due to either of the following:\n\nIncidental ingestion of oocysts from cat feces (eg, handling kitty litter, consuming unwashed produce)\nConsumption of undercooked meat from farm animals that ingested oocysts and developed tissue infection\nIngestion of contaminated meat is the most common method of spread in pregnancy. Therefore, although maternal infection is often asymptomatic, pregnant women are advised to avoid raw, cured, and undercooked meat to reduce the risk of infection and transplacental transmission to the fetus.\n\n(Choice A) Preconception maternal immunization with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine can prevent congenital rubella infection. Characteristic features of congenital rubella include hearing loss, cataracts (cloudy cornea), and cardiac defects (eg, patent ductus arteriosus), none of which are seen in this patient. Moreover, retinal lesions and hydrocephalus are uncommon, and rubella is a virus, not a crescent-shaped, intracellular parasite.\n\n(Choice C) Pregnant women should avoid, not preferentially consume, unpasteurized milk products, primarily to prevent congenital Listeria monocytogenes infection, which can lead to multiorgan abscesses or fetal demise. Although rare, Toxoplasma and other pathogens can also spread through raw milk.\n\n(Choice D) Malaria, a parasitic infection transmitted by mosquitoes, can cause intrauterine infection, but infants with congenital malaria typically present with fever and anemia, not hydrocephalus and chorioretinitis. In addition, although Plasmodium falciparum is a crescent-shaped intracellular organism, placental biopsy would show intervillous accumulation of parasitized red blood cells without calcifications.\n\n(Choice E) Prophylactic penicillin is used during labor to prevent group B Streptococcus (GBS) transmission to the fetus during delivery. Infection typically leads to early neonatal sepsis (eg, lethargy, hypoxia, temperature instability), findings not seen in this patient. Moreover, in contrast to this patient's pathologic findings, GBS is a gram-positive coccus that forms chains.\n\nEducational objective:\nPregnant women should avoid consumption of undercooked meat to prevent infection with Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular, crescent-shaped parasite that can cross the placenta to the fetus. Typical features of congenital toxoplasmosis include chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and diffuse intracranial calcifications.",
    "zh": "该新生儿出现视网膜病变（脉络膜视网膜炎）和脑积水，其胎盘中含有炎性细胞、钙化灶和新月形生物体。这些发现与先天性弓形虫病一致，这是一种由细胞内寄生虫弓形虫引起的感染。通常存在非特异性的新生儿表现，如黄疸和肝脾肿大；弥漫性颅内钙化是影像学上的典型发现。\n\n弓形虫的寄生虫传播始于受感染的猫（宿主），它们会排出污染土壤和水源的卵囊。人类通常由于以下原因之一而感染：\n\n意外摄入来自猫粪便的卵囊（例如，处理猫砂、食用未洗过的农产品）\n食用来自摄入了卵囊并发生组织感染的农场动物的未煮熟的肉\n摄入受污染的肉是妊娠中最常见的传播方式。因此，尽管孕妇感染通常无症状，但建议孕妇避免食用生肉、腌制肉和未煮熟的肉，以降低感染风险以及经胎盘传播给胎儿的风险。\n\n（选项 A）孕前使用麻疹、腮腺炎和风疹疫苗接种可以预防先天性风疹感染。先天性风疹的特征包括听力损失、白内障（角膜混浊）和心脏缺陷（例如，动脉导管未闭），该患者均未见。此外，视网膜病变和脑积水并不常见，而且风疹是一种病毒，而不是新月形的细胞内寄生虫。\n\n（选项 C）孕妇应避免食用未经巴氏消毒的牛奶产品，而不是优先食用，这主要是为了预防先天性单核细胞增生李斯特菌感染，这种感染可导致多器官脓肿或胎儿死亡。虽然罕见，但弓形虫和其他病原体也可能通过生牛奶传播。\n\n（选项 D）疟疾是一种由蚊子传播的寄生虫感染，可引起宫内感染，但患有先天性疟疾的婴儿通常表现为发烧和贫血，而不是脑积水和脉络膜视网膜炎。此外，尽管恶性疟原虫是一种新月形的细胞内生物，但胎盘活检会显示受寄生虫感染的红细胞在绒毛间积聚，而没有钙化。\n\n（选项 E）在分娩过程中使用预防性青霉素，以防止 B 组链球菌 (GBS) 在分娩过程中传播给胎儿。感染通常会导致新生儿早期败血症（例如，嗜睡、缺氧、体温不稳定），该患者未见这些表现。此外，与该患者的病理学发现相反，GBS 是一种革兰氏阳性球菌，形成链。\n\n教育目标：\n孕妇应避免食用未煮熟的肉，以预防弓形虫感染，这是一种细胞内的新月形寄生虫，可以穿过胎盘进入胎儿。先天性弓形虫病的典型特征包括脉络膜视网膜炎、脑积水和弥漫性颅内钙化。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of congenital toxoplasmosis, its transmission routes, clinical presentation in neonates, and preventive measures during pregnancy. It requires recognizing the classic triad of chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and intracranial calcifications, and linking it to the consumption of undercooked meat as the primary risk factor.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key clinical features suggesting congenital toxoplasmosis. Then, recall the transmission routes of Toxoplasma gondii, focusing on the association with undercooked meat. Eliminate options that are related to other congenital infections or neonatal conditions.",
