  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, an inherited inborn error of metabolism often presenting in infancy with lactic acidosis and neurologic defects. The disease results from deficient activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, a multi-enzyme complex generating acetyl-CoA from pyruvate, thereby linking glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Dietary carbohydrates are broken down into pyruvate via glycolysis; in patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, the lack of enzymatic activity leads to a buildup of pyruvate, which is shunted to lactate via lactate dehydrogenase, generating a potentially life-threatening lactic acidosis.\n\nDisease management involves the implementation of a ketogenic diet: a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet with moderate levels of protein. This diet forces the production of ketone bodies from fat and amino acid catabolism to fuel the body in the place of glucose. The near-absence of glucose in the diet decreases the amount of pyruvate generated, thereby decreasing lactate levels.\n\nAmino acid catabolism results in formation of intermediates that are referred to as glucogenic, ketogenic, or both. Glucogenic amino acid metabolism produces pyruvate or TCA cycle intermediates, which can be converted to glucose via gluconeogenesis. Ketogenic amino acid metabolism generates the ketone body precursor acetyl-CoA. Lysine and leucine are exclusively ketogenic amino acids; they cannot be metabolized to pyruvate and consumption will not lead to increased production of lactic acid.\n\n(Choices A and F) The non-essential glucogenic amino acids alanine and serine can be converted to pyruvate through a transamination reaction catalyzed by alanine transaminase and a deamination reaction catalyzed by serine dehydratase, respectively.\n\n(Choice B) Asparagine is catabolized to aspartate and subsequently transaminated to produce glutamate and oxaloacetate, an intermediate of the TCA cycle. Oxaloacetate by itself cannot be used to produce energy; it must first undergo condensation with acetyl-CoA to form citrate.\n\n(Choice C) The monosaccharide galactose is metabolized in the glycolytic pathway; dietary intake will result in elevated levels of lactate in patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency.\n\n(Choice D) Glycerol is metabolized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, a glycolysis intermediate. It can be used as a substrate to form pyruvate and, subsequently, lactate.\n\nEducational objective:\nPyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency is an inherited inborn error of metabolism causing lactic acidosis and neurologic defects. Patients are unable to convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, resulting in a shunting of pyruvate to lactic acid. In these patients, metabolism of exclusively ketogenic amino acids (eg, lysine, leucine) can provide energy in the form of acetyl-CoA without increasing lactate production.",
    "zh": "该患者患有丙酮酸脱氢酶缺乏症，这是一种常在婴儿期出现的遗传性先天性代谢错误，表现为乳酸酸中毒和神经系统缺陷。该疾病是由于丙酮酸脱氢酶复合物活性不足所致，丙酮酸脱氢酶复合物是一个多酶复合物，通过丙酮酸生成乙酰辅酶A，从而将糖酵解与TCA循环连接起来。膳食碳水化合物通过糖酵解分解成丙酮酸；在丙酮酸脱氢酶缺乏症患者中，缺乏酶活性会导致丙酮酸堆积，丙酮酸通过乳酸脱氢酶分流到乳酸，从而产生潜在的危及生命的乳酸酸中毒。\n\n疾病管理涉及实施生酮饮食：一种高脂肪、低碳水化合物饮食，蛋白质含量适中。这种饮食迫使酮体从脂肪和氨基酸分解代谢中产生，以代替葡萄糖为身体提供能量。饮食中几乎没有葡萄糖会减少丙酮酸的产生量，从而降低乳酸水平。\n\n氨基酸分解代谢导致中间产物的形成，这些中间产物被称为生糖、生酮或两者兼有。生糖氨基酸代谢产生丙酮酸或TCA循环中间体，这些中间体可以通过糖异生转化为葡萄糖。生酮氨基酸代谢生成酮体前体乙酰辅酶A。赖氨酸和亮氨酸是纯生酮氨基酸；它们不能代谢成丙酮酸，食用不会导致乳酸产生增加。\n\n（选项A和F）非必需生糖氨基酸丙氨酸和丝氨酸可以分别通过丙氨酸转氨酶催化的转氨反应和丝氨酸脱水酶催化的脱氨反应转化为丙酮酸。\n\n（选项B）天冬酰胺分解代谢成天冬氨酸，随后转氨生成谷氨酸和草酰乙酸，草酰乙酸是TCA循环的中间体。草酰乙酸本身不能用于产生能量；它必须首先与乙酰辅酶A缩合形成柠檬酸。\n\n（选项C）单糖半乳糖在糖酵解途径中代谢；摄入膳食会导致丙酮酸脱氢酶缺乏症患者的乳酸水平升高。\n\n（选项D）甘油代谢成3-磷酸甘油醛，这是一个糖酵解中间体。它可以用作形成丙酮酸，随后形成乳酸的底物。\n\n教育目标：\n丙酮酸脱氢酶复合物缺乏症是一种遗传性先天性代谢错误，可导致乳酸酸中毒和神经系统缺陷。患者无法将丙酮酸转化为乙酰辅酶A，导致丙酮酸分流到乳酸。在这些患者中，仅生酮氨基酸（例如，赖氨酸、亮氨酸）的代谢可以以乙酰辅酶A的形式提供能量，而不会增加乳酸的产生。"
