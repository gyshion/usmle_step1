    "en": "This patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) has bruising, epistaxis, and a prolonged PT, findings consistent with vitamin K deficiency. Patients with CF are at increased risk due to a predisposition to PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY, in which viscous exocrine secretions block pancreatic ducts. Reduced secretion of pancreatic enzymes leads to FAT MALABSORPTION and deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (ie, A, D, E, K).\n\nVitamin K normally acts as an important cofactor in the hepatic activation of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S. VITAMIN K DEFICIENCY results in low levels of activated vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, and PROLONGED PT is caused by deficiency of activated factor VII. Activated PTT (aPTT) is typically normal, as seen in this patient, although it can be prolonged with severe vitamin K deficiency (due to the effect on factor II).\n\nVitamin K deficiency presents with EASY BRUISING and mucosal bleeding (eg, epistaxis). Treatment is vitamin K administration, and patients with CF also should receive pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy to improve fat-soluble vitamin absorption. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Factor V is not dependent on vitamin K for activation. Factor V deficiency is rare and leads to prolonged PT and aPTT.\n\n(Choice C) Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by factor VIII deficiency. As part of the intrinsic pathway, factor VIII deficiency results in prolongation of aPTT with normal PT.\n\n(Choice D) Factor XII (ie, Hageman factor) is part of the intrinsic coagulation pathway and is not vitamin K dependent. Patients with inherited factor XII deficiency are typically asymptomatic but have prolonged aPTT.\n\n(Choice E) Fibrinogen normally assists in coagulation via the final common pathway through fibrin clot formation and platelet binding. Fibrinogen is not dependent on vitamin K for activation. Coagulation disorders involving fibrinogen include severe liver disease and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which are associated with prolonged PT and aPTT.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients with cystic fibrosis are at risk for fat-soluble vitamin (ie, A, D, E, K) deficiency due to fat malabsorption from pancreatic insufficiency. Vitamin K is an important cofactor in the activation of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. Vitamin K deficiency leads to easy bruising, mucosal bleeding, and prolonged PT. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "这位患有囊性纤维化(CF)的患者出现瘀伤、鼻衄和PT延长，这些表现与维生素K缺乏症一致。CF患者由于易患胰腺功能不全而面临更高的风险，在这种情况下，粘稠的外分泌物会阻塞胰管。胰酶分泌减少导致脂肪吸收不良和脂溶性维生素（即A、D、E、K）缺乏。\n\n维生素K通常在肝脏激活凝血因子II、VII、IX和X以及蛋白C和S中起重要辅助因子的作用。维生素K缺乏症导致激活的维生素K依赖性凝血因子水平降低，PT延长是由于激活的VII因子缺乏所致。活化的PTT (aPTT) 通常是正常的，正如在本患者中观察到的那样，尽管在严重维生素K缺乏症的情况下（由于对II因子的影响），它也可能延长。\n\n维生素K缺乏症表现为容易瘀伤和黏膜出血（如鼻衄）。治疗方法是补充维生素K，CF患者也应接受胰酶替代治疗，以改善脂溶性维生素的吸收。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项A) 凝血因子V的活化不依赖于维生素K。凝血因子V缺乏症很少见，会导致PT和aPTT延长。\n\n(选项C) 甲型血友病是一种X连锁隐性遗传病，由凝血因子VIII缺乏引起。作为内源性途径的一部分，凝血因子VIII缺乏会导致aPTT延长，而PT正常。\n\n(选项D) 凝血因子XII（即Hageman因子）是内源性凝血途径的一部分，不依赖于维生素K。患有遗传性凝血因子XII缺乏症的患者通常无症状，但aPTT延长。\n\n(选项E) 纤维蛋白原通常通过纤维蛋白凝块形成和血小板结合，通过最终共同途径辅助凝血。纤维蛋白原的活化不依赖于维生素K。涉及纤维蛋白原的凝血障碍包括严重肝病和弥漫性血管内凝血，这与PT和aPTT延长有关。\n\n教育目标：\n患有囊性纤维化的患者由于胰腺功能不全导致脂肪吸收不良，因此有脂溶性维生素（即A、D、E、K）缺乏的风险。维生素K是激活凝血因子II、VII、IX和X的重要辅助因子。维生素K缺乏症导致容易瘀伤、黏膜出血和PT延长。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of vitamin K deficiency in the context of cystic fibrosis, specifically how it affects coagulation factors and lab values. It requires understanding the role of vitamin K in activating certain coagulation factors and the consequences of its deficiency on prothrombin time (PT).\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's risk factors for vitamin K deficiency (cystic fibrosis, malabsorption), identify the prolonged PT, and recall that vitamin K is essential for the activation of factors II, VII, IX, and X. Therefore, a deficiency in factor VII is the most likely cause of the prolonged PT.",
