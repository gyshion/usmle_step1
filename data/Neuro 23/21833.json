    "en": "A 24-year-old previously healthy man is brought to the emergency department after a motorcycle collision. The patient was intubated in the field. On arrival, Glasgow Coma Scale is 3/15. CT scan of the head {{exhibit_1}} shows left temporoparietal skull fractures, a large subdural hematoma, and diffuse cerebral edema. The patient undergoes hematoma evacuation and decompressive craniotomy. He is admitted in the neurocritical care unit, and supportive measures are provided. His clinical status gradually improves, and the patient is extubated on day 9. Over the next 15 months the patient opens his eyes spontaneously, gazing randomly around the room, but does not visually track moving objects. Bilateral pupils are equally responsive to light. He does not vocalize or follow instructions. The patient moves all 4 extremities, but the movements are not purposeful and there is no withdrawal to painful stimuli. The patient tolerates feeding via a percutaneous gastrostomy tube but has urinary and fecal incontinence.",

    "en": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and was comatose initially. Coma is an unconscious state in which patients are awake, unarousable, and unaware. Coma typically progresses toward 1 of 3 neurologic outcomes:\n\n*   Recovery: Consciousness is restored, but patients typically have residual cognitive, motor, and/or sensory deficits requiring rehabilitation.\n*   Brain death: Cerebral and brainstem function cease. Patients have no cranial nerve reflexes and are apneic (no spontaneous breathing, requiring continuous mechanical ventilation) (Choice A).\n*   Persistent vegetative state (PVS): A chronic state of wakefulness without awareness. Due to the possibility of interim recovery, PVS can be diagnosed only after sufficient time has elapsed (≥12 months) after post-TBI coma.\n\nPatients with PVS are awake, evidenced by spontaneous eye opening and normal sleep-wake cycles. However, they are unaware, as indicated by non-responsiveness to external stimuli, absence of language comprehension or expression, and lack of purposeful visual tracking. Brainstem reflexes (eg, cough, gag, pupillary constriction) are usually intact. Because voluntary sphincter control is lost in PVS, patients have urinary and fecal incontinence. Similarly, control of swallowing (a complex voluntary process) is lost, so patients with PVS require enteral (eg, gastrostomy) tube feedings.\n\n(Choice B) Cataplexy is an abrupt, massive inhibition of muscle tone typically triggered by strong emotions (laughter, fright) in patients with narcolepsy. Patients suddenly go limp and collapse, but they usually recover after a few seconds.\n\n(Choice C) Locked-in syndrome can occur due to osmotic demyelination (eg, excessively rapid hyponatremia correction) or infarction (eg, basilar artery stroke) of pontine corticospinal neurons. As opposed to being unaware and mobile (like this patient), locked-in patients are aware but completely paralyzed except for blinking and vertical eye movement.\n\n(Choice E) Selective mutism is a form of social anxiety disorder in which patients do not verbalize despite negative interpersonal consequences. Despite not speaking, these patients' level of consciousness is intact.\n\nEducational objective:\nPersistent vegetative state (PVS), a chronic state of wakefulness without awareness, is a common post-coma outcome following severe brain injury. Patients with PVS have sufficient brainstem function to maintain vital processes such as spontaneous respiration, but require continuous medical care due to absence of purposeful movement and communication.",
    "zh": "创伤性脑损伤 (TBI) 并且最初处于昏迷状态。昏迷是一种无意识状态，在这种状态下，患者是清醒的，无法被唤醒，并且没有意识。昏迷通常会发展为以下 3 种神经学结果之一：\n\n*   恢复：意识恢复，但患者通常会存在残留的认知、运动和/或感觉缺陷，需要康复治疗。\n*   脑死亡：大脑和脑干功能停止。患者没有脑神经反射，并且出现呼吸暂停（没有自主呼吸，需要持续的机械通气）(选项 A)。\n*   持续性植物人状态 (PVS)：一种没有意识的慢性清醒状态。由于存在中期恢复的可能性，PVS 只能在 TBI 后昏迷后经过足够的时间（≥12 个月）才能诊断。\n\nPVS 患者是清醒的，表现为自发睁眼和正常的睡眠-觉醒周期。然而，他们没有意识，这体现在对外部刺激无反应、缺乏语言理解或表达以及缺乏有目的的视觉追踪。脑干反射（例如，咳嗽、干呕、瞳孔收缩）通常是完整的。由于 PVS 患者丧失了自主括约肌控制，因此会出现尿失禁和粪便失禁。同样，吞咽（一个复杂的自主过程）的控制也丧失了，因此 PVS 患者需要肠内（例如，胃造口术）管饲。\n\n(选项 B) 猝倒症是肌张力突然、大规模的抑制，通常由强烈的情绪（笑声、恐惧）触发，发生在嗜睡症患者中。患者突然变得虚弱并倒下，但他们通常会在几秒钟后恢复。\n\n(选项 C) 闭锁综合征可能由于渗透性脱髓鞘（例如，快速纠正低钠血症）或脑桥皮质脊髓神经元的梗死（例如，基底动脉卒中）而发生。与没有意识且可以移动（如本患者）不同，闭锁综合征患者是有意识的，但除了眨眼和垂直眼球运动外，完全瘫痪。\n\n(选项 E) 选择性缄默症是一种社交焦虑症，患者尽管有负面的社交后果，但仍然不说话。尽管不说话，这些患者的意识水平是完整的。\n\n教育目标：\n持续性植物人状态 (PVS) 是一种慢性清醒状态，没有意识，是严重脑损伤后常见的昏迷后结果。PVS 患者具有足够的脑干功能来维持重要的过程，例如自主呼吸，但由于缺乏有目的的运动和交流，需要持续的医疗护理。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to differentiate between various states of altered consciousness following traumatic brain injury, specifically focusing on the diagnostic criteria for persistent vegetative state (PVS). It requires understanding the clinical features that distinguish PVS from brain death, locked-in syndrome, cataplexy, and selective mutism. \n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key features of PVS: wakefulness without awareness, spontaneous eye opening, intact brainstem reflexes, lack of purposeful movement, and urinary/fecal incontinence. Rule out other conditions based on the presence or absence of these features. Remember that PVS diagnosis requires a period of observation (≥12 months) after a TBI-induced coma.",
