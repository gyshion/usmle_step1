    "en": "A 34-year-old woman comes to the office due to a 1 week history of mood swings, difficulty concentrating, and hand tremors. She also has pain at the front of her neck that radiates to her ears and is worse with swallowing. The patient initially attributed her symptoms to a flu-like illness that she had a few weeks earlier. She has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. Blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg and pulse is 105/min. The thyroid gland is very tender on palpation. After initial laboratory testing, a thyroid scan is performed and reveals diffusely decreased radioiodine uptake. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 105 mm/hr.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with painful enlargement of the thyroid gland has subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (SGT), also called de Quervain thyroiditis. SGT typically follows an acute viral illness and is thought to be due to a cross-reacting immune response against viral proteins or tissue antigens released during cellular injury. Patients may experience a transient hyperthyroid phase (elevated thyroxine [T4], suppressed TSH) due to release of stored thyroid hormone. Radioiodine uptake is decreased in SGT as the low TSH levels suppress synthesis of new thyroid hormone. The disease is self-limited and resolves in <6 weeks.\n\nSGT is initially characterized by a neutrophilic infiltrate with microabscess formation, which, as the disease progresses, is replaced by a more generalized inflammatory infiltrate with macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. The inflammatory process is reflected by elevated serum acute-phase markers (eg, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate).\n\n(Choice A) Papillary thyroid cancer is characterized by branching papillary structures with concentric calcifications (psammoma bodies). This malignancy would typically present with nodular enlargement rather than acute pain and tenderness.\n\n(Choice B) Riedel thyroiditis is characterized by extensive fibrosis of the thyroid gland that extends into surrounding tissues. The thyroid gland is hard and nontender.\n\n(Choice C) Diffusely hyperplastic follicles with tall, crowded cells forming intrafollicular projections can be seen in Graves disease, which would show increased radioiodine uptake due to excessive TSH receptor stimulation.\n\n(Choice E) Chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis is characterized by diffuse, painless thyroid enlargement, often with symptoms of hypothyroidism (eg, fatigue, cold intolerance). Biopsy reveals diffuse lymphocytic infiltration with formation of germinal centers.\n\nEducational objective:\nSubacute granulomatous (de Quervain) thyroiditis is characterized by painful thyroid enlargement and usually follows a viral illness. Biopsy shows a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "这位甲状腺疼痛性肿大的患者患有亚急性肉芽肿性甲状腺炎（SGT），也称为de Quervain甲状腺炎。SGT通常发生在急性病毒性疾病之后，被认为是由于针对细胞损伤期间释放的病毒蛋白或组织抗原的交叉反应性免疫反应。由于储存的甲状腺激素的释放，患者可能会经历短暂的甲状腺功能亢进期（甲状腺素[T4]升高，TSH抑制）。由于低TSH水平抑制了新甲状腺激素的合成，SGT中放射碘摄取减少。该病具有自限性，在<6周内消退。\n\nSGT最初的特征是中性粒细胞浸润伴有微脓肿形成，随着疾病的进展，被巨噬细胞和多核巨细胞的更广泛的炎症浸润所取代。炎症过程反映在血清急性期标志物升高（如C反应蛋白、红细胞沉降率）中。\n\n(选项A) 乳头状甲状腺癌的特征是具有同心钙化（砂粒体）的分支乳头状结构。这种恶性肿瘤通常表现为结节性肿大，而不是急性疼痛和压痛。\n\n(选项B) Riedel甲状腺炎的特征是甲状腺广泛的纤维化，延伸到周围组织。甲状腺坚硬且无压痛。\n\n(选项C) 格雷夫斯病可见弥漫性增生滤泡，高而拥挤的细胞形成滤泡内突起，由于过度的TSH受体刺激，其放射碘摄取会增加。\n\n(选项E) 慢性淋巴细胞性（桥本氏）甲状腺炎的特征是弥漫性、无痛性甲状腺肿大，通常伴有甲状腺功能减退的症状（如疲劳、畏寒）。活检显示弥漫性淋巴细胞浸润，并形成生发中心。\n\n教育目标：\n亚急性肉芽肿性（de Quervain）甲状腺炎的特征是甲状腺疼痛性肿大，通常继发于病毒感染。活检显示混合性炎症浸润，伴有巨噬细胞和多核巨细胞。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the etiology, clinical presentation, and histopathological findings of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (de Quervain's thyroiditis). It requires differentiating this condition from other causes of thyroiditis and thyroid nodules based on clinical and laboratory findings.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis: recent viral illness, painful and tender thyroid enlargement, elevated ESR, and decreased radioiodine uptake. These findings point to an inflammatory process with characteristic histopathological changes.",
