    "en": "Radiographs show an anterior dislocation of the humerus. Reduction of the patient's dislocated joint is performed under procedural sedation with intravenous propofol. A single bolus of propofol provides adequate sedation for the procedure, and he becomes clinically alert several minutes after administration. Which of the following mechanisms most likely explains this patient's rapid recovery from anesthesia?",
    "zh": "X光片显示肱骨前脱位。在静脉注射丙泊酚的镇静下进行患者脱位关节的复位。单次推注丙泊酚为该手术提供了足够的镇静，并且他在给药后几分钟内临床上变得清醒。以下哪种机制最有可能解释该患者从麻醉中快速恢复的原因？"

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "(Choice A) Although propofol is metabolized in the liver through hepatic conjugation, its half-life is 4 hours to 1 day; therefore, hepatic metabolism does not occur fast enough to account for such a short duration of action.\n(Choice B) Volatile, inhaled anesthetics such as halothane are predominately eliminated by the lungs.\n(Choice C) Renal tubular secretion and glomerular filtration are the predominate mechanisms through which water-soluble drugs are eliminated.\n(Choice D) Atracurium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent that spontaneously degrades in plasma and organ tissue, a type of metabolism known as Hofmann elimination.",
    "zh": "(选项A) 虽然丙泊酚通过肝脏结合在肝脏中代谢，但其半衰期为4小时到1天；因此，肝脏代谢发生的速度不足以解释如此短的药效持续时间。\n(选项B) 挥发性吸入麻醉剂（如氟烷）主要通过肺部消除。\n(选项C) 肾小管分泌和肾小球滤过是水溶性药物消除的主要机制。\n(选项D) 阿曲库铵是一种非去极化神经肌肉阻滞剂，可在血浆和器官组织中自发降解，这是一种称为霍夫曼消除的代谢类型。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "Propofol and other highly lipophilic drugs rapidly diffuse across membranes, quickly accumulating in tissues receiving high blood flow; this accounts for their rapid onset of action. These compounds are subsequently redistributed to organs receiving less blood flow, which explains their short duration of action.",
    "zh": "丙泊酚和其他高亲脂性药物迅速穿过膜，快速积聚在高血流量的组织中；这解释了它们起效迅速的原因。这些化合物随后重新分布到血流量较少的器官，这解释了它们药效持续时间短的原因。"
