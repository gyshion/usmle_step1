    "en": "A 26-year-old woman comes to the office due to a skin condition. The patient has had dry, flaky skin since childhood, but it has worsened in recent years. Symptoms are typically worse in the winter but improve as the weather warms in the spring. The patient has a family history of asthma; both parents also have chronically dry skin. Examination shows diffuse scaling of the skin that is most notable on the extremities, as shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}.",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has diffuse dermal scaling consistent with **ichthyosis vulgaris**, an inherited disorder caused by mutations of the **filaggrin gene**. This results in epidermal hyperplasia and **defective keratinocyte desquamation**, leading to the accumulation of **dry, scaly skin** with loss of normal barrier function. Filaggrin mutations are also seen in atopic eczema, and ichthyosis vulgaris is frequently associated with a family history of eczema and other atopic disorders (eg, asthma, seasonal allergies).\n\nIchthyosis vulgaris typically affects the trunk and extensor surfaces of the extremities (particularly the legs), with sparing of the flexures and face. Palmar hyperlinearity is also common. The symptoms first appear in childhood but may worsen with age, as well as in the winter because of decreased ambient humidity; mild symptoms may be misdiagnosed as simple xerosis (ie, dry skin).\n\n(Choice A) An androgen-induced increase in sebum production causes acne vulgaris, which presents with comedones, inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodules during adolescence. Diffuse scaling is not characteristic.\n\n(Choice B) Autoantibodies against desmogleins 1 and 3 cause pemphigus vulgaris, which is characterized by flaccid bullae that easily rupture to form erosions. Scaling is not characteristic.\n\n(Choice D) Excessive collagen deposition is seen in systemic sclerosis (ie, scleroderma). Systemic sclerosis presents with diffuse thickening and hardening of the skin, often associated with ulcerations at the fingertips.\n\n(Choice E) Allergic contact dermatitis is a type IV (T-cell–mediated) hypersensitivity reaction triggered by a variety of allergens (eg, poison ivy, natural rubber). It typically presents acutely within 2-4 days of exposure with a localized, pruritic, erythematous rash with vesicles and small bullae.\n\nEducational objective:\nIchthyosis vulgaris is caused by filaggrin gene mutations that result in defective keratinocyte desquamation. It is characterized by dry, scaly skin; manifestations are diffuse but are typically worse on the trunk and the extensor surfaces of the extremities.",
    "zh": "该患者出现弥漫性皮肤脱屑，与**寻常型鱼鳞病**一致，这是一种由**聚角蛋白微丝蛋白基因**突变引起的遗传性疾病。这会导致表皮增生和**角质形成细胞脱屑缺陷**，导致**干燥、鳞屑状皮肤**的积累，并丧失正常的屏障功能。在特应性湿疹中也可见到聚角蛋白微丝蛋白突变，寻常型鱼鳞病常与湿疹和其他特应性疾病（如哮喘、季节性过敏）的家族史相关。\n\n寻常型鱼鳞病通常影响躯干和四肢的伸侧（特别是腿部），而屈侧和面部则得以保留。掌纹增多也很常见。症状首先出现在儿童时期，但可能随着年龄的增长以及冬季的到来而恶化，因为环境湿度降低；轻度症状可能被误诊为单纯性干燥症（即皮肤干燥）。\n\n(选项 A) 雄激素诱导的皮脂分泌增加会导致寻常性痤疮，其在青春期表现为粉刺、炎性丘疹、脓疱和结节。弥漫性脱屑不具有特征性。\n\n(选项 B) 针对桥粒蛋白1和3的自身抗体会引起寻常型天疱疮，其特征是松弛的水疱，容易破裂形成糜烂。脱屑不具有特征性。\n\n(选项 D) 胶原过度沉积见于系统性硬化症（即硬皮病）。系统性硬化症表现为皮肤弥漫性增厚和硬化，常伴有指尖溃疡。\n\n(选项 E) 变应性接触性皮炎是一种 IV 型（T 细胞介导）超敏反应，由各种过敏原（例如，毒葛、天然橡胶）触发。它通常在接触后 2-4 天内急性出现，表现为局限性、瘙痒性、红斑性皮疹，伴有水疱和小疱。\n\n教学目标：\n寻常型鱼鳞病由聚角蛋白微丝蛋白基因突变引起，导致角质形成细胞脱屑缺陷。其特征是皮肤干燥、鳞屑状；表现为弥漫性，但通常在躯干和四肢伸侧更严重。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of ichthyosis vulgaris, its genetic basis (filaggrin gene mutations), and characteristic clinical presentation of dry, scaly skin due to defective keratinocyte desquamation. It also requires differentiating ichthyosis vulgaris from other skin conditions with scaling or inflammatory features.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of ichthyosis vulgaris: childhood onset, dry/scaly skin, worsening in winter, family history of atopy, and distribution on extensor surfaces. Rule out other conditions based on their distinct presentations (e.g., acne vulgaris, pemphigus vulgaris, scleroderma, allergic contact dermatitis).",
    "zh": "本题考察了对寻常型鱼鳞病、其遗传基础（聚角蛋白微丝蛋白基因突变）以及由于角质形成细胞脱屑缺陷而导致的皮肤干燥、鳞屑的特征性临床表现的认识。它还需要将寻常型鱼鳞病与其他具有脱屑或炎症特征的皮肤病区分开来。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要认识到寻常型鱼鳞病的关键特征：儿童期发病、皮肤干燥/鳞屑、冬季恶化、特应性家族史以及分布于伸侧。根据其他疾病的独特表现（例如，寻常性痤疮、寻常型天疱疮、硬皮病、变应性接触性皮炎）排除其他疾病。"
