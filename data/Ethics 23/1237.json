    "en": "A 65-year-old man is admitted to the inpatient unit of a busy community hospital for worsening shortness of breath over the last few days. He has a 40-pack-year smoking history and was initially diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and treated accordingly. Chest x-ray on admission shows a large hilar opacity, and CT scan confirms the presence of a 4-cm mass in the right hilum. During the process of obtaining informed consent for bronchoscopy with biopsy, the patient says, \"Doc, please don't tell me what they find, because if it's cancer, I don't want to know.\"",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Just as competent patients have the right to refuse medical care and interventions, they also have the right to refuse to receive diagnostic information. Requests to withhold information may stem from personal fears or cultural, religious, or social factors. The patient's wishes should be respected based on the principle of autonomy, and the patient should not feel pressured to change his decision.\n\nHowever, this patient likely has unspoken fears about a cancer diagnosis that can be addressed. An appropriate initial response is to attempt to understand why the patient feels this way. Efforts should be made to gently explore the patient's concerns and elicit questions he may have about potential diagnoses (eg, lung cancer and other possibilities). The physician should try to understand the patient's desires and concerns to develop a trusting relationship that may facilitate future collaborative treatment planning.\n\n(Choice A) This statement asks the patient to reconsider whether he wants a bronchoscopy based on his preference not to know the outcome. It could be experienced as putting pressure on the patient not to undergo the procedure and misses the opportunity to ask why the patient doesn't want to know the results.\n\n(Choice B) Although explaining how knowing the diagnosis may help the patient make subsequent treatment decisions, doing so prematurely without inquiring about the patient's reasoning may pressure the patient to acquiesce to the physician's desire, which does not respect the patient's autonomy.\n\n(Choice D) This response normalizes the tendency to avoid receiving bad news, but it makes the unfounded assumption that not knowing will cause more anxiety than bad news for this particular patient.\n\n(Choice E) This response respects the patient's autonomy but is dismissive and excludes future collaborative treatment planning. The physician should attempt to understand the patient's perspective and address his concerns.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients have the right to have information withheld from them regarding their medical condition. Physicians must respect their wish not to know but should also explore the patient concerns to better understand their preferences and maximize their involvement in subsequent medical decision-making.",
    "zh": "正如具备行为能力的患者有权拒绝医疗护理和干预一样，他们也有权拒绝接收诊断信息。 拒绝获取信息的要求可能源于个人恐惧或文化、宗教或社会因素。 应该根据自主原则尊重患者的意愿，并且不应该给患者施加改变其决定的压力。\n\n然而，这位患者可能对癌症诊断有未言明的恐惧，可以解决。一个合适的初步回应是试图理解患者为何有这种感觉。应该努力温和地探索患者的担忧，并引发他可能对潜在诊断（例如，肺癌和其他可能性）提出的问题。医生应该尝试理解患者的愿望和担忧，以建立信任关系，这可能有助于未来的合作治疗计划。\n\n（选项A）该陈述要求患者重新考虑他是否想要进行支气管镜检查，这基于他不想知道结果的偏好。这可能被理解为对患者施加压力，要求其不接受该程序，并且错失了询问患者为何不想知道结果的机会。\n\n（选项B）虽然解释了知道诊断结果如何帮助患者做出后续治疗决定，但在没有询问患者的推理的情况下过早地这样做可能会给患者施加压力，要求其屈从于医生的意愿，这并不尊重患者的自主权。\n\n（选项D）这种回应将避免听到坏消息的倾向正常化，但它做出了未经证实的假设，即不知道会比这个特定患者的坏消息引起更多的焦虑。\n\n（选项E）这种回应尊重了患者的自主权，但却显得轻视，并排除了未来的合作治疗计划。医生应该尝试理解患者的观点并解决他的担忧。\n\n教育目标：\n患者有权不被告知其医疗状况的相关信息。医生必须尊重他们不想知道的意愿，但也应该探索患者的担忧，以更好地理解他们的偏好，并最大限度地提高他们参与后续医疗决策的程度。"

    "en": "This question tests the ethical principle of patient autonomy and the right to refuse medical information. It also assesses the ability to communicate effectively with patients who express a desire to avoid knowing their diagnosis.\n\nThe best approach is to acknowledge the patient's request, respect their autonomy, and explore the underlying reasons for their decision. Avoid pressuring the patient to reconsider or making assumptions about their emotional state.",
