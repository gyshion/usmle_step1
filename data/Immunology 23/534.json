    "en": "A 57-year-old man underwent lung transplantation for severe emphysema 2 years ago. Over the last 6 months, he has had increasing exertional dyspnea and dry cough. The patient has adhered to his medical regimen. He does not smoke and has no exposure to secondhand smoke. Physical examination shows scattered bilateral rales and end-expiratory squeaks. Cardiac auscultation reveals no murmurs or additional sounds. Spirometry demonstrates markedly decreased FEV1 compared with findings 6 months prior, although the FVC remains largely unchanged. Chronic lung transplant rejection is suspected, and bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy is planned. Histopathology is most likely to show injury predominantly involving which of the following structures?",

    "en": "Although patients who undergo organ transplantation receive immunosuppressive therapy, rejection reactions still commonly occur. The severity and timing of the rejection depends on the degree of difference between the donor and recipient major histocompatibility complex antigens in addition to other variables.\n\nChronic lung transplant rejection is marked by submucosal lymphocytic inflammation in the walls of the small airways. Subsequent ingrowth of granulation tissue into the lumen leads to airway obstruction and obliteration (bronchiolitis obliterans). Patients usually present with slowly worsening dyspnea and dry cough that begins months or years after transplantation. Lung examination may reveal end-expiratory squeaks or pops, and spirometry typically demonstrates airflow limitation (obstructive pattern) with a drop in FEV1.\n\nOther forms of lung transplant rejection include:\n\nHyperacute rejection usually occurs on the first day of transplantation and is caused by preformed host antibodies against donor ABO or human leukocyte antigens (major histocompatibility complexes). Histology generally shows fibrinoid necrosis with hemorrhage and ischemia (\"white graft\" reaction).\n\nAcute rejection normally occurs within 6 months of transplantation and is typically caused by a cell-mediated immune response to donor human leukocyte antigens. Histology generally shows perivascular mononuclear infiltrates in the small blood vessels of the lung, which can expand to include the alveolar walls (Choices A and E).\n\n(Choice B) Bronchiolitis obliterans can occasionally cause large airway scarring, leading to bronchiectasis, but this is not the primary pathologic manifestation.\n\n(Choice C) Restrictive allograft syndrome, a less common type of chronic lung transplant rejection, can result in fibrotic changes to the pleurae. However, pulmonary function tests would reveal a restrictive (reduced FVC), not obstructive, pattern.\n\nEducational objective:\nChronic lung transplant rejection is due primarily to progressive scarring of the small airways, leading to bronchiolitis obliterans. Manifestations occur months or years after transplantation and include obstructive lung disease (eg, reduced FEV1) with dyspnea and dry cough.",
    "zh": "尽管接受器官移植的患者接受免疫抑制治疗，但排斥反应仍然常见。排斥反应的严重程度和时间取决于供体和受体主要组织相容性复合体抗原之间的差异程度以及其他变量。\n\n慢性肺移植排斥反应的特征是小气道壁的黏膜下淋巴细胞性炎症。随后肉芽组织向管腔内生长，导致气道阻塞和闭塞（闭塞性细支气管炎）。患者通常表现为缓慢恶化的呼吸困难和干咳，这些症状在移植后数月或数年开始。肺部检查可能显示呼气末吱吱声或爆裂音，肺活量测定通常显示气流受限（阻塞性模式），FEV1下降。\n\n其他形式的肺移植排斥反应包括：\n\n超急性排斥反应通常发生在移植后的第一天，由针对供体ABO或人白细胞抗原（主要组织相容性复合体）的预制宿主抗体引起。组织学通常显示纤维蛋白样坏死，伴有出血和缺血（“白移植物”反应）。\n\n急性排斥反应通常发生在移植后6个月内，通常由针对供体人白细胞抗原的细胞介导的免疫反应引起。组织学通常显示肺部小血管中的血管周围单核细胞浸润，可扩大到包括肺泡壁（选项A和E）。\n\n（选项B）闭塞性细支气管炎偶尔会导致大气道瘢痕形成，导致支气管扩张，但这并非主要的病理表现。\n\n（选项C）限制性同种异体移植物综合征，一种不太常见的慢性肺移植排斥反应，可导致胸膜的纤维化改变。然而，肺功能检查将显示限制性（FVC降低），而不是阻塞性模式。\n\n教学目标：\n慢性肺移植排斥反应主要是由于小气道的进行性瘢痕形成，导致闭塞性细支气管炎。表现发生在移植后数月或数年，包括阻塞性肺病（例如，FEV1降低），伴有呼吸困难和干咳。"
