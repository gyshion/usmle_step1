    "en": "The POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE (PPV) of a diagnostic test answers the following question: Given a positive test result, what is the probability that a patient has the disease? PPV corresponds to the number of people with the disease who test positive among all those who test positive. Using a standard contingency (2 x 2) table, PPV = a / (a + b).\n\nIn this question, the patient's pre-test probability (which takes into account clinical judgment regarding how likely it is that he has an MI) is assumed to be equivalent to the prevalence of MI in the study, making the results directly translatable. Therefore, PPV = 200 / (200+50) = 200/250 = 0.8 or 80%.",
    "zh": "诊断性检测的阳性预测值 (PPV) 回答以下问题：在检测结果呈阳性的情况下，患者患病的概率是多少？PPV对应于在所有检测结果呈阳性的人群中，患病且检测结果呈阳性的人数。使用标准的列联表 (2 x 2)，PPV = a / (a + b)。\n\n在本题中，患者的检测前概率（考虑了临床判断，即他患MI的可能性）被假定为与研究中MI的患病率相当，这使得结果可以直接转换。因此，PPV = 200 / (200+50) = 200/250 = 0.8 或 80%。"
