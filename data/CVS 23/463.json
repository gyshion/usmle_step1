The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years and occasionally drinks 1 or 2 glasses of wine but does not use illicit drugs. Blood pressure is 142/82 mm Hg and pulse is 80/min. Cardiopulmonary examination is normal. There is a pulsating, central abdominal mass on physical examination.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's pulsating, central abdominal mass most likely represents an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), which is a focal dilation of the abdominal aorta that typically occurs below the renal arteries.\n\nAAA is associated with several risk factors (eg, age >60, smoking, hypertension, male sex, family history) that lead to oxidative stress, vascular smooth muscle apoptosis, and chronic transmural inflammation of the aorta. Inflammatory cells (particularly macrophages) release matrix metalloproteinases and elastases that degrade extracellular matrix components (eg, elastin, collagen), leading to weakening and progressive expansion of the aortic wall. Furthermore, ischemia of the tunica media may play a role as the infrarenal abdominal aorta has a tenuous vasa vasorum, and atherosclerotic thickening of the intimal layer increases the diffusion distance for oxygen.\n\n(Choice B) Cystic medial necrosis is characterized by loss of smooth muscle, collagen, and elastic tissue with formation of cystic mucoid spaces in the aortic media. Patients with Marfan syndrome develop cystic medial degeneration of the aortic root at a young age, predisposing them to ascending aortic aneurysm and dissection.\n\n(Choice C) An intimal tear in the aortic wall is the primary event involved in the pathophysiology of aortic dissection. Patients typically present with tearing chest pain that radiates to the back. Proximal dissections involving the ascending aorta can cause unequal blood pressure in the arms, aortic valve regurgitation (eg, diastolic decrescendo murmur at the right sternal border), and cardiac tamponade.\n\n(Choice D) Malignant endothelial proliferation is characteristic of angiosarcoma, a neoplasm that arises from blood or lymphatic vessels in the subcutaneous tissue and most frequently affects the scalp and face.\n\n(Choice E) Microbial infection (usually bacterial) can cause localized dilation of an artery due to destruction of the vessel wall. Trauma, bacteremic seeding, or septic emboli (mycotic aneurysm) can cause infected aneurysms, which typically present with painful, pulsatile masses and systemic signs such as fever and malaise.\n\n(Choice F) Vasa vasorum endarteritis (\"endarteritis obliterans\") in the thoracic aorta is thought to be the mechanism by which syphilis causes thoracic aortic aneurysm.\n\nEducational objective:\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm is associated with risk factors (eg, age >60, smoking, hypertension, male sex, family history) that lead to chronic transmural inflammation and extracellular matrix degradation within the wall of the aorta. This leads to weakening and progressive expansion of the aortic wall, resulting in aneurysm formation, typically below the renal arteries.",
    "zh": "该患者的搏动性腹部中央肿块最有可能代表腹主动脉瘤（AAA），这是一种腹主动脉的局灶性扩张，通常发生在肾动脉以下。\n\nAAA与几个危险因素相关（例如，年龄>60岁，吸烟，高血压，男性，家族史），这些因素会导致氧化应激、血管平滑肌凋亡和主动脉的慢性全层炎症。炎症细胞（尤其是巨噬细胞）释放基质金属蛋白酶和弹性蛋白酶，降解细胞外基质成分（例如，弹性蛋白，胶原蛋白），导致主动脉壁的弱化和进行性扩张。此外，中膜缺血可能起一定作用，因为肾下腹主动脉的滋养血管薄弱，而内膜层的动脉粥样硬化增厚会增加氧气的扩散距离。\n\n（选项B）囊性中膜坏死以平滑肌、胶原蛋白和弹性组织的丧失以及主动脉中膜中囊性黏液样空间的形成为特征。马凡综合征患者在年轻时会发生主动脉根部的囊性中膜变性，使其易患升主动脉瘤和夹层分离。\n\n（选项C）主动脉壁内膜撕裂是主动脉夹层病理生理学中涉及的主要事件。患者通常表现为放射到背部的撕裂样胸痛。涉及升主动脉的近端夹层分离可导致双臂血压不一致、主动脉瓣反流（例如，右胸骨缘的舒张期递减杂音）和心脏压塞。\n\n（选项D）恶性内皮细胞增生是血管肉瘤的特征，血管肉瘤是一种起源于皮下组织中的血管或淋巴管的肿瘤，最常影响头皮和面部。\n\n（选项E）微生物感染（通常是细菌性感染）可因血管壁的破坏而导致动脉局部扩张。外伤、菌血症播散或脓毒性栓塞（霉菌性动脉瘤）可引起感染性动脉瘤，其通常表现为疼痛、搏动性肿块和全身症状，如发热和不适。\n\n（选项F）胸主动脉的滋养血管内膜炎（“闭塞性内膜炎”）被认为是梅毒引起胸主动脉瘤的机制。\n\n教育目标：\n腹主动脉瘤与危险因素相关（例如，年龄>60岁，吸烟，高血压，男性，家族史），这些因素会导致主动脉壁内的慢性全层炎症和细胞外基质降解。这会导致主动脉壁的弱化和进行性扩张，导致动脉瘤形成，通常发生在肾动脉以下。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), specifically the role of chronic transmural inflammation in weakening the aortic wall.
