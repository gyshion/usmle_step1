    "en": "This patient with progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, lower extremity swelling, and a laterally displaced point of maximal impulse has decompensated heart failure. Heart failure occurs due to either a progressive decline in myocardial contractility (systolic dysfunction) or impaired ability of the ventricular walls to relax during filling (diastolic dysfunction). Both etiologies eventually lead to decreased cardiac output and inadequate oxygen delivery to the tissues, inducing the following neuroendocrine compensatory mechanisms in an effort to restore organ perfusion:\n\n*   Increased sympathetic output: Baroreceptors sense decreased perfusion and stimulate epinephrine and norepinephrine release to increase heart rate and contractility. Vasoconstriction is also triggered, increasing arteriolar resistance and raising afterload.\n*   Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation: Decreased renal perfusion (Choice D) leads to increased secretion of renin and increased circulating levels of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that further increases afterload. Adrenal secretion of aldosterone also increases, which stimulates sodium and water retention and increases circulating blood volume (preload).\n\nAlthough these compensatory mechanisms initially improve organ perfusion, they are overall maladaptive. A vicious cycle is generated as the failing heart is unable to pump against increased afterload, and volume retention creates venous congestion in the kidneys that reduces glomerular filtration rate and further impairs diuresis. Atrial and ventricular stretch triggers the release of natriuretic peptides that stimulate vasodilation and fluid diuresis to counteract the vicious cycle; however, these effects are outweighed by the downward-spiraling negative effects of sympathetic drive and RAAS activation.\n\n(Choice B) Left ventricular failure leads to increased pulmonary venous pressure and transudation of fluid into the lung parenchyma, which stiffens the alveolar walls and decreases lung compliance.\n\n(Choice C) With reduced cardiac output, the tissues become starved for O₂ and increase O₂ extraction from the available capillary blood. This leads to a reduction in mixed venous O₂ content.\n\n(Choice E) Stroke volume is generally maintained early in heart failure (due to compensatory mechanisms) and decreases as decompensation takes place.\n\nEducational objective:\nDecreased cardiac output in heart failure triggers neuroendocrine compensatory mechanisms to maintain organ perfusion; however, the compensatory mechanisms are maladaptive over the long term. Increased sympathetic output and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system stimulate vasoconstriction and volume retention, compounding the hemodynamic stress on an already failing heart and creating a vicious cycle of decompensation. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者出现进行性呼吸困难、端坐呼吸、下肢肿胀以及心尖搏动左移，患有失代偿性心力衰竭。心力衰竭的发生是由于心肌收缩力进行性下降（收缩功能障碍）或心室壁在充盈期间舒张能力受损（舒张功能障碍）。这两种病因最终都会导致心输出量下降和组织供氧不足，从而诱导以下神经内分泌代偿机制，以努力恢复器官灌注：\n\n*   交感神经输出增加：压力感受器感知灌注下降并刺激肾上腺素和去甲肾上腺素释放，以增加心率和收缩力。也会触发血管收缩，增加小动脉阻力并升高后负荷。\n*   肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统 (RAAS) 激活：肾灌注减少（选项 D）导致肾素分泌增加以及循环中血管紧张素II水平升高，血管紧张素II是一种强效的血管收缩剂，会进一步增加后负荷。肾上腺醛固酮分泌也增加，这会刺激钠和水的潴留，并增加循环血容量（前负荷）。\n\n虽然这些代偿机制最初改善了器官灌注，但总的来说它们是适应不良的。当衰竭的心脏无法抵抗增加的后负荷时，会产生一个恶性循环，并且液体潴留会在肾脏中产生静脉淤血，从而降低肾小球滤过率并进一步损害利尿。心房和心室的扩张会触发利钠肽的释放，刺激血管舒张和液体利尿，以对抗恶性循环；然而，这些影响被交感神经驱动和 RAAS 激活的下降螺旋式负面影响所抵消。\n\n（选项 B）左心室衰竭会导致肺静脉压力升高，液体渗入肺实质，使肺泡壁僵硬并降低肺顺应性。\n\n（选项 C）随着心输出量减少，组织对 O₂ 的需求增加，并且从现有的毛细血管血液中提取的 O₂ 增加。这导致混合静脉血氧含量降低。\n\n（选项 E）每搏输出量通常在心力衰竭早期（由于代偿机制）维持，并在失代偿发生时下降。\n\n教学目标：\n心力衰竭时心输出量下降会触发神经内分泌代偿机制以维持器官灌注；然而，从长远来看，代偿机制是适应不良的。交感神经输出增加和肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统的激活会刺激血管收缩和液体潴留，从而加剧已经衰竭的心脏的血流动力学应激，并产生失代偿的恶性循环。 {{exhibit_2}}"
