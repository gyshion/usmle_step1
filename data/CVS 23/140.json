    "en": "A 60-year-old man with known coronary artery disease comes to the office due to exertional chest tightness for the last 6 months. The symptoms occur when he walks more than 3 blocks, especially in cold weather. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery 3 years ago for progressive angina. Past medical history also includes asthma, benign prostate hyperplasia, and peripheral artery disease. The physician discusses adding isosorbide dinitrate to his current therapy but the patient is concerned about adverse effects. ",

    "en": "Nitrates are frequently used for symptomatic relief in patients with chronic stable angina. The anti-ischemic effect of nitrates is mediated by systemic vasodilation (predominantly venodilation) with a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and wall stress, resulting in decreased myocardial oxygen demand and relief of angina symptoms.\n\nThe main adverse effects seen with nitrate therapy include headaches, cutaneous flushing, lightheadedness, hypotension, and reflex tachycardia. Nitrates must be avoided in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to increased outflow tract obstruction), right ventricular infarction (due to reduction in preload, impairing cardiac output), and those on phosphodiesterase inhibitors (synergism increases the risk of severe hypotension).\n\n(Choice A) Atrioventricular conduction delay is a potential adverse effect of several drugs used for management of chronic stable angina. These include calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) and beta blockers (eg, metoprolol, propranolol).\n\n(Choice B) Cold extremities due to Raynaud phenomenon are associated with medications such as amphetamines, ergotamine, and chemotherapeutic agents.\n\n(Choice C) Constipation is a common side effect of opioid analgesics, iron supplements, calcium channel blockers such as verapamil, and anticholinergic medications such as atropine.\n\n(Choice D) Thiazide diuretics can lead to hyperuricemia and precipitate an acute gout attack.\n\n(Choice E) Nocturnal wheezing can be a symptom of asthma or gastroesophageal reflux disease. In addition, the use of beta blockers in patients with underlying bronchospastic disease can cause increased bronchoconstriction and lead to wheezing.\n\n(Choice G) Urinary retention is typically associated with medications that exhibit anticholinergic properties such as tricyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline) and antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine).\n\nEducational objective:\nThe main adverse effects seen with nitrate therapy include headaches and cutaneous flushing along with lightheadedness and hypotension due to systemic vasodilation.",
    "zh": "硝酸盐常用于慢性稳定性心绞痛患者的对症缓解。硝酸盐的抗缺血作用是通过全身血管舒张（主要为静脉舒张）介导的，降低左心室舒张末期容积和壁应力，从而降低心肌耗氧量并缓解心绞痛症状。\n\n硝酸盐治疗的主要不良反应包括头痛、皮肤潮红、头晕、低血压和反射性心动过速。患有肥厚型心肌病（由于增加的血流流出道梗阻）、右心室梗死（由于降低前负荷，损害心输出量）和服用磷酸二酯酶抑制剂（协同作用增加严重低血压的风险）的患者必须避免使用硝酸盐。\n\n（选项A）房室传导延迟是几种用于治疗慢性稳定性心绞痛的药物的潜在不良反应。这些药物包括钙通道阻滞剂（如维拉帕米、地尔硫卓）和β受体阻滞剂（如美托洛尔、普萘洛尔）。\n\n（选项B）雷诺现象引起的肢端寒冷与安非他明、麦角胺和化疗药物等药物有关。\n\n（选项C）便秘是阿片类镇痛药、铁补充剂、钙通道阻滞剂（如维拉帕米）和抗胆碱能药物（如阿托品）的常见副作用。\n\n（选项D）噻嗪类利尿剂可导致高尿酸血症并诱发急性痛风发作。\n\n（选项E）夜间喘息可能是哮喘或胃食管反流病的症状。此外，在患有潜在支气管痉挛性疾病的患者中使用β受体阻滞剂可导致支气管收缩加剧并导致喘息。\n\n（选项G）尿潴留通常与表现出抗胆碱能特性的药物有关，如三环类抗抑郁药（如阿米替林）和抗组胺药（如苯海拉明）。\n\n教育目标：硝酸盐治疗的主要不良反应包括头痛和皮肤潮红，以及由于全身血管舒张引起的头晕和低血压。"
