    "en": "A 34-year-old man came to the office due to white plaques on his buccal mucosa that he incidentally discovered while brushing his teeth. After appropriate workup, he was found to be HIV positive, with a CD4+ T lymphocyte count of 280/mm³. He was referred to an infectious diseases specialist for follow-up but was noncompliant with appointments. The patient returns 3 years later due to several months of pain and itching in the perirectal area. He also has intermittent rectal bleeding and often sees bright red blood on the tissue after wiping. The patient did not seek medical care because he thought he had hemorrhoids. On examination, a single, hard mass with superficial ulceration measuring approximately 2x2 cm is noted in the anal canal. No hemorrhoids are present. There is no palpable regional lymphadenopathy. Which of the following pathogens is most likely responsible for this patient's current anal pathology?",

    "en": "This patient with HIV likely has anal squamous cell carcinoma given the duration of pain, itching, and rectal bleeding in addition to the visible ulcerative mass (anal cancers are ulcerative in >50% of cases). Anogenital squamous cell carcinomas and their precursors, squamous intraepithelial lesions, have been linked to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Intraepithelial neoplasias of the cervix, vulva, penis, and anus have a well-documented association with HPV types 16 and 18. A strong correlation between HPV and invasive carcinoma has been established for cervical cancer.\n\nImmunodeficiency states (eg, AIDS) increase host susceptibility to HPV infection and more severe infection. HIV-positive men who have sex with men are at increased risk of developing anal squamous cell carcinoma (anal intercourse is hypothesized to be related), and HIV-positive women are more prone to developing cervical squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n(Choice A) Adenoviruses can cause severe upper respiratory illnesses, pneumonia, and disseminated infection in immunosuppressed patients.\n\n(Choices B and E) HIV-positive patients often experience reactivation of latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. EBV replication in such patients is associated with certain lymphomas and with oral hairy leukoplakia, which typically manifests as white plaques on the lateral tongue margins (this patient's white buccal plaques on initial diagnosis were more likely thrush due to Candida).\n\n(Choice C) Chlamydia trachomatis causes lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), characterized by an ulcerative or vesicular lesion on the external genitalia followed by significant regional lymphadenopathy. Proctitis with tenesmus and bloody discharge can be seen with both LGV and anal carcinoma; however, LGV has a less indolent clinical course, and painful lymphadenopathy is a cardinal feature.\n\n(Choice D) HIV-positive patients with CD4+ cell counts <100/mm³ are at significantly increased risk of developing cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, which most frequently causes retinitis in AIDS patients. CMV involvement of the gastrointestinal tract typically manifests as esophageal ulcers or colitis, not anal masses.\n\n(Choice F) Although AIDS increases the prevalence of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection and the frequency of symptomatic genital herpes recurrences, HSV-2 is not typically associated with anogenital carcinoma. A large, hard mass is not characteristic of herpetic lesions (classically painful vesicles or ulcers).\n\nEducational objective:\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 are strongly associated with anal and cervical squamous cell carcinoma. HIV infection increases the prevalence of HPV infection and the risk of anal carcinoma; this risk is further augmented in men who have sex with men.",
    "zh": "考虑到疼痛、瘙痒和直肠出血的持续时间，以及可见的溃疡性肿块（肛门癌病例中超过50%为溃疡性），该HIV感染患者很可能患有肛门鳞状细胞癌。肛门生殖器鳞状细胞癌及其前体鳞状上皮内病变与人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）感染有关。宫颈、外阴、阴茎和肛门的上皮内瘤变与HPV 16型和18型有明确的关联。HPV与浸润性癌之间已建立起强相关性，尤其是在宫颈癌中。\n\n免疫缺陷状态（如AIDS）会增加宿主对HPV感染的易感性，并导致更严重的感染。HIV阳性的男男性行为者发生肛门鳞状细胞癌的风险增加（推测与肛交有关），而HIV阳性的女性更容易发生宫颈鳞状细胞癌。\n\n(选项A) 腺病毒可导致免疫抑制患者出现严重的上呼吸道疾病、肺炎和播散性感染。\n\n(选项B和E) HIV阳性患者常发生潜伏性EB病毒（EBV）感染的再激活。EBV在这些患者中的复制与某些淋巴瘤和口腔毛状白斑有关，后者通常表现为舌侧边缘的白色斑块（该患者最初诊断时的白色颊斑更可能是由于念珠菌引起的鹅口疮）。\n\n(选项C) 沙眼衣原体可引起淋巴肉芽肿性病（LGV），其特征是在外生殖器上出现溃疡性或水疱性病变，随后出现显著的区域淋巴结肿大。LGV和肛门癌均可见直肠炎伴里急后重和血性分泌物；然而，LGV的临床病程较短，疼痛性淋巴结肿大是其主要特征。\n\n(选项D) CD4+细胞计数<100/mm³的HIV阳性患者发生巨细胞病毒（CMV）感染的风险显著增加，CMV最常导致AIDS患者发生视网膜炎。CMV侵犯胃肠道通常表现为食管溃疡或结肠炎，而不是肛门肿块。\n\n(选项F) 尽管AIDS增加了单纯疱疹病毒2型（HSV-2）感染的患病率和症状性生殖器疱疹复发的频率，但HSV-2通常与肛门生殖器癌无关。大而硬的肿块不是疱疹病变的特征（典型表现为疼痛性水疱或溃疡）。\n\n教育目标：\n人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）16型和18型与肛门和宫颈鳞状细胞癌密切相关。HIV感染增加了HPV感染的患病率和肛门癌的风险；这种风险在男男性行为者中进一步增加。"

It also assesses the understanding of other opportunistic infections and their manifestations in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's HIV status, the clinical presentation of a hard, ulcerative anal mass, and the absence of lymphadenopathy.
