    "en": "An 82-year-old woman comes to the office due to fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and lower extremity swelling. She also occasionally feels an uncomfortable pulsation in her neck. Six weeks ago, the patient underwent pacemaker implantation due to sick sinus syndrome. Episodes of lightheadedness that she had experienced before the procedure have now resolved. The patient is afebrile, and other vital signs are normal. Physical examination reveals bilateral, lower extremity edema and a tender, pulsatile liver. The lungs are clear on auscultation. The pacemaker implantation site has healed normally. Complete blood count is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient likely has TRICUSPID VALVE REGURGITATION (TR) due to an adverse effect of her permanent pacemaker. The right ventricular lead of an implantable pacemaker or cardioverter-defibrillator passes through the superior vena cava into the right atrium and then through the tricuspid valve orifice to terminate on the endocardium of the right ventricle. Permanent pacemaker placement can cause TR because the right ventricular lead passes through the tricuspid valve orifice and can disrupt valve closure {{exhibit_1}}. Leading to severe TR in some patients.\n\nSevere TR typically presents with right-sided heart failure. Patients can have distended jugular veins, pulsatile and tender hepatomegaly, abdominal distension with ascites, and lower extremity edema. The lungs are clear on auscultation in the absence of concomitant left-sided heart disease. Cardiac examination typically reveals a holosystolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border; the murmur intensifies with maneuvers that increase right ventricular preload (eg, deep inspiration, leg raise).\n\n(Choice A) Causes of aortic valve regurgitation include rheumatic heart disease and aortic root dilation. Severe disease can lead to left-sided heart failure; however, pulmonary edema with crackles on lung auscultation would be expected.\n\n(Choice B) Constrictive pericarditis can result from chronic pericardial inflammation in the setting of infection or rheumatologic disease. It typically manifests with signs and symptoms of right-sided heart failure; however, the relationship between this patient's heart failure symptoms and recent pacemaker placement makes TR more likely.\n\n(Choice C) Infective endocarditis may affect the tricuspid valve and lead to TR; however, tricuspid involvement typically develops in patients with a history of injection drug use. In addition, this patient's lack of fever makes infective endocarditis unlikely.\n\n(Choice D) Severe pulmonic valve regurgitation can lead to right-sided heart failure. Causes of pulmonic valve regurgitation include rheumatic heart disease and endocarditis, but it is not associated with pacemaker placement as pacemaker leads do not cross the pulmonic valve.\n\nEducational objective:\nSevere tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR) can lead to right-sided heart failure, evidenced by jugular venous distension, hepatomegaly, lower extremity edema, and the absence of pulmonary edema.",
    "zh": "该患者可能患有三尖瓣反流 (TR)，这源于其永久起搏器的不良反应。可植入式起搏器或心脏复律除颤器的右心室导线通过上腔静脉进入右心房，然后穿过三尖瓣口，最终到达右心室的心内膜。永久起搏器植入可导致TR，因为右心室导线穿过三尖瓣口并可能破坏瓣膜关闭 {{exhibit_1}}。这会导致一些患者出现严重的TR。\n\n严重的TR通常表现为右心衰竭。患者可能有颈静脉扩张、搏动性压痛性肝肿大、腹水引起的腹胀和下肢水肿。在没有并发左侧心脏病的情况下，肺部听诊清晰。心脏检查通常显示全收缩期杂音，在左胸骨下缘最明显；该杂音随着增加右心室前负荷的动作（例如，深呼吸、抬腿）而增强。\n\n(选项 A) 主动脉瓣反流的病因包括风湿性心脏病和主动脉根部扩张。严重疾病可导致左心衰竭；然而，预计肺水肿伴肺部听诊出现啰音。\n\n(选项 B) 缩窄性心包炎可由感染或风湿性疾病引起的慢性心包炎症引起。它通常表现为右心衰竭的体征和症状；然而，该患者的心衰症状与近期起搏器植入之间的关系使TR更有可能。\n\n(选项 C) 感染性心内膜炎可能影响三尖瓣并导致TR；然而，三尖瓣受累通常发生在有静脉注射药物使用史的患者中。此外，该患者没有发烧，使得感染性心内膜炎不太可能。\n\n(选项 D) 严重的肺动脉瓣反流可导致右心衰竭。肺动脉瓣反流的病因包括风湿性心脏病和心内膜炎，但它与起搏器植入无关，因为起搏器导线不穿过肺动脉瓣。\n\n教学目标：\n严重的 tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR) 可导致右心衰竭，表现为颈静脉扩张、肝肿大、下肢水肿和无肺水肿。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the complications of pacemaker placement, specifically tricuspid regurgitation. It also tests the ability to differentiate right-sided heart failure from other causes of edema and abdominal discomfort.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the recent pacemaker placement and the signs of right-sided heart failure (lower extremity edema, tender hepatomegaly, clear lungs). Consider the anatomical relationship of the pacemaker lead to the tricuspid valve.",
