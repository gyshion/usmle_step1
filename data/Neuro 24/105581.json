    "en": "A 74-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her son after he found her acting strangely. She was asking to open the window blinds, even though the blinds were already open and was bumping into objects when walking around her home. The patient insists that her vision is fine and came to the hospital upon her son's insistence. On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented but lacks appropriate eye contact. Bilateral direct and consensual pupillary reflexes are normal. On confrontation visual field testing, she reports the wrong number of fingers in all 4 visual quadrants. The patient indicates the wrong direction when asked to point to the door and gives an incorrect visual description when asked to describe the physician. This patient most likely has an infarction involving the brain regions supplied by which of the following arteries?",
    "zh": "一名74岁女性由她的儿子带到急诊科，因为她的儿子发现她行为异常。她要求打开百叶窗，即使百叶窗已经打开了，并且在她走动时撞到了物体。患者坚称她的视力很好，并且是在她儿子的坚持下才来医院的。体格检查显示，患者警觉且定向，但缺乏适当的眼神交流。双侧直接和间接瞳孔反射正常。在对峙视野检查中，她报告在所有4个视野象限中手指数量错误。当被要求指向门时，患者指错了方向，并且当被要求描述医生时，给出了不正确的视觉描述。该患者最有可能患有涉及由以下哪条动脉供应的脑区的梗死？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of CORTICAL BLINDNESS, characterized by a loss of vision despite intact pupillary reflexes and normal ocular structures. The specific deficits described, such as misidentifying the number of fingers and the direction of objects, along with confabulation (unawareness of her condition) and anosognosia (unawareness of one's condition), point towards damage to the visual cortex and associated areas responsible for visual processing and integration. These areas are primarily supplied by the POSTERIOR CEREBRAL ARTERIES. The bilateral nature of the symptoms suggests involvement of both posterior cerebral arteries or a significant unilateral lesion affecting the visual cortex. The explanation states: \"This combination is suspicious for CORTICAL BLINDNESS due to damage of the BILATERAL OCCIPITAL LOBES. The occipital lobes are supplied by the POSTERIOR CEREBRAL ARTERIES. Associated anosognosia and confabulation may be due to the inability of the visual cortex to communicate with areas of the brain that conduct higher-order sensory integration and speech-language processing.\"\n\n(Choice A) Anterior cerebral artery occlusion typically affects the medial aspects of the frontal and parietal lobes, leading to motor and sensory deficits, particularly in the leg, and potentially executive dysfunction or incontinence. This does not explain the primary visual deficits.\n\n(Choice B) Basilar artery occlusion affects the brainstem (pons), leading to severe neurological deficits such as quadriplegia, bulbar dysfunction (facial weakness, dysarthria), and oculomotor deficits. This is inconsistent with the patient's presentation.\n\n(Choice C) Middle cerebral artery infarcts commonly cause contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and aphasia (if the dominant hemisphere is involved). While visual field deficits can occur (e.g., homonymous hemianopsia), the constellation of symptoms, including anosognosia and confabulation, is less typical for MCA territory infarcts compared to PCA infarcts affecting the occipital lobes.\n\n(Choice D) Ophthalmic artery occlusion can lead to blindness in the respective eye due to occlusion of the internal carotid artery's branch supplying the eye. However, it would not cause bilateral cortical blindness or the associated cognitive deficits like anosognosia and confabulation.\n\nKey clinical pearls:\n- CORTICAL BLINDNESS is characterized by visual loss with preserved pupillary reflexes.\n- The OCCIPITAL LOBES, responsible for visual processing, are supplied by the POSTERIOR CEREBRAL ARTERIES.\n- ANOSOGNOSIA and CONFABULATION can be associated with lesions affecting higher-order cognitive and sensory integration areas, often seen with PCA infarcts affecting the occipital and temporal lobes.",
    "zh": "患者表现出提示皮质盲的症状，其特征是尽管瞳孔反射完整且眼部结构正常，但视力丧失。所描述的特定缺陷，例如错误识别手指数量和物体方向，以及错构（对自身状况的无意识）和无认知障碍（对自身状况的无意识），指向负责视觉处理和整合的视觉皮层和相关区域的损伤。这些区域主要由大脑后动脉供应。症状的**双侧性**表明两侧大脑后动脉都受累，或者单侧病变严重影响视觉皮层。解释指出：“这种组合提示皮质盲，是由于双侧枕叶损伤所致。枕叶由大脑后动脉供应。相关的无认知障碍和错构可能由于视觉皮层无法与进行高级感觉整合和言语-语言处理的脑区交流而导致。”\n\n(选项A) 大脑前动脉闭塞通常影响额叶和顶叶的内侧，导致运动和感觉缺陷，尤其是在腿部，并可能导致执行功能障碍或失禁。这不能解释主要的视觉缺陷。\n\n(选项B) 基底动脉闭塞影响脑干（脑桥），导致严重的神经系统缺陷，如四肢瘫痪、延髓功能障碍（面部无力、言语不清）和动眼神经缺陷。这与患者的表现不符。\n\n(选项C) 大脑中动脉梗死通常导致对侧偏瘫、偏身感觉缺失和失语症（如果涉及优势半球）。虽然可能发生视野缺损（例如，同侧偏盲），但与影响枕叶的大脑后动脉梗死相比，MCA区域梗死的症状组合（包括无认知障碍和错构）不太典型。\n\n(选项D) 眼动脉闭塞可能导致相应眼睛失明，原因是供应眼睛的颈内动脉分支闭塞。然而，它不会引起双侧皮质盲或相关的认知缺陷，如无认知障碍和错构。\n\n关键临床要点：\n- 皮质盲的特征是视力丧失，但瞳孔反射保留。\n- 负责视觉处理的枕叶由大脑后动脉供应。\n- 无认知障碍和错构可能与影响高级认知和感觉整合区域的病变有关，常常见于影响枕叶和颞叶的大脑后动脉梗死。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the neurological deficits associated with stroke in different cerebral arteries, specifically focusing on the localization of visual processing deficits and associated cognitive impairments. It requires correlating clinical symptoms with the vascular supply of specific brain regions.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the core neurological deficit (cortical blindness with anosognosia and confabulation), localizing this deficit to the occipital lobes, and then determining which artery supplies this region. Ruling out other vascular territories based on their typical clinical presentations is also crucial.",
