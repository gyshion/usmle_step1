    "en": "A 3-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency department after he is found underwater in the bathtub. His parents say the patient was left alone for 5 minutes. On physical examination, he does not respond to painful stimuli and is pulseless and not breathing. Cardiac rhythm is asystole and spontaneously returns after several minutes of resuscitation. While performing endotracheal intubation, stimulation of the posterior pharyngeal wall with laryngoscope elicits no soft palate movements or gagging. This patient's findings during intubation most likely indicate dysfunction of which of the following neural structures? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient with prolonged oxygen deprivation has an absent gag reflex. The gag reflex is an airway protective mechanism that acts to expel foreign or toxic material from the aerodigestive tract. It is mediated by the following:\n\nSensory (afferent) signals from the back of the tongue or posterior pharyngeal wall are sent via the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX).\nSomatic sensory fibers of CN IX enter the brainstem at the medulla, descend along the spinal trigeminal tract, and synapse in the caudal spinal nucleus.\nInformation is then sent to the bilateral nuclei ambiguus, which are also located in the medulla.\nBilateral motor (efferent) signals are sent via the vagus nerves (CN X), causing elevation of the soft palate and contraction of the pharynx.\nTherefore, an absent gag reflex is suspicious for dysfunction of the medulla oblongata. In combination with a prolonged anoxic period, this is concerning for BRAIN DEATH, which is the irreversible absence of cerebral and brainstem reflexes.\n\n(Choice A) Damage to the prefrontal cortex can cause inappropriate behavior, impaired judgment, and poor problem-solving skills (ie, executive dysfunction). It cannot be evaluated in an unconscious patient.\n\n(Choice B) The motor cortex is responsible for generating voluntary motor movement and cannot be tested in an unconscious patient. The gag reflex is involuntary and mediated by cranial nerves in the medulla.\n\n(Choice C) The pupillary reflex is also assessed in patients with suspected brain death and indicates dysfunction of the midbrain. It is mediated by afferents from the optic nerve (CN II) and efferents from the oculomotor nerve (CN III) to mediate constriction of the pupils in response to light.\n\n(Choice E) The cervical spinal cord can mediate several reflexes including neck flexion, adduction of the shoulders, elbow flexion, and flexion of the trunk. These may even be present in patients with brain death. However, the gag reflex is mediated by cranial (rather than spinal) nerves.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe gag reflex is mediated by afferents predominantly from the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) and efferents from the vagus nerve (CN X). An absent gag reflex may indicate dysfunction of the medulla oblongata, where the involved cranial nerve nuclei reside.",
    "zh": "这位患者长期缺氧，没有咽反射。咽反射是一种气道保护机制，旨在将异物或有毒物质从呼吸消化道中排出。它由以下因素介导：\n\n来自舌后部或咽后壁的感觉（传入）信号通过舌咽神经（CN IX）发送。\nCN IX 的躯体感觉纤维进入延髓的脑干，沿脊髓三叉神经束下行，并在尾侧脊髓核处突触。\n然后，信息被发送到双侧疑核，该疑核也位于延髓。\n双侧运动（传出）信号通过迷走神经（CN X）发送，引起软腭抬高和咽部收缩。\n因此，没有咽反射，提示延髓 dysfunction。结合长时间的缺氧期，这与脑死亡有关，脑死亡是脑和脑干反射的不可逆转的缺失。\n\n（选项 A）前额叶皮层的损伤可导致不适当的行为、判断力受损和解决问题的能力差（即执行功能障碍）。无法对无意识患者进行评估。\n\n（选项 B）运动皮层负责产生自主运动，无法对无意识患者进行测试。咽反射是自主的，由延髓中的颅神经介导。\n\n（选项 C）瞳孔反射也在疑似脑死亡的患者中进行评估，并表明中脑 dysfunction。它由来自视神经（CN II）的传入神经和来自动眼神经（CN III）的传出神经介导，以介导瞳孔对光的收缩。\n\n（选项 E）颈椎脊髓可以介导几种反射，包括颈部屈曲、肩部内收、肘部屈曲和躯干屈曲。这些甚至可能存在于脑死亡的患者中。但是，咽反射由颅神经（而非脊髓神经）介导。\n\n教育目标：\n咽反射主要由来自舌咽神经（CN IX）的传入神经和来自迷走神经（CN X）的传出神经介导。没有咽反射可能表明延髓 dysfunction，相关颅神经核位于延髓。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the gag reflex pathway and its association with brainstem function, specifically the medulla oblongata. It also assesses the ability to correlate clinical findings with specific neurological structures.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the cranial nerves involved in the gag reflex (CN IX and X) and their nuclei location in the medulla. Recognize that the absence of the gag reflex in an unresponsive patient suggests brainstem dysfunction, particularly of the medulla oblongata.",
    "zh": "此问题测试对咽反射通路及其与脑干功能（特别是延髓）的关联的了解。它还评估了将临床发现与特定神经结构相关联的能力。\n\n要解决这个问题，请回忆起参与咽反射的颅神经（CN IX 和 X）及其在延髓中的核定位。认识到无反应患者没有咽反射表明脑干功能障碍，特别是延髓的 dysfunction。"
