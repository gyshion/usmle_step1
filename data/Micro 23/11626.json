    "en": "An 84-year-old woman is sent to the hospital from a nursing home due to 3 days of fever, abdominal pain, and progressive lethargy. The patient has a history of recurrent hospitalizations with multiple antibiotic courses for urinary tract infection, infected decubitus ulcer, and pneumonia. Her temperature is 38.2 C (101 F), blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, and pulse is 110/min. She has mild suprapubic and right costovertebral angle tenderness. Urine and blood cultures are obtained, and the patient is started on intravenous fluids and empiric ceftriaxone. Her urine culture shows extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a urinary tract infection caused by an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli. ESBL enzymes can inactivate extended-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins (including third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins) and monobactams (aztreonam). Genes encoding these enzymes are often located on PLASMIDS and therefore can be transferred between organisms and between different species through conjugation. Some have been incorporated into bacterial chromosomes. Carbapenems (eg, imipenem) are the treatment of choice for ESBL-producing organisms (although unfortunately, organisms with carbapenem resistance have emerged).\n\n(Choice A) Mutations in DNA gyrase can lead to fluoroquinolone resistance and generally do not impact beta-lactam antibiotic activity.\n\n(Choice B) Porin mutations can confer penicillin and aminoglycoside resistance and are particularly important in gram-negative organisms such as Pseudomonas.\n\n(Choice C) Penicillin-binding protein alterations are the mechanism that leads to methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.\n\n(Choice D) Vancomycin inhibits glycopeptide polymerization through binding to D-alanyl-D-alanine in the cell wall precursor; peptidoglycan changes (eg, D-alanine-D-lactate) can develop as a resistance mechanism.\n\n(Choice F) Ribosome mutations can confer resistance to ribosome-targeting antibiotics such as aminoglycosides and macrolides.\n\nEducational objective:\nExtended-spectrum beta-lactamases can be produced by gram-negative bacteria, rendering cephalosporins and other beta-lactam antibiotics inactive. These genes can be transmitted between organisms through plasmid conjugation.",
    "zh": "该患者患有由产超广谱β-内酰胺酶(ESBL)的大肠杆菌引起的尿路感染。ESBL酶可以灭活广谱青霉素和头孢菌素（包括第三代和第四代头孢菌素）和单酰胺类（氨曲南）。编码这些酶的基因通常位于质粒上，因此可以通过接合在生物体之间和不同物种之间转移。有些已并入细菌染色体。碳青霉烯类药物（如亚胺培南）是产ESBL病原体的首选治疗方法（尽管不幸的是，已经出现了对碳青霉烯类药物具有耐药性的病原体）。\n\n(选项A) DNA促旋酶的突变可导致氟喹诺酮类药物耐药性，通常不会影响β-内酰胺类抗生素的活性。\n\n(选项B) 孔蛋白突变可赋予青霉素和氨基糖苷类药物耐药性，这在革兰氏阴性病原体（如假单胞菌）中尤为重要。\n\n(选项C) 青霉素结合蛋白的改变是导致金黄色葡萄球菌耐甲氧西林的机制。\n\n(选项D) 万古霉素通过与细胞壁前体中的D-丙氨酰-D-丙氨酸结合来抑制糖肽聚合；肽聚糖变化（例如，D-丙氨酸-D-乳酸）可以发展为一种耐药机制。\n\n(选项F) 核糖体突变可赋予对核糖体靶向抗生素（如氨基糖苷类和大环内酯类）的耐药性。\n\n教育目标：\n革兰氏阴性细菌可以产生超广谱β-内酰胺酶，从而使头孢菌素和其他β-内酰胺类抗生素失活。这些基因可以通过质粒接合在生物体之间传播。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of antibiotic resistance mechanisms, specifically extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production in Escherichia coli. It requires understanding how resistance genes are acquired and transferred among bacteria.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that ESBL genes are commonly located on plasmids, which facilitate horizontal gene transfer and rapid dissemination of antibiotic resistance. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance for other antibiotic classes helps eliminate incorrect options.",
