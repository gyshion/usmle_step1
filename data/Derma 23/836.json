  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient described in this vignette is presenting with symptoms of tinea corporis. Clinically tinea corporis presents as an annular scaling plaque with well-demarcated, raised erythematous borders and central clearing.\n\nTerbinafine is a commonly used drug for treatment of dermatophytosis. It belongs to the class of antifungals called allylamines and may be used topically or orally. Terbinafine inhibits synthesis of ergosterol of the fungal membrane by inhibiting the enzyme squalene epoxidase. Ergosterol is a cell membrane sterol that is unique to fungi and does not occur in human cell membranes. This drug tends to accumulate in skin and its appendages, and its side effects are mild by the topical route.\n\n(Choice A) Binding to ergosterol is a mechanism of action of polyene antifungals (amphotericin B and nystatin).\n\n(Choice C) Caspofungin belongs to the echinocandin class of antifungals. It blocks synthesis of β (1,3)-D-glucan, a main component of Candida and Aspergillus cell walls.\n\n(Choice D) Griseofulvin binds to polymerized microtubules and disrupts the fungal mitotic spindle, thus preventing fungal cell mitosis. It accumulates in the skin and its appendages and is only effective in dermatophytosis.\n\n(Choice E) Flucytosine is an antimetabolite antifungal that is transformed into 5-fluorouracil in the fungal cell. It inhibits fungal protein synthesis by replacing uracil with 5-fluorouracin in fungal mRNA. It is used in systemic fungal infections.",
    "zh": "本案例描述的患者表现为体癣的症状。临床上，体癣表现为环状鳞屑斑块，边界清晰，隆起，发红，中央有清亮区。\n\n特比萘芬是治疗皮肤癣菌病的常用药物。它属于烯丙胺类抗真菌药，可局部或口服使用。特比萘芬通过抑制酶鲨烯环氧化酶来抑制真菌膜中麦角固醇的合成。麦角固醇是一种真菌特有的细胞膜甾醇，不会出现在人体细胞膜中。这种药物往往会在皮肤及其附属物中积累，通过局部给药，其副作用很轻微。\n\n（选项A）与麦角固醇结合是多烯类抗真菌药（两性霉素B和制霉菌素）的作用机制。\n\n（选项C）卡泊芬净属于棘白菌素类抗真菌药。它阻断β (1,3)-D-葡聚糖的合成，β (1,3)-D-葡聚糖是白色念珠菌和曲霉细胞壁的主要成分。\n\n（选项D）灰黄霉素与聚合的微管蛋白结合并破坏真菌有丝分裂纺锤体，从而阻止真菌细胞有丝分裂。它在皮肤及其附属物中积累，仅对皮肤癣菌病有效。\n\n（选项E）氟胞嘧啶是一种抗代谢抗真菌药，在真菌细胞内转化为5-氟尿嘧啶。它通过在真菌mRNA中用5-氟尿嘧啶代替尿嘧啶来抑制真菌蛋白的合成。它用于全身性真菌感染。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of antifungal medications, specifically terbinafine, in the treatment of dermatophyte infections like tinea corporis.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the clinical presentation of tinea corporis and then recalling the specific mechanism by which terbinafine inhibits fungal growth, which is through inhibition of squalene epoxidase.",
