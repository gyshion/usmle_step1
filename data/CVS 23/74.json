    "en": "A 35-year-old man is evaluated for progressive fatigue and shortness of breath. Recently, he has noticed bilateral leg swelling and abdominal distension despite overall weight loss. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Despite treatment, the patient dies several weeks later. Autopsy reveals significant endocardial thickening with dense fibrous deposits around the tricuspid and pulmonary valves as well as moderate pulmonary valve stenosis. The left-sided cardiac chambers and valves are normal.",

    "en": "The autopsy findings - endocardial thickening and fibrosis of tricuspid and pulmonary valves - are characteristic of CARCINOID HEART DISEASE. Carcinoids are well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors found most commonly in the distal small intestine and proximal colon, with a strong propensity for metastasis to the liver. These tumors secrete several products (including histamine, serotonin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide) that are metabolized in the liver. In patients with liver metastasis, these hormones are released directly into the systemic circulation, leading to carcinoid syndrome.\n\nCarcinoid heart disease is caused by excessive secretion of SEROTONIN, which stimulates fibroblast growth and fibrogenesis. Pathognomonic plaque-like DEPOSITS OF FIBROUS TISSUE occur most commonly on the ENDOCARDIUM, leading to TRICUSPID REGURGITATION, pulmonic valvulopathy, and right-sided heart failure (eg, ascites, peripheral edema). Endocardial fibrosis and thickening are generally limited to the right heart as vasoactive products are inactivated distally by pulmonary vascular endothelial monoamine oxidase.\n\n5-HYDROXYINDOLEACETIC ACID (5-HIAA) is an end product of serotonin metabolism, and elevated 24-hour urinary 5-HIAA levels are helpful in diagnosing suspected carcinoid syndrome.\n\n(Choice A) Measurement of plasma cortisol levels is used for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency and Cushing syndrome.\n\n(Choice B) Inherited or acquired elevation of plasma homocysteine levels may contribute to arterial and venous thrombosis and to the development of atherosclerosis.\n\n(Choice C) Plasma phenylalanine may be elevated in patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency (phenylketonuria), resulting in central nervous system damage/intellectual disability.\n\n(Choice E) Urinary porphobilinogen may be elevated in the porphyrias, which are caused by deficiencies of the heme synthesis enzymes. The porphyrias may produce cutaneous lesions, skin photosensitivity, or attacks of abdominal pain and neurological disturbances (acute intermittent porphyria).\n\n(Choice F) Vanillylmandelic acid is a byproduct of norepinephrine and epinephrine, and can be used to detect neuroblastoma and other tumors of neural crest origin.\n\nEducational objective:\nCarcinoid syndrome typically presents with episodic flushing, secretory diarrhea, and wheezing. It can lead to pathognomonic plaque-like deposits of fibrous tissue on the right-sided endocardium, causing tricuspid regurgitation and right-sided heart failure. Elevated 24-hour urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid can confirm the diagnosis.",
    "zh": "尸检结果——三尖瓣和肺动脉瓣的内膜增厚和纤维化——是类癌心脏病的特征。类癌是分化良好的神经内分泌肿瘤，最常见于远端小肠和近端结肠，具有很强的肝转移倾向。这些肿瘤分泌多种产物（包括组胺、血清素和血管活性肠肽），这些产物在肝脏中代谢。在肝转移患者中，这些激素直接释放到全身循环中，导致类癌综合征。\n\n类癌心脏病是由血清素过度分泌引起的，血清素刺激成纤维细胞生长和纤维形成。特征性的斑块样纤维组织沉积物最常发生在心内膜上，导致三尖瓣反流、肺动脉瓣病变和右心衰竭（例如，腹水、周围水肿）。内膜纤维化和增厚通常仅限于右心，因为血管活性产物被肺血管内皮单胺氧化酶远端失活。\n\n5-羟吲哚乙酸（5-HIAA）是血清素代谢的最终产物，24小时尿5-HIAA水平升高有助于诊断疑似类癌综合征。\n\n（选项A） 测量血浆皮质醇水平用于诊断肾上腺皮质功能不全和库欣综合征。\n\n（选项B） 血浆同型半胱氨酸水平的遗传性或获得性升高可能导致动脉和静脉血栓形成以及动脉粥样硬化的发展。\n\n（选项C） 苯丙氨酸羟化酶缺乏症（苯丙酮尿症）患者的血浆苯丙氨酸可能升高，导致中枢神经系统损伤/智力障碍。\n\n（选项E） 尿卟胆原可能在卟啉症中升高，卟啉症是由血红素合成酶缺乏引起的。卟啉症可产生皮肤损伤、皮肤光敏性或腹痛和神经系统紊乱的发作（急性间歇性卟啉症）。\n\n（选项F） 香草扁桃酸是去甲肾上腺素和肾上腺素的副产物，可用于检测神经母细胞瘤和其他神经嵴来源的肿瘤。\n\n教学目标：\n类癌综合征通常表现为阵发性潮红、分泌性腹泻和喘息。它可导致右心内膜上出现特征性的斑块样纤维组织沉积，引起三尖瓣反流和右心衰竭。 24小时尿5-羟吲哚乙酸升高可确诊。"
