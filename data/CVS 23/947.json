She runs daily and wants to start actively training for a half marathon. The patient is concerned that the murmur is a sign of heart disease. She has no family history of sudden cardiac death. Auscultation reveals a midsystolic click followed by a short late-systolic murmur at the cardiac apex. The murmur disappears with squatting. This patient's condition is most likely related to an abnormality involving which of the following tissues? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "The presence of a midsystolic click followed by a systolic murmur at the cardiac apex that disappears with squatting is most consistent with mitral valve prolapse (MVP). The click is caused by sudden tensing of the chordae tendineae as they are pulled taut by the ballooning valve leaflets, and the murmur results from regurgitation of blood due to malalignment of the valve margins with prolapse.\n\nDuring systole, there is a critical left ventricular (LV) size at which prolapse occurs; therefore, maneuvers that change LV end-diastolic volume affect the timing of the click and murmur. Squatting increases venous return and LV volume, increasing the tension and decreasing the slack in the mitral valve apparatus. Because the ventricular walls have farther to travel to reach the critical LV size at which prolapse occurs, prolapse occurs later in systole or not at all. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nPrimary MVP is most commonly a sporadic disorder and is characterized by myxomatous degeneration (ie, pathologic degeneration of the connective tissue) affecting the mitral valve leaflets and chordae tendineae. Secondary MVP is associated with inherited connective tissue disorders, including Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and osteogenesis imperfecta.\n\n(Choice A) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) presents with a systolic murmur at the left sternal border that decreases in intensity with squatting (due to increased LV volume and decreased outflow tract obstruction). A midsystolic click is not heard with HCM.\n\n(Choice C) Coronary artery disease can cause myocardial ischemia or infarction leading to papillary muscle dysfunction and acute mitral regurgitation. In such patients, squatting from a standing position increases murmur intensity due to a higher blood volume of regurgitation. In addition, such a murmur is not preceded by a midsystolic click.\n\n(Choice D) Endomyocardial fibrosis and endocardial fibroelastosis are disorders that affect the endocardium and are not associated with MVP.\n\n(Choice E) Pericardial disease may infrequently result in cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis. Pericarditis may produce a friction rub; however, it is not associated with a cardiac murmur.\n\nEducational objective:\nMitral valve prolapse is most often caused by defects in connective tissue proteins that predispose to myxomatous degeneration of the mitral leaflets and chordae tendineae. Cardiac auscultation typically reveals a midsystolic click followed by a mitral regurgitation murmur; the click and murmur occur later in systole or disappear completely with maneuvers (eg, squatting) that increase left ventricular end-diastolic volume.",
    "zh": "在中期收缩期出现喀喇声，随后在心脏尖端出现收缩期杂音，下蹲时消失，这与二尖瓣脱垂（MVP）最为一致。喀喇声是由腱索突然绷紧引起的，当它们被膨胀的瓣叶拉紧时，杂音是由于瓣膜边缘错位伴脱垂引起的血液反流所致。\n\n在收缩期，存在一个发生脱垂的关键左心室（LV）大小；因此，改变LV舒张末期容积的动作会影响喀喇声和杂音的时间。下蹲会增加静脉回流和LV容积，增加张力并减少二尖瓣装置的松弛。由于心室壁必须行进更远才能达到发生脱垂的关键LV大小，因此脱垂发生在收缩期的后期或根本不发生。 {{exhibit_2}}\n\n原发性MVP最常见于散发性疾病，其特征是粘液样变性（即，影响二尖瓣叶和腱索的结缔组织的病理性变性）。继发性MVP与遗传性结缔组织疾病相关，包括马凡综合征或埃勒斯-当洛斯综合征和成骨不全。\n\n（选项A）肥厚型心肌病（HCM）表现为左胸骨缘的收缩期杂音，下蹲时强度降低（由于LV容积增加和流出道梗阻减少）。HCM听不到中期收缩期喀喇声。\n\n（选项C）冠状动脉疾病可引起心肌缺血或梗死，导致乳头肌功能障碍和急性二尖瓣反流。在这种患者中，从站立姿势下蹲会因反流量增加而增加杂音强度。此外，这种杂音之前没有中期收缩期喀喇声。\n\n（选项D）心内膜纤维化和心内膜弹力纤维增生是影响心内膜的疾病，与MVP无关。\n\n（选项E）心包疾病很少导致心脏压塞或缩窄性心包炎。心包炎可能会产生摩擦音；然而，它与心脏杂音无关。\n\n教育目标：\n二尖瓣脱垂最常由结缔组织蛋白缺陷引起，这些缺陷易患二尖瓣叶和腱索的粘液样变性。心脏听诊通常显示中期收缩期喀喇声，随后出现二尖瓣反流杂音；喀喇声和杂音发生在收缩期后期或通过增加左心室舒张末期容积的动作（例如，下蹲）完全消失。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of mitral valve prolapse (MVP), its auscultatory findings, and the underlying tissue abnormality. It also tests understanding of how maneuvers like squatting affect the murmur associated with MVP.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic auscultatory findings of MVP (midsystolic click and late systolic murmur) and how they change with squatting. Then, recall that MVP is primarily caused by myxomatous degeneration of the connective tissue in the mitral valve leaflets and chordae tendineae.",
