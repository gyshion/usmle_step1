    "en": "A 40-year-old man comes to the office due to a 6-month history of sleep abnormalities, constipation, and generalized slowing of activity. In addition, he has difficulty rising from a seated position. Medical history is significant for a traumatic head injury 3 years ago, which required a prolonged hospital stay. The patient has no other medical conditions and takes no medication. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Vital signs are normal. Examination shows resistance to passive movement in the upper extremities, which is slightly greater on the left than on the right. Left hand tremor and decreased arm swing occur during walking.",

    "en": "This patient presents with symptoms suggestive of PARKINSON DISEASE, including bradykinesia (slowing of activity, decreased arm swing), resting tremor, rigidity (resistance to passive movement), and constipation. The constellation of symptoms is concerning for Parkinson disease, which originates from a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. This typically occurs gradually, leading to clinical onset in the sixth or seventh decade. However, TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY, especially with prolonged loss of consciousness, is associated with both an INCREASED INCIDENCE and an EARLIER ONSET of Parkinson disease. This is due to the ACCELERATED DEGENERATION OF NEURONS both at the time of injury and through ongoing neurotoxic cascades that lead to the accumulation of alpha-synuclein filaments and accelerated neurodegeneration.\n\n(Choice A) Astrocyte swelling occurs in the early phase of traumatic brain injury and can lead to cerebral edema and life-threatening increased intracranial pressure. It does not seem to directly contribute to dopaminergic neurodegeneration.\n\n(Choice C) Degeneration of oligodendrocytes (myelin-forming cells) leads to demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, which typically presents with neurologic deficits disseminated in space and time.\n\n(Choice D) Disruption of vascular endothelial cells can occur due to shearing forces during traumatic brain injury. This can disrupt the BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER, leading to cerebral edema and petechial hemorrhaging. However, it is not the primary cause of Parkinson disease.\n\n(Choice E) Vascular amyloid deposition is responsible for cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which is the most common cause of lobar intracranial hemorrhage. The amyloidogenic proteins are usually the same as those seen in Alzheimer dementia, but they are not associated with Parkinson disease, which is associated with alpha-synuclein deposition.\n\nEducational objective:\nBradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity are features of Parkinson disease, which is caused by dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Traumatic brain injuries can accelerate neurodegeneration, leading to a higher incidence and earlier onset of Parkinson disease.",
    "zh": "该患者出现的症状提示帕金森病，包括运动迟缓（活动减慢、摆臂减少）、静止性震颤、强直（被动运动阻力）和便秘。这些症状的组合提示帕金森病，其病因是黑质中多巴胺能神经元的丧失。这通常是逐渐发生的，导致在六、七十年代出现临床症状。然而，头部外伤，尤其是伴有长期意识丧失的头部外伤，与帕金森病的发生率增加和发病年龄提前有关。这是由于神经元变性加速，这既发生在损伤时，也通过持续的神经毒性级联反应，导致α-突触核蛋白丝的积累和神经变性加速。\n\n(选项 A) 星形胶质细胞肿胀发生在头部外伤的早期，可导致脑水肿和危及生命的高颅内压。它似乎并不能直接导致多巴胺能神经元的变性。\n\n(选项 C) 少突胶质细胞（髓鞘形成细胞）的变性会导致脱髓鞘疾病，如多发性硬化症，其典型表现为在时间和空间上弥散的神经功能缺损。\n\n(选项 D) 血管内皮细胞的破坏可能发生在头部外伤期间的剪切力作用下。这会破坏血脑屏障，导致脑水肿和瘀点出血。然而，它不是帕金森病的主要原因。\n\n(选项 E) 血管淀粉样蛋白沉积是脑淀粉样血管病的原因，这是脑叶内出血最常见的原因。淀粉样蛋白原性蛋白通常与阿尔茨海默病中看到的相同，但与帕金森病无关，帕金森病与α-突触核蛋白沉积有关。\n\n教育目标：\n运动迟缓、静止性震颤和强直是帕金森病的特征，其病因是多巴胺能神经元的变性。头部外伤会加速神经变性，导致帕金森病的发病率更高，发病年龄更早。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of Parkinson disease presentation and the impact of traumatic brain injury on neurodegenerative processes. It specifically assesses the knowledge that head trauma can accelerate neuronal degeneration, leading to an earlier onset of Parkinsonian symptoms.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the clinical features suggestive of Parkinson disease. Then, consider how the patient's history of traumatic brain injury might influence the presentation and etiology of these symptoms, leading to the identification of accelerated neuronal degeneration as the most likely underlying mechanism.",
