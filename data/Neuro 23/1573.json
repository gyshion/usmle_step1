    "en": "A 42-year-old man is brought to the emergency department following a generalized tonic-clonic seizure witnessed by his family. He has no history of seizures but has had headaches for the past several weeks. The patient works in construction. He lives in the United States and has not traveled recently. The patient has never had pets. He smokes a pack of cigarettes daily and drinks 3 or 4 cans of beer every evening. Physical examination is notable for a postictal state, oral thrush, and several enlarged cervical and inguinal lymph nodes. MRI of the brain with contrast is shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}.",

    "en": "The presence of oropharyngeal candidiasis should raise suspicion for HIV infection when a patient has no other risk factors for thrush (eg, dentures, xerostomia, inhaled corticosteroid use, recent antibiotic exposure). Patients with HIV are often unaware of infection and come to clinical attention due to an AIDS-defining illness; in this case, the patient's subacute headaches, new seizure, and multiple ring-enhancing lesions on MRI of the brain suggest toxoplasmic encephalitis {{exhibit_2}}.\n\nToxoplasmic encephalitis is the most common CNS infection in patients with AIDS. Although exposure often occurs due to accidental ingestion of oocytes following handling of feline feces (eg, litter box cleaning, cat handling), many cases arise following ingestion of undercooked meat from an intermediate host (eg, pig, sheep). Therefore, pet exposure is not a prerequisite.\n\nToxoplasmic encephalitis usually presents with slowly progressive headaches, seizures, focal neurologic findings, and/or personality changes. Brain imaging with contrast frequently reveals multiple ring-enhancing lesions with surrounding edema. Diagnosis is supported by the presence of positive toxoplasma serology.\n\n(Choice A) Aspergillus fumigatus is not a common opportunistic pathogen in patients with AIDS, possibly because phagocytic function is relatively preserved despite T-cell dysfunction. A fumigatus typically affects the lungs; however, it can cause brain abscesses in patients who are immunocompromised due to neutropenia or transplant.\n\n(Choice B) Although CNS glioblastomas are ring-enhancing, they are typically solitary and often have a characteristic butterfly appearance.\n\n(Choice C) Neurocysticercosis (due to Taenia solium [pork tapeworm] ingestion) can cause multiple brain lesions, but neuroimaging typically shows lesions at variable stages of degeneration, including cysts, calcifications, and enhancement.\n\n(Choice D) Nocardiosis is more common in patients with defects in cell-mediated immunity (eg, AIDS). Although it can cause headache and seizure, brain imaging would show evidence of abscess (eg, loculation, fluid-filled cavities).\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients with HIV are often unaware of infection and come to clinical attention due to an AIDS-defining illness. The presence of multiple ring-enhancing lesions in a patient with AIDS most likely indicates toxoplasmosis {{exhibit_3}}.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients, specifically toxoplasmic encephalitis. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation and interpreting brain imaging findings to arrive at the most likely diagnosis.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to recognize the risk factors for HIV (thrush, lymphadenopathy, risky behaviors), the neurological symptoms (headaches, seizures), and the characteristic multiple ring-enhancing lesions on brain MRI. This combination strongly suggests toxoplasmic encephalitis in an immunocompromised individual.",
