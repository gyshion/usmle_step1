    "en": "A 55-year-old man comes to the office for evaluation of progressive watery diarrhea for the last 2 weeks. The patient has a history of kidney transplantation 5 years ago due to polycystic kidney disease and currently takes multiple immunosuppressive medications. Temperature is 36.2 C (97.2 F), pulse is 98/min, blood pressure is 106/72 mm Hg, and respirations are 15/min. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The abdomen is soft, nontender, and without organomegaly. Rectal examination shows brown stool. Stool microscopy using modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining shows multiple acid-fast organisms. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current condition?",

    "en": "This immunocompromised patient has PROFUSE WATERY DIARRHEA and stool studies revealing acid-fast staining microorganisms. These findings are most likely due to infection with Cryptosporidium parvum.\n\nCryptosporidium is a fecal-orally transmitted protozoan that most commonly causes outbreaks in association with contaminated water; foodborne and person-to-person transmission may also occur. Ingested oocytes travel to the small bowel where they release sporozoites that attach to epithelial cells. Sporozoites mature intraluminally into meronts that reinvade host cells (eg, auto-infection) as well as create new oocytes that are shed in feces. These oocysts can be identified by modified acid-fast staining of stool specimens. Stool PCR and immunofluorescent assay are also diagnostic.\n\nHealthy individuals infected with Cryptosporidium usually develop mild, self-limited (10-14 days) diarrhea, but those with IMPAIRED IMMUNITY (eg, AIDS, organ transplant recipients on immunosuppression therapy) are at risk for severe and protracted symptoms with fluid loss sometimes exceeding >20 L a day.\n\n(Choice B) Giardia lamblia is a protozoan that causes watery and sometimes oily diarrhea (ie, steatorrhea due to fat malabsorption). Stool microscopy demonstrates oval-shaped cysts and flagellated pear-shaped trophozoites with two large central nuclei. Acid-fast staining is negative.\n\n(Choice C) Listeria monocytogenes typically causes self-limited (2-3 days) watery diarrhea associated with fever and muscle/joint pain. Invasive disease (eg, sepsis, meningitis) can occur in immunocompromised individuals. However, this organism is a gram-positive rod; acid-fast staining would be negative.\n\n(Choice D) Mycobacterium avium complex can cause disseminated infection in immunosuppressed patients. Although diarrhea is common, it is typically associated with fever and weight loss. Blood culture or tissue histology demonstrates acid-fast positive bacilli; stool culture is less useful for diagnosis as the organism is only found infrequently.\n\n(Choice E) Strongyloides stercoralis causes diarrhea and abdominal pain, but pulmonary manifestations (eg, cough, dyspnea) and linear, pruritic, erythematous streaks (eg, larva currens) are typical. Stool microscopy may reveal rhabditiform larva.\n\nEducational objective:\nCryptosporidium is a fecal-orally transmitted protozoan that causes severe and protracted watery diarrhea in patients with impaired immunity (eg, AIDS, immunosuppression). The presence of acid-fast staining oocytes in a stool specimen is diagnostic.",
    "zh": "这位免疫功能低下的患者有大量水样腹泻，粪便检查显示抗酸染色微生物。这些发现很可能是由于感染了微小隐孢子虫。\n\n隐孢子虫是一种粪口传播的原生动物，最常引起与受污染水源相关的爆发；食源性和人际传播也可能发生。摄入的卵囊进入小肠，在那里释放出附着于上皮细胞的子孢子。子孢子在肠腔内成熟为裂殖体，重新侵入宿主细胞（例如，自身感染），并产生新的卵囊，这些卵囊在粪便中排出。这些卵囊可以通过改良的粪便抗酸染色来识别。粪便PCR和免疫荧光检测也有助于诊断。\n\n感染隐孢子虫的健康个体通常会出现轻度、自限性（10-14天）腹泻，但免疫受损（例如，艾滋病、接受免疫抑制治疗的器官移植受者）的个体有发生严重和迁延性症状的风险，液体流失有时超过每天20升。\n\n（选项B）兰伯贾第虫是一种原生动物，可引起水样、有时呈油性腹泻（即，脂肪吸收不良引起的脂肪泻）。粪便显微镜检查显示卵圆形包囊和具有两个大中心核的鞭毛梨形滋养体。抗酸染色阴性。\n\n（选项C）单核细胞增生李斯特菌通常引起与发热和肌肉/关节疼痛相关、自限性（2-3天）水样腹泻。免疫功能低下者可能发生侵袭性疾病（例如，败血症、脑膜炎）。然而，这种生物是一种革兰氏阳性杆菌；抗酸染色将呈阴性。\n\n（选项D）鸟型分枝杆菌复合体可引起免疫抑制患者的播散性感染。虽然腹泻常见，但通常与发热和体重减轻有关。血培养或组织病理学显示抗酸阳性杆菌；粪便培养对诊断的帮助较小，因为该生物体仅偶见。\n\n（选项E）粪圆线虫可引起腹泻和腹痛，但肺部表现（例如，咳嗽、呼吸困难）和线状、瘙痒性、红斑条纹（例如，幼虫移行症）是典型的。粪便显微镜检查可能显示杆状幼虫。\n\n教育目标：\n隐孢子虫是一种粪口传播的原生动物，可引起免疫受损患者（例如，艾滋病、免疫抑制）的严重和迁延性水样腹泻。粪便样本中存在抗酸染色卵囊具有诊断意义。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of common causes of diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, specifically focusing on Cryptosporidium parvum and its diagnostic features. It requires recognizing the significance of acid-fast organisms in stool microscopy within the context of a patient with a history of kidney transplantation and immunosuppression. \n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the key findings (watery diarrhea, acid-fast organisms in stool) and correlating them with the patient's immunocompromised state. Ruling out other causes of diarrhea based on their distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic features is crucial.",
