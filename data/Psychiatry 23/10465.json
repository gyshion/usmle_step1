    "en": "A 5-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother, who is concerned after observing her daughter speak to an empty chair in her room on several occasions. The girl's medical history is significant for preterm birth at 36 weeks gestation but is otherwise noncontributory. Her family history is significant for cerebrovascular accident and depression in her maternal grandfather and schizoaffective disorder in her father. When questioned, the patient says she sees her grandmother at night and likes to speak to her before she goes to bed. The grandmother died 2 months ago and had lived in the family home. For a few weeks following the death, the girl would become tearful and frequently ask her parents when her grandmother would be coming back.",

    "en": "This child is experiencing HALLUCINATIONS of her recently deceased grandmother that appear to be comforting. Studies suggest that behavioral disturbances are common in CHILDREN the year following the death of a loved one and that children try to maintain a connection with the lost loved one as a way of coping with loss. In the absence of other psychiatric symptoms (eg, other psychotic symptoms, severe mood symptoms, social or academic problems), these hallucinations are unlikely to be a symptom of mental illness and are likely a way of holding on to the grandmother during the BEREAVEMENT process. The mother should be reassured that this is a NORMAL response to loss.\n\nChildren under age 6 do not understand the finality of death and may believe that it is temporary or reversible. By the age of 7, children usually understand that death is permanent but may have difficulty understanding abstract concepts (eg, soul, heaven) until adolescence.\n\nParents can help young children mourn by supporting their expression about the deceased, maintaining<bos>, reassuring them that the death and other people's reactions are not their fault, and responding truthfully to their children's questions in a concrete fashion.\n\n(Choices A and E) Hallucinations should be differentiated from nightmares and flashbacks that may occur in acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These disorders typically involve exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence followed by development of characteristic symptoms (eg, intrusive flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance, detachment, hyperarousal). Acute stress disorder lasts from 3 days to 1 month, and PTSD lasts more than 1 month.\n\n(Choices B and F) Childhood-onset psychotic disorders are rare, and this child exhibits no other psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions, disorganization, negative symptoms). Psychotic disorders can be differentiated by duration: brief psychotic disorder lasts for less than 1 month, schizophreniform disorder lasts 1-6 months, and schizophrenia lasts 6 months or more.\n\n(Choice C) This patient exhibits no persistent depressive symptoms that would be required to diagnose major depressive disorder with psychotic features.\n\nEducational objective: Transient behavioral disturbances are common in children after the death of a loved one. Hallucinations of recently deceased relatives are part of a normal grief reaction and may not be indicative of major psychiatric illness.",
    "zh": "这个孩子正在经历她最近去世的祖母的幻觉，这些幻觉似乎令人感到安慰。研究表明，在儿童失去亲人后的一年内，行为紊乱很常见，儿童会尝试与失去的亲人保持联系，以此作为应对失去的方式。在没有其他精神病症状（例如，其他精神病症状、严重的 mood 症状、社交或学业问题）的情况下，这些幻觉不太可能是精神疾病的症状，而很可能是在哀伤过程中抓住祖母的一种方式。应该让母亲放心，这是对失去的正常反应。\n\n6岁以下的儿童不理解死亡的最终性，可能认为它是暂时的或可逆的。到7岁时，儿童通常理解死亡是永久的，但在青春期之前可能难以理解抽象概念（例如，灵魂，天堂）。\n\n父母可以通过支持他们对死者的表达，保持<bos>，向他们保证死亡和其他人的反应不是他们的错，并以具体的方式如实回答他们孩子的问题来帮助年幼的孩子哀悼。\n\n（选项 A 和 E）幻觉应与可能发生在急性应激障碍和创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD) 中的噩梦和闪回区分开来。这些疾病通常涉及暴露于实际或威胁死亡、严重伤害或性暴力，然后出现特征性症状（例如，侵入性闪回、噩梦、回避、冷漠、过度警觉）。急性应激障碍持续 3 天到 1 个月，而 PTSD 持续 1 个月以上。\n\n（选项 B 和 F）儿童期起病的精神病性障碍很少见，而且这个孩子没有表现出其他精神病症状（例如，妄想、思维混乱、阴性症状）。精神病性障碍可以通过持续时间来区分：短暂性精神病性障碍持续不到 1 个月，精神分裂症样障碍持续 1-6 个月，精神分裂症持续 6 个月或更长时间。\n\n（选项 C）该患者没有表现出诊断伴有精神病性症状的重度抑郁症所必需的持续性抑郁症状。\n\n教育目标：在儿童失去亲人后，短暂的行为紊乱很常见。最近去世的亲人的幻觉是正常悲伤反应的一部分，可能不表明患有重大的精神疾病。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of normal grief reactions in young children, specifically differentiating between transient behavioral disturbances and psychiatric disorders following the death of a loved one. It emphasizes the importance of considering developmental stage and the context of bereavement when evaluating symptoms like hallucinations.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully evaluating the patient's symptoms within the context of her recent loss. Key factors include the nature of the hallucinations (comforting vs. distressing), the absence of other psychiatric symptoms, and the child's developmental stage, all of which point towards a normal grief response rather than a pathological condition.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对幼儿正常悲伤反应的理解，特别是区分失去亲人后短暂的行为紊乱和精神障碍。它强调了在评估幻觉等症状时，考虑发育阶段和悲伤背景的重要性。\n\n解决这个问题的方法包括在患者最近的失落背景下仔细评估患者的症状。关键因素包括幻觉的性质（安慰 vs. 痛苦）、缺乏其他精神病症状以及孩子的发展阶段，所有这些都指向正常的悲伤反应，而不是病理状况。"
