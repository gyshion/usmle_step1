    "en": "An 80-year-old man comes to the office for evaluation of persistent dry mouth and difficulty chewing food. He has had no dry eyes or joint pains. The patient has no chronic medical conditions and takes no medications. On examination, there is decreased saliva production but no tenderness or swelling of the salivary glands. Extensive dental caries are present. Laboratory results show negative anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies. Which of the following age-related changes is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?",

    "en": "Elderly patients are at increased risk of dysphagia due to age-related physiologic changes in the upper aerodigestive tract. Acinar atrophy and fatty infiltration affecting the parotid salivary glands result in a dramatic reduction (~50%) in saliva production, which frequently leads to xerostomia. This decrease in saliva is often accompanied by age-related mucosal atrophy, which manifests as receding gums with increased exposure of tooth roots; these changes increase the risk of TOOTH DECAY in elderly patients.\n\nElderly patients also commonly have a decrease in muscle mass and loss of connective tissue elasticity, which can impact the muscles of mastication, intrinsic and extrinsic tongue muscles, and pharyngeal constrictors. These alterations can lead to difficulty forming food into a bolus and propelling food from the oral cavity into the oropharynx and then into the esophagus.\n\nIn addition, elderly patients have a decreased sense of taste and smell and impaired airway protective reflexes. They also are more likely to have comorbid neurologic diseases (eg, stroke, Parkinson disease) that further increase the risk of dysphagia. Dysphagia can lead to malnutrition and aspiration, both of which cause significant morbidity and mortality in the elderly.\n\n(Choice B) Involvement of the salivary glands by systemic amyloidosis is common, but amyloid deposition significant enough to lead to dysphagia is very rare; normal age-related physiologic changes are much more likely in this patient.\n\n(Choice C) Fibrosis and focal lymphocytic infiltration into the salivary glands are seen in Sjogren syndrome, an autoimmune disease impacting exocrine glands (eg, salivary, lacrimal, vaginal). Although patients often have dry mouth, they also typically have dry eyes and positive anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB antibodies.\n\n(Choice D) Granulomatous inflammation of the salivary glands is seen in uveoparotid fever (ie, Heerfordt syndrome), an uncommon manifestation of sarcoidosis characterized by acute fever, parotitis, and anterior uveitis.\n\n(Choice E) Elderly patients with xerostomia are at risk of acute sialadenitis, an infection of the salivary glands caused by retrograde seeding of bacteria from the oral cavity. Patients have acute, typically unilateral salivary gland swelling, exquisite pain, and fever.\n\nEducational objective:\nElderly patients have decreased saliva production due to acinar atrophy and fatty infiltration of the salivary glands. Other age-related changes include oral mucosal atrophy; weakening of the muscles of mastication, tongue muscles, and pharyngeal constrictors; and a decreased sense of taste and smell. As a result, elderly patients are at increased risk of dysphagia, malnutrition, and pneumonia. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "老年患者由于上呼吸消化道的年龄相关生理变化，吞咽困难的风险增加。影响腮腺的腺泡萎缩和脂肪浸润导致唾液分泌量急剧减少（约50%），这经常导致口干症。唾液减少常常伴随着与年龄相关的黏膜萎缩，表现为牙龈萎缩，牙根暴露增加；这些变化增加了老年患者的龋齿风险。\n\n老年患者通常也会出现肌肉质量下降和结缔组织弹性丧失，这会影响咀嚼肌、舌内肌和外肌以及咽部收缩肌。这些改变会导致难以将食物形成食团，并难以将食物从口腔推进到口咽，然后再到食道。\n\n此外，老年患者的味觉和嗅觉减退，气道保护性反射受损。他们也更有可能患有合并的神经系统疾病（例如，中风、帕金森病），这会进一步增加吞咽困难的风险。吞咽困难可导致营养不良和吸入性肺炎，两者都会导致老年人的显著发病率和死亡率。\n\n(选项 B) 系统性淀粉样变性累及唾液腺很常见，但导致吞咽困难的淀粉样蛋白沉积非常罕见；该患者更可能出现正常的年龄相关生理变化。\n\n(选项 C) 纤维化和局灶性淋巴细胞浸润到唾液腺中可见于干燥综合征，这是一种影响外分泌腺（例如，唾液腺、泪腺、阴道）的自身免疫性疾病。尽管患者经常有口干症状，但他们通常也会有眼干和抗Ro/SSA和/或抗La/SSB抗体阳性。\n\n(选项 D) 唾液腺肉芽肿性炎症可见于葡萄膜腮腺热（即 Heerfordt 综合征），这是结节病的一种不常见表现，其特征是急性发热、腮腺炎和前葡萄膜炎。\n\n(选项 E) 口干症的老年患者有发生急性唾液腺炎的风险，这是一种由口腔细菌逆行播散引起的唾液腺感染。患者有急性、通常为单侧的唾液腺肿胀、剧烈疼痛和发热。\n\n教育目标：\n老年患者由于腺泡萎缩和唾液腺脂肪浸润导致唾液分泌减少。其他与年龄相关的变化包括口腔黏膜萎缩；咀嚼肌、舌肌和咽部收缩肌无力；以及味觉和嗅觉减退。因此，老年患者吞咽困难、营养不良和肺炎的风险增加。{{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of age-related changes in the upper aerodigestive tract, specifically focusing on the salivary glands and their impact on saliva production and oral health in elderly patients. It requires understanding the physiological changes that occur with aging and their clinical manifestations. \n\nThe best approach is to consider the patient's age and lack of other systemic symptoms. Rule out other conditions like Sjogren's syndrome or sialadenitis based on the provided clinical information and laboratory results. Focus on the most common age-related changes that can explain the patient's dry mouth and chewing difficulties.",
