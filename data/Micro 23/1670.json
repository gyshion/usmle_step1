    "en": "Measles virus, or rubeola, is an enveloped, nonsegmented, negative-sense RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family. This highly contagious infection is transmitted by airborne or person-to-person contact. Classically, measles presents with a prodrome of fever, cough, rhinorrhea, and conjunctivitis (ie, conjunctival injection [hyperemia]). Koplik spots {{exhibit_2}} on the buccal mucosa are a pathognomonic finding and consist of small white, blue, or gray specks on an erythematous base. These symptoms are followed by a maculopapular exanthem that starts on the face and spreads down the trunk and extremities.\n\nThe parents' refusal of preventive medicine also supports a diagnosis of measles, as the child likely did not receive the combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\n(Choice A) Hepatitis A spreads through the fecal-oral route and is generally an acute and self-limited disease. Hepatitis B is transmitted via bodily fluids and causes acute and chronic disease. These viruses cause elevated liver enzymes and hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice).\n\n(Choice C) Mumps is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family and spreads by respiratory droplets or person-to-person contact. Infection classically causes parotitis, orchitis, and aseptic meningitis.\n\n(Choice D) Pertussis is caused by the gram-negative bacteria Bordetella pertussis and spread by respiratory droplets. It is highly contagious and presents with paroxysms of cough and an inspiratory \"whoop\" sound in children.\n\n(Choice E) Epiglottitis is linked with Haemophilus influenzae type b, a gram-negative, encapsulated bacteria spread by respiratory droplets. Patients often present with tripod positioning in an attempt to increase airflow due to life-threatening airway obstruction.\n\n(Choice F) A diffuse vesicular rash of different stages is typical of chickenpox, or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. VZV is a double-stranded, enveloped, DNA virus that is part of the Herpesviridae family. Transmission occurs via aerosolized droplets or direct contact.\n\n(Choice G) Rotavirus, a double-stranded RNA virus of the Reoviridae family, causes profuse watery diarrhea in infants, potentially leading to dehydration and death.\n\nEducational objective:\nMeasles presents with fever, cough, rhinorrhea, and conjunctivitis followed by a maculopapular rash that starts on the face and spreads downwards. Koplik spots are pathognomonic for measles and characterized by tiny white or blue-gray lesions on the buccal mucosa. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "麻疹病毒，或称风疹病毒，是副黏液病毒科的一种有包膜、无分节段的负链RNA病毒。这种高度传染性的感染通过空气传播或人与人之间的接触传播。典型地，麻疹表现为前驱症状，包括发烧、咳嗽、流鼻涕和结膜炎（即结膜充血[充血]）。颊黏膜上的Koplik斑点{{exhibit_2}}是特征性的发现，由红斑基底上的小的白色、蓝色或灰色斑点组成。这些症状之后出现斑丘疹，从面部开始，向下蔓延到躯干和四肢。\n\n父母拒绝接受预防性药物治疗也支持麻疹的诊断，因为孩子可能没有接种麻疹、腮腺炎和风疹 (MMR) 联合疫苗。\n\n(选项A) 甲型肝炎通过粪口途径传播，通常是一种急性和自限性疾病。乙型肝炎通过体液传播，可引起急性和慢性疾病。这些病毒会导致肝酶升高和高胆红素血症（黄疸）。\n\n(选项C) 腮腺炎是副黏液病毒科的成员，通过呼吸道飞沫或人与人之间的接触传播。感染通常会导致腮腺炎、睾丸炎和无菌性脑膜炎。\n\n(选项D) 百日咳由革兰氏阴性细菌百日咳博德特氏菌引起，并通过呼吸道飞沫传播。它具有高度传染性，表现为阵发性咳嗽和儿童吸气时的“哮鸣”声。\n\n(选项E) 会厌炎与嗜血杆菌流感嗜血杆菌 b 型有关，这是一种通过呼吸道飞沫传播的革兰氏阴性、有包膜的细菌。患者通常会采取三脚架姿势，试图增加气流，因为这是一种危及生命的呼吸道梗阻。\n\n(选项F) 不同阶段的弥漫性水疱疹是水痘或水痘-带状疱疹病毒 (VZV) 感染的典型表现。 VZV 是一种双链、有包膜的 DNA 病毒，是疱疹病毒科的一部分。通过气溶胶飞沫或直接接触传播。\n\n(选项G) 轮状病毒，一种呼肠孤病毒科的双链 RNA 病毒，可引起婴儿出现大量水样腹泻，可能导致脱水和死亡。\n\n教育目标：\n麻疹表现为发烧、咳嗽、流鼻涕和结膜炎，随后出现从面部开始并向下蔓延的斑丘疹。 Koplik斑点是麻疹的特征，其特征是在颊黏膜上出现微小的白色或蓝灰色病变。 {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of measles (rubeola) presentation, including the characteristic prodrome, pathognomonic Koplik spots, and subsequent maculopapular rash. It also assesses understanding of vaccine-preventable diseases and the importance of immunization.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic prodrome symptoms (fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis) and identify the Koplik spots as pathognomonic for measles. Consider the patient's lack of vaccination due to parental refusal, increasing the likelihood of measles.",
