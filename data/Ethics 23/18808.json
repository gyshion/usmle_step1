    "en": "A 73-year-old woman with congestive heart failure is being prepared for discharge from the hospital. The patient has heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and has been admitted to the hospital twice in the past 60 days. Medical history is notable for ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypertension. Vital signs are normal. Pulmonary examination shows normal respiratory effort and no crackles, and there is no peripheral edema. The patient asks to stay in the hospital for a few additional days and says, \"I feel fine right now, but I am worried that if I go home, I might end up back in the hospital again.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient's request?",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Congestive heart failure carries a high rate of hospital readmission. The potential reasons for readmission are numerous and variable and can include premature discharge, inadequate outpatient follow-up, inadequate social support, dietary indiscretion, and medication errors (eg, missed or duplicate prescriptions). In addition, patients may not thoroughly understand how to take their medications, what each medication is for, or what to do if their symptoms begin to relapse.\n\nPredischarge counseling typically begins with exploring patients' level of understanding and health literacy (ie, ability to process basic health information and make appropriate health decisions). Patients should have an opportunity to express their questions and concerns about factors at home that may lead to readmission. If possible, education should be provided by a multidisciplinary team (eg, pharmacist, physical therapist) that can address specific aspects of care. In addition, follow-up phone calls and telemonitoring (eg, blood pressure checks) after discharge may be helpful.\n\n(Choice A) Friends and family members can often help patients by assisting with activities of daily living, reinforcing treatment plans, and alerting outpatient providers to early signs of clinical decompensation. However, it would be premature to enlist others to help before understanding the reasons for readmission.\n\n(Choice B) Nursing home (ie, skilled care facility) transfer is appropriate for patients who require technically advanced interventions (eg, dressing changes, intravenous antibiotics) that cannot be provided at home. Postacute care for heart failure typically involves oral medications that do not require skilled services.\n\n(Choice C) Improper diet (eg, unrestricted sodium intake) is a common reason for heart failure readmission. However, the clinician should first assess the patient's current level of understanding, and the patient should be allowed to explain the reasons she thinks contribute to readmission.\n\n(Choice E) This patient has been clinically stabilized and is unlikely to benefit from continued stay. Predischarge counseling should focus on factors at home that could lead to readmission rather than on reasons to stay in the hospital.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nPredischarge counseling should begin with exploring patients' level of understanding and health literacy. Patients should have an opportunity to ask questions and express their concerns about factors at home that could lead to readmission. If possible, education should be provided by a multidisciplinary care team, and the plan for home care and follow-up should be clear.",
    "zh": "充血性心力衰竭的再入院率很高。再入院的潜在原因有很多，而且各不相同，可能包括过早出院、门诊随访不足、社会支持不足、饮食不当和用药错误（例如，漏服或重复处方）。此外，患者可能不完全了解如何服药、每种药物的用途或如果症状开始复发该怎么做。\n\n出院前咨询通常从探讨患者的理解程度和健康素养（即，处理基本健康信息和做出适当健康决策的能力）开始。患者应有机会表达他们对可能导致再入院的家中因素的疑问和担忧。如果可能，应由多学科团队（例如，药剂师、物理治疗师）提供教育，以解决护理的特定方面。此外，出院后的随访电话和远程监测（例如，血压检查）可能有所帮助。\n\n（选项A）朋友和家人通常可以通过协助日常生活活动、加强治疗计划以及向门诊医生通报临床失代偿的早期迹象来帮助患者。然而，在了解再入院的原因之前，寻求他人帮助为时过早。\n\n（选项B）对于需要在家中无法提供的技术先进的干预措施（例如，换药、静脉注射抗生素）的患者，转入疗养院（即，技术护理机构）是合适的。心力衰竭的后期护理通常涉及不需要技术服务的口服药物。\n\n（选项C）饮食不当（例如，不受限制的钠摄入）是心力衰竭再入院的常见原因。然而，临床医生应首先评估患者目前的理解水平，并应允许患者解释她认为导致再入院的原因。\n\n（选项E）该患者的病情已临床稳定，不太可能从继续住院中获益。出院前咨询应侧重于可能导致再入院的家中因素，而不是住院的原因。\n\n教育目标：\n\n出院前咨询应从探讨患者的理解程度和健康素养开始。患者应有机会提出问题并表达他们对可能导致再入院的家中因素的担忧。如果可能，应由多学科护理团队提供教育，并且家庭护理和随访计划应明确。"

    "en": "This question assesses the appropriate approach to pre-discharge counseling for a patient with congestive heart failure who is concerned about readmission. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the patient's perspective and identifying potential factors at home that could contribute to readmission.\n\nThe best approach is to engage the patient in a discussion about their concerns and potential reasons for readmission. This allows the clinician to assess the patient's understanding of their condition and identify areas where education and support may be needed.",
