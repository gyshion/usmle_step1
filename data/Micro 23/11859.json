    "en": "A 21-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgias, and debilitating retroorbital headaches for the past several days. The patient is on summer break and came to work at his grandparents' dairy farm 3 weeks ago. He cleans out animal waste from the barn, but he does not handle hay. His past medical history is insignificant. He does not use tobacco or illicit drugs. The patient's temperature is 38.8 C (101.8 F). Bronchial breath sounds are heard in the right lower lung. There are no cardiac murmurs. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Chest x-ray demonstrates right lower and middle lobe consolidation. Laboratory results are as follows:\n\nComplete blood count\n\nHemoglobin 14 g/dL\n\nPlatelets 60,000/mm³\n\nLeukocytes 8,800/mm³\n\nLiver function studies\n\nAspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) 162 U/L\n\nAlanine aminotransferase (SGPT) 174 U/L\n\nAn HIV test is negative.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Q fever is a zoonosis caused by *Coxiella burnetii*. Human infection usually occurs through inhalation of bacteria from air contaminated by animal waste. Q fever has acute and chronic stages. Acute Q fever manifests as a nonspecific febrile illness with fever lasting >10 days, fatigue, and myalgias. Severe debilitating headaches, which are often retroorbital and associated with photophobia, are a frequent symptom. Pneumonia is one of the primary signs of acute Q fever, and the most common x-ray abnormality is lobar consolidation. Leukocyte count is often normal. Other classic laboratory findings are increased liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia. Chronic Q fever, which is frequently fatal if not treated, is rare, may occur in patients with or without previous symptomatic acute infection, and manifests as infective endocarditis in patients with valvular disease.\n\n(Choice A) *Borrelia burgdorferi* is a spirochete that is the causative agent in Lyme disease, transmitted to humans through the bite of the *Ixodes* tick. Manifestations include erythema migrans (target lesion), febrile illness with headaches and joint pains, and central nervous system or cardiac involvement. Pneumonia would be unusual.\n\n(Choice C) Epstein-Barr virus causes infectious mononucleosis (malaise, pharyngitis, splenomegaly).\n\n(Choice D) *Escherichia coli* can infect the udders of cows and cause infection of unpasteurized milk, but it is unlikely to cause a febrile illness with retroorbital headaches and pneumonia.\n\n(Choice E) Salmonellosis typically causes a gastrointestinal illness with abdominal cramps and diarrhea.\n\nEducational objective:\nQ fever is a zoonotic infection that occurs in farm workers exposed to waste from cattle and sheep. Its causative agent is *Coxiella burnetii*. A patient with exposure to waste from farm animals who develops a nonspecific illness (myalgias, fatigue, fever [>10 days], retroorbital headache) with a normal leukocyte count, thrombocytopenia, and increased liver enzymes should be evaluated for acute Q fever infection.",
    "zh": "Q热是由贝纳柯克斯体引起的动物源性疾病。人类感染通常通过吸入被动物废物污染的空气中的细菌而发生。Q热有急性和慢性阶段。急性Q热表现为非特异性发热性疾病，发热持续>10天、疲劳和肌痛。严重的、使人衰弱的头痛，通常是眶后痛，并伴有畏光，是常见的症状。肺炎是急性Q热的主要体征之一，最常见的X线异常是肺叶实变。白细胞计数通常正常。其他经典的实验室发现包括肝酶升高和血小板减少。慢性Q热很少见，如果不治疗，通常是致命的，可能发生在有或没有既往有症状的急性感染的患者中，并表现为患有瓣膜疾病的患者的感染性心内膜炎。\n\n（选项A）伯氏疏螺旋体是一种螺旋体，是莱姆病的病原体，通过*Ixodes*蜱的叮咬传播给人类。表现包括游走性红斑（靶型病灶）、伴有头痛和关节痛的发热性疾病，以及中枢神经系统或心脏受累。肺炎是不寻常的。\n\n（选项C）爱泼斯坦-巴尔病毒引起传染性单核细胞增多症（不适、咽炎、脾肿大）。\n\n（选项D）大肠杆菌可以感染奶牛的乳房并引起未巴氏消毒牛奶的感染，但它不太可能引起伴有眶后头痛和肺炎的发热性疾病。\n\n（选项E）沙门氏菌病通常引起伴有腹部绞痛和腹泻的胃肠道疾病。\n\n教育目标：\nQ热是一种动物源性感染，发生在接触牛和羊的废物的农场工人中。其病原体是贝纳柯克斯体。对于接触农场动物废物并出现非特异性疾病（肌痛、疲劳、发热[>10天]、眶后头痛）伴有正常白细胞计数、血小板减少和肝酶升高的患者，应评估其是否患有急性Q热感染。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Q fever, a zoonotic infection caused by Coxiella burnetii, and its characteristic presentation in patients exposed to farm animals.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's occupation (dairy farm worker), symptoms (fever, myalgias, retroorbital headaches, pneumonia), and laboratory findings (thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes). This clinical picture is highly suggestive of acute Q fever.",
