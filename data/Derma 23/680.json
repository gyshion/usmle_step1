    "en": "A 6-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to poor feeding, irritability, and rash. He was well-appearing until 2 days ago, when he developed little interest in drinking and a progressive rash. Physical examination reveals diffuse erythema and desquamation that is most prominent at the neck, axillae, inguinal folds, and perioral region. The perioral area also has crusting and the lips are dry and cracked, but the mucosal membranes are normal. The epidermis easily comes off with gentle pressure at the erythematous areas. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "zh": "一名6个月大的男孩因喂养不良、烦躁和皮疹被带到急诊科。他在2天前表现良好，当时他开始对喝水不感兴趣并出现进行性皮疹。体格检查显示弥漫性红斑和脱屑，最常见于颈部、腋窝、腹股沟褶皱和口周区域。口周区域也有结痂，嘴唇干燥皲裂，但粘膜正常。表皮在红斑区域轻轻按压即可脱落。以下哪项最可能是该患者症状的原因？"

    "en": "This patient's poor feeding, irritability, and desquamating rash are most consistent with STAPHYLOCOCCAL SCALDED SKIN SYNDROME (SSSS), an infection caused by strains of exotoxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus. {{exhibit_1}} Exfoliative toxins act as proteases that cleave desmoglein in desmosomes, which are junctions that adhere epithelial cells together. Skin damage occurs as the exotoxins spread, causing separation of keratinocytes and superficial EPIDERMAL BLISTERING. Gentle pressure causes detachment and shedding of the outer layer of skin (ie, NIKOLSKY SIGN). The rash, although diffusely erythematous and painful (\"scalded\"), is most prominent in the skin folds (eg, neck, axillae, groin). Perioral involvement (eg, erythema, crusting) is common, but the MUCOUS MEMBRANES ARE SPARED. {{exhibit_2}} SSSS is most common in infants and young children, and skin findings are often preceded or accompanied by fever, irritability, malaise, and poor feeding. Treatment includes antistaphylococcal antibiotics (eg, nafcillin, oxacillin). {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} (Choice A) Pemphigus vulgaris is caused by an autoantibody to desmoglein and results in a positive Nikolsky sign and epidermal erosions, blisters, and bullae. This disorder is uncommon in children, and mucous membranes are almost always involved. {{exhibit_5}} (Choice B) Cell-mediated (ie, type IV delayed-type) hypersensitivity, in which sensitized Tₕ1 cells secrete cytokines to attract cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, is responsible for Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Blistering, bullae, and Nikolsky sign may be seen, but mucosal involvement is almost always present. In addition, a preceding trigger (eg, medication, Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection) would be expected. {{exhibit_6}} (Choice C) Lipopolysaccharides (ie, ENDOTOXIN) released into the blood by gram-negative bacteria can cause a severe, widespread inflammatory response (septic shock). Purpuric lesions may occur with gram-negative sepsis, but Nikolsky sign would not be present. (Choice E) Crosslinking of IgE on the cell surface causes mast cell degranulation that is associated with allergic reactions. URTICARIA (hives) appears as itchy, erythematous, blanching papules, not diffuse erythema or desquamation.",
    "zh": "该患者的喂养不良、烦躁和脱屑性皮疹与葡萄球菌烫伤样皮肤综合征 (SSSS) 最为一致，这是一种由产生外毒素的金黄色葡萄球菌菌株引起的感染。{{exhibit_1}} 表皮剥脱毒素充当蛋白酶，切割桥粒中的桥粒蛋白，桥粒是将上皮细胞连接在一起的连接点。随着外毒素的扩散，皮肤损伤发生，导致角质形成细胞分离和表皮浅表水疱。轻微压力会导致表皮外层脱离和脱落（即尼氏征）。皮疹虽然弥漫性红斑且疼痛（“烫伤”），但在皮肤皱褶处（例如，颈部、腋窝、腹股沟）最明显。口周受累（例如，红斑、结痂）很常见，但粘膜通常不受累。{{exhibit_2}} SSSS 在婴儿和幼儿中最常见，皮肤表现通常先于或伴有发烧、烦躁、不适和喂养不良。治疗方法包括抗葡萄球菌抗生素（例如，萘夫西林、草酰西林）。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} （选项 A）寻常型天疱疮是由针对桥粒蛋白的自身抗体引起的，并导致尼氏征阳性和表皮糜烂、水疱和大疱。这种疾病在儿童中不常见，并且几乎总是涉及粘膜。{{exhibit_5}} （选项 B）细胞介导的（即 IV 型迟发型）超敏反应，其中致敏的 Tₕ1 细胞分泌细胞因子以吸引细胞毒性 T 细胞和 NK 细胞，是史蒂文斯-约翰逊综合征和中毒性表皮坏死松解症的原因。可能会出现水疱、大疱和尼氏征，但几乎总是存在粘膜受累。此外，预计会出现先前的诱因（例如，药物、肺炎支原体感染）。{{exhibit_6}} （选项 C）革兰氏阴性菌释放到血液中的脂多糖（即内毒素）可引起严重的、广泛的炎症反应（感染性休克）。革兰氏阴性菌败血症可能出现紫癜性病变，但不会出现尼氏征。（选项 E）IgE 在细胞表面的交联会导致肥大细胞脱颗粒，这与过敏反应有关。荨麻疹（荨麻疹）表现为瘙痒性、红斑性、变白性丘疹，而不是弥漫性红斑或脱屑。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS), focusing on its pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and differentiation from other dermatologic conditions. It assesses the ability to recognize the characteristic findings of SSSS, such as diffuse erythema, desquamation, and a positive Nikolsky sign, and to attribute these to exotoxin-mediated damage by Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully analyzing the patient's age, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Key features to identify include the distribution and nature of the rash, the involvement (or sparing) of mucous membranes, and the presence of signs like epidermal shedding with gentle pressure. Comparing these findings to the typical presentations of the differential diagnoses provided in the options is crucial for arriving at the correct answer.",
