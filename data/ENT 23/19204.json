    "en": "A newborn girl is evaluated in the neonatal intensive care unit for difficulty breathing. The patient was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery. Since birth, she has had difficulty breathing with loud snoring sounds and intermittent oxygen desaturations. She has been unable to breastfeed due to her breathing problems. Breathing improves significantly when the patient is placed in a prone position. On examination, there is a small mandible, posteriorly displaced tongue, and U-shaped cleft palate. The abnormalities described represent an example of which of the following?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a small mandible, posteriorly displaced tongue, and U-shaped cleft palate, which is consistent with PIERRE ROBIN sequence. A sequence occurs when a single developmental defect causes a cascade of additional malformations.\n\nIn Pierre Robin sequence, hypoplasia of the mandibular prominence leads to micrognathia. Severe micrognathia causes posterior displacement of the tongue (glossoptosis), which blocks fusion of the palatine shelves, resulting in a cleft palate that is characteristically U-shaped. Difficulty breathing occurs because the tongue prolapses into the posterior oropharynx, blocking airflow. Breathing improves when the patient is in a prone position because gravity pulls the tongue anteriorly, opening the airway.\n\n(Choice A) An association is a collection of malformations that are often seen together and do not have a known, common cause (eg, VACTERL association).\n\n(Choice B) A disruption occurs when an external insult (rather than a genetic defect) interrupts and arrests normal fetal development (eg, when an amniotic band disrupts limb development). No specific external insult has been linked to Pierre Robin sequence, and most cases result from genetic abnormalities.\n\n(Choice C) Genomic imprinting is a normal process that refers to selective activation of gene expression depending on the parent of origin. Aberrant imprinting occurs with uniparental disomy (ie, when a person receives 2 copies of a chromosome from the same parent and no copy from the other parent). Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome (15q) are examples of conditions caused by dysfunctional imprinting.\n\n(Choice E) A syndrome is a collection of malformations that have a common cause but are not related anatomically. For example, upslanting palpebral fissures, atrioventricular canal defect, and single palmar crease are all due to trisomy 21.\n\nEducational objective:\nPierre Robin is characterized as a sequence because the primary defect (hypoplasia of the mandibular prominence) leads to a cascade of further malformations (ie, micrognathia, posteriorly displaced tongue, U-shaped cleft palate). {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者下颌骨小、舌后移、腭裂呈 U 形，这与 PIERRE ROBIN 序列一致。当单一发育缺陷导致一系列额外的畸形时，就会发生序列。\n\n在 Pierre Robin 序列中，下颌隆突发育不全导致小颌畸形。严重的小颌畸形导致舌后移 (舌下垂)，阻碍腭板融合，导致腭裂特征性地呈 U 形。呼吸困难的发生是因为舌头脱垂到后口咽，阻塞气流。当患者呈俯卧位时，呼吸改善，因为重力将舌头向前拉，打开气道。\n\n(选项 A) 联合是指一组经常一起出现的畸形，但没有已知的共同原因（例如，VACTERL 联合）。\n\n(选项 B) 当外部损伤（而不是基因缺陷）中断并阻止正常的胎儿发育时，就会发生中断（例如，当羊膜带破坏肢体发育时）。没有特定的外部损伤与 Pierre Robin 序列相关联，大多数病例是由基因异常引起的。\n\n(选项 C) 基因组印记是一个正常过程，指的是根据起源亲本选择性激活基因表达。异常印记发生在单亲二体性染色体 (即，当一个人从同一个亲本接收到 2 份染色体，而没有从另一个亲本接收到染色体时)。Prader-Willi 综合征和 Angelman 综合征 (15q) 是由功能失调的印记引起的病症的例子。\n\n(选项 E) 综合征是指一组具有共同原因但解剖学上不相关的畸形。例如，眼睑裂上斜、房室管缺损和单掌纹都归因于 21 三体综合征。\n\n教育目标：\nPierre Robin 的特征是序列，因为主要缺陷（下颌隆突发育不全）导致一系列进一步的畸形（即，小颌畸形、舌后移、U 形腭裂）。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the classification of congenital anomalies, specifically the difference between a sequence, association, disruption, imprinting disorder, and syndrome. It requires recognizing the features of Pierre Robin sequence and understanding that it is a sequence because one primary defect leads to a cascade of other malformations.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key features of Pierre Robin sequence (micrognathia, glossoptosis, cleft palate). Then, recall the definition of a sequence as a cascade of malformations resulting from a single primary defect. Eliminate other options based on their definitions.",
