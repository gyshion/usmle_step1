    "en": "A 68-year-old man with a history of permanent atrial fibrillation comes to the office for follow-up. He has been having symptoms due to ineffective ventricular rate control despite aggressive medical therapy. On examination, the patient's heart rate is 125/min and irregular. ECG shows atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. A catheter-based radiofrequency ablation of the atrioventricular node with placement of a permanent ventricular pacemaker is planned. The ablation tip should be positioned at which of the following locations?",

    "en": "The **atrioventricular (AV) node** controls the rate at which atrial impulses are conducted to the ventricles. In patients with atrial fibrillation, continuous stimulation of the AV node can sometimes lead to a **rapid ventricular rate**, which can cause hemodynamic instability and (if persistent) tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. In order to prevent these complications, patients with a rapid ventricular response sometimes undergo **radiofrequency ablation** of the AV node. The AV node is located on the endocardial surface of the right atrium, near the insertion of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve and the orifice of the coronary sinus {{exhibit_1}}.\n\n(Choices A and D) The isthmus between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid annulus is the site of radiofrequency ablation for atrial flutter. The fossa ovalis is the name given to the foramen ovale (fetal opening between the right and left atria) once it is closed. However, neither option refers to the location of the AV node.\n\n(Choice C) The pulmonary vein ostia are often the origination site of the aberrant electrical activity that triggers atrial fibrillation, and catheter ablation of these trigger sites (pulmonary vein isolation) can be used to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation. However, this patient has already developed permanent atrial fibrillation and is undergoing an ablation procedure involving the AV node.\n\n(Choice E) The sinoatrial node is located in the upper anterior right atrium at the opening of the superior vena cava.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe atrioventricular node is located on the endocardial surface of the right atrium, near the insertion of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve and the orifice of the coronary sinus.",
    "zh": " **房室 (AV) 结**控制心房冲动传导至心室的速率。在心房颤动的患者中，持续刺激房室结有时会导致**快速心室率**，这可能导致血流动力学不稳定，如果持续存在，则可能导致心动过速引起的心肌病。为了预防这些并发症，具有快速室性反应的患者有时会接受房室结的**射频消融术**。房室结位于右心房的心内膜表面，靠近三尖瓣的间隔瓣的插入处和冠状窦的开口处 {{exhibit_1}}。\n\n（选项 A 和 D）下腔静脉和三尖瓣环之间的峡部是射频消融心房扑动的部位。卵圆窝是卵圆孔（右心房和左心房之间的胎儿开口）闭合后的名称。然而，这两个选项都没有提及房室结的位置。\n\n（选项 C）肺静脉口经常是引发心房颤动的异常电活动的起源部位，导管消融这些触发部位（肺静脉隔离）可用于预防复发性心房颤动。然而，该患者已发生永久性心房颤动，并正在接受涉及房室结的消融术。\n\n（选项 E）窦房结位于上腔静脉开口附近右心房前上部。\n\n教育目标：\n房室结位于右心房的心内膜表面，靠近三尖瓣的间隔瓣的插入处和冠状窦的开口处。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cardiac electrophysiology and the anatomical location of the atrioventricular (AV) node, which is crucial for performing AV node ablation.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the anatomical location of the AV node within the heart, specifically its proximity to the tricuspid valve and the coronary sinus. Understanding the purpose of AV node ablation in managing atrial fibrillation is also helpful.",
