    "en": "A 26-year-old man is hospitalized after he was found in the park shouting and laughing to himself. He insists on wearing a cap lined with several layers of aluminum foil and explains that the hat prevents laser beams from reprogramming his mind. For the past 3 years, the patient has been hearing the voices of his deceased mother, the devil, and a world-famous singer. He has had one previous psychiatric hospitalization, during which he responded well to haloperidol. However, the patient stopped the medication shortly after discharge because he did not like the way it made him feel. A decision is made to administer a second-generation antipsychotic medication. Compared with first-generation antipsychotics, this class of medication is associated with which of the following?",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient is experiencing an acute psychotic episode (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized behavior) most likely due to schizophrenia, a chronic psychotic illness with typical onset in young adulthood. His treatment history indicates a good response to the first-generation antipsychotic (FGA) haloperidol but poor adherence, likely because of tolerability issues. As a class, FGAs are associated with a HIGH RISK of EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPSs) due to their potent D2 antagonism. Types of EPS include acute dystonic reactions, drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia (inner restlessness and inability to sit still), and tardive dyskinesia.\n\nSecond-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are often used for first-line treatment in schizophrenia due to their LOWER RISK of EPSs compared with FGAs. However, SGAs are associated with WEIGHT GAIN and METABOLIC EFFECTS, including the development of DIABETES. Side effect profiles of individual SGAs vary; olanzapine and clozapine are associated with the greatest risk of metabolic effects.\n\n(Choice A) FGAs and SGAs appear to be equally effective in the treatment of positive psychotic symptoms.\n\n(Choice B) Both FGAs and SGAs block muscarinic receptors to varying degrees. Low-potency FGAs (eg, chlorpromazine) and the SGAs olanzapine, quetiapine, and clozapine have the greatest risk.\n\n(Choice C) SGAs are less likely to cause tardive dyskinesia than FGAs.\n\n(Choice E) Compared with FGAs, SGAs have a GREATER risk of metabolic adverse effects.\n\n(Choice F) Both FGAs and SGAs have been associated with lowering the seizure threshold. The SGA clozapine, in particular, has been associated with a dose-dependent increase in seizure risk.\n\nEducational objective:\nSecond-generation antipsychotics are associated with a lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects compared with first-generation antipsychotics but may cause adverse metabolic effects.",
    "zh": "该患者正在经历一个急性精神病发作（妄想、幻觉、思维混乱），很可能由于精神分裂症，这是一种典型的在青年期起病的慢性精神病。他的治疗史表明他对第一代抗精神病药（FGA）氟哌啶醇反应良好，但依从性差，这很可能是因为耐受性问题。作为一类药物，由于其强大的D2受体拮抗作用，FGA与锥体外系症状（EPSs）的高风险相关。EPS的类型包括急性肌张力障碍反应、药物引起的帕金森病、静坐不能（内心烦躁不安且无法静坐）和迟发性运动障碍。\n\n二代抗精神病药（SGAs）常用于精神分裂症的一线治疗，因为它们与FGA相比，EPS的风险较低。然而，SGAs与体重增加和代谢影响有关，包括糖尿病的发生。单个SGAs的副作用特征各不相同；奥氮平和氯氮平与代谢影响的风险最高。\n\n(选项 A) FGA和SGA在治疗阳性精神病症状方面似乎同样有效。\n\n(选项 B) FGA和SGA均以不同程度阻断毒蕈碱受体。低效FGA（例如，氯丙嗪）和SGA奥氮平、喹硫平和氯氮平的风险最高。\n\n(选项 C) 与FGA相比，SGA引起迟发性运动障碍的可能性较小。\n\n(选项 E) 与FGA相比，SGA具有更大的代谢不良反应风险。\n\n(选项 F) FGA和SGA均与降低癫痫发作阈值有关。特别是，SGA氯氮平与剂量依赖性癫痫发作风险增加有关。\n\n教育目标：\n与第一代抗精神病药相比，第二代抗精神病药与锥体外系副作用的风险较低，但可能引起不良代谢影响。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the comparative side effect profiles of first-generation and second-generation antipsychotic medications, specifically focusing on extrapyramidal symptoms and metabolic effects.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall the key differences in adverse effects between FGAs and SGAs, recognizing that SGAs generally have a lower risk of EPSs like acute dystonia, but a higher risk of metabolic complications.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试对第一代和第二代抗精神病药物的比较副作用特征的理解，特别是侧重于锥体外系症状和代谢影响。\n\n为了解决这个问题，必须回忆FGA和SGA之间不良反应的关键区别，认识到SGA通常具有较低的EPS（如急性肌张力障碍）风险，但代谢并发症的风险较高。"
