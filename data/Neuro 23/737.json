    "en": "The patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of meningitis, including fever, headache, confusion, nuchal rigidity, and an elevated white blood cell count with a left shift. The Gram stain of cerebrospinal fluid revealing gram-negative cocci in pairs is highly suggestive of Neisseria meningitidis. \n\nPathogenesis of Neisseria meningitidis: Neisseria meningitidis is a life-threatening infection that classically presents with the triad of fever, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental state. Most cases are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (gram-positive coccus) and Neisseria meningitidis (gram-negative diplococcus). These pathogens are transmitted via aerosolized droplets and are able to colonize the nasopharynx due to the presence of specialized surface components (eg, fimbriae, pili). Colonization usually leads to an asymptomatic carrier state, but in a minority of patients (~0.2%), the bacteria penetrate the epithelium and enter the bloodstream. Intravascular survival is dependent on capsular polysaccharides, which allow the bacteria to evade destruction by the alternative complement system. Meningitis occurs when the bacteria penetrate the cerebral capillary endothelium or the choroid plexus, the location of blood-CSF barrier.\n\n(Choice A) Haemophilus influenzae and S pneumoniae can rarely spread into the meninges from a middle ear infection. However, an ear infection is very uncommon cause of meningitis.\n\n(Choice C) Spread from the pharynx through the nasal lymphatics to the subarachnoid space may contribute to some cases of bacterial meningitis. However, this route is thought to be far less common than bloodstream invasion with subsequent hematogenous spread.\n\n(Choice D) Infections of the lung (eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, S pneumoniae) can lead to bacteremia and meningitis. However, N meningitidis does not usually colonize or infect the lung.\n\n(Choice E) Traumatic brain injury can lead to CSF leaks, with subsequent infection of the central nervous system. This is particularly common in the setting of basilar skull fracture. S pneumoniae (gram-positive cocci in pairs) is the most common organism.\n\nEducational objective:\nNeisseria meningitidis is transmitted primarily by aerosolized droplets and subsequently colonizes the nasopharyngeal epithelium. Penetration of the epithelium can lead to bloodstream infection. Spread to the meninges occurs via transcellular penetration of the cerebral capillary endothelium or entry at the choroid plexus.",
    "zh": "患者出现提示脑膜炎的症状和体征，包括发烧、头痛、意识模糊、颈部强直以及白细胞计数升高伴核左移。脑脊液的革兰染色显示成对革兰阴性球菌高度提示脑膜炎奈瑟菌。\n\n脑膜炎奈瑟菌的病理生理学：脑膜炎奈瑟菌是一种危及生命的感染，典型的表现是发烧、颈部强直和精神状态改变的三联征。大多数病例由肺炎链球菌（革兰阳性球菌）和脑膜炎奈瑟菌（革兰阴性双球菌）引起。这些病原体通过气溶胶飞沫传播，并且由于存在特殊的表面成分（例如，纤毛、菌毛）而能够定植于鼻咽部。定植通常会导致无症状的携带状态，但在少数患者（约0.2%）中，细菌穿透上皮细胞并进入血液。血管内生存取决于荚膜多糖，这使得细菌能够逃避替代补体系统的破坏。当细菌穿透脑毛细血管内皮细胞或脉络丛（脑-CSF屏障的位置）时，会发生脑膜炎。\n\n(选项A) 嗜血杆菌和肺炎链球菌极少数情况下会从中耳感染扩散到脑膜。然而，耳部感染是脑膜炎的非常不常见的原因。\n\n(选项C) 细菌从咽部通过鼻淋巴系统扩散到蛛网膜下腔可能会导致某些细菌性脑膜炎病例。然而，人们认为这条途径不如通过血流入侵并随后血源性传播常见。\n\n(选项D) 肺部感染（例如，结核分枝杆菌、肺炎链球菌）可导致菌血症和脑膜炎。然而，脑膜炎奈瑟菌通常不会定植或感染肺部。\n\n(选项E) 颅脑外伤可导致脑脊液渗漏，随后中枢神经系统感染。这在颅底骨折的情况下尤其常见。肺炎链球菌（成对革兰阳性球菌）是最常见的病原体。\n\n教育目标：\n脑膜炎奈瑟菌主要通过气溶胶飞沫传播，随后定植于鼻咽部上皮细胞。穿透上皮细胞可导致血流感染。扩散到脑膜通过脑毛细血管内皮细胞的细胞间穿透或在脉络丛进入。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathogenesis of Neisseria meningitidis, specifically how it invades the central nervous system to cause meningitis. It requires knowledge of common routes of infection for bacterial meningitis and the typical pathways of bacterial spread from colonization to the meninges.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the likely causative organism based on the Gram stain and clinical presentation. Then, recall or deduce the most common route of hematogenous spread for this organism, which involves colonization of the nasopharynx, entry into the bloodstream, and subsequent penetration of the blood-brain barrier, often via the choroid plexus.",
