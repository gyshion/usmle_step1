    "en": "A 33-year-old woman with a 9-year history of ulcerative colitis comes to the office due to concern about her risk of colon cancer. One of her close family friends died recently from this cancer. The patient wants to \"undergo all the tests for colon cancer.\" She has no other comorbid conditions and is under the care of a gastroenterologist who has kept her disease well controlled with sulfasalazine. Compared with sporadic colorectal carcinoma, colorectal malignancy arising in this patient would more likely exhibit which of the following features?",

    "en": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a significant risk for colorectal carcinoma (CRC); up to 30% of patients with IBD develop CRC in their lifetime. Patients with ulcerative colitis, particularly pancolitis, are at highest risk. Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CA-CRC) occurs in areas of chronic inflammation, and the risk is proportionate to the duration and severity of inflammation.\n\n(Choices A, B, and D) Unlike sporadic CRC, which typically progresses slowly from a singular dysplastic polyp, CA-CRC is typically more aggressive, often evolves from flat (nonpolypoid) lesions, and is frequently multifocal (ie, multiple synchronous carcinomas) at diagnosis. CA-CRC often affects a younger population than sporadic CRC. These malignancies are more likely to have a higher histopathologic grade, with poorly differentiated or anaplastic cells and a high number of mucinous or signet ring cells. The molecular pathogenesis of CA-CRC is also different than that of sporadic disease, with p53 mutations occurring early in the course of malignant development and APC mutations occurring much later.\n\nGiven the high risk for CRC and the difficulty of colonoscopic visualization of flat or multifocal lesions, it is important to regularly monitor IBD via colonoscopy with random biopsies.\n\nEducational objective:\nInflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcerative pancolitis, is associated with a significant risk for colorectal carcinoma. Compared with sporadic colorectal cancer, colitis-associated colorectal cancer is more likely to occur at a younger age, is typically more aggressive with a higher histopathologic grade, often evolves from flat (nonpolypoid) lesions, and is frequently multifocal. Patients should be monitored regularly via colonoscopy with random biopsies.",
    "zh": "炎症性肠病(IBD)与结直肠癌(CRC)的风险显著相关；多达30%的IBD患者在其一生中会患上CRC。溃疡性结肠炎患者，尤其是全结肠炎患者，风险最高。结肠炎相关性结直肠癌(CA-CRC)发生在慢性炎症区域，其风险与炎症的持续时间和严重程度成正比。\n\n（选项A、B和D）与散发性CRC不同，后者通常从单个发育不良息肉缓慢进展，CA-CRC通常更具侵袭性，通常由扁平（非息肉样）病变发展而来，并且在诊断时经常呈多灶性（即，多个同步癌）。CA-CRC比散发性CRC更常影响年轻人群。这些恶性肿瘤更有可能具有更高的组织病理学分级，具有分化不良或间变细胞以及大量黏蛋白或印戒细胞。CA-CRC的分子发病机制也与散发性疾病不同，p53突变发生在恶性肿瘤发展的早期，而APC突变发生在晚期。\n\n鉴于CRC的高风险以及结肠镜下难以观察扁平或多灶性病变，定期通过结肠镜检查和随机活检监测IBD非常重要。\n\n教育目标：\n炎症性肠病，尤其是溃疡性全结肠炎，与结直肠癌的风险显著相关。与散发性结直肠癌相比，结肠炎相关性结直肠癌更可能发生在较年轻的年龄，通常更具侵袭性，具有更高的组织病理学分级，通常由扁平（非息肉样）病变发展而来，并且经常呈多灶性。患者应定期通过结肠镜检查和随机活检进行监测。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the differences between colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CA-CRC) and sporadic colorectal cancer, focusing on risk factors, pathogenesis, and clinical features. CA-CRC is more common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease like ulcerative colitis.\n\nTo answer this question, recall that CA-CRC is more aggressive, often multifocal, arises from flat lesions, and has a different molecular pathogenesis compared to sporadic CRC. Therefore, multifocal origin is the most likely feature in this patient.",
