    "en": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to repeated vomiting that began 2 hours ago. His vomit is dark brown and has a granular consistency. The patient has a history of dyspepsia, for which he takes over-the-counter antacids as needed and degenerative knee arthritis, for which he takes naproxen regularly. He drinks 2-3 beers daily. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 114/62 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 14/min. Physical examination reveals mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound or guarding. Hemoglobin is 9 g/dL. Endoscopy shows a deep, bleeding ulcer on the posterior wall of the duodenal bulb.",

    "en": "Bleeding peptic ulcer disease should be considered in patients who develop acute epigastric pain, unstable vital signs, or hematemesis, particularly in the setting of prior dyspepsia. Most peptic ulcers are caused by *Helicobacter pylori* infection or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use; other risk factors include smoking, older age, and glucocorticoid use.\n\nDuodenal ulcers are more common than gastric ulcers and tend to occur anteriorly. Ulcers located on the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb are more prone to perforation; those on the posterior wall are more likely to cause hemorrhage. These complications are explained by the relationship of the duodenal bulb to adjacent organs. The duodenal bulb is approximately 5 cm long, beginning at the pylorus and ending at the neck of the gallbladder. The gallbladder and liver lie anterior to the duodenal bulb within the intraperitoneal space; the gastroduodenal artery, common biliary duct, and portal vein are posterior to the bulb; and the head of the pancreas is located inferiorly. When an ulcer penetrates the posterior duodenal wall, it is likely to erode into the gastroduodenal artery, which perfuses both the pylorus and the proximal part of the duodenum. Damage to the gastroduodenal artery can cause significant UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING.\n\n(Choice A) The common hepatic artery arises from the celiac trunk and bifurcates into the proper hepatic and gastroduodenal arteries. It passes superior to the duodenal bulb.\n\n(Choice C) The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery is a branch of the superior mesenteric artery. It supplies blood to the lower duodenum and to the head of the pancreas. This artery has no close relation to the duodenal bulb.\n\n(Choices D, E, and F) The left gastroepiploic and right gastric arteries supply blood to the greater and lesser curves of the stomach, respectively. The short gastric arteries arise off the splenic artery and supply the upper portions of the greater curvature. These vessels do not lie in close proximity to the duodenal bulb.\n\n(Choice G) The superior mesenteric artery lies anterior to the transverse part of the duodenum. It arises from the anterior surface of the abdominal aorta and supplies the intestine from the duodenum to the proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe gastroduodenal artery lies along the posterior wall of the duodenal bulb and is likely to be eroded by posterior duodenal ulcers. Ulceration into the gastroduodenal artery can be a source of life-threatening hemorrhage. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "在出现急性上腹痛、生命体征不稳定或呕血的患者中，应考虑出血性消化性溃疡病，尤其是有消化不良病史的患者。大多数消化性溃疡是由*幽门螺杆菌*感染或使用非甾体类抗炎药引起的；其他危险因素包括吸烟、高龄和使用糖皮质激素。\n\n十二指肠溃疡比胃溃疡更常见，并且倾向于发生在前面。位于十二指肠球前壁的溃疡更容易发生穿孔；位于后壁的溃疡更容易引起出血。这些并发症可以通过十二指肠球与邻近器官的关系来解释。十二指肠球大约5厘米长，从幽门开始，到胆囊颈结束。胆囊和肝脏位于十二指肠球的前方，位于腹膜腔内；胃十二指肠动脉、胆总管和门静脉位于球的后方；胰头位于下方。当溃疡穿透十二指肠后壁时，很可能侵蚀到胃十二指肠动脉，该动脉灌注幽门和十二指肠近端。胃十二指肠动脉的损伤可引起严重的上消化道出血。\n\n(选项A) 肝总动脉源自腹腔干，并分支成肝固有动脉和胃十二指肠动脉。它通过十二指肠球的上方。\n\n(选项C) 胰十二指肠下动脉是肠系膜上动脉的分支。它为十二指肠下部和胰头供血。这条动脉与十二指肠球没有密切关系。\n\n(选项D、E和F) 胃网膜左动脉和胃右动脉分别向胃的大弯和胃的小弯供血。胃短动脉发自脾动脉，并向胃大弯的上方供血。这些血管不在十二指肠球附近。\n\n(选项G) 肠系膜上动脉位于十二指肠横部的前方。它起源于腹主动脉的前表面，并为从十二指肠到横结肠近三分之二的肠道供血。\n\n教育目标：\n胃十二指肠动脉沿着十二指肠球的后壁，很可能被后十二指肠溃疡侵蚀。溃疡侵入胃十二指肠动脉可能是危及生命的出血的来源。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}"
