    "en": "A healthy, nulliparous 29-year-old woman with regular 28-day cycles comes to the office for a fertility evaluation. Over the past year, she and her 30-year-old husband have been trying to conceive. Her only medications are prenatal vitamins. She tracks her periods, cervical mucus, basal temperature, and intercourse with a smartphone app. The couple has intercourse every other day from cycle day 8 through the LH surge. The patient's urine pregnancy test is positive. The oocyte was most likely arrested in which of the following stages of meiosis immediately prior to fertilization?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is B. Oogenesis begins in utero at approximately 4 weeks gestation when primordial germ cells migrate from the yolk sac region to the developing gonadal region. These germ cells then differentiate into oogonia and multiply by mitosis before beginning meiosis I. Now called primary oocytes, these cells arrest in prophase of meiosis I (Choice C) and remain there until ovulation. The chromosome pairs are arranged in a tetrad during this phase, and their proximity allows for genetic recombination. The full complement of oocytes is developed by 5 months gestation and then degenerates during the woman's lifetime until depleted at menopause.\n\nAt puberty, ovulatory cycles begin and the female is capable of reproduction. During each menstrual cycle, FSH stimulation followed by an LH surge causes some oocytes to resume meiosis I. Telophase I (Choice E) is the last phase of meiosis I and yields secondary oocytes and polar bodies. The secondary oocyte begins meiosis II (the polar body degenerates) but halts in metaphase II. Approximately 36 hours after LH levels begin to rise, a secondary oocyte is released from the ovarian follicle. The secondary oocyte remains frozen in metaphase II until fertilization occurs, at which point it completes its division (telophase II, Choice F) and second polar body. A normally fertilized embryo is then diploid due to genetic contribution from both the ovum and sperm pronuclei.\n\n(Choice A) Metaphase of meiosis I differs from metaphase of meiosis II, as the spindles are not preparing to split the centromeres. Instead, the tetrads are lined up at the metaphase plate, and during anaphase the homologs separate from each other with the centromeres intact.\n\n(Choice D) Prophase of meiosis II is unique as it does not immediately follow a period of DNA synthesis; DNA was duplicated prior to prophase of meiosis I.\n\nEducational objective: Primary oocytes are completely developed in female fetuses by the fifth month of gestation, at which point they are arrested in prophase of meiosis I. After puberty, menstrual cycle hormones stimulate the primary oocyte to resume differentiation. Prior to fertilization, secondary oocytes are arrested in metaphase of meiosis II.",
    "zh": "正确答案是B。卵子发生始于子宫内，大约在妊娠4周时，原始生殖细胞从卵黄囊区域迁移到发育中的性腺区域。这些生殖细胞随后分化成卵原细胞，并通过有丝分裂增殖，然后开始减数分裂I。现在称为初级卵母细胞，这些细胞停滞在减数分裂I的前期（选项C），并一直停留在那里直到排卵。在此阶段，染色体对排列成四分体，它们的邻近性允许基因重组。完整的卵母细胞组在妊娠5个月时发育完成，然后在女性一生中退化，直到绝经时耗尽。\n\n青春期开始时，排卵周期开始，女性具有生殖能力。在每个月经周期中，FSH刺激后跟随LH峰值，导致一些卵母细胞恢复减数分裂I。末期I（选项E）是减数分裂I的最后阶段，产生次级卵母细胞和极体。次级卵母细胞开始减数分裂II（极体退化），但停滞在中期II。在LH水平开始升高后大约36小时，一个次级卵母细胞从卵泡中释放出来。次级卵母细胞保持停滞在中期II，直到受精发生，此时它完成分裂（末期II，选项F）和第二个极体。正常的受精胚胎由于来自卵子和精子原核的遗传贡献而成为二倍体。\n\n（选项A）减数分裂I的中期与减数分裂II的中期不同，因为纺锤体没有准备好分裂着丝粒。相反，四分体排列在中期板上，在后期，同源物彼此分离，着丝粒保持完整。\n\n（选项D）减数分裂II的前期是独特的，因为它没有立即跟随DNA合成期； DNA在减数分裂I的前期之前被复制。\n\n教育目标：初级卵母细胞在女性胎儿妊娠第五个月时完全发育，此时它们停滞在减数分裂I的前期。青春期后，月经周期激素刺激初级卵母细胞恢复分化。在受精之前，次级卵母细胞停滞在减数分裂II的中期。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the stages of oogenesis and the specific meiotic arrest points of the oocyte prior to fertilization. It requires knowledge of the hormonal regulation and timing of these events throughout a woman's reproductive life.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall the process of oogenesis, specifically the stages of meiosis and where the oocyte arrests during its development. The key is to identify that the secondary oocyte, released at ovulation, is arrested in metaphase II and only completes meiosis upon fertilization.",
    "zh": "这道题考察了对卵子发生阶段以及受精前卵母细胞的特定减数分裂停滞点的理解。它需要了解这些事件在女性生殖生命周期中的激素调节和时间安排。\n\n为了解决这个问题，必须回忆卵子发生的过程，特别是减数分裂的阶段以及卵母细胞在其发育过程中停滞的位置。关键是要确定在排卵时释放的次级卵母细胞停滞在中期II，并且只有在受精后才完成减数分裂。"
