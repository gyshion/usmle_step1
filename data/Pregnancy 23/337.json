    "en": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the office at 28 weeks gestation due to dyspnea. She has been feeling short of breath when she is supine but has no other symptoms. The patient has had no prenatal care during her pregnancy. She has a history of epilepsy that is well-controlled with medication. She lives with her husband and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Her immunizations are up to date, and she has no allergies. Physical examination shows a uterine size that is larger than expected for gestational age. Sonographic assessment shows markedly elevated amniotic fluid levels.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Polyhydramnios is the excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid. Moderate-to-severe polyhydramnios causes uterine enlargement (eg, increased abdominal circumference) out of proportion to gestational age. Potential complications include preterm labor, placental abruption, and uterine atony due to uterine overdistention. Polyhydramnios also increases the risk of MATERNAL RESPIRATORY COMPROMISE as the abdominal cavity impairs lung expansion.\n\nPolyhydramnios can be due to decreased fetal swallowing or increased fetal urination. Fetal anomalies associated with IMPAIRED SWALLOWING include GASTROINTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION (eg, duodenal, esophageal, or intestinal atresia) and ANENCEPHALY (a defect of the cranial neural tube). Causes of INCREASED FETAL URINATION include high cardiac output due to anemia or twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. MATERNAL DIABETES and MULTIPLE GESTATIONS tend to cause milder polyhydramnios compared to the aforementioned major fetal anomalies.\n\nThis patient's prenatal use of anti-epileptic therapy (eg, valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is a substantial risk factor for fetal neural tube defects such as anencephaly. Like anencephaly, SPINA BIFIDA (Choice F) is a group of neural tube defects (eg, occulta, meningocele, myelomeningocele) that can result from maternal folic acid deficiency and use of folic acid antagonists (anti-epileptic drugs, trimethoprim). However, spina bifida occulta, the mildest form, is not associated with polyhydramnios as fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid remains normal.\n\n(Choice B) Atrial septal defects (ASDs) are one of the most common congenital heart diseases. ASDs are usually asymptomatic in utero. The diagnosis is usually made after birth based on wide fixed splitting of S2 on physical examination. ASDs are not associated with polyhydramnios.\n\n(Choices C, D, and E) Renal agenesis is associated with severe OLIGOHYDRAMNIOS (too little amniotic fluid) after 16 weeks of gestation when the majority of the amniotic fluid is derived from fetal urine. Posterior urethral valves in male fetuses can also result in decreased fetal urine output and oligohydramnios. Pulmonary hypoplasia is a consequence of oligohydramnios and is not associated with polyhydramnios.\n\nEducational objective:\nPolyhydramnios (excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid) presents with increased abdominal circumference out of proportion to gestational age. The etiology is decreased fetal swallowing or increased fetal urination. Fetal anomalies associated with impaired swallowing include gastrointestinal obstruction (eg, duodenal, esophageal, or intestinal atresia) and anencephaly.",
    "zh": "羊水过多是羊水过度积聚。中度至重度羊水过多会导致子宫增大（例如，腹围增加）与孕周不符。潜在并发症包括早产、胎盘早剥和子宫收缩乏力，原因是子宫过度膨胀。羊水过多也会增加孕妇呼吸功能受损的风险，因为腹腔会妨碍肺的扩张。\n\n羊水过多可能是由于胎儿吞咽减少或胎儿排尿增加所致。与吞咽障碍相关的胎儿异常包括胃肠道梗阻（例如，十二指肠、食道或肠闭锁）和无脑畸形（颅神经管的缺陷）。胎儿排尿增加的原因包括贫血或双胎输血综合征导致的高心输出量。与上述主要胎儿异常相比，孕妇糖尿病和多胎妊娠往往导致轻度羊水过多。\n\n该患者产前使用抗癫痫治疗（例如，丙戊酸、卡马西平、苯妥英钠）是发生无脑畸形等胎儿神经管缺陷的重要危险因素。与无脑畸形一样，隐性脊柱裂（选项F）是一组神经管缺陷（例如，隐性脊柱裂、脑膜膨出、脊髓脊膜膨出），其可能由孕妇叶酸缺乏症和使用叶酸拮抗剂（抗癫痫药物、甲氧苄氨嘧啶）引起。然而，隐性脊柱裂是最轻微的形式，与羊水过多无关，因为胎儿对羊水的吞咽仍然正常。\n\n（选项B）房间隔缺损 (ASD) 是最常见的先天性心脏病之一。ASD 在子宫内通常无症状。诊断通常是在出生后根据体格检查中S2的广泛固定分裂来确定。ASD 与羊水过多无关。\n\n（选项C、D和E）肾发育不全与妊娠16周后严重的羊水过少（羊水过少）有关，此时大部分羊水来自胎儿尿液。男性胎儿的后尿道瓣膜也可能导致胎儿尿量减少和羊水过少。肺发育不全是羊水过少的后果，与羊水过多无关。\n\n教学目标：\n羊水过多（羊水过度积聚）表现为腹围增加与孕周不符。病因是胎儿吞咽减少或胎儿排尿增加。与吞咽障碍相关的胎儿异常包括胃肠道梗阻（例如，十二指肠、食道或肠闭锁）和无脑畸形。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the causes of polyhydramnios, specifically focusing on fetal anomalies that lead to either decreased fetal swallowing or increased fetal urination. It also highlights the association between maternal anti-epileptic drug use and neural tube defects.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall the pathophysiology of amniotic fluid regulation and identify fetal conditions that disrupt this balance. The patient's history of anti-epileptic medication use is a crucial clue pointing towards neural tube defects, which are a significant cause of polyhydramnios.",
