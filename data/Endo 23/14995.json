    "en": "A 29-year-old woman comes to the office due to increased hair loss. She delivered a healthy baby boy 8 months ago and has not felt the same since. The patient has fatigue and decreased libido, and her menstrual cycles have not returned. She has no prior medical problems and no drug allergies. The patient takes a multivitamin and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. There is no significant family history. Blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg and pulse is 58/min. Physical examination shows diffuse alopecia and thickened, brittle nails. The thyroid is nontender. Laboratory results show decreased serum TSH and free thyroxine (T4) levels.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has hypothyroidism manifesting as fatigue, hair loss, and brittle nails with a low serum thyroxine (T4) level. The low TSH confirms that this is due to hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (ie, central/secondary hypothyroidism) rather than a primary thyroid disorder, which would cause a compensatory rise in TSH. Central hypothyroidism is much less common than primary hypothyroidism. However, when it occurs, other hypothalamic-pituitary systems may be affected and patients may develop deficiencies of other pituitary hormones (eg, low gonadotropin levels leading to amenorrhea).\n\nThe causes of central hypothyroidism are the same as those of hypopituitarism in general. Sheehan syndrome is ischemic necrosis of the pituitary gland and is typically caused by systemic hypotension during delivery. During pregnancy, the pituitary gland enlarges due to estrogen-induced hyperplasia of lactotrophs, but the blood supply does not increase proportionally. Subsequent peripartum hemorrhage with hypotension can cause underperfusion of the pituitary gland with subsequent ischemic injury.\n\n(Choices A and C) Chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. Postpartum thyroiditis is a variant of Hashimoto thyroiditis that occurs within a year of pregnancy. These disorders cause primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH levels.\n\n(Choice B) Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder caused by activating antibodies against the TSH receptor. It presents with elevated T4 and suppressed TSH levels, typically with a goiter and ocular manifestations (eg, proptosis, lid lag).\n\n(Choice D) Secondary (central) hyperthyroidism is a rare disorder, usually caused by a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. Both TSH and serum T4 levels are elevated.\n\n(Choice F) Subacute granulomatous (de Quervain) thyroiditis causes a painful goiter and transient hyperthyroid symptoms; it typically follows a viral syndrome.\n\nEducational objective: Central hypothyroidism is characterized by low serum TSH and thyroxine (T4) levels and is due to hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. Sheehan syndrome is ischemic necrosis of the pituitary gland and is typically caused by systemic hypotension during delivery. In addition to central hypothyroidism, patients may also develop deficiencies of other pituitary hormones (eg, ACTH, prolactin, gonadotropins).",
    "zh": "该患者表现为疲劳、脱发和指甲易脆的甲状腺功能减退，血清甲状腺素(T4)水平低。TSH低证实这与下丘脑-垂体功能障碍(即，中枢性/继发性甲状腺功能减退症)有关，而不是原发性甲状腺疾病，后者会导致TSH代偿性升高。中枢性甲状腺功能减退症比原发性甲状腺功能减退症少见。然而，当它发生时，其他下丘脑-垂体系统可能受到影响，患者可能会出现其他垂体激素的缺乏(例如，促性腺激素水平低导致闭经)。\n\n中枢性甲状腺功能减退症的病因与一般性垂体功能减退症的病因相同。Sheehan综合征是垂体坏死，通常由分娩期间的全身性低血压引起。在怀孕期间，垂体因雌激素诱导的泌乳细胞增生而增大，但血液供应并未成比例增加。随后的产后出血伴低血压可导致垂体灌注不足，进而引起缺血性损伤。\n\n(选项A和C) 慢性自身免疫性(桥本)甲状腺炎是甲状腺功能减退症最常见的原因。产后甲状腺炎是桥本甲状腺炎的一种变异，发生在妊娠一年内。这些疾病导致原发性甲状腺功能减退症，TSH水平升高。\n\n(选项B) Graves病是一种自身免疫性疾病，由针对TSH受体的活化抗体引起。其表现为T4升高和TSH水平降低，通常伴有甲状腺肿和眼部表现(例如，眼球突出、眼睑滞后)。\n\n(选项D) 继发性(中枢性)甲状腺功能亢进是一种罕见疾病，通常由分泌TSH的垂体腺瘤引起。TSH和血清T4水平均升高。\n\n(选项F) 亚急性肉芽肿性(de Quervain)甲状腺炎会导致甲状腺疼痛和短暂的甲状腺功能亢进症状；它通常继发于病毒综合征。\n\n教育目标：中枢性甲状腺功能减退症的特征是血清TSH和甲状腺素(T4)水平低，并且是由下丘脑-垂体功能障碍引起的。 Sheehan综合征是垂体缺血性坏死，通常由分娩期间的全身性低血压引起。 除了中枢性甲状腺功能减退症外，患者还可能出现其他垂体激素(例如，ACTH、催乳素、促性腺激素)的缺乏。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of secondary hypothyroidism, specifically Sheehan syndrome, and its presentation following postpartum hemorrhage. The key is to recognize the low TSH and T4 levels, indicating a central cause of hypothyroidism, and the history of recent pregnancy with potential complications.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's postpartum status and symptoms of hypothyroidism. Rule out primary thyroid disorders based on the TSH level. Recognize that Sheehan syndrome is a cause of secondary hypothyroidism due to pituitary ischemia following postpartum hemorrhage.",
    "zh": "此题考察对继发性甲状腺功能减退症的了解，特别是Sheehan综合征及其在产后出血后的表现。关键是认识到TSH和T4水平低，表明甲状腺功能减退症的中枢性原因，以及近期妊娠史和潜在并发症。\n\n要解决这个问题，请考虑患者的产后状况和甲状腺功能减退症的症状。根据TSH水平排除原发性甲状腺疾病。认识到Sheehan综合征是继发性甲状腺功能减退症的原因，是由于产后出血后垂体缺血所致。"
