  "explanation": {
    "en": "The assessment of an arterial blood gas follows a stepwise process:\n\n1. Evaluate the pH (normal: 7.4): A value <7.35 signifies acidosis whereas a value >7.45 indicates alkalosis. This patient has an arterial blood pH of 7.22, which is consistent with acidosis.\n\n2. Identify the primary process: Differentiate respiratory from metabolic processes by determining the PaCO₂ (normal: 40) and HCO₃⁻ (normal: 24).\n\n*   Respiratory acidosis occurs due to the retention of CO₂ in the lungs and presents with a low pH and a high PaCO₂.\n*   Metabolic acidosis develops due to depletion of HCO₃⁻ and is characterized by a low pH and a low HCO₃⁻.\n\nThis patient has a pH of 7.22 (low) and a PaCO₂ of 60 mm Hg (high), which is consistent with respiratory acidosis.\n\n3. Identify compensation: Because increased PaCO₂ leads to an increased hydrogen ion concentration in the body, the kidneys begin to compensate by increasing resorption of HCO₃⁻ to help buffer the excess acid. The renal compensation begins after several hours and takes several days to complete. After approximately 72 hours, the expected compensatory increase in HCO₃⁻ is approximately 4 mEq/L for every 10 mm Hg elevation in PaCO₂.\n\nThis patient has a HCO₃⁻ of 24 mEq/L, which is normal and indicates respiratory acidosis without compensation. Causes of respiratory acidosis without compensation include any disorder that causes ACUTE HYPOVENTILATION (eg, opioid overdose with depression of respiratory drive).\n\n(Choices A and E) Metabolic acidosis is indicated by low pH and low serum HCO₃⁻. The respiratory compensation involves hyperventilation to breathe off CO₂ and help increase pH. Respiratory compensation for metabolic disturbances begins right away and is usually maximized within hours; therefore, full (or nearly full) compensation is expected in both the acute and chronic setting unless the patient's breathing is compromised.\n\n(Choice B) Metabolic alkalosis is indicated by high pH and high HCO₃⁻. The respiratory compensation involves hypoventilation to retain CO₂ and decrease pH.\n\n(Choice C) This patient's low pH and high PaCO₂ are consistent with respiratory acidosis, but the normal HCO₃⁻ indicates that renal compensation has not yet occurred.\n\n(Choice D) Respiratory alkalosis is indicated by high pH and low PaCO₂. The metabolic compensation involves increased HCO₃⁻ excretion by the kidneys to help decrease pH and requires approximately 72 hours to complete. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "动脉血气分析的评估遵循一个逐步的过程：\n\n1. 评估pH值（正常值：7.4）：pH值<7.35表示酸中毒，而pH值>7.45表示碱中毒。该患者的动脉血pH值为7.22，与酸中毒一致。\n\n2. 确定主要过程：通过测定PaCO₂（正常值：40）和HCO₃⁻（正常值：24）来区分呼吸性过程和代谢性过程。\n\n*   呼吸性酸中毒是由于肺部CO₂潴留引起的，表现为pH值低和PaCO₂高。\n*   代谢性酸中毒是由于HCO₃⁻耗竭引起的，其特征是pH值低和HCO₃⁻低。\n\n该患者pH值为7.22（低），PaCO₂为60 mmHg（高），这与呼吸性酸中毒一致。\n\n3. 确定代偿：由于PaCO₂升高导致体内氢离子浓度升高，肾脏开始通过增加HCO₃⁻的重吸收来代偿，以帮助缓冲过多的酸。肾脏代偿在数小时后开始，需要数天才能完成。大约72小时后，预计HCO₃⁻的代偿性增加约为每10 mmHg PaCO₂升高4 mEq/L。\n\n该患者的HCO₃⁻为24 mEq/L，属于正常范围，表明未代偿的呼吸性酸中毒。未代偿的呼吸性酸中毒的原因包括任何引起急性通气不足的疾病（例如，阿片类药物过量导致呼吸驱动抑制）。\n\n（选项A和E）代谢性酸中毒的特征是pH值低和血清HCO₃⁻低。呼吸代偿涉及过度通气以呼出CO₂并帮助提高pH值。代谢性紊乱的呼吸代偿立即开始，通常在数小时内达到最大；因此，除非患者的呼吸受到损害，否则在急性和慢性情况下都预计会完全（或几乎完全）代偿。\n\n（选项B）代谢性碱中毒的特征是pH值高和HCO₃⁻高。呼吸代偿涉及通气不足以潴留CO₂并降低pH值。\n\n（选项C）该患者的低pH值和高PaCO₂与呼吸性酸中毒一致，但正常的HCO₃⁻表明肾脏代偿尚未发生。\n\n（选项D）呼吸性碱中毒的特征是pH值高和PaCO₂低。代谢代偿涉及肾脏增加HCO₃⁻的排泄以帮助降低pH值，这大约需要72小时才能完成。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the interpretation of arterial blood gas (ABG) results to determine the acid-base status of a patient, specifically focusing on identifying uncompensated respiratory acidosis. It requires knowledge of normal ABG values and the physiological mechanisms of respiratory and metabolic compensation. \n\nTo solve this question, first assess the pH to determine if the patient is acidemic or alkalemic. Then, evaluate the PaCO2 and HCO3- levels to identify the primary disturbance (respiratory or metabolic). Finally, assess whether compensation has occurred by examining the level of the non-primary component.",
