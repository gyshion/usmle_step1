    "en": "A study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a new drug, KM28. The study will compare KM28 plus standard care versus standard care alone with regard to decreasing the incidence of recurrent breast cancer. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will approve the new drug if KM28 plus standard care decreases the rate of breast cancer recurrence by at least 40% compared to standard therapy alone. The recurrence rate on standard therapy is found to be 8%.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The new drug, KM28, will be approved if its associated recurrence rate is decreased by at least 40% compared to the recurrence rate on standard therapy alone, which is given as 8%. As 40% of 8% is 0.40 × 8% = 3.2%, the maximum acceptable recurrence rate is 8% – 3.2% = 4.8%. Another quick solution would be to state that the maximum acceptable recurrence rate is 60% of 8%, which is 0.60 × 8% = 4.8%.\n\nAn alternate solution involves using relative and absolute risk calculations. The 40% (ie, 0.4) mentioned in the prompt refers to relative risk reduction (RRR), defined as the percent reduction in absolute risk (AR) between the treatment group (eg, KM28 + standard therapy) and the control group (eg, standard therapy). The formula for RRR is:\n\nRRR = (ARcontrol – ARtreatment) / ARcontrol\n\nIn this example, ARcontrol, which represents the risk of recurrence with standard therapy, is given as 8% or 0.08. The formula can be rearranged to calculate ARtreatment:\n\nARtreatment = ARcontrol – (RRR × ARcontrol)\n\nPlugging in the values for RRR and ARcontrol gives:\n\nARtreatment = 0.08 – (0.4 × 0.08) = 0.08 – 0.032 = 0.048 (ie, 4.8%)\n\nRRR may overstate the effectiveness of an intervention. For example, a RRR of 50% occurs whether a drug decreases the incidence of a disease from 2% to 1% or from 50% to 25%. Clearly, the latter is of greater clinical significance.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nRelative risk reduction = (absolute riskcontrol – absolute risk treatment) / absolute riskcontrol",
    "zh": "如果新药KM28的相关复发率与单独标准治疗相比降低至少40%，则将被批准，标准治疗的复发率为8%。由于8%的40%是0.40 × 8% = 3.2%，因此可接受的最大复发率是8% – 3.2% = 4.8%。另一种快速的解决方案是声明可接受的最大复发率是8%的60%，即0.60 × 8% = 4.8%。\n\n另一种解决方案涉及使用相对和绝对风险计算。提示中提到的40%（即0.4）是指相对风险降低（RRR），定义为治疗组（例如，KM28 +标准治疗）和对照组（例如，标准治疗）之间绝对风险（AR）的百分比降低。 RRR的公式为：\n\nRRR = (ARcontrol – ARtreatment) / ARcontrol\n\n在本例中，ARcontrol代表标准治疗的复发风险，给定为8%或0.08。该公式可以重新排列以计算ARtreatment：\n\nARtreatment = ARcontrol – (RRR × ARcontrol)\n\n代入RRR和ARcontrol的值，得到：\n\nARtreatment = 0.08 – (0.4 × 0.08) = 0.08 – 0.032 = 0.048（即4.8%）\n\nRRR可能会高估干预措施的有效性。例如，无论药物是将疾病的发病率从2%降低到1%，还是从50%降低到25%，都会发生50%的RRR。显然，后者具有更大的临床意义。\n\n教育目标：\n\n相对风险降低 = (绝对风险对照组 – 绝对风险治疗组) / 绝对风险对照组"
