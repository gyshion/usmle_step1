    "en": "A 32-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to a 2-day history of progressive difficulty walking and tingling in his feet. He says that his feet feel \"like they've gone to sleep\" and states that he tripped while walking this morning. Medical history is unremarkable except for an episode of acute diarrhea 2 weeks ago that resolved spontaneously. The patient takes no medications. He drinks 1-2 alcoholic beverages daily and does not use tobacco products or illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows decreased muscular strength in the lower extremities bilaterally with absent deep tendon reflexes.",
    "zh": "一名32岁男性因2天来进行性行走困难和足部麻刺感就诊于急诊科。他说他的脚感觉“好像睡着了”，并表示今天早上走路时绊倒了。病史无特殊，除了2周前曾出现一过性急性腹泻，已自愈。患者未服用任何药物。他每天喝1-2杯含酒精饮料，不使用烟草或违禁药物。生命体征在正常范围内。体格检查显示双下肢肌肉力量减弱，深腱反射消失。"

    "en": "This patient with progressive lower extremity weakness, depressed deep tendon reflexes, and paresthesias has GUILLAIN-BARRÉ SYNDROME (GBS). GBS represents a group of immune-mediated demyelinating polyneuropathies that are thought to be caused by MOLECULAR MIMICRY. An antecedent event (typically an infection) provokes an immune response that cross-reacts with the Schwann cells and myelin sheath of the peripheral nerves. The myelin sheath is stripped from the axon, leading to loss of neuronal conductivity and axonal degeneration. Up to one-third of GBS cases are preceded by Campylobacter jejuni infection, a common cause of acute (sometimes bloody) DIARRHEA. Less common antecedent infections include upper respiratory viral illnesses, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, Zika virus, and HIV.\n\nPatients with GBS experience SYMMETRIC, ASCENDING WEAKNESS that typically begins in the legs and progresses to flaccid paralysis and respiratory failure. Decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, paresthesias, pain (often of the back), and dysautonomia are common.\n\n(Choices B, C, D, and E) Rotavirus, Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, and Shigella are all important causes of diarrhea but are not associated with GBS. Both Shiga toxin-producing E. coli and Shigella can cause bloody diarrhea and are associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome. Salmonella typically causes nonbloody diarrhea and may lead to bacteremia, particularly in an asplenic patient. Rotavirus, most commonly seen in children, causes nonbloody diarrhea and can lead to gastrointestinal obstruction due to small bowel intussusception.\n\n(Choice F) Zika virus is associated with GBS; however, patients with Zika virus typically present with a pruritic maculopapular rash, low-grade fever, arthralgias, and conjunctivitis rather than diarrhea.\n\nEducational objective:\nGuillain-Barré syndrome represents a group of immune-mediated polyneuropathies that are thought to be caused by molecular mimicry, leading to demyelination of the peripheral nerves. Up to one-third of GBS cases are preceded by a Campylobacter jejuni infection, which is a common cause of acute diarrheal illness.",

It specifically assesses the association between Campylobacter jejuni infection and the development of GBS.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recognize the classic presentation of GBS, including ascending weakness, absent deep tendon reflexes, and paresthesias, and then recall the most common infectious trigger for this condition, which is Campylobacter jejuni.",
