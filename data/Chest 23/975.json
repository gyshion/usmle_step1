He was enrolled in a methadone program but admits to relapsing last week. Temperature is 40 C (104 F), blood pressure is 75/40 mm Hg, pulse is 122/min and regular, and respirations are 40/min. He is admitted to the intensive care unit but dies despite treatment efforts. Lung autopsy findings are shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}.",

    "en": "The lung specimen above shows multiple wedge-shaped hemorrhagic infarcts in the periphery of the lung, which, given this patient's presentation, are most likely due to septic pulmonary emboli.\n\nPatients with INTRAVENOUS DRUG use are at increased risk of developing tricuspid valve endocarditis, most commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus. The clinical presentation is typically acute with high-grade fever, and tachycardia and hypotension due to septic shock. The majority of patients with tricuspid valve endocarditis experience embolization of tricuspid valve vegetation fragments; these fragments lodge in distal portions of the pulmonary arterial tree and cause septic pulmonary infarcts. The infarcts are typically wedge-shaped due to the triangular perfusion field of small arteries at the lung periphery. Due to the relatively low density of lung tissue (which allows blood seepage into tissue during infarction) and a dual blood supply (ie, pulmonary and bronchial arteries), pulmonary infarcts are typically hemorrhagic (red) rather than ischemic (white).\n\n(Choice A) Miliary tuberculosis typically has a subacute or chronic presentation and is accompanied by night sweats, weight loss, and anorexia. Innumerable, small, white nodules resembling millet seeds are typically seen; peripherally located wedge-shaped hemorrhages in the lung are not characteristic.\n\n(Choice B) Mycotic aneurysms may occur as a complication of endocarditis; however, they refer to the local destruction and dilation of an arterial wall due to infection. Despite their name, mycotic aneurysms are very rarely associated with fungal infections.\n\n(Choice C) Small airway obstruction is characteristic of asthma, which typically presents with dyspnea, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness. Lung autopsy usually reveals the occlusion of bronchi and bronchioles by thick mucous plugs containing shed epithelium.\n\n(Choice E) Venous thromboembolism in the pulmonary vasculature (ie, thrombotic pulmonary embolism) can also cause wedge-shaped hemorrhagic infarct in the periphery of the lung. However, this patient's high-grade fever and recent intravenous drug use are more suggestive of septic emboli from tricuspid valve endocarditis. In addition, multiple pulmonary infarcts are more consistent with septic embolization than venous thromboembolism.\n\nEducational objective:\nPulmonary infarcts are typically hemorrhagic (red) and wedge-shaped in the periphery of the lung. Intravenous drug users are at increased risk of tricuspid valve endocarditis, which can cause multiple septic pulmonary infarcts due to embolization of tricuspid valve vegetation fragments. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "上述肺部标本显示肺外周有多处楔形出血性梗死，考虑到该患者的临床表现，最有可能的原因是脓毒性肺栓塞。\n\n有静脉注射毒品史的患者发生三尖瓣心内膜炎的风险增加，最常见的原因是金黄色葡萄球菌。临床表现通常是急性发病，伴有高热、心动过速和低血压，这是由于感染性休克引起的。大多数三尖瓣心内膜炎患者会发生三尖瓣赘生物碎片的栓塞；这些碎片滞留在肺动脉树的远端，引起脓毒性肺梗死。由于肺外周小动脉的灌注区域呈三角形，梗死通常呈楔形。由于肺组织密度相对较低（这使得梗死期间血液渗入组织）和双重血液供应（即肺动脉和支气管动脉），肺梗死通常是出血性（红色）而不是缺血性（白色）。\n\n（选项A）粟粒性肺结核通常有亚急性或慢性病程，并伴有盗汗、体重减轻和厌食。通常可见无数个类似于小米粒的小白结节；肺中外周楔形出血不是特征性的。\n\n（选项B）霉菌性动脉瘤可能作为心内膜炎的并发症出现；然而，它们是指由于感染导致动脉壁的局部破坏和扩张。尽管有这个名字，霉菌性动脉瘤极少与真菌感染有关。\n\n（选项C）小气道阻塞是哮喘的特征，通常表现为呼吸困难、咳嗽、喘息和胸闷。肺部尸检通常显示支气管和小支气管被含有脱落上皮的粘稠粘液栓堵塞。\n\n（选项E）肺血管系统中的静脉血栓栓塞（即血栓性肺栓塞）也可导致肺外周楔形出血性梗死。然而，该患者的高热和最近的静脉注射毒品史更提示三尖瓣心内膜炎引起的脓毒性栓塞。此外，多发性肺梗死与脓毒性栓塞比静脉血栓栓塞更一致。\n\n教育目标：\n肺梗死通常是出血性（红色）的，并且呈楔形，位于肺外周。静脉注射毒品的患者发生三尖瓣心内膜炎的风险增加，这可能由于三尖瓣赘生物碎片的栓塞而引起多发性脓毒性肺梗死。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the presentation, etiology, and pathological findings associated with tricuspid valve endocarditis in intravenous drug users, specifically the development of septic pulmonary emboli and hemorrhagic lung infarcts. The question requires differentiating this condition from other pulmonary diseases based on clinical history, vital signs, and autopsy findings.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the patient's history of intravenous drug use, acute presentation with fever and septic shock, and the autopsy findings of multiple wedge-shaped hemorrhagic infarcts. This combination strongly suggests tricuspid valve endocarditis with septic embolization to the lungs.",
