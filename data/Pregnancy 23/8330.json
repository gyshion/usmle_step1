    "en": "A 37-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, at 30 weeks gestation comes to the office to discuss her recent laboratory work. At her last visit at 28 weeks gestation, the patient drank a solution containing 50 g of glucose, and her serum glucose was abnormally elevated an hour later. Today, she is scheduled to undergo a confirmatory 3-hour glucose test. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated, and the patient has no chronic medical conditions. She is taking a daily prenatal vitamin. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows a uterine size consistent with gestational age. Fetal heart rate is 140/min.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "During pregnancy, a physiologic increase in maternal INSULIN RESISTANCE occurs during the second and third trimesters, largely due to HUMAN PLACENTAL LACTOGEN (hPL), a peptide hormone secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast. hPL establishes a glucose-sparing effect that results in:\n\n* Increased maternal glucose levels: allows glucose to freely cross the placenta for consumption by the fetus for energy\n* Increased maternal proteolysis: provides a readily available supply of amino acids for the fetus\n* Increased maternal lipolysis: leads to increased free fatty acids and ketones to provide energy to the mother, preserving glucose and amino acids for the fetus\n\nhPL also stimulates maternal PANCREATIC BETA-CELL PROLIFERATION to increase insulin production to counteract the rising resistance. This physiologic process becomes pathologic (ie, GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS) when the pancreatic function is not sufficient to overcome the pregnancy-related increase in insulin resistance.\n\nAverage levels of hPL rise with increasing gestational age, reflecting the increasing energy requirements of the growing fetus. Therefore, screening for gestational diabetes is performed in the late second or early third trimester (when plasma levels of hPL are peaking) to ensure screening accuracy.\n\n(Choice A) Growth hormone, released from the pituitary gland, causes an increase in insulin resistance and fat breakdown; however, growth hormone secretion does not increase during pregnancy.\n\n(Choice B) In early pregnancy, the syncytiotrophoblast secretes human chorionic gonadotropin, a peptide hormone, which stimulates the corpus luteum to produce progesterone, a steroid hormone. Progesterone is necessary to maintain the secretory endometrium, allowing the pregnancy to persist through term.\n\n(Choice D) Prolactin is a peptide hormone secreted by lactotroph cells in the anterior pituitary. It stimulates ductal and alveolar growth in breast tissue and is responsible for milk production and lactation in postpartum women.\n\n(Choice E) Pregnancy increases the levels of thyroid-binding globulin, leading to increased total circulating T3 and T4. However, free thyroid hormone levels remain essentially normal.\n\nEducational objective:\nHuman placental lactogen creates a fetal glucose-sparing effect by increasing maternal insulin resistance during the second and third trimesters, leading to a rise in serum glucose that helps provide adequate nutrition to the growing fetus. Gestational diabetes occurs when the compensatory rise in maternal insulin secretion is inadequate to prevent serum glucose levels from reaching excessively high levels.",
    "zh": "在怀孕期间，由于人胎盘催乳素（hPL）（一种由合体滋养层分泌的肽类激素），在孕中期和孕晚期会发生孕妇生理性胰岛素抵抗增加。hPL建立了一种葡萄糖节约效应，导致：\n\n* 孕妇葡萄糖水平升高：允许葡萄糖自由通过胎盘，供胎儿消耗以获取能量\n* 孕妇蛋白质分解增加：为胎儿提供现成的氨基酸供应\n* 孕妇脂肪分解增加：导致游离脂肪酸和酮体增加，为母亲提供能量，从而为胎儿保留葡萄糖和氨基酸\n\nhPL 还刺激孕妇的胰腺 β 细胞增殖，以增加胰岛素的产生，从而对抗不断上升的抵抗力。当胰腺功能不足以克服妊娠相关的胰岛素抵抗增加时，这一生理过程就会变成病理性的（即妊娠期糖尿病）。\n\nhPL 的平均水平随着孕龄的增加而升高，反映了生长中的胎儿对能量的需求增加。因此，在孕中期晚期或孕晚期（hPL 的血浆水平达到峰值时）进行妊娠糖尿病筛查，以确保筛查的准确性。\n\n（选项 A）生长激素由脑垂体释放，导致胰岛素抵抗增加和脂肪分解；然而，怀孕期间生长激素的分泌并没有增加。\n\n（选项 B）在怀孕早期，合体滋养层分泌人绒毛膜促性腺激素，这是一种肽类激素，可刺激黄体生成孕酮，这是一种类固醇激素。孕酮是维持分泌性子宫内膜所必需的，从而使妊娠持续到足月。\n\n（选项 D）催乳素是一种肽类激素，由脑垂体前叶的催乳细胞分泌。它刺激乳腺组织导管和肺泡的生长，并负责产后妇女的乳汁分泌和泌乳。\n\n（选项 E）怀孕会增加甲状腺结合球蛋白的水平，从而导致循环总 T3 和 T4 增加。然而，游离甲状腺激素水平基本保持正常。\n\n教育目标：\n人胎盘催乳素通过在孕中期和孕晚期增加孕妇的胰岛素抵抗来产生胎儿葡萄糖节约效应，导致血清葡萄糖升高，这有助于为生长中的胎儿提供足够的营养。当孕妇胰岛素分泌的代偿性升高不足以防止血清葡萄糖水平达到过高水平时，就会发生妊娠糖尿病。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the hormonal changes during pregnancy that contribute to altered glucose metabolism and the risk of gestational diabetes. Specifically, it assesses knowledge of human placental lactogen (hPL) and its role in inducing maternal insulin resistance.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the hormonal changes characteristic of the second and third trimesters of pregnancy that lead to increased maternal glucose levels. Recognizing that hPL is the primary hormone responsible for these metabolic adaptations, particularly insulin resistance, is key to selecting the correct answer.",
