    "en": "A 6-year-old boy is brought to the office due to frequent nighttime awakenings. Several times a week over the past month, he has come to his parents' bed around 3 AM, frequently crying, appearing frightened, and saying that he became lost in a crowd and couldn't find his parents. Although he is comforted by their reassurance, he refuses to return to his room and eventually falls back asleep in their bed. The boy is about to start first grade at a new school. He is healthy and developmental milestones are normal. Examination shows no abnormalities. The sleep stage associated with this child's frightening experience is characterized by which of the following?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This boy's recurrent awakenings with associated dream content and ability to be comforted are characteristic of NIGHTMARES, a common and developmentally normal experience for most children. Nightmares occur during RAPID EYE MOVEMENT (REM) sleep and are more frequent in the FINAL THIRD OF THE NIGHT when REM periods become longer (Choice A). Children can often describe the nightmare, become fully alert after awakening, and are typically able to be consoled. In contrast, sleep terrors are a common non-REM parasomnia of childhood that occur during slow-wave sleep in the first third of the night. Unlike nightmares, the child with sleep terrors does not fully awaken, is unresponsive to comfort, and has no associated dream content.\n\nREM sleep is characterized by dreaming and VOLUNTARY MUSCLE PARALYSIS due to inhibition of motor neurons. EEG activity during REM sleep is similar to the waking state, consisting of a combination of alpha, beta, and desynchronous EEG waves (sawtooth waves).\n\n(Choices B, D, and E) These EEG findings are characteristic of different sub stages of non-REM sleep (typically divided into 3 stages). Theta waves are seen in stage 1 (transition from wakefulness to sleep) and stage 2 (light, stable sleep). Sleep spindles and K complexes are characteristic of stage 2. Delta waves are characteristic of slow-wave sleep or deep sleep (stage 3). Non-REM arousal disorders (eg. sleep terrors) often occur in stage 3.\n\nEducational objective:\nREM sleep is characterized by dreaming and voluntary muscle paralysis, and occurs more often during the final third of the night. Nightmares occur during REM sleep and can be differentiated from sleep terrors, a non-REM parasomnia characterized by incomplete arousals and lack of dream content.\n\nReferences\n• REM sleep at its core – circuits, neurotransmitters, and pathophysiology.\n• Just a scary dream?

    "zh": "这名男孩反复醒来，伴有梦的内容，并且能够得到安慰，这是噩梦的特征，对大多数儿童来说，这是一种常见且符合发育规律的经历。噩梦发生在快速眼动（REM）睡眠期间，并且在夜间最后三分之一的时间内更频繁，此时REM周期变得更长（选项A）。儿童通常可以描述噩梦，在醒来后完全清醒，并且通常能够得到安慰。相比之下，睡眠惊恐症是儿童常见的非REM睡眠异态症，发生在夜间前三分之一的慢波睡眠期间。与噩梦不同，患有睡眠惊恐症的儿童不会完全醒来，对安慰无反应，并且没有相关的梦的内容。\n\nREM睡眠的特点是做梦和自主肌肉麻痹，这是由于运动神经元的抑制。REM睡眠期间的脑电图活动类似于清醒状态，由alpha、beta和去同步脑电波（锯齿波）的组合组成。\n\n（选项B、D和E）这些脑电图结果是不同非REM睡眠亚阶段的特征（通常分为3个阶段）。Theta波出现在第1阶段（从清醒到睡眠的过渡）和第2阶段（轻度、稳定的睡眠）。睡眠锭和K复合波是第2阶段的特征。Delta波是慢波睡眠或深度睡眠（第3阶段）的特征。非REM觉醒障碍（例如睡眠惊恐症）通常发生在第3阶段。\n\n教育目标：\nREM睡眠的特点是做梦和自主肌肉麻痹，并且在夜间最后三分之一的时间内更常发生。噩梦发生在REM睡眠期间，可以与睡眠惊恐症区分开来，睡眠惊恐症是一种非REM睡眠异态症，其特点是不完全觉醒和缺乏梦的内容。\n\n参考文献\n• 核心REM睡眠——回路、神经递质和病理生理学。\n• 只是一个可怕的梦？简要回顾睡眠惊恐症、噩梦和快速眼动睡眠行为障碍。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the characteristics of nightmares, specifically the sleep stage in which they occur and their associated physiological features, differentiating them from other sleep disorders like sleep terrors.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the clinical presentation as a nightmare based on the patient's age, symptoms, and ability to be consoled. Then, recall the physiological characteristics of REM sleep, which is the stage associated with nightmares, particularly the presence of muscle paralysis and the timing within the sleep cycle.",
