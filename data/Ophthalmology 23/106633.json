    "en": "A 66-year-old hospitalized woman is evaluated due to progressive pain and decreased vision in her left eye. The patient was admitted 2 weeks ago due to acute diverticulitis with microperforation and localized abscess. CT-guided abscess drainage was performed, and she has been receiving antibiotics and parenteral nutrition via a central venous catheter. The patient has no other medical conditions. Temperature is 38.3 C (100.91 F). Left eye examination shows chorioretinitis and vitreous abscess. Urgent partial vitrectomy is performed, and antimicrobial therapy is administered. Culture of the vitreous humor grows Candida albicans. Which of the following is the most likely route of pathogen invasion during the pathogenesis of this patient's ocular infection?",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is C. This patient has CANDIDA ENDOPHTHALMITIS, a purulent infection of the structures and (usually) fluid chambers of the eye. Although molds such as Aspergillus or Fusarium generally spread to the eye via direct extension following surgery or trauma, yeasts such as Candida typically infect the eye via HEMATOGENOUS DISSEMINATION in the setting of fungemia. Candida first seeds the highly vascular choroid layer and then spreads to the retina and fluid chambers.\n\nMost cases occur in hospitalized patients with a CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETER, which allows commensal Candida organisms from the skin to enter the bloodstream. The risk is further increased by TOTAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, recent abdominal surgery, and immuncompromise (eg, neutropenia, glucocorticoid therapy).\n\nManifestations of Candida endophthalmitis are often unilateral and include floaters and a PROGRESSIVE LOSS IN VISION. Eye pain does not typically occur until late in the disease course. The patient may feel well and be otherwise asymptomatic or may have systemic symptoms (eg, fever) due to fungemia. Blood cultures should be obtained, but vitreous fluid sampling is usually required for diagnosis.\n\n(Choice A) Direct extension from the anterior chamber can occur in the setting of a corneal infection following trauma or surgery. It is rare for Candida to otherwise spread via the anterior chamber.\n\n(Choice B) Rhizopus is a mold that affects primarily those with immuncompromise and diabetes mellitus. It first attacks the paranasal sinuses and then spreads into adjacent tissue (eg, orbit, eye). This is not a typical pattern for Candida.\n\n(Choice D) Herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus can reactivate in the optic nerve root and travel in a retrograde fashion to infect the retina, leading to retinal vasculitis or acute retinal necrosis. Candida does not spread in this fashion.\n\n(Choice E) Lymphatic spread is common with many atypical bacteria and some endemic fungi. However, Candida does not usually spread to the eye through the lymphatic system.\n\nEducational objective: Candida endophthalmitis typically occurs due to hematogenous dissemination to the choroid in the setting of fungemia. Most cases arise in hospitalized patients with indwelling central catheters. Patients usually have unilateral eye floaters and progressive vision loss.",
    "zh": "正确答案是C。这位患者患有念珠菌眼内炎，这是一种眼部结构和（通常是）液腔的化脓性感染。虽然曲霉或镰刀菌等霉菌通常通过手术或外伤后的直接蔓延传播到眼睛，但念珠菌等酵母菌通常通过血行播散感染眼睛，这种情况发生在真菌血症的情况下。念珠菌首先在高度血管化的脉络膜层播种，然后扩散到视网膜和液腔。\n\n大多数病例发生在有中心静脉导管的住院患者中，这使得来自皮肤的共生念珠菌有机体能够进入血流。总肠外营养、广谱抗生素治疗、近期腹部手术和免疫功能低下（例如，中性粒细胞减少症、糖皮质激素治疗）会进一步增加风险。\n\n念珠菌眼内炎的临床表现通常是单侧的，包括飞蚊症和进行性视力下降。眼痛通常要到疾病晚期才会发生。患者可能感觉良好，并且没有其他症状，或者可能由于真菌血症而出现全身症状（例如，发烧）。应进行血培养，但通常需要进行玻璃体液采样以进行诊断。\n\n（选项A）前房直接蔓延可能发生在创伤或手术后的角膜感染的情况下。念珠菌通常很少通过前房蔓延。\n\n（选项B）毛霉菌是一种主要影响免疫功能低下和糖尿病患者的霉菌。它首先攻击鼻窦，然后蔓延到邻近组织（例如，眼眶，眼睛）。这不是念珠菌的典型模式。\n\n（选项D）单纯疱疹病毒和水痘-带状疱疹病毒可以在视神经根中重新激活，并以逆行方式传播以感染视网膜，导致视网膜血管炎或急性视网膜坏死。念珠菌不会以这种方式传播。\n\n（选项E）淋巴传播常见于许多非典型细菌和一些地方性真菌。然而，念珠菌通常不会通过淋巴系统传播到眼睛。\n\n教育目标：念珠菌眼内炎通常是由于血行播散到脉络膜引起的，这种情况发生在真菌血症的情况下。大多数病例发生在有留置中心静脉导管的住院患者中。患者通常有单侧眼部飞蚊症和进行性视力下降。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathogenesis of Candida endophthalmitis, specifically the route of pathogen invasion in a hospitalized patient with risk factors. It requires knowledge of common fungal infections of the eye and their typical modes of transmission.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the causative organism (Candida) and the patient's clinical context (hospitalized, central venous catheter, recent surgery, TPN). Consider the typical routes of infection for fungi, particularly yeasts, and how they relate to the patient's risk factors to determine the most likely pathway to the eye.",
