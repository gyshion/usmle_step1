    "en": "An 11-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after he briefly lost consciousness. The patient's mother found him on the kitchen floor shaking and jerking. She believes that he was out of her sight for only a few minutes. When asked about any other abnormal behaviors, she says that her son often stares into space and does not respond to questions during these episodes. The patient has no known medical conditions or history of recent illnesses. He is afebrile with normal vital signs. The patient seems sleepy but is oriented to time and place and has no abnormalities on physical examination. Several hours later, he is alert and says that he wants to go home.",

    "en": "This patient with frequent staring spells (ie, ABSENCE SEIZURES) and an unprovoked TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE most likely has undiagnosed juvenile absence epilepsy. Absence seizures are characterized by momentary lapses in consciousness (~10 seconds) associated with a classic 3-Hz spike-wave pattern on electroencephalogram. Younger children with absence seizure types typically do not develop other seizure types; however, later onset (eg, age 10-12) of absence epilepsy is associated with an increased incidence of generalized onset tonic-clonic or myoclonic seizures.\n\nAlthough a first-time unprovoked seizure may not require treatment, this patient has had multiple seizures, including both absence and tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide is the preferred first-line agent for the treatment of isolated absence seizures; however, it does not suppress tonic-clonic seizures (Choice B). Treatment with a broad-spectrum antiepileptic such as VALPROIC ACID is required in these patients because it is effective for both absence and tonic-clonic seizures.\n\n(Choices A, C, and D). Carbamazepine, phenytoin, and gabapentin are narrow-spectrum antiepileptics that can be used to treat focal onset seizures (including focal onset seizures that progress to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures). However, they are not effective for treating generalized onset seizures (eg, absence, myoclonic) which can actually be worsened by treatment with carbamazepine or phenytoin.\n\nEducational objective:\nOlder children with absence seizures may also develop generalized onset tonic-clonic or myoclonic seizures. Although ethosuximide is effective against isolated absence seizures, it is not effective for tonic-clonic seizures. Valproic acid is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic that treats both types of seizures.",
    "zh": "该患者频繁出现凝视发作（即，失神发作）和无诱因的强直-阵挛性发作，最有可能患有未确诊的青少年失神癫痫。失神发作的特征是意识短暂丧失（约10秒），与脑电图上典型的3赫兹棘慢波模式相关。患有失神发作的幼儿通常不会发展为其他类型的癫痫发作；然而，起病较晚（例如，10-12岁）的失神癫痫与全身性强直-阵挛性或肌阵挛性发作的发生率增加相关。\n\n虽然首次无诱因发作可能不需要治疗，但该患者已发生多次发作，包括失神发作和强直-阵挛性发作。乙琥胺是治疗孤立性失神发作的首选一线药物；然而，它不能抑制强直-阵挛性发作（选项B）。这些患者需要使用广谱抗癫痫药，如丙戊酸，因为它对失神发作和强直-阵挛性发作均有效。\n\n（选项A、C和D）。卡马西平、苯妥英和加巴喷丁是窄谱抗癫痫药，可用于治疗局灶起病性发作（包括进展为双侧强直-阵挛性发作的局灶起病性发作）。然而，它们对治疗全身性发作（例如，失神、肌阵挛）无效，实际上可能因卡马西平或苯妥英的治疗而加重。\n\n教育目标：\n患有失神发作的较大儿童也可能发生全身性强直-阵挛性或肌阵挛性发作。虽然乙琥胺对孤立性失神发作有效，但对强直-阵挛性发作无效。丙戊酸是一种广谱抗癫痫药，可治疗这两种类型的发作。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of seizure types and appropriate antiepileptic drug selection, specifically in the context of juvenile absence epilepsy. The key is to recognize the presence of both absence and tonic-clonic seizures and choose a broad-spectrum agent.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the seizure types described in the vignette (absence and tonic-clonic) and recall that valproic acid is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic effective for both generalized and focal seizures, while ethosuximide is only effective for absence seizures.",
