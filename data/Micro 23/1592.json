    "en": "A 26-year-old man is being screened as a potential kidney donor for his mother, who has end-stage renal disease. The patient has no history of diabetes, hypertension, or kidney disease and is up to date with all recommended vaccinations. Physical examination is unremarkable. Blood type and crossmatch testing demonstrate biological compatibility. As part of the evaluation, screening for transmissible diseases is performed and is notable for the following results:\n\nHIV-1 antibody: negative\nHepatitis B core antibody, IgM: negative\nHepatitis B core antibody, IgG: negative\nHepatitis B surface antigen: negative\nHepatitis B surface antibody: positive\nHepatitis C virus antibody: negative\nCytomegalovirus antibody, IgM: negative\nCytomegalovirus antibody, IgG: positive",

    "en": "This patient, who is HIV negative, has a positive titer for CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV) IgG, suggesting prior CMV infection. CMV is a rare cause of disease in the immunocompetent, with the virus more typically responsible for subclinical infection. When primary CMV infection does result in clinically evident illness, affected individuals appear to have a systemic MONONUCLEOSIS-LIKE SYNDROME characterized by fever, malaise, myalgia, atypical lymphocytosis, and elevated liver transaminases. In contrast to Epstein-Barr virus mononucleosis (most common), heterophile antibodies are not usually present in patients with CMV mononucleosis (negative Monospot test).\n\n(Choices A and D) Odynophagia (painful swallowing) associated with linear esophageal ulcers due to CMV infection is seen in patients with HIV. Retinitis is one of the more common manifestations of CMV infection in patients with HIV.\n\n(Choice B) Disseminated CMV can cause diarrhea and hepatitis in the immunocompromised. In this patient, the combination of a positive hepatitis B surface antibody with a negative hepatitis B surface antigen and a negative hepatitis B core antibody reflects immunization against hepatitis B, not prior hepatitis B infection.\n\n(Choice E) A vesicular skin rash is seen in association with herpes simplex or herpes zoster virus infection.\n\n(Choice F) CMV pneumonitis typically occurs after organ transplantation.\n\nEducational objective:\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is typically associated with subclinical infection in the immunocompetent, with the occasional individual developing a mononucleosis-like syndrome that is heterophile antibody (Monospot) negative. In the immunocompromised, primary or reactivated CMV infection can result in severe retinitis, pneumonia, esophagitis, colitis, or hepatitis.",
    "zh": "该患者HIV检测阴性，巨细胞病毒(CMV) IgG抗体滴度阳性，提示既往CMV感染。CMV在免疫功能正常者中很少引起疾病，该病毒更常见于引起亚临床感染。当原发性CMV感染确实导致临床表现明显的疾病时，受影响的个体似乎会出现全身性的单核细胞增多症样综合征，其特征为发热、不适、肌痛、异型淋巴细胞增多和肝转氨酶升高。与Epstein-Barr病毒单核细胞增多症（最常见）相比，CMV单核细胞增多症患者通常不存在异嗜性抗体（Monospot试验阴性）。\n\n（选项A和D）与CMV感染相关的吞咽疼痛（吞咽困难）引起的线性食管溃疡见于HIV感染患者。视网膜炎是HIV感染患者中CMV感染的常见表现之一。\n\n（选项B）播散性CMV可在免疫功能低下者中引起腹泻和肝炎。对于该患者，乙型肝炎表面抗体阳性，乙型肝炎表面抗原和乙型肝炎核心抗体阴性，反映了针对乙型肝炎的免疫接种，而非既往乙型肝炎感染。\n\n（选项E）水疱性皮疹与单纯疱疹或带状疱疹病毒感染有关。\n\n（选项F）CMV肺炎通常发生在器官移植后。\n\n教育目标：\n巨细胞病毒(CMV)通常与免疫功能正常者的亚临床感染相关，偶尔个体可发生单核细胞增多症样综合征，其异嗜性抗体（Monospot）阴性。在免疫功能低下者中，原发性或再活化的CMV感染可导致严重的视网膜炎、肺炎、食管炎、结肠炎或肝炎。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and its clinical manifestations in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. It requires interpreting serological markers to determine past exposure and potential clinical syndromes.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the significance of a positive CMV IgG antibody in an immunocompetent individual, which often indicates a past subclinical infection or a mononucleosis-like illness. Understanding the differential diagnosis of mononucleosis-like syndromes and the typical presentations of CMV in different patient populations is crucial.",
    "zh": "本题考察了巨细胞病毒(CMV)感染及其在免疫功能正常和免疫功能低下个体中的临床表现。它需要解读血清学标志物以确定既往暴露和潜在的临床综合征。\n\n解决此题的关键是认识到免疫功能正常个体中CMV IgG抗体阳性的重要性，这通常表明既往亚临床感染或单核细胞增多症样疾病。了解单核细胞增多症样综合征的鉴别诊断以及CMV在不同患者人群中的典型表现至关重要。"
