    "en": "This woman with dull, near-daily headaches has TENSION HEADACHES (THs), the most common form of headache. THs are likely due to sensitization of peripheral nociceptors leading to increased perception of myofascial pain. Patients typically develop mild to moderate, achy, or pressure-like pain that is often BILATERAL and may involve the occipitonuchal, temporal, or frontal regions of the head. Pericranial MUSCLE TENDERNESS (eg, head, neck, shoulder) is common.\n\nTHs are not associated with other neurologic symptoms or nausea/vomiting and are often precipitated by STRESS and fatigue. They may persist for days, months, or even years but (unlike migraines and cluster headaches) do not typically limit a patient's ability to perform daily functions. Treatment is typically with SIMPLE ANALGESICS (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen).\n\n(Choice A) Chronic sinusitis can cause facial pain and tenderness but is often associated with nasal congestion and mucopurulent nasal drainage. A reduced sense of smell and taste is also common.\n\n(Choice B) Cluster headaches most commonly affect men and present as severe, unilateral, orbital or temporal pain with associated autonomic symptoms (eg, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, diaphoresis). The headaches are typically brief (15-180 minutes), debilitating, and may awaken patients from sleep.\n\n(Choice C) Giant cell arteritis is associated with an acute headache that is typically accompanied by scalp tenderness, visual symptoms, and jaw claudication. It occurs exclusively in older patients (age \\u2265 50) and is often associated with polymyalgia rheumatica.\n\n(Choice D) Brain tumors typically cause nausea, vomiting, and headaches that worsen with changes in body position. In addition, the presence of other focal neurologic signs would be expected due to compression of surrounding brain structures by the expanding tumor.\n\n(Choice E) Migraine headaches are characterized by often debilitating, episodic, unilateral, pulsatile headaches typically associated with nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. Some patients have focal neurologic symptoms that precede or accompany the headache (ie, aura).",
    "zh": "这位女性出现钝痛，几乎每天都头痛，患有紧张型头痛 (THs)，这是最常见的头痛类型。THs 可能是由于外周伤害性感受器的敏化导致对肌筋膜疼痛的感知增加。患者通常会发展为轻度至中度、酸痛或压迫样疼痛，通常是双侧的，可能涉及枕颈、颞部或额部。颅周肌肉压痛（如头部、颈部、肩部）很常见。\n\nTHs 与其他神经系统症状或恶心/呕吐无关，通常由压力和疲劳诱发。它们可能持续数天、数月甚至数年，但（与偏头痛和丛集性头痛不同）通常不会限制患者进行日常活动的能力。治疗通常采用简单镇痛药（如非甾体抗炎药、对乙酰氨基酚）。\n\n(选项 A) 慢性鼻窦炎可引起面部疼痛和压痛，但通常与鼻塞和黏液脓性鼻涕有关。嗅觉和味觉减退也很常见。\n\n(选项 B) 丛集性头痛最常影响男性，表现为严重的单侧、眼眶或颞部疼痛，伴有自主神经症状（如流泪、流涕、出汗）。头痛通常短暂（15-180分钟）、使人虚弱，并可能使患者从睡眠中醒来。\n\n(选项 C) 巨细胞性动脉炎与急性头痛相关，通常伴有头皮压痛、视觉症状和下颌跛行。它仅发生在老年患者（年龄 ≥ 50 岁）中，并且通常与风湿性多肌痛有关。\n\n(选项 D) 脑肿瘤通常引起恶心、呕吐和头痛，并且随着体位变化而加重。此外，由于肿瘤压迫周围脑结构，预计会出现其他局灶性神经系统体征。\n\n(选项 E) 偏头痛的特征是经常使人衰弱的、阵发性、单侧、搏动性头痛，通常与恶心、畏光和畏声有关。一些患者会出现先于或伴随头痛的局灶性神经系统症状（即先兆）。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to differentiate between common types of headaches based on their clinical presentation, including characteristics of pain, associated symptoms, and patient demographics.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully evaluate the patient's description of the headache (e.g., location, quality, duration, frequency, severity), associated symptoms, and relevant medical history. Compare these findings to the typical features of each headache diagnosis presented in the options, utilizing a systematic approach to rule out less likely diagnoses.",
