    "en": "A cell biologist is studying the role of ribonucleoproteins in normal cellular function. He prepares a cell extract using a specific cell type obtained from a 73-year-old man. Ribonucleoproteins are separated and purified from the cell extract for structural and functional analyses. These cells are found to express higher amounts of a particular protein in comparison to other cell types. This protein has reverse transcriptase activity that functions to add TTAGGG repeats to the 3' end of chromosomes.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The protein described has reverse transcriptase activity that functions to add TTAGGG repeats to the 3' end of chromosomes. This is similar to other reverse transcriptase enzymes in that it synthesizes single-stranded DNA using single-stranded RNA as a template (RNA-DEPENDENT DNA POLYMERASE). Telomerase is composed of 2 main subunits, the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) subunit and the telomerase RNA component (TERC). TERC is a \"built-in\" RNA template that is repeatedly read by the TERT subunit to add TTAGGG DNA sequence repeats to telomeres.\n\nSTEM CELLS have very LONG TELOMERES due to their high telomerase activity, allowing them to proliferate indefinitely in a controlled manner. In contrast, most terminally differentiated adult somatic cells (eg, myocardial cells, neurons, pancreatic β cells) have short telomeres as they do not express telomerase and their telomeres shorten with every cell division (Choices C, D, and E). Critical shortening in TELOMERE LENGTH is thought to be a signal for programmed cell death. In fact, syndromes of premature aging (eg, Bloom syndrome) are associated with shortened telomeres. In contrast, cancer cells upregulate their telomerase activity, preventing cell death by maintaining their telomere length.\n\nStem cells are undifferentiated cells with the potential to differentiate into other cell types and can be classified as either embryonic or adult stem cells. Although embryonic stem cells are present in the very early stages of embryogenesis and can give rise to every cell type in adult humans (pluripotent), adult stem cells are present in most tissues and are generally responsible for replacing dead cells. For example, the epidermis is continuously replaced by stem cells present in the basal cell layers. Bone marrow stem cells similarly replace peripheral red and white blood cells.\n\n(Choice B) Erythrocytes have no nuclei and therefore have no potential to divide.",
    "zh": "所描述的蛋白质具有逆转录酶活性，其功能是向染色体的3'端添加TTAGGG重复序列。这与其他逆转录酶相似，即它使用单链RNA作为模板合成单链DNA（RNA依赖性DNA聚合酶）。端粒酶由2个主要亚基组成，即端粒酶逆转录酶（TERT）亚基和端粒酶RNA组分（TERC）。TERC是一个“内置”的RNA模板，由TERT亚基重复读取，以将TTAGGG DNA序列重复添加到端粒。\n\n干细胞由于其高端粒酶活性而具有非常长的端粒，这使它们能够以受控方式无限增殖。相反，大多数终末分化的成人体细胞（例如，心肌细胞、神经元、胰岛β细胞）具有短端粒，因为它们不表达端粒酶，并且它们的端粒随着每次细胞分裂而缩短（选项C、D和E）。端粒长度的严重缩短被认为是程序性细胞死亡的信号。事实上，早衰综合征（例如，布卢姆综合征）与端粒缩短有关。相反，癌细胞上调其端粒酶活性，通过维持其端粒长度来阻止细胞死亡。\n\n干细胞是未分化的细胞，具有分化成其他细胞类型的潜力，可以分为胚胎干细胞或成体干细胞。尽管胚胎干细胞存在于胚胎发生的早期阶段，并且可以产生成人人类的每一种细胞类型（多能性），但成体干细胞存在于大多数组织中，并且通常负责替换死亡细胞。例如，表皮由存在于基底细胞层中的干细胞不断替换。骨髓干细胞也类似地替换外周红细胞和白细胞。\n\n（选项B）红细胞没有细胞核，因此没有分裂的潜力。"
