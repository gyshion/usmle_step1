    "en": "A 34-year-old man diagnosed with advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma undergoes doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy with good clinical response. Several weeks after the last chemotherapy cycle, the patient comes to the office with progressive exertional dyspnea. He has difficulty sleeping flat at night and needs to use multiple pillows to fall asleep. The patient is a lifetime nonsmoker and has no family history of heart disease. Blood pressure is 124/72 mm Hg, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 16/min. Oxygen saturation on room air is 96%.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Anthracyclines (eg, daunorubicin, doxorubicin) are chemotherapeutic agents associated with severe cardiotoxicity that manifests as dilated cardiomyopathy. The toxicity is dependent on the cumulative dose of anthracycline; affected patients develop symptoms of heart failure (eg, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, peripheral edema) anywhere from several weeks to years following treatment.\n\nAnthracyclines exert their antitumor effect by binding to the topoisomerase II enzyme in cancer cells to create DNA cleavage complexes that break DNA and cause cell death. Anthracycline cardiotoxicity results from a similar anthracycline-topoisomerase II complex that forms in healthy cardiomyocytes. In addition, anthracycline can form iron-containing complexes that produce DNA-damaging free radicals, which likely also plays a role in cardiotoxicity.\n\nThe most effective method of preventing anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy is the administration of dexrazoxane, a chelating agent thought to both block the formation of iron-associated free radicals and inhibit the formation of anthracycline-topoisomerase II complexes in healthy cardiomyocytes.\n\n(Choice B) Focal myocardial scarring commonly results following a myocardial infarction.\n\n(Choice C) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an autosomal dominant disorder often caused by mutation of the beta-myosin heavy chain.\n\n(Choice D) Pericardial thickening and fibrosis usually follow cardiac surgery, radiation therapy, or viral infections of the pericardium.\n\n(Choice E) Restrictive cardiomyopathy often occurs as the initial cardiac manifestation of infiltrative disease (eg, hemochromatosis, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis) or may occur with radiation therapy.\n\n(Choice F) Right ventricular pressure overload can occur with acute pulmonary embolism. Although this patient with malignancy is at increased risk for venous thromboembolic disease, orthopnea is not explained by acute pulmonary embolism and is more consistent with heart failure.\n\nEducational objective:\nAnthracycline chemotherapeutic agents (eg, doxorubicin, daunorubicin) cause cardiotoxicity mainly through the formation of anthracycline-topoisomerase II DNA cleavage complexes that affect healthy cardiomyocytes. The cardiotoxicity is dependent on the cumulative dose of anthracycline received, and it manifests as dilated cardiomyopathy.",
    "zh": "蒽环类药物（例如，柔红霉素、多柔比星）是与严重心脏毒性相关的化疗药物，表现为扩张型心肌病。这种毒性取决于蒽环类药物的累积剂量；受影响的患者会在治疗后的几周到几年内出现心力衰竭的症状（例如，劳力性呼吸困难、端坐呼吸、外周水肿）。\n\n蒽环类药物通过与癌细胞中的拓扑异构酶II酶结合，产生DNA切割复合物，从而破坏DNA并导致细胞死亡，发挥其抗肿瘤作用。蒽环类药物的心脏毒性源于类似的蒽环类药物-拓扑异构酶II复合物，该复合物在健康的心肌细胞中形成。此外，蒽环类药物可以形成含铁复合物，产生损伤DNA的自由基，这可能也在心脏毒性中发挥作用。\n\n预防蒽环类药物引起的心肌病的最有效方法是使用右雷佐生，这是一种螯合剂，被认为可以阻断铁相关自由基的形成，并抑制蒽环类药物-拓扑异构酶II复合物在健康心肌细胞中的形成。\n\n（选项B）局灶性心肌瘢痕形成通常继发于心肌梗死。\n\n（选项C）肥厚型心肌病是一种常染色体显性遗传病，通常由β-肌球蛋白重链的突变引起。\n\n（选项D）心包增厚和纤维化通常继发于心脏手术、放射治疗或心包的病毒感染。\n\n（选项E）限制型心肌病通常作为浸润性疾病（例如，血色素沉着病、淀粉样变性病、结节病）的初始心脏表现，或者可能发生在放射治疗中。\n\n（选项F）右心室压力超负荷可发生于急性肺栓塞。虽然这种恶性肿瘤患者发生静脉血栓栓塞性疾病的风险增加，但端坐呼吸并不能用急性肺栓塞解释，而更符合心力衰竭。\n\n教育目标：\n蒽环类化疗药物（例如，多柔比星、柔红霉素）主要通过蒽环类药物-拓扑异构酶II DNA切割复合物的形成引起心脏毒性，这些复合物会影响健康的心肌细胞。心脏毒性取决于接受的蒽环类药物的累积剂量，并表现为扩张型心肌病。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the cardiotoxic effects of anthracycline chemotherapy, specifically the development of dilated cardiomyopathy. It requires recognizing the association between doxorubicin treatment and subsequent heart failure symptoms.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's history of chemotherapy with doxorubicin, a known cardiotoxic agent. Recognize that dilated cardiomyopathy is a common complication of anthracycline therapy and can present with heart failure symptoms like dyspnea and orthopnea.",
