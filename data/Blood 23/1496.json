    "en": "A 14-year-old girl comes to the emergency department due to rapidly progressive exertional dyspnea and generalized weakness, which were preceded by a mild febrile illness several days ago. She has a history of sickle cell disease and takes a daily folic acid supplement. Her temperature is 37.2 C (99.1 F), blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 112/min and regular. On examination, the patient has conjunctival pallor but no icterus. A cardiac flow murmur is present. The abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly. Laboratory studies show a hematocrit of 16% with reticulocyte count of 0.1% (normal range, 0.5%-1.5%). Leukocyte and platelet counts are normal. Which of the following best describes the virus most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has developed severe anemia (eg, pallor, low hematocrit, flow murmur) following a minor febrile illness. If her bone marrow were able to respond appropriately to the degree of anemia, the reticulocyte count would be elevated (normal reticulocyte count is 0.5%-1.5% of red cells). Instead, the patient's reticulocyte count is markedly reduced.\n\nThis scenario describes an APLASTIC CRISIS, which in sickle cell patients is usually due to parvovirus B19 infection of erythroid precursor cells in the bone marrow. Parvovirus is a nonenveloped single-stranded DNA virus. DESTRUCTION of the erythroid precursor cells by this virus diminishes the number of reticulocytes available to replace the deformed and/or removed erythrocytes.\n\n(Choices A, C, and E) Epstein-Barr virus (enveloped double-stranded DNA virus), hepatitis C virus (enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus), and hepatitis E virus (nonenveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus) can cause hematopoietic depression and some measure of aplastic anemia (a cause of pancytopenia that should not be confused with aplastic crisis, which is limited to affecting erythrocytes). Anemia with normal leukocyte and platelet counts is more likely to occur with parvovirus B19 due to the virus's predilection for infecting proerythroblasts.\n\n(Choice B) Important enveloped negative-sense RNA viruses include orthomyxoviruses (eg, influenza), paramyxoviruses (eg, measles and mumps), and rhabdoviruses (eg, rabies). However, these viruses are not known to infect erythroid progenitor cells in sufficient numbers to significantly impact erythropoiesis.\n\n(Choice D) Nonenveloped double-stranded DNA viruses include adenoviruses, papillomaviruses, and polyomaviruses, which are not commonly known to cause hematopoietic depression or aplastic crisis.\n\nEducational objective:\nIn patients with sickle cell anemia and other chronic hemolytic disorders, the most common viral cause of an aplastic crisis is infection of erythroid progenitor cells with parvovirus B19, a nonenveloped single-stranded DNA virus.",
    "zh": "该患者在发生轻微发热疾病后出现重度贫血（如，苍白、血细胞比容低、心脏杂音）。如果她的骨髓能够对贫血程度做出适当的反应，网织红细胞计数将会升高（正常网织红细胞计数为红细胞的0.5%-1.5%）。相反，患者的网织红细胞计数显著降低。\n\n这种情况描述了再生障碍危象，在镰状细胞病患者中，这通常是由于B19微小病毒感染骨髓中的红系祖细胞所致。细小病毒是一种无包膜单链DNA病毒。这种病毒对红系祖细胞的破坏减少了可用于替代变形和/或被清除的红细胞的网织红细胞数量。\n\n（选项A、C和E）EB病毒（包膜双链DNA病毒）、丙型肝炎病毒（包膜单链正义RNA病毒）和戊型肝炎病毒（无包膜单链正义RNA病毒）可引起造血抑制和一定程度的再生障碍性贫血（导致全血细胞减少的原因，不应与再生障碍危象混淆，后者仅限于影响红细胞）。贫血伴有正常的白细胞和血小板计数更可能发生在B19微小病毒感染中，这归因于该病毒倾向于感染原红细胞母细胞。\n\n（选项B）重要的包膜负义RNA病毒包括正粘病毒（如，流感）、副粘病毒（如，麻疹和腮腺炎）和弹状病毒（如，狂犬病）。然而，这些病毒已知不会以足够的数量感染红系祖细胞，从而显著影响红细胞生成。\n\n（选项D）无包膜双链DNA病毒包括腺病毒、乳头瘤病毒和多瘤病毒，这些病毒通常已知不会引起造血抑制或再生障碍危象。\n\n教育目标：\n在镰状细胞贫血和其他慢性溶血性疾病患者中，再生障碍危象最常见的病毒病因是B19微小病毒感染红系祖细胞，B19微小病毒是一种无包膜单链DNA病毒。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of aplastic crisis in sickle cell disease, specifically the role of parvovirus B19. It requires understanding the virus's characteristics and its impact on erythropoiesis.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the signs of aplastic crisis (severe anemia with low reticulocyte count) in a patient with sickle cell disease and associating it with parvovirus B19. Knowing the viral characteristics (nonenveloped, single-stranded DNA) is crucial for selecting the correct answer.",
