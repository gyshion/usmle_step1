    "en": "A 40-year-old man comes to the office with pain on defecation. The pain is sharp and severe but subsides within minutes of passing the bowel movement. He often sees spots of bright red blood on the toilet paper. The patient has chronic constipation and has not taken laxatives or increased his fluid intake to compensate. He has no fever, night sweats, diarrhea, or unexpected weight loss. Past medical history is notable for chronic low back pain following a motor vehicle accident, for which he takes a scheduled dose of pain relievers. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 20 years but does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. He is married and has no outside sexual contacts. Vital signs are normal. The abdomen is soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly. Rectal examination is likely to show a tear at which of the following locations?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has sharp pain and bright red rectal bleeding on defecation, suggesting an anal fissure. Anal fissures are due to stretching of the mucosa and are characterized by longitudinal tears in the anal canal distal to the dentate line (Choice B). Spasm of the sphincter can contribute to the pain and create tension across the wound, leading to a chronic fissure. Most fissures are related to chronic constipation with high anal pressures and passage of hard stools. They can also be seen with frequent diarrhea or anal sexual intercourse. In some cases, the pain may be so severe that patients withhold bowel movements, thereby exacerbating the constipation.\n\nThe majority of fissures, especially those causing prolonged symptoms, occur at the posterior midline of the anal verge. This is likely due to the relatively poor perfusion of the posterior anal canal, which makes its mucosa sensitive to trauma and slows healing times. Anterior midline fissures are less common, but may occur due to mechanical stresses related to the alignment of muscular fibers in the external sphincter (Choice A).\n\n(Choice C) Bilateral anal fissures are uncommon.\n\n(Choices D and E) Fissures not at the midline are more likely due to unusual causes (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, infection) and may warrant more detailed investigation.\n\nEducational objective:\nAnal fissures are longitudinal tears in the mucosa. They are usually due to passage of hard stool in patients with chronic constipation. Most fissures occur at the posterior midline, likely due to decreased blood flow in this area. Fissures in other areas may be due to less common causes. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该患者排便时出现剧烈疼痛和鲜红色直肠出血，提示肛裂。肛裂是由于黏膜拉伸所致，其特征是在齿状线远端的肛管纵向撕裂（选项B）。括约肌痉挛可导致疼痛并造成伤口张力，从而导致慢性裂口。大多数裂口与慢性便秘、肛门压力高和硬便通过有关。也可在频繁腹泻或肛交时出现。在某些情况下，疼痛可能非常严重，以至于患者会抑制排便，从而加重便秘。\n\n大多数裂口，尤其是那些引起长期症状的裂口，发生在肛缘的后正中线。这很可能由于肛管后部灌注不良，这使得其黏膜对创伤敏感并减缓愈合时间。前正中线裂口较少见，但可能由于与外括约肌肌肉纤维排列相关的机械应力而发生（选项A）。\n\n（选项C）双侧肛裂并不常见。\n\n（选项D和E）不在中线的裂口更可能是由不寻常原因引起的（例如，炎症性肠病、恶性肿瘤、感染），可能需要更详细的调查。\n\n教育目标：\n肛裂是黏膜的纵向撕裂。它们通常是由于慢性便秘患者的硬便通过所致。大多数裂口发生在后正中线，这可能是由于该区域的血流量减少所致。其他区域的裂口可能由于较少见的原因所致。{{exhibit_1}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of anal fissure presentation, etiology, and location. It requires understanding the pathophysiology of anal fissures and the anatomical considerations that predispose to posterior midline fissures.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the symptoms of an anal fissure (painful defecation, bright red blood), recall the common location (posterior midline), and understand the underlying cause (stretching of mucosa due to hard stools and poor perfusion).",
