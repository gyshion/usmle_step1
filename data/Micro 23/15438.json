    "en": "A 54-year-old Sudanese immigrant is evaluated for several months of intermittent dysuria and gross hematuria. The patient notes that he passes blood at the end of urination but has no associated pain. Cystoscopy reveals erythematous areas in the bladder mucosa. Multiple biopsies are taken from the affected sites; histopathological findings are shown in the image below.",

    "en": "Schistosomiasis is a parasitic blood fluke infection endemic to rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and South America. Transmission occurs when humans bathe in freshwater ponds, lakes, or rivers contaminated with cercariae from infected snails. Cercariae penetrate the dermis and travel to the liver, where they evolve into adult worms and subsequently migrate into the venules in the walls of the intestines, colon, or bladder.\n\nBecause adult schistosomes absorb host proteins and display host antigens on their surface, they are relatively protected from immune recognition and generally do not cause symptoms. However, adult worms shed eggs into the circulation that travel through host tissues and induce eosinophilic granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis (as seen in the image above). This can lead to indolent symptoms in the liver, spleen, bowel wall, and genitourinary system. One characteristic manifestation of genitourinary schistosomiasis is the development of hematuria at the end of voiding (\"terminal hematuria\") due to bladder wall inflammation and ulcers; urinary calcifications, obstruction, and bladder cancer may eventually develop.\n\n(Choice A) Benign prostatic hyperplasia can cause chronic urinary tract obstruction. Patients usually have difficulty voiding urine (eg, slow stream, hesitancy), frequency, urgency, and/or nocturia.\n\n(Choice C) Cyclophosphamide is a common cause of hemorrhagic cystitis in patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer or chronic rheumatologic conditions. Cystoscopy may show bladder irritation, but eggs would not be seen on biopsy.\n\n(Choice D) Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for the development of bladder cancer (usually transitional cell carcinoma), which classically presents with painless hematuria. However, cystoscopy generally shows a mass, and biopsy would reveal malignant cells, not eggs.\n\n(Choice E) Genitourinary infections with bacteria that split urea such as *Proteus mirabilis* are frequently associated with the formation of urinary stones. Nephrolithiasis can cause hematuria but is usually very painful.\n\nEducational objective:\nSchistosomiasis is a parasitic blood fluke infection that is associated with bathing in freshwater contaminated with cercariae from infected snails. Patients often are asymptomatic for months or years but may eventually develop eosinophilic granulomatous inflammation in the liver, spleen, gastrointestinal tract, or genitourinary system. One common manifestation of genitourinary schistosomiasis is painless terminal hematuria; eggs can often be identified in the urine or on biopsy.",
    "zh": "血吸虫病是一种寄生虫血吸虫感染，流行于撒哈拉以南非洲、亚洲和南美洲的农村地区。当人类在被感染蜗牛的尾蚴污染的淡水池塘、湖泊或河流中沐浴时，就会发生传播。尾蚴穿透真皮，到达肝脏，在那里它们进化成成虫，随后迁移到肠、结肠或膀胱壁的静脉中。\n\n由于成虫血吸虫吸收宿主蛋白并在其表面显示宿主抗原，它们相对受到免疫识别的保护，通常不会引起症状。然而，成虫将卵排出到循环中，这些卵通过宿主组织，诱导嗜酸性肉芽肿性炎症和纤维化（如上图所示）。这可能导致肝脏、脾脏、肠壁和泌尿生殖系统的迟缓症状。泌尿生殖系统血吸虫病的一个特征性表现是排尿结束时出现血尿（“终末血尿”），这是由于膀胱壁炎症和溃疡引起的；尿钙化、梗阻和膀胱癌最终可能会发展。\n\n(选项 A) 良性前列腺增生可导致慢性尿路梗阻。患者通常排尿困难（例如，尿流缓慢、犹豫）、尿频、尿急和/或夜尿。\n\n(选项 C) 环磷酰胺是接受癌症或慢性风湿病化疗的患者发生出血性膀胱炎的常见原因。膀胱镜检查可能显示膀胱刺激，但在活检中不会看到虫卵。\n\n(选项 D) 吸烟是膀胱癌（通常是移行细胞癌）发生的主要危险因素，其典型表现是无痛性血尿。然而，膀胱镜检查通常显示肿块，活检会显示恶性细胞，而不是虫卵。\n\n(选项 E) 尿素分解细菌（如奇异变形杆菌）引起的泌尿生殖系统感染，经常与尿结石的形成有关。肾结石病可引起血尿，但通常非常疼痛。\n\n教育目标：\n血吸虫病是一种寄生虫血吸虫感染，与在被感染蜗牛尾蚴污染的淡水中沐浴有关。患者通常无症状数月或数年，但最终可能会在肝脏、脾脏、胃肠道或泌尿生殖系统中出现嗜酸性肉芽肿性炎症。泌尿生殖系统血吸虫病的一个常见表现是无痛性终末血尿；通常可以在尿液或活检中鉴定出虫卵。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection caused by blood flukes, and its association with contaminated water exposure. It also tests the ability to recognize the clinical presentation of schistosomiasis, including intermittent dysuria and gross hematuria, particularly terminal hematuria. \n\nThe best approach is to consider the patient's demographic (Sudanese immigrant) and symptoms (intermittent dysuria, gross hematuria, terminal hematuria). This should raise suspicion for schistosomiasis, which is common in sub-Saharan Africa and is transmitted through contaminated water. Eliminate other options based on their typical presentations and risk factors.",
