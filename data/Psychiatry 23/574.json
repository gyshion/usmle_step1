    "en": "A 60-year-old man is found by his daughter to be confused at home. Emergency medical services are called and he is brought to the emergency department by ambulance. The patient's daughter, who accompanies him, says that she found an empty bottle of amitriptyline next to his bed. He has not been taking any other medications. In the emergency department, the patient is delirious and says that he sees small animals running around in the corner of the room. He appears flushed. The patient has a brief seizure and becomes unconscious. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 90/62 mm Hg, and pulse is 120/min. Both pupils are dilated and equally reactive to light, and his skin and mucous membranes are dry. Initial ECG shows QRS widening and QTc prolongation. He is transferred to the intensive care unit but dies despite resuscitation attempts.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's presentation is consistent with an overdose of a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), such as amitriptyline. TCAs have multiple pharmacological effects, including inhibition of sodium channels, anticholinergic effects, antihistamine effects, and blockade of norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake. In overdose, the most life-threatening effects are due to sodium channel blockade, which leads to cardiac arrhythmias and refractory hypotension. The widened QRS complex and QTc prolongation on the ECG are classic findings of TCA overdose and are directly related to sodium channel inhibition. The patient's death is most likely due to cardiac arrhythmias and refractory hypotension resulting from this effect.\n\n(Choice A) Increased antihistamine effect can cause sedation and increased appetite, but it is not the primary cause of death in TCA overdose.\n(Choice C) Synaptic norepinephrine accumulation contributes to the antidepressant effects of TCAs, but in overdose, it is not the most lethal consequence. While excessive sympathetic stimulation can occur, the cardiac conduction abnormalities are more critical.\n(Choice D) Synaptic serotonin accumulation is also a mechanism of TCA action, but serotonin syndrome, which is associated with excessive serotonin, typically presents with hyperthermia, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities, and is not the primary cause of death in TCA overdose. While some symptoms may overlap, the cardiac findings are more indicative of sodium channel blockade.\n(Choice E) TCAs do not primarily affect presynaptic dopamine release; rather, they inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Amphetamines, not TCAs, are known to increase dopamine release.\n\nKey clinical pearls: TCA overdose is a medical emergency. The most dangerous effects are cardiac, due to SODIUM CHANNEL BLOCKADE. ECG findings of WIDE QRS COMPLEX and QTc PROLONGATION are critical indicators. Treatment involves SODIUM BICARBONATE to counteract the sodium channel blockade.",
    "zh": "患者的临床表现与三环类抗抑郁药 (TCA) 过量有关，例如阿米替林。TCA具有多种药理作用，包括抑制钠通道、抗胆碱能作用、抗组胺作用以及阻断去甲肾上腺素和血清素的再摄取。在过量的情况下，最具生命威胁的作用是由于钠通道阻滞，这会导致心律失常和难治性低血压。心电图上QRS波增宽和QTc间期延长是TCA过量的典型表现，与钠通道抑制直接相关。患者死亡最有可能由于心律失常和难治性低血压，这是由这种作用引起的。\n\n（选项A）组胺效应增强可引起镇静和食欲增加，但它不是TCA过量死亡的主要原因。\n（选项C）突触去甲肾上腺素蓄积有助于TCA的抗抑郁作用，但在过量时，它不是最致命的后果。虽然可能会发生过度的交感神经兴奋，但心脏传导异常更为关键。\n（选项D）突触血清素蓄积也是TCA的作用机制，但与血清素过量相关的血清素综合征，通常表现为高热、自主神经功能不稳定和神经肌肉异常，并且不是TCA过量死亡的主要原因。虽然某些症状可能重叠，但心脏表现更表明是钠通道阻滞。\n（选项E）TCA主要不影响突触前多巴胺的释放；相反，它们抑制去甲肾上腺素和血清素的再摄取。已知安非他明（而非TCA）会增加多巴胺的释放。\n\n关键临床要点：TCA过量是一种医疗急症。最危险的后果是心脏方面的，这是由于钠通道阻滞引起的。心电图表现为QRS波增宽和QTc间期延长是关键指标。治疗涉及碳酸氢钠以对抗钠通道阻滞。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pharmacology of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and the mechanisms by which TCA overdose leads to mortality. Specifically, it assesses the knowledge of the most life-threatening effects of TCAs, particularly in the context of cardiac toxicity.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the clinical scenario as a TCA overdose based on the patient's symptoms and the empty amitriptyline bottle. Then, recall the primary pharmacological actions of TCAs and their consequences in overdose, focusing on which effect is most likely to cause death. Recognizing the ECG findings of QRS widening and QTc prolongation as hallmarks of sodium channel blockade is crucial for linking the mechanism to the outcome.",
