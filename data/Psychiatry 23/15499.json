I can't even look at myself in the mirror anymore because I'm disgusting.\" She smokes marijuana once a week and does not use alcohol or other recreational substances. BMI is 23.4 kg/m².",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's recurrent episodes of binge eating (ie, consuming an excessively large amount of food in a discrete period) associated with a sense of lack of control are consistent with binge eating disorder (BED). In BED, feelings of disgust, guilt, or depression commonly follow a binge, and this patient's report of weight dissatisfaction is typical. BED is differentiated from bulimia nervosa by the absence of compensatory behaviors (eg, self-induced vomiting, fasting, misuse of laxatives, excessive exercise) (Choice D).\n\nBED is the most common eating disorder and occurs more commonly in women. Although patients with BED are more likely to be obese, it also occurs in those with normal weight, such as this patient. Treatment approaches include psychotherapy, behavioral weight loss therapy, and pharmacotherapy.\n\n(Choice A) Anorexia nervosa is characterized by significantly low weight, intense fears of being fat despite being underweight, and distorted body image. The disorder can be subtyped as restricting or binge/purge type.\n\n(Choice C) Patients with body dysmorphic disorder are obsessively preoccupied with nonexistent or slight defects in physical appearance. It is not diagnosed in patients whose main concern is weight and who also meet criteria for an eating disorder.\n\n(Choice E) Although cannabis use is associated with increased appetite, this patient smokes marijuana only once a week, whereas her binges occur several times a week.",
    "zh": "该患者反复出现暴食（即，在特定时间段内摄入过量的食物）并伴有失控感，这与暴食症（BED）一致。在BED中，厌恶、内疚或抑郁感通常伴随暴食之后，并且该患者关于体重不满的报告是典型的。BED与神经性贪食症的区别在于没有代偿行为（例如，自我诱导呕吐、禁食、滥用泻药、过度运动）（选项D）。\n\nBED是最常见的饮食失调症，更常见于女性。虽然患有BED的患者更容易肥胖，但也发生在体重正常的人群中，如该患者。治疗方法包括心理治疗、行为减肥疗法和药物治疗。\n\n（选项A）神经性厌食症的特征是体重显著偏低、尽管体重过轻仍强烈害怕发胖以及对体像的扭曲。该疾病可分为限制型或暴食/清除型。\n\n（选项C）躯体变形障碍患者过度关注不存在或轻微的身体外观缺陷。对于主要关注体重且也符合饮食失调标准患者，不诊断该病。\n\n（选项E）虽然使用大麻与食欲增加有关，但该患者每周仅吸食一次大麻，而她的暴食每周发生数次。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the diagnostic criteria for various eating disorders, specifically differentiating between binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and anorexia nervosa based on clinical presentation.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully analyze the patient's reported behaviors, including the frequency and nature of eating episodes, the presence or absence of compensatory behaviors, and the patient's subjective feelings and body image concerns, and then match these findings to the diagnostic criteria for each disorder.",
    "zh": "本题考察对各种饮食失调症诊断标准的理解，特别是根据临床表现区分暴食症、神经性贪食症和神经性厌食症。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须仔细分析患者报告的行为，包括进食发作的频率和性质、是否存在代偿行为以及患者的主观感受和身体形象问题，然后将这些发现与每种疾病的诊断标准相匹配。"
