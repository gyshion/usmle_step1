    "en": "A researcher is interested in assessing the blood folate level of women who live in a population with a high incidence of neural tube defects. She takes a large random sample (n) of women age 18-45 and measures their blood folate levels. The researcher finds that the data are normally distributed, and she reports the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the sample. To account for sampling variation, she decides to calculate a 95% confidence interval to estimate the mean of the entire population. The researcher concludes that 2.4 to 4.6 ng/mL might be a likely range for the true, unknown population mean.",

    "en": "The 95% CI can be calculated as: CI of mean = mean ± 1.96 × (SD/√n). The SAMPLE size and the SD of the sample determine the magnitude of the variability due to sampling. As n increases, SE decreases, and the CI becomes narrower and more precise. Conversely, as the SD increases, SE increases, and the CI becomes wider and less precise. Choice A estimates use the SE of the mean, which takes into account the SD and the size of the sample (n). As such, the equation divides the SD by the square root of n. Choices C, D, and E) As noted, the SD reflects the spread of individual values in a NORMAL distribution. Multiplying the SD by a specific constant (z-score) gives us a range of values that encompass a certain proportion of the observations. The mean ± 1 × SD would cover 68% of the observations, and the mean ± 2.58 × SD would cover 99% of the observations. However, the question is asking for a 95% CI, so the equation should use a z-score of 1.96 and the SE (ie, SD/√n).",
    "zh": "95%置信区间（CI）可以计算为：均值的CI = 均值 ± 1.96 × (SD/√n)。样本量和样本的SD决定了抽样引起的变异程度。当n增加时，标准误（SE）减小，CI变得更窄，更精确。相反，当SD增加时，SE增加，CI变得更宽，精确度降低。选项A估算使用了均值的SE，其中考虑了SD和样本量(n)。因此，该公式将SD除以n的平方根。选项C、D和E) 如上所述，SD反映了正态分布中各个值的分布。将SD乘以一个特定的常数（z分数）可以得到一个包含一定比例观测值的取值范围。均值 ± 1 × SD将覆盖68%的观测值，均值 ± 2.58 × SD将覆盖99%的观测值。然而，问题要求的是95% CI，因此该公式应使用z分数为1.96和SE（即，SD/√n）。"
