    "en": "A 12-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother due to unusual nighttime behavior. The mother reports that once or twice a month over the past year she has found her daughter walking around the house between the hours of midnight and 2 AM. The mother says, \"Although her eyes are open, she appears to be in a daze and doesn't respond to me. I guide her back to bed and she goes back to sleep, but I worry that she could get hurt or fall down the stairs if I'm not there.\" The girl has no recollection of the events.",

    "en": "This girl's nighttime ambulation associated with incomplete arousal and amnesia for the event is consistent with SLEEPWALKING, a non-REM (NREM) parasomnia. Sleepwalking is more common in children, peaks at age 8-12, and often remits spontaneously. NREM-related parasomnias such as sleepwalking and sleep terrors occur during DEEP, SLOW-WAVE SLEEP. Deep, slow-wave sleep is more prominent during the first half of the night and, as a result, NREM-related parasomnias occur more commonly during this time.\n\nSleep is divided into NREM and REM sleep. Most dreams occur during REM sleep. NREM sleep is further divided into 3 substages based on depth of sleep (N1, N2, and N3). Brain waves of different frequencies are associated with different stages of sleep. DELTA WAVES (frequency up to 3.99 Hz) are characteristic of deep, slow-wave sleep (stage N3). Alpha and beta waves are characteristic of wakefulness and REM sleep (Choices A and B). K complexes and Sleep spindles are characteristic of stage N2 (light, stable sleep) (Choices D and E).\n\nEducational objective: Sleepwalking, a common non-REM parasomnia of childhood, occurs during slow-wave sleep (stage N3), which is characterized by delta waves on EEG. Sleepwalking typically occurs during the first half of the night, when slow-wave sleep is most prominent.",
    "zh": "这个女孩夜间的行走伴随着不完全的觉醒和对事件的失忆，这与梦游一致，这是一种非快速眼动（NREM）异态睡眠。梦游在儿童中更常见，高峰年龄在8-12岁，并且通常会自发缓解。与NREM相关的异态睡眠，如梦游和夜惊，发生在深度慢波睡眠期间。深度慢波睡眠在前半夜更明显，因此，与NREM相关的异态睡眠在这个时间段内更常发生。\n\n睡眠分为NREM和REM睡眠。大多数梦发生在REM睡眠期间。NREM睡眠根据睡眠深度进一步分为3个亚阶段（N1、N2和N3）。不同频率的脑波与不同的睡眠阶段相关联。δ波（频率高达3.99 Hz）是深度慢波睡眠（N3阶段）的特征。α波和β波是清醒和REM睡眠的特征（选项A和B）。K复合波和睡眠纺锤波是N2阶段（浅、稳定睡眠）的特征（选项D和E）。\n\n教育目标：梦游，一种常见的儿童非REM异态睡眠，发生在慢波睡眠（N3阶段），其特征是在脑电图上出现δ波。梦游通常发生在前半夜，此时慢波睡眠最为突出。"
