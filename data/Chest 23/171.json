    "en": "A 10-year-old boy with a history of mild, persistent asthma is brought to the office for follow-up. His asthma symptoms are controlled with an inhaled beta-agonist and inhaled glucocorticoid therapy. There is no family history of asthma, but both his parents and older brother have short stature. The patient's mother is concerned about the use of glucocorticoids because she read on the internet that they cause growth retardation. The patient's glucocorticoid medication is stopped, and he is started on a trial of inhaled cromolyn. Which of the following is the most likely site of action of this new medication? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "Bronchial constriction during an asthma exacerbation begins with MAST CELL ACTIVATION secondary to allergen interaction with IgE antibodies or nonimmune triggers (eg, exercise, cold exposure, chemical irritants). This results in the release of chemical mediators that cause immediate bronchial constriction, bronchial wall edema, and increased mucus production (early phase reaction). These mediators recruit additional inflammatory cells (eg, eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils, T lymphocytes) that lead to bronchial obstruction, which occurs several hours after the triggering event (late phase reaction).\n\nCromolyn and nedocromil INHIBIT MAST CELL DEGRANULATION and prevent release of preformed chemical mediators. These medications do not influence bronchial constriction directly; therefore, they are typically used to prevent acute attacks, rather than to treat acute exacerbations. Even though these drugs are less efficacious than inhaled glucocorticoids, they are very effective prophylactic agents for patients with seasonal symptoms, aspirin hypersensitivity, and exercise-induced asthma.\n\n(Choice A) The anti-IgE antibody, omalizumab, inhibits IgE binding to mast cells, preventing mast cell degranulation. Omalizumab is used in some patients with severe, persistent asthma to lower IgE levels and reduce allergen-induced bronchial constriction.\n\n(Choice B) Cleavage of membrane phospholipids by the enzyme phospholipase A2 leads to the formation of arachidonic acid, which is in turn converted into prostaglandins and leukotrienes. By inhibiting phospholipase A2 synthesis, glucocorticoids inhibit the release of these downstream mediators, decreasing airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation.\n\n(Choices C and D) Zileuton is a selective inhibitor of the lipoxygenase pathway that leads to decreased formation of leukotrienes. Zafirlukast and montelukast are leukotriene receptor antagonists. These agents are typically used for chronic asthma prophylaxis.\n\n(Choice F) Antihistamines are used to prevent and blunt an acute allergic response (as seen in allergic rhinitis) but have not been shown to improve bronchoconstriction in asthma. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "哮喘加重期间的支气管收缩始于肥大细胞活化，继发于过敏原与IgE抗体或非免疫触发因素（如运动、寒冷暴露、化学刺激物）的相互作用。这导致化学介质的释放，引起即刻的支气管收缩、支气管壁水肿和粘液分泌增加（早期反应）。这些介质募集额外的炎症细胞（如嗜酸性粒细胞、嗜碱性粒细胞、中性粒细胞、T淋巴细胞），导致支气管阻塞，这发生在触发事件发生数小时后（晚期反应）。\n\n色甘酸钠和奈多罗米抑制肥大细胞脱颗粒并阻止预制化学介质的释放。这些药物不直接影响支气管收缩；因此，它们通常用于预防急性发作，而不是治疗急性加重。尽管这些药物的疗效不如吸入型糖皮质激素，但它们对患有季节性症状、阿司匹林过敏和运动诱发性哮喘的患者来说是非常有效的预防剂。\n\n（选项 A）抗IgE抗体奥马利珠单抗抑制IgE与肥大细胞的结合，阻止肥大细胞脱颗粒。奥马利珠单抗用于某些患有严重、持续性哮喘的患者，以降低IgE水平并减少过敏原诱导的支气管收缩。\n\n（选项 B）酶磷脂酶A2裂解膜磷脂，导致花生四烯酸的形成，花生四烯酸又转化为前列腺素和白三烯。通过抑制磷脂酶A2的合成，糖皮质激素抑制这些下游介质的释放，从而减少气道高反应性和炎症。\n\n（选项 C 和 D）齐留通是脂氧合酶途径的选择性抑制剂，可减少白三烯的形成。扎鲁司特和孟鲁司特是白三烯受体拮抗剂。这些药物通常用于慢性哮喘预防。\n\n（选项 F）抗组胺药用于预防和减弱急性过敏反应（如变应性鼻炎中所示），但尚未显示可改善哮喘的支气管收缩。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"
