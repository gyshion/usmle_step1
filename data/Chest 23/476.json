    "en": "A 56-year-old man is evaluated for dyspnea and chest discomfort. Medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. Temperature is 37.8 C (100 F), blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 24/min. BMI is 31 kg/m². The patient undergoes a 2-part nuclear medicine test. During the first part, he breathes in a radioactive tracer and a lung scan is performed. In the second part of the test, he is given an intravenous injection of a different radioactive material while breathing normal air, and the scan is repeated. When the images are compared, a large area of the lower right lung is not visualized in the second scan. Based on the observed findings, which of the following underlying disease processes is most likely present in this patient?",

    "en": "Pulmonary embolism (PE). PEs are most commonly caused by DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS in the lower extremities that subsequently embolizes to the pulmonary vasculature. Signs and symptoms include acute-onset pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypotension. CT pulmonary angiography is typically the imaging modality of choice; however, V/Q scans {{exhibit_1}} are helpful in evaluating patients in whom angiography is contraindicated (eg, contrast allergy, renal failure).\n\nV/Q scans are 2-part studies that compare regional ventilation and perfusion. The initial phase uses a radiolabeled aerosol that is inhaled and delivered throughout the tracheobronchial tree. The second phase uses an intravenous tracer that is distributed throughout the pulmonary vasculature. The images are then overlaid for comparison. Normal results show even distribution of both radionucleotide tracers throughout the lung (ie, V/Q match). V/Q mismatch occurs when alveoli are ventilated but not perfused (ie, a defect in the perfusion phase). This pattern can be seen in diseases that increase physiologic dead space, including PULMONARY EMBOLISM (as in this patient) and malignancies that obstruct arterial blood flow.\n\n(Choices B, C, and E) Endobronchial neoplasms can cause obstruction of the airway. Left ventricular infarction can cause pulmonary edema. Exudative pleuritis causes a pleural effusion, often with compression and atelectasis of the adjacent lung. These diseases cause ventilation defects, typically with matched perfusion defects as the resulting alveolar hypoxia induces pulmonary vasoconstriction. However, this patient has isolated perfusion defects.\n\n(Choice D) Spontaneous pneumothorax would cause compression of the ipsilateral lung; V/Q scan would show decreased lung volume on ventilation and perfusion images compared to the normal lung.\n\nEducational objective:\nVentilation-perfusion (V/Q) scans use radiotracers to compare the ventilation and blood perfusion of each area of the lung. V/Q mismatch with perfusion defects are often indicative of a pulmonary embolism, which are most commonly caused by deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities that embolizes to the pulmonary vasculature.",
    "zh": "肺栓塞 (PE)。PE 最常见的原因是下肢深静脉血栓形成，随后栓塞到肺血管系统。体征和症状包括急性起病的胸膜性胸痛、呼吸短促、心动过速和低血压。CT肺动脉造影通常是首选的影像学检查方式；然而，对于禁忌血管造影的患者（例如，对比剂过敏、肾功能衰竭），V/Q扫描{{exhibit_1}} 很有帮助。\n\nV/Q 扫描是比较区域通气和灌注的 2 部分研究。初始阶段使用吸入并输送到整个气管支气管树的放射性气溶胶。第二阶段使用静脉注射示踪剂，该示踪剂分布于整个肺血管系统。然后将图像叠加进行比较。正常结果显示两种放射性核素示踪剂在整个肺部均匀分布（即，V/Q匹配）。当肺泡通气但未灌注时，发生 V/Q 失配（即，灌注相的缺陷）。这种模式可见于增加生理死腔的疾病，包括肺栓塞（如本患者）和阻塞动脉血流的恶性肿瘤。\n\n（选项 B、C 和 E）支气管内肿瘤可引起气道阻塞。左心室梗死可引起肺水肿。渗出性胸膜炎引起胸腔积液，常伴有邻近肺的受压和肺不张。这些疾病引起通气缺陷，通常伴有匹配的灌注缺陷，因为由此产生的肺泡低氧血症会引起肺血管收缩。然而，该患者仅有灌注缺陷。\n\n（选项 D）自发性气胸会导致同侧肺受压；V/Q 扫描将显示通气和灌注图像上的肺容积减少，而正常肺则不会。\n\n教育目标：\n通气-灌注 (V/Q) 扫描使用放射性示踪剂比较肺的每个区域的通气和血液灌注。具有灌注缺陷的 V/Q 失配通常表示肺栓塞，其最常见的原因是下肢深静脉血栓形成，栓塞到肺血管系统。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scans and their interpretation in the context of pulmonary embolism. It requires understanding the concept of V/Q mismatch and its significance in diagnosing pulmonary embolism.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the V/Q mismatch pattern, where ventilation is normal but perfusion is decreased. This pattern is highly suggestive of pulmonary embolism, which is often caused by deep vein thrombosis.",
