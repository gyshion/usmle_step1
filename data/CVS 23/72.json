    "en": "This patient's presentation (fever, dyspnea, and a new blowing holosystolic murmur best heard at the cardiac apex) is suggestive of mitral regurgitation due to INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS (IE). Patients with IE can develop several peripheral cutaneous or mucocutaneous stigmata of endocarditis including petechiae, splinter hemorrhages, Roth spots, Janeway lesions, and Osler nodes.\n\nJaneway lesions are nontender, macular, and erythematous lesions typically located on the palms and soles. They are the result of septic embolization from valvular vegetations and are composed of bacteria, neutrophils (microabscesses), necrotic material, and subcutaneous hemorrhage. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) A neoplastic proliferation of cells of vascular origin (eg, Kaposi sarcoma) cannot be ruled out based on the appearance of this patient's skin lesions alone. However, the overall clinical presentation is highly suggestive of bacterial endocarditis as the unifying diagnosis.\n\n(Choice B) Granulomatous inflammation can produce cutaneous lesions in miliary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and leprosy. However, the lesions do not localize preferentially to the palms.\n\n(Choice C) Osler nodes are tender, violaceous nodules typically located in the pulp of fingers and toes. The pathogenesis of Osler nodes involves immune-complex deposition in skin vessels.\n\n(Choice E) The lesions on the palms could represent primary foci of infection as might occur following focal skin abrasions/puncture or from sporotrichosis. However, this patient's new holosystolic murmur is more suggestive of mitral valve IE.\n\nEducational objective:\nJaneway lesions are nontender, macular, and erythematous lesions typically located on the palms and soles of patients with acute infective endocarditis and are the result of septic embolization from valvular vegetations. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现（发热、呼吸困难和在心尖处听诊最清楚的新吹风样全收缩期杂音）提示由于感染性心内膜炎（IE）引起的二尖瓣反流。IE患者可发生多种周围皮肤或黏膜皮肤表现，包括瘀点、刺状出血、Roth斑、Janeway病变和Osler结节。\n\nJaneway病变是无压痛性、斑疹样和红斑性病变，通常位于手掌和足底。它们是瓣膜赘生物引起的脓毒性栓塞的结果，由细菌、中性粒细胞（微脓肿）、坏死物质和皮下出血组成。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n（选项A）根据该患者的皮肤病变外观，不能排除血管源性细胞的肿瘤增生（例如，卡波西肉瘤）。然而，总体的临床表现高度提示细菌性心内膜炎作为统一诊断。\n\n（选项B）肉芽肿性炎症可在粟粒性结核病、结节病和麻风病中产生皮肤病变。然而，病变并不会优先定位在手掌上。\n\n（选项C）Osler结节是触痛性、紫罗兰色结节，通常位于手指和脚趾的末端。Osler结节的发病机制涉及免疫复合物沉积在皮肤血管中。\n\n（选项E）手掌上的病变可能代表原发感染病灶，如局部皮肤擦伤/穿刺或孢子丝菌病。然而，该患者的新全收缩期杂音更提示二尖瓣IE。\n\n教学目标：\nJaneway病变是无压痛性、斑疹样和红斑性病变，通常位于患有急性感染性心内膜炎的患者的手掌和足底，是瓣膜赘生物引起的脓毒性栓塞的结果。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the clinical presentation and cutaneous manifestations of infective endocarditis, specifically the characteristics of Janeway lesions. It requires differentiating Janeway lesions from other skin findings based on their appearance, location, and associated symptoms.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's symptoms (fever, dyspnea, new murmur) as suggestive of infective endocarditis. Then, identify the skin lesions on the palms as Janeway lesions, which are nontender and caused by septic embolization. Rule out other options based on their differing characteristics and etiologies.",
