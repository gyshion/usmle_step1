  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's gross pathology demonstrates multiple sac-like outpouchings from the sigmoid colon, which is consistent with diverticulosis. Diverticulosis occurs due to excessive colonic contractions that cause increased intraluminal pressure; this forces the mucosa and submucosa to herniate through the muscularis at naturally weak areas where the vasa recta penetrate. It is an exceedingly common disorder, particularly in Western nations, and its incidence increases with age.\n\nDiverticulosis may be clinically silent, but up to 30% of patients develop complications, including diverticular bleeding and diverticulitis. Diverticular bleeding occurs with injury to the exposed vasa recta within the colonic lumen and typically presents with painless hematochezia. Diverticulitis is caused by trapped food particles or excessive intraluminal pressure within the diverticula, leading to focal necrosis and microperforation. Patients develop abdominal pain (usually in the left lower quadrant), fever, nausea and vomiting, and alterations in bowel habits (eg, diarrhea, constipation). Diverticulitis is typically managed with antibiotics and bowel rest; however, surgery may be required for recurrent disease.\n\nThe risk for diverticular disease is increased by dietary factors, including diets high in red meat, high in fat, and low in fiber (Choice A). Other risk factors include obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking.\n\n(Choice B) Although previously thought to be associated with diverticular diseases, the ingestion of nuts, seeds, and popcorn is not correlated with increased risk of diverticulosis, diverticular bleeding, or diverticulitis.\n\n(Choice D) *Helicobacter pylori* infection is associated with peptic ulcer and gastric cancer but does not increase the risk of diverticular disease.\n\n(Choice E) Excessive alcohol intake is associated with liver cirrhosis and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus; it is not associated with diverticular disease.\n\nEducational objective:\nColonic diverticulosis refers to multiple sac-like outpouchings within the sigmoid colon. Complications include diverticular bleeding and diverticulitis. Risk factors for diverticulosis include a diet high in red meat and fat and low in fiber, as well as obesity and physical inactivity. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者的肉眼病理表现为乙状结肠出现多个囊状外突，这与憩室病一致。憩室病是由于结肠过度收缩导致管腔内压力升高所致；这迫使黏膜和黏膜下层通过肌层，在血管直肠穿透的自然薄弱区域发生疝出。这是一种非常常见的疾病，尤其是在西方国家，其发病率随着年龄的增长而增加。\n\n憩室病可能在临床上是无症状的，但多达30%的患者会发生并发症，包括憩室出血和憩室炎。憩室出血是由于结肠腔内暴露的血管直肠损伤引起的，通常表现为无痛性便血。憩室炎是由滞留的食物颗粒或憩室内过高的管腔内压力引起的，导致局灶性坏死和微穿孔。患者出现腹痛（通常在左下腹）、发烧、恶心和呕吐以及排便习惯改变（如腹泻、便秘）。憩室炎通常采用抗生素和肠道休息治疗；然而，对于复发性疾病可能需要手术。\n\n憩室病的风险因饮食因素而增加，包括高红肉、高脂肪和低纤维饮食（选项A）。其他危险因素包括肥胖、缺乏运动和吸烟。\n\n（选项B）尽管先前认为与憩室病有关，但摄入坚果、种子和爆米花与憩室病、憩室出血或憩室炎的风险增加无关。\n\n（选项D）幽门螺杆菌感染与消化性溃疡和胃癌有关，但不会增加憩室病的风险。\n\n（选项E）过量饮酒与肝硬化和食管鳞状细胞癌有关；它与憩室病无关。\n\n教育目标：\n结肠憩室病是指乙状结肠内的多个囊状外突。并发症包括憩室出血和憩室炎。憩室病的危险因素包括高红肉、高脂肪和低纤维饮食，以及肥胖和缺乏运动。{{exhibit_2}}"
