    "en": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the office due to painless nodules on his lips and tongue. The lesions appeared several months ago and have been progressively enlarging. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy 5 years ago following the discovery of a thyroid mass and takes replacement thyroid hormone. On physical examination, the patient is tall and slender with disproportionately long arms and legs. His fingers are also long and thin, and joint laxity is present. Eye examination is normal and oral inspection reveals several small, soft, flesh-colored papules on his lips and tongue. Serum TSH is within normal limits.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a marfanoid habitus—a tall and slender build with disproportionately long arms, legs, and fingers. The flesh-colored nodules on his lips and tongue are likely mucosal neuromas, which are unencapsulated, thickened proliferations of neural tissue. This patient also has a history of total thyroidectomy, which was likely due to medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). This combination of clinical findings is consistent with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN 2B), which is due to an autosomal dominant germ-line mutation in the RET proto-oncogene. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nOther possible manifestations of MEN 2B include pheochromocytoma and intestinal ganglioneuromas (which may cause constipation). The earliest manifestations of the disease often appear in childhood or adolescence. Early recognition of MEN 2B is important as almost all patients develop MTC and prophylactic thyroidectomy can be life-saving.\n\n(Choice A) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heritable connective tissue disorder characterized by skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, tissue fragility, poor wound healing, and easy bruising. There is no known association between Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and thyroid cancer or perioral nodules.\n\n(Choice B) Although this patient has a marfanoid habitus, the remainder of his presentation is more consistent with MEN 2B than Marfan syndrome. In addition, unlike true Marfan syndrome, patients with MEN 2B do not develop aortic malformations (eg, dilation) or ocular malformations (eg, ectopia lentis).\n\n(Choice C) Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by parathyroid adenomas with hyperparathyroidism, anterior pituitary gland tumors, and pancreatic endocrine tumors (the “3 Ps”). MEN 1 is not associated with thyroid cancer or perioral nodules.\n\n(Choices E and F) Neurofibromatosis type 1 is characterized by café au lait spots, cutaneous neurofibromas, axillary or inguinal freckling, optic glioma, and iris hamartomas. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (the more central form) is characterized by bilateral acoustic neuromas, brain meningiomas, and schwannomas of the dorsal roots in the spinal cord. Although this patient has (mucosal) neuromas, the remainder of his presentation is more consistent with MEN 2B.\n\nEducational objective:\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B is characterized by medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, marfanoid habitus, and oral and intestinal mucosal neuromas. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者具有马凡样体征——身材高瘦，四肢、手指不成比例地长。其唇部和舌部的肤色结节可能是黏膜神经瘤，这些是未包囊、增厚的神经组织增生。该患者还有全甲状腺切除术史，这很可能是由于甲状腺髓样癌（MTC）所致。这种临床表现的组合与多发性内分泌肿瘤病2B型（MEN 2B）相符，其病因是RET原癌基因的常染色体显性遗传生殖系突变。{{exhibit_1}} \n\nMEN 2B的其他可能表现包括嗜铬细胞瘤和肠神经节神经瘤（可能导致便秘）。该疾病最早的表现通常出现在儿童或青春期。早期识别MEN 2B很重要，因为几乎所有患者都会发生MTC，而预防性甲状腺切除术可以挽救生命。\n\n（选项A）埃勒斯-当洛斯综合征是一种遗传性结缔组织疾病，其特征是皮肤过度伸展性、关节过度活动性、组织脆弱性、伤口愈合不良和易于瘀伤。埃勒斯-当洛斯综合征与甲状腺癌或口周结节之间没有已知的关联。\n\n（选项B）虽然该患者具有马凡样体征，但他的其余表现与MEN 2B比马凡综合征更一致。此外，与真正的马凡综合征不同，MEN 2B患者不会发生主动脉畸形（例如，扩张）或眼部畸形（例如，晶状体异位）。\n\n（选项C）多发性内分泌肿瘤病1型（MEN 1）是一种常染色体显性遗传疾病，其特征是伴有甲状旁腺功能亢进的甲状旁腺腺瘤、垂体前叶肿瘤和胰腺内分泌肿瘤（“3个P”）。MEN 1与甲状腺癌或口周结节无关。\n\n（选项E和F）神经纤维瘤病1型的特征是牛奶咖啡斑、皮肤神经纤维瘤、腋窝或腹股沟雀斑、视神经胶质瘤和虹膜错构瘤。神经纤维瘤病2型（更中枢的形式）的特征是双侧听神经瘤、脑膜瘤和脊髓背根神经鞘瘤。虽然该患者有（黏膜）神经瘤，但他的其余表现与MEN 2B更一致。\n\n教育目标：\n多发性内分泌肿瘤病2B型的特征是甲状腺髓样癌、嗜铬细胞瘤、马凡样体征以及口腔和肠道黏膜神经瘤。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2B (MEN 2B), specifically its clinical presentation including marfanoid habitus, mucosal neuromas, and medullary thyroid cancer. It also requires differentiating MEN 2B from other similar conditions like Marfan syndrome and other neurocutaneous disorders.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of MEN 2B: mucosal neuromas, marfanoid habitus, and a history of thyroidectomy (likely for medullary thyroid cancer).
