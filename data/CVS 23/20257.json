    "en": "This patient with progressive dyspnea and chest tightness over a period of 2 weeks and a drop in systolic blood pressure >10 mm Hg with inspiration (ie, pulsus paradoxus) likely has subacute cardiac tamponade; uremia in the setting of advanced renal failure can lead to pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion and sometimes tamponade. Tamponade classically presents with Beck's triad of hypotension (often less prominent with subacute compared to acute tamponade), distant heart sounds, and jugular venous distension.\n\nNormally, a pressure gradient exists between the vena cava and the right side of the heart, allowing blood to fill the right atrium during diastole. With inspiration, a reduction in intrathoracic pressure pulls additional blood into the right side of the heart and the pulmonary circulation, causing normal inspiratory collapse of the inferior vena cava (IVC).\n\nWith cardiac tamponade, increasing pericardial pressure begins to compress the relatively low-pressure, right-sided heart chambers and restrict diastolic filling. The increased right-sided pressures are transmitted backward to the vena cava, causing engorgement of the IVC with decreased inspiratory collapse that can be seen on echocardiography. In addition, because the right ventricle is compressed and unable to expand during diastole, the increase in right-sided blood flow during inspiration causes the ventricular septum to bow into the left ventricle; this reduces left ventricular stroke volume during inspiration and is responsible for the observed >10 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure.\n\nAs tamponade progresses, impaired right-sided filling causes the left ventricle to receive less blood, resulting in decreased cardiac output and obstructive shock. Because the obstruction to blood flow is primarily right sided, there is no pulmonary edema and the lungs remain clear to auscultation. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices A, B, D, and E) A segmental (eg, apical) wall motion abnormality suggests myocardial ischemia or infarction, dilation of all 4 cardiac chambers is seen with dilated cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid regurgitation can occur with carcinoid syndrome, and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve is seen with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (and often exacerbates obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract). None of these conditions are expected to cause pulsus paradoxus or distant heart sounds.\n\nEducational objective:\nCardiac tamponade involves restriction of diastolic filling of the right-sided heart chambers, with engorgement and decreased inspiratory collapse of the inferior vena cava seen on echocardiography. Pulsus paradoxus (>10 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration) is commonly present with tamponade.",
    "zh": "该患者在2周内出现进行性呼吸困难和胸闷，并且吸气时收缩压下降超过10 mmHg（即反常脉），很可能患有亚急性心包填塞；晚期肾衰竭环境下的尿毒症可导致心包炎，并伴有心包积液，有时还会导致填塞。填塞的典型表现为Beck三联征：低血压（与急性填塞相比，亚急性填塞通常不那么明显）、心音遥远和颈静脉扩张。\n\n正常情况下，腔静脉和心脏右侧之间存在压力梯度，允许血液在舒张期充盈右心房。吸气时，胸腔内压力的降低将额外的血液吸入心脏右侧和肺循环，导致下腔静脉（IVC）的正常吸气性塌陷。\n\n发生心包填塞时，增加的心包压力开始压迫相对低压的右侧心腔，并限制舒张期充盈。增加的右侧压力向后传递到腔静脉，导致IVC充盈，吸气性塌陷减少，这可在超声心动图中观察到。此外，由于右心室受压且无法在舒张期扩张，吸气期间右侧血流的增加会导致室间隔弯曲进入左心室；这会减少吸气期间的左心室每搏输出量，并导致观察到的收缩压下降超过10 mmHg。\n\n随着填塞的进展，右侧充盈受损导致左心室获得的血液减少，导致心输出量下降和梗阻性休克。由于血流梗阻主要位于右侧，因此没有肺水肿，并且听诊肺部仍然清晰。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项A、B、D和E）节段性（例如，心尖）壁运动异常提示心肌缺血或梗死，所有4个心腔扩张见于扩张型心肌病，严重的三尖瓣反流可发生于类癌综合征，二尖瓣收缩期前移见于肥厚型心肌病（并且通常会加剧左心室流出道梗阻）。这些情况均不会引起反常脉或心音遥远。\n\n教育目标：\n心包填塞涉及限制右侧心腔的舒张期充盈，在超声心动图上可见下腔静脉充盈和吸气性塌陷减少。反常脉（吸气时收缩压下降>10 mmHg）通常存在于填塞中。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cardiac tamponade, its etiology (uremia secondary to chronic kidney disease), clinical presentation (Beck's triad, pulsus paradoxus), and echocardiographic findings (engorged IVC). It also requires differentiating cardiac tamponade from other cardiac conditions based on clinical and echocardiographic findings.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key findings of pulsus paradoxus and distant heart sounds in a patient with chronic kidney disease.
