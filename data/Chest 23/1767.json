    "en": "A 34-year-old man with HIV comes to the emergency department due to fever, chills, productive cough, and left-sided chest pain that worsens with deep breathing. His symptoms began 3 days ago and have progressively worsened. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 4 years ago during routine screening, and he takes antiretroviral therapy. His CD4 count was 480 cells/mm³ a month ago. Temperature is 38.8 C (102 F), blood pressure is 110/66 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 22/min. Physical examination shows dullness to percussion, bronchial breath sounds, and crackles over the left lower lung. The right lung and cardiac auscultation findings are normal. Laboratory testing reveals an elevated leukocyte count with left shift.",

    "en": "Although HIV is classically associated with impairment to the cell-mediated immune response, the virus also dramatically hampers the production of opsonizing antibodies and the recruitment of phagocytes to areas of infection. Therefore, patients with HIV are at much greater risk for INVASIVE BACTERIAL INFECTIONS, particularly with encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nS pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals, and usually presents with acute-onset fever, productive cough, leukocytosis, and signs of lobar consolidation (eg, dullness to percussion, crackles). S pneumoniae is also a frequent cause of sepsis and bacterial meningitis. To reduce the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, all patients with HIV should be immunized with the pneumococcal vaccination, which provides immunity to the most common strains.\n\n(Choice A) Although invasive Aspergillus is much more common in patients with HIV, it primarily affects those with extremely low CD4 counts (<50/mm³). Fever, cough, shortness of breath, and nodular or cavitary pulmonary infiltrate often occurs.\n\n(Choice B) Influenza usually causes acute-onset fever, malaise, myalgias, and headache. Manifestations of lobar consolidation would be atypical and would likely indicate an influenza complication (eg, secondary pneumonia). Patients with HIV should receive yearly influenza vaccination.\n\n(Choice C) Legionella is a common cause of atypical pneumonia and is far more common in patients with HIV than the general population. Although Legionella often causes lobar consolidation, most cases are marked by several days of gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, vomiting, diarrhea) prior to developing pulmonary symptoms.\n\n(Choice D) Patients with HIV are at much greater risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, which usually presents over several weeks (not days) with cough, low-grade fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Active pulmonary tuberculosis is usually characterized by cavitary disease in the upper lobes of the lung; signs of lower lobe consolidation would be atypical.\n\n(Choice E) Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a leading cause of \"walking pneumonia,\" a form of atypical pneumonia. \"Walking pneumonia\" usually presents with several weeks (not days) of nonproductive cough and malaise. The infection usually affects multiple lobes of lung and causes a bilateral patchy infiltrate on chest x-ray.\n\n(Choice F) Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is common in patients with HIV, but occurs primarily in those with CD4 counts <200/mm³ (unlike this patient). It usually presents with several weeks (not days) of slowly worsening dyspnea and fever. In addition, PCP usually affects both lungs and appears as bilateral reticulonodular pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray.",
    "zh": "尽管HIV通常与细胞介导的免疫反应受损有关，但该病毒也会显著阻碍调理抗体的产生和吞噬细胞向感染部位的募集。因此，HIV感染者罹患侵袭性细菌感染的风险要高得多，尤其是被膜菌，如肺炎链球菌。\n\n肺炎链球菌是HIV感染者和未感染者社区获得性肺炎最常见的原因，通常表现为急性发热、有痰咳嗽、白细胞增多和肺叶实变的体征（如叩诊浊音、啰音）。肺炎链球菌也是脓毒症和细菌性脑膜炎的常见病因。为了降低侵袭性肺炎球菌病的风险，所有HIV感染者都应接种肺炎球菌疫苗，该疫苗可对最常见的菌株提供免疫力。\n\n（选项A）尽管侵袭性曲霉在HIV感染者中更为常见，但它主要影响CD4计数极低的患者（<50个/mm³）。通常会出现发热、咳嗽、呼吸急促和结节性或空洞性肺浸润。\n\n（选项B）流感通常引起急性发热、不适、肌痛和头痛。肺叶实变的表现是不典型的，可能表明流感并发症（例如继发性肺炎）。HIV感染者应每年接种流感疫苗。\n\n（选项C）军团菌是社区获得性肺炎的常见病因，在HIV感染者中的发病率远高于普通人群。虽然军团菌常引起肺叶实变，但大多数病例在出现肺部症状前有几天的胃肠道症状（如呕吐、腹泻）。\n\n（选项D）HIV感染者罹患结核分枝杆菌感染的风险要高得多，通常在几周（不是几天）内出现咳嗽、低热、体重减轻和疲劳。活动性肺结核通常的特征是肺上叶空洞性病变；肺下叶实变的体征是不典型的。\n\n（选项E）肺炎支原体是“非典型肺炎”的主要病因。“非典型肺炎”通常表现为几周（不是几天）的无痰咳嗽和不适。感染通常影响多个肺叶，并在胸部X光片上引起双侧斑片状浸润。\n\n（选项F）肺孢子菌肺炎（PCP）在HIV感染者中很常见，但主要发生在CD4计数<200个/mm³的患者中（与本患者不同）。它通常表现为几周（不是几天）逐渐恶化的呼吸困难和发热。此外，PCP通常影响双肺，并在胸部X光片上表现为双侧网状结节性肺浸润。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of common causes of community-acquired pneumonia in HIV-positive patients, focusing on the importance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and its clinical presentation. It also assesses understanding of other potential pathogens and their distinguishing features. \n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's CD4 count, the acute onset of symptoms, and the presence of lobar consolidation. Rule out organisms more common in patients with lower CD4 counts or those with atypical presentations.",
