He was going over some papers at work when he suddenly felt nauseated and started vomiting up bright red blood. Physical examination reveals a palpable spleen. Endoscopy shows bleeding esophageal varices. A liver biopsy performed 2 days later shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Portal vein thrombosis {{exhibit_1}}\n\nThis patient is exhibiting signs of portal hypertension, including esophageal varices and splenic enlargement. Varices form in portal hypertension due to increased hydrostatic pressure in the portal system that causes blood to be shunted through portocaval anastomoses. This patient's normal liver biopsy indicates that a presinusoidal process is responsible for the portal hypertension. Portal vein thrombosis causes obstruction in portal venous flow upstream to the liver, causing portal hypertension while not affecting the liver parenchyma. Ascites is uncommon with portal vein thrombosis since sinusoidal hypertension does not develop.\n\n(Choice A) Acetaminophen toxicity causes centrilobular hepatic necrosis and liver failure 24-48 hours following ingestion, depending on the amount consumed. This process would be obvious on liver biopsy.\n\n(Choice B) Long-term alcohol consumption can causes hepatic cirrhosis, which can cause portal hypertension. However, hepatocyte injury and fibrosis would be evident on liver biopsy. Mallory-Weiss tears can also occur with heavy alcohol use; however, mucosal lacerations (not varices) would be seen on endoscopy.\n\n(Choice C) In Budd-Chiari syndrome, there is occlusion of the hepatic vein, which drains from the liver and portal circulation into the systemic circulation. Liver biopsy shows centrilobular congestion and fibrosis.\n\n(Choice D) Constrictive pericarditis causes blood to back up in the systemic venous circulation due to decreased cardiac output. This increases pressure within the liver in much the same way as Budd-Chiari syndrome and would present with similar findings.\n\nEducational objective:\nPortal vein thrombosis causes portal hypertension, splenomegaly, and varicosities at portocaval anastomoses. It does not cause histologic changes to the hepatic parenchyma. Ascites is uncommon as the obstruction is presinusoidal; ascites typically only develops in conditions that cause sinusoidal hypertension.",
    "zh": "门静脉血栓形成 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n该患者表现出门静脉高压的征象，包括食管静脉曲张和脾脏肿大。静脉曲张形成于门静脉高压症，这是由于门静脉系统中静水压升高，导致血液通过门体吻合分流所致。该患者正常的肝活检表明，肝窦前过程是门静脉高压的原因。门静脉血栓形成导致门静脉血流在肝脏上游发生梗阻，引起门静脉高压，但不影响肝实质。门静脉血栓形成时腹水并不常见，因为肝窦高压不会发生。\n\n(选项 A) 对乙酰氨基酚中毒可在摄入后24-48小时引起肝小叶中心性肝坏死和肝功能衰竭，这取决于摄入量。这种病变在肝活检中很明显。\n\n(选项 B) 长期饮酒可引起肝硬化，可导致门静脉高压。然而，肝细胞损伤和纤维化在肝活检中可见。Mallory-Weiss 撕裂也可发生于大量饮酒；然而，在内镜检查中可见粘膜撕裂（而非静脉曲张）。\n\n(选项 C) 在 Budd-Chiari 综合征中，肝静脉发生闭塞，肝静脉将血液从肝脏和门静脉循环引流到体循环中。肝活检显示肝小叶中心性充血和纤维化。\n\n(选项 D) 缩窄性心包炎导致血液因心输出量降低而回流到体静脉循环中。这增加了肝脏内的压力，与 Budd-Chiari 综合征的情况大致相同，并会表现出相似的发现。\n\n教育目标：\n门静脉血栓形成导致门静脉高压、脾肿大和门体吻合处的静脉曲张。它不会引起肝实质的组织学改变。腹水并不常见，因为梗阻是肝窦前的；腹水通常仅发生在引起肝窦高压的疾病中。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the causes and presentation of portal hypertension, specifically focusing on portal vein thrombosis as a presinusoidal cause. It requires differentiating between various etiologies of portal hypertension based on clinical findings and liver biopsy results. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the signs of portal hypertension (esophageal varices, splenomegaly) and the significance of a normal liver biopsy. This points towards a presinusoidal cause, making portal vein thrombosis the most likely diagnosis.",
