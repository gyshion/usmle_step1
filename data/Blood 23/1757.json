    "en": "Sore throat, moderate to high fever, palatal petechiae, lymphadenopathy (commonly posterior cervical or auricular), splenomegaly, and atypical (reactive) lymphocytosis are classic signs and symptoms of infectious mononucleosis, a disease common among teenagers and young adults. Ninety percent of cases of infectious mononucleosis are caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV); however, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and Toxoplasma are some of the other agents known to cause non-EBV infectious mononucleosis. EBV infection induces heterophile antibodies, which react to antigens from animal erythrocytes (sheep in the Paul-Bunnell test and horse in the Monospot test). The heterophile antibody tests are sensitive and specific for EBV-associated infectious mononucleosis.\n\nEBV replicates primarily in B lymphocytes and is also associated with malignancies, including Burkitt lymphoma (especially the endemic African type) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Many disorders in immunocompromised patients are caused by EBV, including central nervous system lymphoma in HIV-positive patients and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in allograft recipients.\n\n(Choices A and F) There is no classic association between acute myeloid leukemia or multiple myeloma and viral infection.\n\n(Choice B) Cervical carcinoma is strongly associated with human papillomavirus (types 16, 18, 31, and 33) infection.\n\n(Choice C) Chronic infection with either hepatitis B or C virus significantly increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n(Choice D) Kaposi sarcoma is strongly associated with HIV and human herpes virus type 8 infections.\n\n(Choice E) Gastric adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue tumor (MALToma) are associated with Helicobacter pylori infection.",
    "zh": "咽喉痛、中度至高烧、腭部瘀点、淋巴结肿大（通常为后颈或耳部）、脾肿大和非典型（反应性）淋巴细胞增多症是传染性单核细胞增多症的典型体征和症状，这种疾病常见于青少年和年轻人。百分之九十的传染性单核细胞增多症病例由 Epstein-Barr 病毒 (EBV) 引起；然而，巨细胞病毒、HIV 和弓形虫是一些已知可引起非 EBV 感染性单核细胞增多症的其他病原体。EBV 感染诱导异嗜性抗体，异嗜性抗体与动物红细胞的抗原发生反应（Paul-Bunnell 试验中的绵羊和 Monospot 试验中的马）。异嗜性抗体试验对 EBV 相关性传染性单核细胞增多症具有敏感性和特异性。\n\nEBV 主要在 B 淋巴细胞中复制，并且还与恶性肿瘤有关，包括伯基特淋巴瘤（尤其是地方性非洲型）和鼻咽癌。免疫功能低下的患者的许多疾病是由 EBV 引起的，包括 HIV 阳性患者的中枢神经系统淋巴瘤和同种异体移植受者的移植后淋巴细胞增殖性疾病 (PTLD)。\n\n（选项 A 和 F）急性髓细胞性白血病或多发性骨髓瘤与病毒感染之间没有经典的关联。\n\n（选项 B）宫颈癌与人乳头瘤病毒（16、18、31 和 33 型）感染密切相关。\n\n（选项 C）慢性乙型或丙型肝炎病毒感染会显著增加肝细胞癌的风险。\n\n（选项 D）卡波西肉瘤与 HIV 和人疱疹病毒 8 型感染密切相关。\n\n（选项 E）胃腺癌和黏膜相关淋巴组织肿瘤 (MALToma) 与幽门螺杆菌感染有关。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and its association with certain malignancies, specifically nasopharyngeal carcinoma. It also assesses understanding of heterophile antibodies and their role in diagnosing EBV infection.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of infectious mononucleosis (fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, palatal petechiae) and the presence of heterophile antibodies. Recall that EBV is associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试了对 Epstein-Barr 病毒 (EBV) 引起的传染性单核细胞增多症的了解，以及它与某些恶性肿瘤（特别是鼻咽癌）的关系。它还评估了对异嗜性抗体及其在诊断 EBV 感染中的作用的理解。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要认识到传染性单核细胞增多症的临床表现（发烧、喉咙痛、淋巴结肿大、脾肿大、腭部瘀点）和异嗜性抗体的存在。回想一下 EBV 与鼻咽癌有关。"
