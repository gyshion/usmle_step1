    "en": "A 57-year-old man comes to the office accompanied by his wife for follow-up of Parkinson disease. The patient reports no change in motor symptoms, and the disease has been well controlled with anti-Parkinson medication. However, his wife is very concerned about a change in behavior, reporting that he recently started gambling and has lost a significant amount of their savings. The patient drives several hours multiple times a week to gamble at a casino in a neighboring state. His only other medical condition is major depressive disorder for which he takes sertraline. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a mild resting hand tremor and minimal rigidity.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Parkinson disease (PD) is caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia, resulting in symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity. Dopaminergic medications used to treat PD have been associated with the abrupt onset of **impulse control disorders**, including **pathological gambling**, compulsive buying, and compulsive sexual behavior. **Dopamine agonists** (eg, pramipexole) as a class are most frequently associated with this adverse effect. These drugs act by binding to central dopamine receptors and stimulating dopamine activity in the ventral striatum (includes the **nucleus accumbens**, which is involved in motivation and **reward pathways**) and substantia nigra.\n\nPatients on dopamine agonist therapy should be monitored for dysfunctional impulse control. Gradual taper of the offending agent results in improvement in most cases.\n\n(Choice A) Decreased peripheral conversion of levodopa is the mechanism of action of carbidopa, a drug used in combination with levodopa (a dopamine precursor) to increase the availability of levodopa in the central nervous system. Compared to dopamine agonists, carbidopa-levodopa is much less likely to precipitate impulse control disorders.\n\n(Choice B) Increasing norepinephrine levels in the synaptic cleft is the mechanism of action of atomoxetine, a nonstimulant medication used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\n(Choice C) Increasing serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft is the mechanism of action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, sertraline). These medications are not associated with the onset of impulse control disorders and have actually been shown to decrease impulsivity.\n\n(Choice E) Upregulation of brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is a neuroadaptive response to the receptor desensitization that occurs with chronic repeated exposure to high levels of nicotine.\n\nEducational objective:\nDopamine agonist medications used to treat Parkinson disease have been associated with the abrupt onset of impulse control disorders, including pathological gambling, compulsive buying, and compulsive sexual behavior. The behavior is thought to be mediated by stimulation of central dopamine receptors.",
    "zh": "帕金森病 (PD) 是由基底神经节多巴胺能神经元的损失引起的，导致运动迟缓、震颤和僵硬等症状。用于治疗 PD 的多巴胺能药物与**冲动控制障碍**的突然发病有关，包括**病理性赌博**、强迫性购物和强迫性性行为。**多巴胺激动剂**（例如，普拉克索）作为一类药物，与这种不良反应最为相关。这些药物通过与中枢多巴胺受体结合并在腹侧纹状体（包括涉及动机和**奖赏通路**的**伏隔核**）和黑质中刺激多巴胺活性而起作用。\n\n接受多巴胺激动剂治疗的患者应监测功能失调的冲动控制。在大多数情况下，逐渐减少导致问题的药物剂量可改善病情。\n\n（选项 A）左旋多巴外周转化减少是卡比多巴的起效机制，卡比多巴与左旋多巴（一种多巴胺前体）联合使用，以增加中枢神经系统中左旋多巴的利用率。与多巴胺激动剂相比，卡比多巴-左旋多巴更不可能诱发冲动控制障碍。\n\n（选项 B）增加突触间隙的去甲肾上腺素水平是托莫西汀的起效机制，托莫西汀是一种用于治疗注意力缺陷多动障碍的非兴奋剂药物。\n\n（选项 C）增加突触间隙的血清素水平是选择性血清素再摄取抑制剂（例如，舍曲林）的起效机制。这些药物与冲动控制障碍的发生无关，事实上已被证明可以降低冲动性。\n\n（选项 E）大脑烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体上调是对长期反复暴露于高水平尼古丁而发生的受体脱敏的神经适应性反应。\n\n教育目标：\n用于治疗帕金森病的多巴胺激动剂药物与冲动控制障碍的突然发病有关，包括病理性赌博、强迫性购物和强迫性性行为。这种行为被认为是由中枢多巴胺受体的刺激介导的。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of impulse control disorders associated with dopamine agonist medications used in Parkinson's disease. It assesses the ability to recognize the link between dopamine agonist therapy and the development of pathological gambling.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's Parkinson's disease treatment and the new onset of gambling behavior. Recall that dopamine agonists are known to cause impulse control disorders through stimulation of central dopamine receptors.",
