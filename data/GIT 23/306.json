    "en": "A 43-year-old man comes to the office with a several-month history of fatigue, rash, flushing, and abdominal cramps. His rash is worse with rubbing or scratching, and he has diffuse itching after hot showers. The patient is frequently dizzy and light-headed after prolonged standing and had an episode of syncope while working in the hot sun. He used to be healthy and physically active but has had to reduce his normal activity. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are normal. Skin examination shows a maculopapular rash. Skin biopsy shows large clusters of mast cells that are positive for KIT (CD 117).",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Gastric acid secretion by parietal cells in the fundus and body of the stomach is stimulated by:\n\n1.  Histamine binds H₁ receptors and increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentration.\n2.  Acetylcholine binds M₁ muscarinic receptors and leads to an increase in intracellular calcium.\n3.  Gastrin binds to the cholecystokinin B receptor and increases the intracellular calcium concentration. It also stimulates histamine synthesis and release by enterochromaffin-like cells in the stomach.\n\nIntracellular calcium and cAMP activate protein kinases and lead to increased transport of H⁺ by H⁺/K⁺-ATPase into the gastric lumen.\n\nIn systemic mastocytosis, clonal mast cell proliferation occurs in the bone marrow, skin, and other organs. Mast cell proliferation often is associated with mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase. These cells are characterized by prominent expression of mast cell tryptase. Excessive histamine release from degranulation of mast cells mediates many of the symptoms of the disease, such as syncope, flushing, hypotension, pruritus, and urticaria. In addition, histamine induces gastric acid secretion, which can lead to gastric ulceration. The excess acid also inactivates pancreatic and intestinal enzymes, causing diarrhea. Other gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices A, B, and F) Gastric mucosal atrophy often results from colonization with Helicobacter pylori. It can also be caused by autoimmune gastritis, which may lead to pernicious anemia due to loss of intrinsic factor from parietal cells. Symptoms of atrophic gastritis may include nausea, indigestion, and epigastric discomfort, but this patient's skin symptoms are more consistent with mastocytosis.\n\n(Choice D) Gastric hypomotility (gastroparesis) occurs with diabetes mellitus, uremia, hypothyroidism, and other metabolic disorders. Gastroparesis causes constipation, early satiety, and food stasis with vomiting.\n\n(Choice E) Pancreatic endocrine tumors may secrete gastrin (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), insulin (hypoglycemia), glucagon (hyperglycemia, rash), somatostatin (diarrhea, cholelithiasis, hyperglycemia), or vasoactive intestinal peptide (watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, achlorhydria). These disorders would not be associated with excess mast cells in the skin.\n\nEducational objective:\nSystemic mastocytosis is characterized by the abnormal proliferation of mast cells and increased histamine release. Histamine causes hypersecretion of gastric acid by parietal cells in the stomach as well as a variety of other symptoms (eg, hypotension, flushing, pruritus).",
    "zh": "胃底和胃体的壁细胞分泌胃酸受到以下因素刺激：\n\n1.  组胺与H₁受体结合并增加细胞内环磷酸腺苷 (cAMP) 浓度。\n2.  乙酰胆碱与M₁毒蕈碱受体结合，导致细胞内钙离子增加。\n3.  胃泌素与胆囊收缩素B受体结合，增加细胞内钙离子浓度。它还刺激胃内嗜铬样细胞合成和释放组胺。\n\n细胞内钙离子和cAMP激活蛋白激酶，导致H⁺通过H⁺/K⁺-ATPase向胃腔内转运增加。\n\n在系统性肥大细胞增多症中，肥大细胞的克隆性增殖发生在骨髓、皮肤和其他器官中。肥大细胞增殖通常与KIT受体酪氨酸激酶的突变有关。这些细胞的特征是肥大细胞类胰蛋白酶的突出表达。肥大细胞脱颗粒释放过多的组胺介导了该疾病的许多症状，如晕厥、潮红、低血压、瘙痒和荨麻疹。此外，组胺诱导胃酸分泌，可导致胃溃疡。过多的酸也会使胰酶和肠酶失活，引起腹泻。其他胃肠道症状包括恶心、呕吐和腹部绞痛。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项A、B和F）胃黏膜萎缩通常由幽门螺杆菌定植引起。它也可能由自身免疫性胃炎引起，后者可能因壁细胞的内因子丧失而导致恶性贫血。萎缩性胃炎的症状可能包括恶心、消化不良和上腹部不适，但该患者的皮肤症状与肥大细胞增多症更为一致。\n\n（选项D）胃动力不足（胃轻瘫）发生于糖尿病、尿毒症、甲状腺功能减退和其他代谢性疾病。胃轻瘫引起便秘、早饱、食物停滞和呕吐。\n\n（选项E）胰腺内分泌肿瘤可能分泌胃泌素（卓-艾综合征）、胰岛素（低血糖）、胰高血糖素（高血糖、皮疹）、生长抑素（腹泻、胆石症、高血糖）或血管活性肠肽（水样腹泻、低钾血症、无胃酸症）。这些疾病不会与皮肤中过多的肥大细胞相关。\n\n教育目的：\n系统性肥大细胞增多症的特征是肥大细胞异常增殖和组胺释放增加。组胺会引起胃壁细胞分泌胃酸过多以及各种其他症状（例如，低血压、潮红、瘙痒）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of systemic mastocytosis and its associated symptoms, particularly the role of histamine release in causing gastric hypersecretion. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of mastocytosis (rash, flushing, abdominal cramps) and linking it to the pathophysiological mechanism of histamine-induced gastric acid production. \n\nThe key to solving this question is to identify the underlying condition based on the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings. Recognizing that systemic mastocytosis involves mast cell proliferation and histamine release allows one to deduce the likely consequence of gastric hypersecretion.",
