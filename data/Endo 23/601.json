  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The term somatostatin was originally applied to the 14-aminoacid cyclic peptide that is secreted by the hypothalamus and that inhibits the production of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary gland. Somatostatin is now known to be secreted from other parts of the central nervous system and from pancreatic delta cells. Somatostatin secreted from pancreatic \"delta cells\" decreases the secretion of secretin, cholecystokinin, glucagon, insulin, and gastrin. Somatostatinomas are rare pancreatic islet cell tumors that arise from delta cells. Patients with somatostatinomas present with hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, steatorrhea (excessive fat in the feces), and gallbladder stones. Gallbladder stones form because of poor gallbladder contractility, which is secondary to inhibition of cholecystokinin release.\n\n(Choices C and D) Somatostatin decreases the release of glucagon as well as insulin. However, the secretion of insulin is more profoundly inhibited than is glucagon; therefore, the net result is hyperglycemia.\n\n(Choice A) Steatorrhea results from the decreased secretion of secretin as well as a decrease in gastrointestinal motility.\n\n(Choice E) A decrease in gastrin release causes hypochlorhydria.\n\n(Choice F) As indicated above, somatostatin does decrease growth hormone secretion from the normal pituitary gland, and it does so in growth-hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas. However, somatostatin cannot be used in clinical practice because of its extremely short half-life. Somatostatin analogs (octreotide and lanreotide) have a longer plasma half-life and are available for clinical use.\n\nEducational Objective:\nReduced gallbladder contractility, due to decreased cholecystokinin secretion, is responsible for biliary stones in patients with somatostatinoma.",
    "zh": "生长抑素一词最初用于指由下丘脑分泌的14个氨基酸环肽，它抑制垂体前叶生长激素的产生。现在已知生长抑素由中枢神经系统的其他部位和胰腺δ细胞分泌。由胰腺“δ细胞”分泌的生长抑素减少了促胰液素、胆囊收缩素、胰高血糖素、胰岛素和胃泌素的分泌。生长抑素瘤是罕见的胰岛细胞肿瘤，起源于δ细胞。生长抑素瘤患者表现为高血糖或低血糖、脂肪泻（粪便中脂肪过多）和胆结石。胆结石的形成是由于胆囊收缩力差，这是继发于胆囊收缩素释放的抑制。\n\n（选项C和D）生长抑素减少胰高血糖素和胰岛素的释放。然而，胰岛素的分泌比胰高血糖素受到更强的抑制；因此，最终结果是高血糖症。\n\n（选项A）脂肪泻是由促胰液素分泌减少以及胃肠蠕动减弱引起的。\n\n（选项E）胃泌素释放减少会导致胃酸缺乏。\n\n（选项F）如上所述，生长抑素确实会减少正常垂体分泌生长激素，并且在分泌生长激素的垂体腺瘤中也是如此。然而，由于其极短的半衰期，生长抑素不能用于临床实践。生长抑素类似物（奥曲肽和兰瑞肽）具有更长的血浆半衰期，可供临床使用。\n\n教育目标：\n由于胆囊收缩素分泌减少，胆囊收缩力降低，是生长抑素瘤患者胆结石的原因。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of somatostatin's effects on hormone secretion and its clinical manifestations, particularly the association with gallbladder stones due to decreased cholecystokinin secretion. It also assesses understanding of the pathophysiology of somatostatinomas.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that somatostatin inhibits the release of several hormones, including cholecystokinin. Recognize that decreased cholecystokinin leads to poor gallbladder contractility, predisposing to biliary stone formation. Eliminate options that are not directly related to gallbladder function or are increased by somatostatin.",
