    "en": "Researchers are studying the structure and function of hemoglobin. Arterial and venous blood samples are obtained from enrolled volunteers with no health problems. Red blood cells are isolated from whole blood by differential centrifugation, and the contents of the intact red blood cells are analyzed. It is found that the concentration of chloride is much lower in the red blood cells in the arterial sample compared to the venous sample.",

    "en": "Hemoglobin is only found within red blood cells (RBCs), and it is responsible not only for O₂ delivery to the tissues, but also for carrying CO₂ from the tissues to the lungs. Hemoglobin carries CO₂ in the form of carbaminohemoglobin, which is created as follows:\n\nCO₂ + Hb-NH₃ ⇌ H⁺ + Hb-NH-CO₂\n\nHowever, only a small percentage of total blood CO₂ is carried by hemoglobin. The majority of total blood CO₂ is carried in the plasma as bicarbonate ion (HCO₃⁻) via the following process: {{exhibit_1}}\n\n*   The CO₂ produced by tissue metabolism enters RBCs and is hydrated by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase to form carbonic acid (H₂CO₃).\n*   H₂CO₃ then undergoes spontaneous conversion to HCO₃⁻ and H⁺.\n*   The excess HCO₃⁻ is then transferred out of RBCs into the plasma via band 3 protein in exchange for chloride ions (Cl⁻) to maintain electrical neutrality. This exchange is known as \"chloride shift\" and is the principal cause of high RBC chloride content in venous blood.\n\n(Choice A) Bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) mutase converts 1,3-BPG to 2,3-BPG. In RBCs, 2,3-BPG combines with hemoglobin to decrease its affinity for O₂ and facilitate O₂ unloading in the tissues.\n\n(Choices C and E) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is the first enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (produces NADPH) and pyruvate kinase catalyzes the final step of glycolysis (produces ATP). Deficiency of either glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase or pyruvate kinase typically leads to shortened RBC lifespan and episodic hemolysis triggered by oxidative stressors.\n\n(Choice D) Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase is responsible for the maintenance of ionic concentration gradients across the plasma membrane in many cells in the body. This energy-requiring pump is electrogenic as it extrudes 3 sodium ions for every 2 potassium ions that enter the cell, which creates negative intracellular potential.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe majority of CO₂ produced in the tissues is transported to the lungs as bicarbonate ion (HCO₃⁻). Within red blood cells (RBCs), the enzyme carbonic anhydrase forms HCO₃⁻ from CO₂ and water. The excess HCO₃⁻ is then transferred out of RBCs into the plasma via exchange with chloride ions (Cl⁻). This exchange is known as \"chloride shift\" and is the principal cause of high RBC chloride content in venous blood.",
    "zh": "血红蛋白仅存在于红细胞（RBC）中，它不仅负责向组织输送O₂，还负责将CO₂从组织输送到肺。血红蛋白以氨基甲酰血红蛋白的形式携带CO₂，其产生过程如下：\n\nCO₂ + Hb-NH₃ ⇌ H⁺ + Hb-NH-CO₂\n\n然而，只有一小部分总血CO₂由血红蛋白携带。 大部分总血CO₂以碳酸氢根离子（HCO₃⁻）的形式在血浆中被携带，通过以下过程：{{exhibit_1}}\n\n*   组织代谢产生的CO₂进入红细胞，并被酶碳酸酐酶水合形成碳酸（H₂CO₃）。\n*   H₂CO₃随后自发转化为HCO₃⁻和H⁺。\n*   过量的HCO₃⁻随后通过带3蛋白从红细胞转移到血浆中，以交换氯离子（Cl⁻），以维持电中性。 这种交换被称为“氯离子转移”，是静脉血中红细胞氯化物含量高的主要原因。\n\n（选项A）二磷酸甘油酸 (BPG) 变位酶将1,3-BPG转化为2,3-BPG。 在红细胞中，2,3-BPG与血红蛋白结合，降低其对O₂的亲和力，并促进组织中的O₂释放。\n\n（选项C和E）葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶是戊糖磷酸途径中的第一个酶（产生NADPH），丙酮酸激酶催化糖酵解的最后一步（产生ATP）。 葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶或丙酮酸激酶的缺乏通常会导致红细胞寿命缩短，并由氧化应激原触发阵发性溶血。\n\n（选项D）Na⁺/K⁺-ATP酶负责维持体内许多细胞中跨细胞膜的离子浓度梯度。 这种需要能量的泵是生电的，因为它排出3个钠离子，而每进入细胞2个钾离子，这会产生负的细胞内电位。\n\n教学目标：\n组织中产生的大部分CO₂以碳酸氢根离子（HCO₃⁻）的形式输送到肺。 在红细胞（RBC）内，酶碳酸酐酶由CO₂和水形成HCO₃⁻。 然后，过量的HCO₃⁻通过与氯离子（Cl⁻）交换从红细胞转移到血浆中。 这种交换被称为“氯离子转移”，是静脉血中红细胞氯化物含量高的主要原因。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the chloride shift, a process where bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) are exchanged for chloride ions (Cl-) across the red blood cell membrane, and the role of carbonic anhydrase in this process. It also tests understanding of the differences in chloride concentration between arterial and venous blood. \n\nTo solve this question, understand that the chloride shift occurs in red blood cells to maintain electrical neutrality during CO2 transport. Carbonic anhydrase facilitates the conversion of CO2 to bicarbonate, which then exits the cell in exchange for chloride, leading to higher chloride concentration in venous blood.",
