    "en": "A 35-year-old woman comes to the office for evaluation of anxiety. The patient works as a mechanical engineer and recently declined a promotion to be a project manager. Although her salary would have increased significantly, she felt that overseeing other employees and leading team meetings would be too stressful. She says, \"If something were to go wrong, everyone would blame me. I don't even know why they offered me this position.\" The patient enjoys her job but tends to eat lunch by herself because she feels that her coworkers do not like her appearance or sense of humor. She has never had a long-term romantic partner but fantasizes about getting married someday. The patient lives alone, rarely socializes with friends, and is close with her mother, whom she describes as \"the person I can always rely on no matter what.\"",
    "zh": "一名35岁的女性来到诊所，寻求焦虑评估。患者是一名机械工程师，最近拒绝了晋升为项目经理的机会。尽管她的薪水会大幅增加，但她觉得监督其他员工和主持团队会议会让她感到压力太大。她说：“如果出了什么问题，每个人都会责备我。我甚至不知道他们为什么给我这个职位。” 患者喜欢她的工作，但倾向于独自吃午饭，因为她觉得她的同事不喜欢她的外貌或幽默感。她从未有过长期的浪漫伴侣，但幻想有一天结婚。患者独居，很少与朋友交往，并且与母亲关系密切，她将母亲描述为“无论如何，我总是可以依靠的人”。"

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's pattern of avoiding social interactions and hypersensitivity to criticism is characteristic of AVOIDANT PERSONALITY DISORDER. Patients with this disorder typically have very limited social relationships due to the FEAR OF BEING JUDGED, embarrassed, or rejected. They desire social acceptance and may fantasize about having relationships, as in this patient; however, they struggle with FEELINGS OF INADEQUACY and pursue relationships only if certain of absolute acceptance by others. Occupational dysfunction due to difficulties interacting with coworkers or turning down promotions due to fear of criticism is common.\n\n(Choice A) ACUTE STRESS DISORDER involves exposure to a life-threatening event with resulting flashbacks, intrusive memories, avoidance, negative mood, hyperarousal, and dissociation from reality.\n\n(Choice B) In ADJUSTMENT DISORDER WITH ANXIETY, a disproportionate level of worry develops within 3 months of onset of an identifiable stressor. This patient's chronic anxiety symptoms appear to be related to a longstanding fear of rejection in social situations and low self-esteem, which is more consistent with avoidant personality disorder.\n\n(Choice C) ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER is marked by persistent disregard for and violation of the rights of others. Individuals with this disorder are often risk-takers who exhibit criminal behavior.\n\n(Choice E) GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER is characterized by excessive worry about multiple issues and is associated with irritability, restlessness, muscle tension, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and difficulty concentrating. This patient's anxiety is more consistent with avoidant personality disorder because it revolves around a fear of judgment by others and feelings of inadequacy, resulting in a pattern of social avoidance.\n\n(Choice F) PARANOID PERSONALITY DISORDER involves a pattern of distrust and suspiciousness of others' motives. Patients with this disorder also avoid relationships and socialization, but do so because they are concerned about personal information being used to exploit them.\n\n(Choice G) Individuals with SCHIZOID PERSONALITY DISORDER are also socially avoidant, but they tend to be content with their social isolation. Patients with this disorder are emotionally detached, have a limited range of affect, do not desire social acceptance, and prefer to be alone.\n\nEducational objective:\nAVOIDANT PERSONALITY DISORDER is a maladaptive pattern of behavior characterized by social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and fear of embarrassment and rejection.",
    "zh": "患者回避社交互动和对批评高度敏感的模式是回避型人格障碍的特征。患有这种障碍的患者通常由于害怕被评判、尴尬或被拒绝而导致社交关系非常有限。他们渴望被社会接纳，并可能幻想拥有关系，就像这位患者一样；然而，他们与无能感作斗争，并且仅在确定他人绝对接受的情况下才追求关系。由于难以与同事互动或由于害怕批评而拒绝晋升，职业功能障碍很常见。\n\n（选项 A）急性应激障碍涉及暴露于威胁生命的事件，并导致闪回、侵入性记忆、回避、负面情绪、过度唤醒和与现实分离。\n\n（选项 B）在伴焦虑的适应障碍中，在可识别的应激源发病后3个月内出现不成比例的担忧水平。这位患者的慢性焦虑症状似乎与长期以来对社交场合被拒绝的恐惧和自卑有关，这与回避型人格障碍更为一致。\n\n（选项 C）反社会型人格障碍的特点是持续漠视和侵犯他人的权利。患有这种障碍的个体通常是冒险者，表现出犯罪行为。\n\n（选项 E）广泛性焦虑症的特征是过度担心多个问题，并且与易怒、烦躁不安、肌肉紧张、疲劳、睡眠障碍和难以集中注意力有关。这位患者的焦虑与回避型人格障碍更为一致，因为它围绕着对他人评判的恐惧和无能感，从而导致社交回避的模式。\n\n（选项 F）偏执型人格障碍涉及对他人的动机产生不信任和怀疑的模式。患有这种障碍的患者也会回避人际关系和社交，但这样做是因为他们担心个人信息被用来利用他们。\n\n（选项 G）患有分裂样人格障碍的个体也表现出社交回避，但他们往往对自己的社交隔离感到满意。患有这种障碍的患者情绪冷漠，情感范围有限，不渴望被社会接纳，更喜欢独处。\n\n教育目标：\n回避型人格障碍是一种适应不良的行为模式，其特征是社交抑制、无能感以及对尴尬和拒绝的恐惧。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of personality disorders, specifically differentiating between various anxiety-related and socially avoidant presentations. It requires the clinician to identify the core features of the patient's presentation, such as fear of criticism, feelings of inadequacy, and avoidance of social situations, and match them to the diagnostic criteria of the most appropriate personality disorder.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully reading the clinical vignette and identifying key symptoms and behaviors. The next step is to consider the differential diagnoses presented in the options, comparing the patient's presentation to the diagnostic criteria for each disorder. The most likely diagnosis will be the one that best encompasses all the patient's reported symptoms and history.",
