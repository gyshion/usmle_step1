    "en": "A 43-year-old man comes to the emergency department after experiencing 4 episodes of coffee ground emesis that started earlier this morning. He also describes epigastric pain over the last 3-4 months that was relieved by over-the-counter antacids. He has no other past medical history. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 20 years but does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg and pulse is 130/min and regular. Extremities are cool to the touch with loss of skin turgor. Intravenous access is obtained via 2 large-bore peripheral catheters, and rapid infusion of 2 liters of normal saline is initiated. This intervention is most likely to increase which of the following hemodynamic parameters?",

    "en": "This patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and cool extremities are indicative of hypovolemic shock most likely due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding from peptic ulcer disease (coffee ground emesis due to oxidation of heme iron by exposure to gastric acid). Decreased intravascular volume from significant blood loss activates the SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM and RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN-ALDOSTERONE SYSTEM (RAAS), which help to maintain systemic blood pressure via the following compensatory mechanisms:\n\n1.  Stimulation of the heart results in increased contractility and heart rate, helping to maintain cardiac output.\n2.  Constriction of the arteriolar beds serves to increase total peripheral resistance and maintain end-organ perfusion. This also shunts blood away from the extremities and skin and toward the vital organs.\n3.  Constriction of the systemic veins increases venous return to the heart, thereby assisting in maintaining preload.\n4.  Increased renal sodium and water retention help to prevent further volume loss.\n\nIn the treatment of hypovolemic shock, the most important intervention other than identifying and eliminating the source of bleeding is RAPID INFUSION OF BLOOD products and crystalloid solutions such as NORMAL SALINE. By infusing intravenous fluids, intravascular volume and ventricular preload can be increased rapidly. The increase in preload stretches the myocardium and increases the end-diastolic sarcomere length, leading to an increase in stroke volume and cardiac output by the Frank-Starling mechanism.\n\n(Choice A) Aortic wall elasticity is based on the intrinsic structure of the aortic media and is not affected by fluid infusions.\n\n(Choice B) The diastolic ventricular compliance is determined by intrinsic properties of the myocardium and is unaffected by crystalloid infusions. Conditions that decrease ventricular compliance include left ventricular hypertrophy (aortic stenosis, hypertension), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and infiltrative disorders (amyloidosis, sarcoidosis).\n\n(Choice D) Adequate fluid resuscitation in a hypovolemic patient decreases the sympathetic drive and endogenous catecholamine release, resulting in decreased heart rate.\n\n(Choice E) Plasma renin activity increases in patients with hypovolemic shock due to activation of RAAS and would be expected to decrease after intravenous fluid resuscitation.\n\n(Choices F and G) In a patient with hypovolemic shock, total peripheral resistance and myocardial contraction velocity are high due to sympathetic activation. Administration of fluids will reduce sympathetic activation and decrease both of these parameters. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该患者的低血压、心动过速和四肢冰冷提示低血容量性休克，最有可能由于消化性溃疡病引起的上消化道出血（咖啡渣样呕吐是由于血红素铁被暴露于胃酸而氧化所致）。大量失血导致血管内容量减少，激活交感神经系统和肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统 (RAAS)，通过以下代偿机制帮助维持全身血压：\n\n1.  心脏受到刺激导致心肌收缩力和心率增加，有助于维持心输出量。\n2.  小动脉床收缩有助于增加总外周阻力并维持末端器官灌注。这也会将血液从四肢和皮肤分流到重要器官。\n3.  全身静脉收缩增加了静脉回流到心脏，从而有助于维持前负荷。\n4.  肾脏钠和水的潴留增加有助于防止进一步的容量损失。\n\n在治疗低血容量性休克时，除了识别并消除出血来源外，最重要的干预措施是快速输注血液制品和晶体液，如生理盐水。通过输注静脉输液，可以快速增加血管内容量和心室前负荷。前负荷的增加会拉伸心肌，并增加舒张末期肌节长度，通过Frank-Starling机制导致每搏输出量和心输出量增加。\n\n(选项A) 主动脉壁弹性基于主动脉内膜的固有结构，不受液体输注的影响。\n\n(选项B) 舒张期心室顺应性由心肌的固有特性决定，不受晶体液输注的影响。降低心室顺应性的情况包括左心室肥大（主动脉瓣狭窄、高血压）、肥厚型心肌病和浸润性疾病（淀粉样变性、结节病）。\n\n(选项D) 对低血容量患者进行充分的液体复苏会降低交感神经驱动力和内源性儿茶酚胺的释放，导致心率降低。\n\n(选项E) 由于RAAS的激活，低血容量性休克患者的血浆肾素活性增加，预计在静脉输液复苏后会降低。\n\n(选项F和G) 在低血容量性休克患者中，由于交感神经激活，总外周阻力和心肌收缩速度很高。输注液体将减少交感神经激活并降低这两个参数。{{exhibit_1}}"
