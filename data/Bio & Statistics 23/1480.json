    "en": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the office due to abnormal motor development. He was born at 40 weeks gestation and had an unremarkable perinatal course. The boy developed normally during the first year of life. However, for the past 2 years, he has had progressive bilateral leg stiffness and abnormal involuntary movements. His cognitive and motor development is also delayed. There is no significant family history of neurological or muscular disorders. The patient's height, weight, and head circumference are below the 3rd percentile. Examination shows bilateral spastic paresis of his lower extremities and frequent choreoathetoid movements. Comprehensive laboratory testing reveals significantly elevated arginine levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.",
    "zh": "一名3岁男孩因运动发育异常就诊。他出生时孕龄为40周，围产期病程无特殊。男孩在生命的第一年发育正常。然而，在过去的2年里，他出现了进行性双侧腿部僵硬和异常不自主运动。他的认知和运动发育也迟缓。没有重要的神经系统或肌肉疾病家族史。患者的身高、体重和头围均低于第3百分位数。检查显示其下肢双侧痉挛性轻瘫和频繁的舞蹈手足徐动症运动。综合实验室检查显示血浆和脑脊液中精氨酸水平显著升高。"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has features of ARGINASE DEFICIENCY, including progressive development of SPASTIC DIPLEGIA, ABNORMAL MOVEMENTS, and growth delay in the setting of ELEVATED ARGININE levels. Arginase is a urea cycle enzyme that produces UREA and ORNITHINE from ARGININE. Diagnosis is based on elevated arginine levels on plasma amino acid testing. Treatment of arginase deficiency consists of a LOW-PROTEIN DIET devoid of arginine. Administration of a synthetic protein made of essential amino acids usually results in a dramatic decrease in plasma arginine concentration and an improvement in neurological abnormalities. Unlike other urea cycle disorders, patients with arginase deficiency have MILD OR NO HYPERAMMONEMIA.",
    "zh": "该患者具有精氨酸酶缺乏症的特征，包括在精氨酸水平升高的背景下，进行性发生痉挛性双瘫、异常运动和生长迟缓。精氨酸酶是一种尿素循环酶，它从精氨酸中产生尿素和鸟氨酸。诊断基于血浆氨基酸检测中精氨酸水平升高。精氨酸酶缺乏症的治疗包括低蛋白饮食，不含精氨酸。给予由必需氨基酸制成的合成蛋白通常会导致血浆精氨酸浓度显着降低，并改善神经系统异常。与其他尿素循环障碍不同，精氨酸酶缺乏症患者仅有轻度或无高氨血症。"
