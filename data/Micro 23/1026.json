    "en": "A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to urinary urgency, a burning sensation on urination, and urethral discharge. The patient had similar symptoms 3 months ago, and urethral swab microscopy showed numerous neutrophils and intracellular gram-negative diplococci. The symptoms resolved after treatment with ceftriaxone and doxycycline but recurred 4 days ago. The patient was advised to use condoms but has had unprotected sexual encounters recently. He has no other medical conditions. The patient occasionally drinks alcohol and smokes cigarettes. Temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F). BMI is 18.8 kg/m². No suprapubic or flank tenderness is present. Mild erythema is noted at the urethral meatus. Nucleic acid amplification testing of a clean catch urine specimen is positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and negative for Chlamydia trachomatis.",

    "en": "This young patient who engages in high-risk sexual activity developed dysuria, frequency, and urethral discharge 3 months ago, indicating infectious urethritis. Gram stain at that time showed intracellular gram-negative diplococci, which is diagnostic for Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. Because coinfection with N gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis is common, and because Chlamydia cannot be seen on Gram stain due to lack of peptidoglycan in the cell wall, the patient was treated empirically for both infections with ceftriaxone and doxycycline.\n\nAlthough treatment resolved the symptoms completely, the patient developed recurrent manifestations after additional unprotected sexual encounters, raising suspicion for N gonorrhoeae reinfection. Gonorrhea infection generates IgA and IgG antibodies against the bacteria; however, these antibodies provide limited or no protective immunity against future infections due to an extremely high rate of antigenic variation in bacterial surface molecules (eg, porins, Opa proteins, lipooligosaccharide).\n\n(Choice A) Memory T cells form in response to gonococcal infection but are not effective at preventing reinfection due to high antigenic variation, which prevents recognition of antigens from the organism.\n\n(Choice B) The humoral antibody response can be impaired by severe malnutrition; however, the high rate of antigenic variability in gonococcal infection would already preclude development of an effective antibody response.\n\n(Choice D) Antigenic mimicry occurs when an organism displays similar antigens to the host, preventing the host's immune system from recognizing the organism as foreign.\n\n(Choice E) Gonorrhea is largely susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone) but may be resistant to penicillins, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones. Antibiotic resistance should be suspected when initial symptoms do not improve with treatment. Because this patient's initial symptoms resolved after he was treated with ceftriaxone and then recurred a few months later, reinfection is far more likely than drug resistance.\n\nEducational objective:\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae has high antigenic variability of surface molecules (eg, porins, Opa proteins, lipooligosaccharide), which prevents the formation of protective immunity and leads to susceptibility to repeat infection.",
    "zh": "这位从事高危性行为的年轻患者在3个月前出现了排尿困难、尿频和尿道分泌物，表明患有感染性尿道炎。当时的革兰染色显示细胞内革兰阴性双球菌，诊断为淋病奈瑟菌感染。由于淋病奈瑟菌和沙眼衣原体的混合感染很常见，并且由于沙眼衣原体细胞壁中缺乏肽聚糖，在革兰染色中无法看到，因此，患者经验性地接受了头孢曲松和多西环素治疗。\n\n尽管治疗完全缓解了症状，但患者在再次发生无保护性行为后出现了复发表现，这引起了对淋病奈瑟菌再次感染的怀疑。淋病感染会产生针对细菌的IgA和IgG抗体；然而，由于细菌表面分子（例如，孔蛋白、Opa蛋白、脂寡糖）的抗原变异率极高，这些抗体对未来的感染提供的保护有限或无效。\n\n（选项A）记忆性T细胞对淋球菌感染作出反应，但由于抗原高度变异，无法有效预防再次感染，这阻止了对来自该生物体的抗原的识别。\n\n（选项B）体液抗体反应可能会受到严重营养不良的损害；然而，淋球菌感染中抗原变异的高发生率已经排除了有效抗体反应的产生。\n\n（选项D）当生物体显示与宿主相似的抗原时，就会发生抗原模拟，从而阻止宿主的免疫系统将该生物体识别为异物。\n\n（选项E）淋病主要对第三代头孢菌素（例如，头孢曲松）敏感，但可能对青霉素、大环内酯类和氟喹诺酮类耐药。当初始症状没有因治疗而改善时，应怀疑存在抗生素耐药性。由于该患者的初始症状在接受头孢曲松治疗后缓解，然后在几个月后复发，因此再感染的可能性远大于耐药性。\n\n教育目标：\n淋病奈瑟菌具有表面分子（例如，孔蛋白、Opa蛋白、脂寡糖）的高度抗原变异性，这阻止了保护性免疫的形成，并导致易于重复感染。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathogenesis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, specifically the mechanism of antigenic variation that allows for reinfection despite previous exposure and treatment. It also tests the understanding of why other potential causes of recurrent infection are less likely in this scenario.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the patient's history of recurrent infection despite appropriate antibiotic treatment. Consider the unique characteristics of N. gonorrhoeae that contribute to its ability to evade the host's immune system, such as antigenic variation.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对淋病奈瑟菌感染发病机制的了解，特别是抗原变异的机制，该机制允许在之前的暴露和治疗后再次感染。它还考察了对为什么在这种情况下其他可能的复发原因不太可能的理解。\n\n要解决这个问题，请关注患者在接受适当抗生素治疗后复发的病史。考虑淋病奈瑟菌的独特特征，这些特征有助于其逃避免疫系统，例如抗原变异。"
