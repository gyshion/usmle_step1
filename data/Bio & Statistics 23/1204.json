    "en": "The **power** of a study is the ability of a study to detect a difference between groups when such a difference truly exists. Power is related to **type II error (β)**, which is the probability of concluding there is no difference between groups when one truly exists. Mathematically, power is given by:\n\nPower = 1 – β\n\nIn this example, the power of the study is the probability of detecting a difference in blood cholesterol level between diabetics and non-diabetics if there is a real difference. The probability of concluding that there is no difference in blood cholesterol level when in reality there is one is given as 20%; this corresponds to the definition of β (ie, β = 0.20 in this example). Therefore:\n\nPower = 1 – β = 1 – 0.20 = 0.80\n\n(Choice A) Type I error (α) describes the probability of seeing a difference when there is no difference in reality. The value of α is generally compared to the probability that the observed difference is due to chance alone (a simplified explanation of the p-value). In this example, the probability that the observed difference between diabetic and nondiabetic patients is due to chance alone is given as 5% (0.05).\n\n(Choices B and E) Type II error (β) is 0.20, as explained above. The value 0.95 corresponds to (1 – α), but power is given by (1 – β).\n\nEducational objective:\nThe power of a study indicates the probability of seeing a difference when there is one. The formula is Power = 1 – β, where β is the type II error rate.",
    "zh": "一项研究的**效力**是指该研究在真正存在组间差异时检测到该差异的能力。 效力与**II型错误 (β)** 相关，II型错误是指在组间确实存在差异时得出结论认为组间没有差异的概率。 从数学上讲，效力由下式给出：\n\n效力 = 1 – β\n\n在本例中，研究的效力是指在糖尿病患者和非糖尿病患者之间存在真实差异的情况下，检测到血胆固醇水平差异的概率。 得出结论认为血胆固醇水平没有差异，而实际上存在差异的概率为 20%；这与 β 的定义相对应（即，在本例中 β = 0.20）。 因此：\n\n效力 = 1 – β = 1 – 0.20 = 0.80\n\n（选项 A）I型错误 (α) 描述了在实际上没有差异时看到差异的概率。 α 的值通常与观察到的差异仅由于偶然因素造成的概率（p 值的简化解释）进行比较。 在本例中，糖尿病患者和非糖尿病患者之间观察到的差异仅由于偶然因素造成的概率为 5% (0.05)。\n\n（选项 B 和 E）II型错误 (β) 为 0.20，如上所述。 值 0.95 对应于 (1 – α)，但效力由 (1 – β) 给出。\n\n教育目标：\n一项研究的效力表示在存在差异时看到差异的概率。 公式为 效力 = 1 – β，其中 β 是 II 型错误率。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of statistical power in research studies, specifically its relationship to Type II error (beta). Power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis, or detecting a true effect when it exists.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the formula: Power = 1 - β, where β is the probability of a Type II error. Identify the value of β from the question stem (the probability of concluding there is no difference when one exists) and subtract it from 1 to calculate the power.",
