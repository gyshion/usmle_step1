  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's shortness of breath and wheezing are suggestive of asthma, and his rhinorrhea and watery eyes are suggestive of allergic rhinitis. Both of these conditions are examples of type I hypersensitivity, which involves the triggering of an allergic response via the binding of previously recognized antigen to IgE antibodies on mast cells. Many type I hypersensitivity reactions are composed of both an early and late phase.\n\nHistamine is housed in preformed granules of unactivated mast cells and plays an important role in the early phase of type I hypersensitivity. Upon activation, mast cells rapidly release histamine via degranulation, making histamine the first chemical mediator to take effect. Once released, histamine triggers smooth muscle contraction leading to bronchoconstriction, increases vascular permeability leading to edema, and increases mucus secretion from glandular tissue.\n\n(Choice B) Leukotriene D4, along with the other cysteinyl leukotrienes (C4 and E4), are not preformed but require synthesis via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. Therefore, these mediators are released by mast cells later than histamine. Once released, the cysteinyl leukotrienes are potent mediators of vasoconstriction, bronchoconstriction, and increased vascular permeability.\n\n(Choice C) Major basic protein is released from eosinophils in the late stage of a type I hypersensitivity reaction and causes localized tissue damage.\n\n(Choice D) Platelet-activating factor is a secondary inflammatory mediator that must be synthesized from phospholipid prior to being released from activated mast cells and basophils. Once released, it stimulates bronchospasm and increased vascular permeability.\n\n(Choice E) Prostaglandin D2 is synthesized via the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism prior to being released from mast cells. Once released, it causes bronchospasm and vasodilation.\n\nEducational objective:\nType I hypersensitivity reactions are an allergic response triggered by the binding of previously recognized antigen to IgE antibodies on mast cells. In the early phase of the response, histamine, already stored in preformed granules in mast cells, is the first chemical mediator released. Once released, histamine stimulates smooth muscle contraction (bronchoconstriction), increases vascular permeability (edema), and increases mucus secretion. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of type I hypersensitivity reactions and the role of various mediators, specifically focusing on which mediator is released first. It requires understanding the immediate phase of the allergic response and the preformed nature of histamine in mast cells.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the sequence of events in type I hypersensitivity.
