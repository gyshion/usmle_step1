    "en": "An 18-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to 3 days of fever, myalgias, and profound fatigue. He was feeling fine prior to the onset of symptoms. The patient has a history of intermittent asthma for which he uses an inhaler as needed. He is a senior in high school and plays on the football team. Temperature is 38 C (100.4 F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 16/min. BMI is 22.1 kg/m². On physical examination, the patient is found to have swollen lymph nodes in his neck and behind his ears. The tip of the spleen is palpable 1 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory results are notable for the following:\n\nComplete blood count\nHemoglobin 14.4 g/dL\nPlatelets 310,000/mm³\nLeukocytes 11,000/mm³\nLymphocytes 70%",

    "en": "This patient has many of the classic features of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced mononucleosis, including fever, profound fatigue, lymphadenopathy, lymphocytosis (with atypical lymphocytes), and splenomegaly (palpable spleen tip). EBV is typically transmitted from an asymptomatic virus shedder to a susceptible individual through saliva transfer (eg, kissing).\n\n(Choice A) Anal sexual intercourse is more likely to transmit pathogens such as HIV, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Chlamydia trachomatis.\n\n(Choices C, D, and E) Urine can harbor pathogens such as cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae; blood can harbor hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV; and arthropods (eg, ticks) can harbor Rickettsia rickettsii and Borrelia burgdorferi, among others.\n\n(Choice F) Malaria and leishmaniasis, which can cause splenomegaly, are found in South Asia. However, malaria would classically be associated with anemia and thrombocytopenia. Visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) manifests as progressive splenic enlargement and weight loss over months.",
    "zh": "该患者具有许多EB病毒（EBV）诱导的单核细胞增多症的典型特征，包括发热、严重疲劳、淋巴结肿大、淋巴细胞增多（伴有非典型淋巴细胞）和脾肿大（可触及的脾尖）。EBV通常通过唾液传播（例如，接吻）从无症状的病毒携带者传播给易感个体。\n\n（选项A）肛交更容易传播病原体，如HIV、淋病奈瑟菌和沙眼衣原体。\n\n（选项C、D和E）尿液可携带病原体，如巨细胞病毒、腺病毒、大肠杆菌、腐生葡萄球菌和肺炎克雷伯菌；血液可携带乙型肝炎病毒、丙型肝炎病毒和HIV；节肢动物（例如，蜱虫）可携带落基山斑疹热立克次体和伯氏疏螺旋体等。\n\n（选项F）可在南亚发现可引起脾肿大的疟疾和利什曼病。然而，疟疾通常与贫血和血小板减少症相关。内脏利什曼病（黑热病）表现为数月内进行性脾肿大和体重减轻。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) mononucleosis presentation, including fever, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, lymphocytosis, and splenomegaly. It also tests understanding of EBV transmission through saliva.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic mononucleosis symptoms and associate them with EBV. Then, recall that EBV is transmitted through saliva, making contact with saliva the most likely historical finding.",
    "zh": "本题考察了EB病毒（EBV）单核细胞增多症的表现，包括发热、疲劳、淋巴结肿大、淋巴细胞增多和脾肿大。它还考察了通过唾液传播EBV的理解。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要认识到经典的单核细胞增多症症状并将其与EBV联系起来。然后，回忆EBV通过唾液传播，这使得接触唾液成为最有可能的病史发现。"
