  "explanation": {
    "en": "Diazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine indicated as follows:\n\n*   As an anxiolytic, it is effective for the management of generalized anxiety disorder and panic attacks.\n*   The sedative-hypnotic effect of diazepam is useful for the short-term treatment of insomnia.\n*   As an anticonvulsant, diazepam is indicated for status epilepticus. It is a first-line agent (along with chlordiazepoxide) for the treatment of seizures associated with alcohol withdrawal.\n*   As a muscle relaxant, diazepam can stop the spasticity caused by upper motor neuron disorders (multiple sclerosis, strokes, spinal cord trauma) and tetanus.\n\nThe most common side effect of diazepam is sedation. Diazepam may also impair coordination and balance (sometimes avoided in the elderly for fear of falls), decrease memory and concentration, and produce confusion. These effects are amplified by the coadministration of other CNS-depressants. As a class, all benzodiazepines should be excluded from use in conjunction with alcohol, barbiturates, neuroleptics, or first-generation antihistamines.\n\nAmong drugs listed in the answer choices, only chlorpheniramine causes sedation and should not be used with diazepam. Chlorpheniramine is a first-generation antihistamine that acts by blocking both central and peripheral H1 receptors. Chlorpheniramine and other first-generation antihistamines can be very sedating because they easily penetrate the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the CNS. The most sedating of this generation of antihistamines are diphenhydramine, promethazine, and hydroxyzine. Despite the associated sedation, these antihistamines are often still used to prevent/treat allergic reactions and motion sickness and as antiemetics.\n\n(Choice B) Loratadine is a second-generation antihistamine that blocks peripheral H1 histamine receptors. It does not enter the CNS and does not cause drowsiness.\n\n(Choice C) In patients with significant liver disease (eg, cirrhosis), caution should be used when prescribing acetaminophen and diazepam because both are hepatically metabolized. Otherwise, acetaminophen does not cause sedation and can generally be taken safely with diazepam. Diazepam may speed up acetaminophen metabolism (thereby decreasing acetaminophen levels), but this interaction is very minor.\n\n(Choice D) Famotidine is a H2 receptor antagonist that inhibits gastric acid secretion. It is metabolized by the CYP450 system but has minimal effects on the metabolism of other drugs.\n\n(Choice E) Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that decreases gastric secretion. Although both diazepam and lansoprazole are metabolized by the P450 system, studies have shown that lansoprazole does not have clinically significant interactions with diazepam.\n\nEducational objective:\nFirst-generation H1-histamine receptor antagonists, including diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine, can cause significant sedation, especially when used with other medications that cause CNS depression (such as benzodiazepines).",
    "zh": "地西泮是一种长效苯二氮卓类药物，其适应症如下：\n\n*   作为抗焦虑药，它可有效治疗广泛性焦虑症和惊恐发作。\n*   地西泮的镇静催眠作用可用于失眠的短期治疗。\n*   作为抗惊厥药，地西泮适用于癫痫持续状态。它是治疗与戒酒相关的癫痫发作的一线药物（与氯氮卓一起）。\n*   作为肌肉松弛剂，地西泮可以阻止由上运动神经元疾病（多发性硬化症、卒中、脊髓损伤）和破伤风引起的痉挛。\n\n地西泮最常见的副作用是镇静。地西泮也可能损害协调性和平衡性（有时在老年人中避免使用，因为担心跌倒），降低记忆力和注意力，并产生意识模糊。这些作用会因与其他中枢神经系统抑制剂同时使用而增强。作为一类药物，所有苯二氮卓类药物均应避免与酒精、巴比妥类药物、神经安定剂或第一代抗组胺药合用。\n\n在答案选项中，只有氯苯那敏会引起镇静，不应与地西泮一起使用。氯苯那敏是一种第一代抗组胺药，通过阻断中枢和外周H1受体发挥作用。氯苯那敏和其他第一代抗组胺药可能具有很强的镇静作用，因为它们很容易穿过血脑屏障并在中枢神经系统中积聚。这一代抗组胺药中镇静作用最强的是苯海拉明、异丙嗪和羟嗪。尽管存在相关的镇静作用，但这些抗组胺药通常仍用于预防/治疗过敏反应和晕动病，以及作为止吐药。\n\n（选项 B）氯雷他定是一种第二代抗组胺药，可阻断外周H1组胺受体。它不进入中枢神经系统，也不会引起嗜睡。\n\n（选项 C）对于患有严重肝病（例如肝硬化）的患者，在开具对乙酰氨基酚和地西泮处方时应谨慎，因为两者均由肝脏代谢。否则，对乙酰氨基酚不会引起镇静，通常可以与地西泮安全服用。地西泮可能会加速对乙酰氨基酚的代谢（从而降低对乙酰氨基酚水平），但这种相互作用非常轻微。\n\n（选项 D）法莫替丁是一种H2受体拮抗剂，可抑制胃酸分泌。它由CYP450系统代谢，但对其他药物的代谢影响甚微。\n\n（选项 E）兰索拉唑是一种质子泵抑制剂，可减少胃酸分泌。尽管地西泮和兰索拉唑均由P450系统代谢，但研究表明，兰索拉唑与地西泮之间没有临床显着的相互作用。\n\n教学目标：\n第一代H1-组胺受体拮抗剂，包括苯海拉明和氯苯那敏，可引起显着的镇静作用，尤其是在与其他引起中枢神经系统抑制的药物（如苯二氮卓类药物）合用时。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of drug interactions, specifically the synergistic sedative effects of benzodiazepines and first-generation antihistamines. It requires understanding of the mechanism of action and side effect profiles of common medications.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the medication that has a sedative effect and would potentiate the sedation caused by diazepam. Recognizing that first-generation antihistamines cross the blood-brain barrier and cause sedation is key to answering correctly.",
