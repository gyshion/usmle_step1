    "en": "A 42-year-old woman comes to the office due to dizziness. She has a 6-month history of episodic bouts where she experiences a spinning sensation associated with nausea and ringing in her left ear. The patient also has difficulty hearing while holding her phone to the left ear, although hearing in the right ear is normal. The dizziness improves spontaneously and she feels fine between episodes. Past medical history is notable for hypothyroidism, for which she is on thyroid replacement therapy, and endometriosis, which led to a hysterectomy at age 38. The patient works as a supermarket manager. She does not use tobacco or drink alcohol. This patient's condition is most likely the result of which of the following pathologic processes?",
    "zh": "一名42岁的女性因头晕来诊。她有6个月的病史，表现为阵发性发作，伴有旋转感、恶心和左耳耳鸣。患者在用左耳接听电话时也有听力困难，尽管右耳听力正常。头晕可自发缓解，在发作间歇期感觉良好。既往病史值得关注的是甲状腺功能减退症，正在接受甲状腺激素替代治疗，以及子宫内膜异位症，这导致她在38岁时进行了子宫切除术。患者担任超市经理。她不吸烟也不饮酒。该患者的病情最有可能是什么病理过程引起的？"

    "en": "This patient has classic features of Ménière disease, including:\n\nvertigo, the subjective sensation of spinning or motion in the absence of actual motion; commonly associated with nausea and vomiting\nunilateral sensorineural hearing loss, which initially completely resolves between episodes but usually worsens over time\nunilateral low-frequency tinnitus, often accompanied by a feeling of ear fullness\nMénière disease is a disorder of the inner ear characterized by increased volume and pressure of endolymph (endolymphatic hydrops) that is thought to be due to defective resorption of endolymph. The resultant distension of the endolymphatic system causes damage to the vestibular and cochlear components of the inner ear. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Multiple sclerosis is characterized by patchy demyelinating lesions in the CNS that are disseminated in space and time. Although this patient's symptoms are disseminated in time (ie, episodic), they are not disseminated in space because all symptoms can be explained by a single lesion impacting the inner ear. The classic triad of episodic vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus with aural fullness is much more consistent with Ménière disease.\n\n(Choice C) Labyrinthitis is inflammation of the labyrinth and vestibular nerve that causes acute-onset hearing loss and vertigo, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting (if no hearing loss is present, it is called vestibular neuritis). It usually occurs in a single episode following a viral syndrome; symptoms typically last one to two days.\n\n(Choice D) A mass lesion at the cerebellopontine angle is most commonly an acoustic neuroma (schwannoma of CN VIII). An acoustic neuroma classically presents with unilateral progressive hearing loss. Although vertigo and tinnitus could also be present, symptoms are usually persistent and progressive rather than episodic.\n\n(Choice E) Otosclerosis is an inherited condition seen in middle age. Patients develop progressive conductive hearing loss due to bony overgrowth and fixation of the footplate of the stapes. Because it impacts the middle ear (vs inner ear in Ménière disease), vertigo does not occur.\n\nEducational objective:\nMénière disease is characterized by episodic vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss, and tinnitus with aural fullness. Its pathogenesis is related to an increased volume and pressure of endolymph in the vestibular apparatus. {{exhibit_2}}",
