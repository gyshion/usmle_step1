    "en": "A group of investigators is conducting a phase I clinical trial for a newly developed synthetic opioid. After several volunteers ingest a fixed oral dose, the plasma concentrations of the active drug and its inactive metabolites are measured. The plasma concentration of the drug is determined to be subtherapeutic. After rectal administration of the same dose of the drug, the peak plasma drug concentration is almost double the level measured after oral administration.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Bioavailability is the fraction of an administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation unchanged. Oral bioavailability depends on the drug's intrinsic ability to be absorbed by the gastrointestinal mucosa (eg, poor with vancomycin) and its propensity for metabolization by intestinal and hepatic enzymes (first-pass metabolism).\n\nWhen a drug has high first-pass metabolism, large amounts of its metabolites (rather than the drug itself) enter the systemic circulation. Drugs that are largely inactivated by first-pass metabolism (ie, low oral bioavailability) are often administered by a route that bypasses the portal circulation (eg, intravenous, sublingual).\n\nRectal administration (via suppository) allows a drug to partially escape first-pass metabolism. Venous drainage of the anorectum above the dentate line is to the portal venous system via the superior rectal veins (which drain to the inferior mesenteric vein). However, the region below the dentate line drains into the systemic circulation via the middle and inferior rectal veins (which drain to the internal iliac and internal pudendal veins, respectively). For a drug that is inactivated by first-pass metabolism, the rectal route allows a higher proportion of the drug to bypass portal circulation, increasing bioavailability.\n\n(Choices B, C, and D) For orally administered drugs, the small intestine is a major site of absorption owing to its large surface area and high blood flow rates. In contrast, the rectum has a much smaller surface area, lower blood flow rates, and often contains absorptive stool. Therefore, rectally administered drugs are typically absorbed more slowly and erratically compared to orally administered drugs.\n\n(Choice E) Reduced renal blood flow causes a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which in turn slows elimination of renally excreted drugs (ie, increases bioavailability). Patients with reduced GFR may require a lower dose to prevent adverse effects. However, the route of administration does not impact drug clearance.\n\nEducational objective: Drugs administered orally must pass through the portal circulation and are subject to first-pass metabolism by intestinal and hepatic enzymes. Rectal administration is capable of partially bypassing first-pass metabolism due to the portion of venous outflow that goes directly to the systemic circulation; drugs with extensive first-pass metabolism have increased bioavailability when administered rectally.",
    "zh": "生物利用度是指已给药药物到达体循环而未发生变化的比例。口服生物利用度取决于药物被胃肠道黏膜吸收的内在能力（例如，万古霉素吸收不良）及其被肠道和肝脏酶代谢的倾向（首过效应代谢）。\n\n当药物具有高首过效应代谢时，其大量代谢物（而不是药物本身）进入体循环。主要被首过效应代谢灭活的药物（即，口服生物利用度低）通常通过绕过门静脉循环的途径给药（例如，静脉内、舌下）。\n\n直肠给药（通过栓剂）允许药物部分逃避首过效应代谢。肛门直肠上方齿状线的静脉引流通过上直肠静脉（引流到肠系膜下静脉）进入门静脉系统。然而，齿状线以下的区域通过中直肠静脉和下直肠静脉（分别引流到髂内静脉和阴部内静脉）引流入体循环。对于被首过效应代谢灭活的药物，直肠途径允许更高比例的药物绕过门静脉循环，从而增加生物利用度。\n\n（选项 B、C 和 D）对于口服给药的药物，小肠是主要的吸收部位，这归功于其较大的表面积和高血流量。相比之下，直肠的表面积小得多，血流量也较低，并且通常含有吸收性粪便。因此，与口服给药的药物相比，直肠给药的药物通常吸收得更慢且不规则。\n\n（选项 E）肾血流量减少会导致肾小球滤过率 (GFR) 下降，这反过来会减缓肾脏排泄药物的消除（即，增加生物利用度）。GFR 降低的患者可能需要较低的剂量以防止不良反应。然而，给药途径不影响药物清除率。\n\n教育目标：口服给药的药物必须通过门静脉循环，并受到肠道和肝脏酶的首过效应代谢。由于静脉流出的一部分直接进入体循环，直肠给药能够部分绕过首过效应代谢；当直肠给药时，具有广泛首过效应代谢的药物具有增加的生物利用度。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of drug bioavailability, specifically the concept of first-pass metabolism and how different routes of administration can affect it. It requires knowledge of hepatic and portal circulation and the venous drainage of the rectum.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify that the drug likely undergoes significant first-pass metabolism. Then, by understanding the venous drainage of the rectum relative to the portal system, one can deduce that rectal administration can bypass the liver, thus increasing the bioavailability of drugs that are heavily metabolized by the liver.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试对药物生物利用度的理解，特别是首过效应代谢的概念以及不同的给药途径如何影响它。它需要了解肝脏和门静脉循环以及直肠的静脉引流。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须确定该药物可能经历了显著的首过效应代谢。然后，通过了解直肠相对于门静脉系统的静脉引流，可以推断直肠给药可以绕过肝脏，从而增加肝脏高度代谢的药物的生物利用度。"
