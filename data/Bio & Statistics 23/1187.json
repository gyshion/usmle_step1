    "en": "Incidence and prevalence are important concepts for evaluating the impact of disease on a population. Incidence corresponds to the number of new cases of a disease diagnosed in a population at risk over a given period. Prevalence refers to the total number of diseased individuals in the population at a particular point; it is dependent on incidence and the average duration of the disease (ie, time from diagnosis to cure or death):\n\nPrevalence = (Incidence) x (Duration of disease)\n\nA simplified diagram compares incidence and prevalence to adding new drops (incident cases) to a sink collecting water (prevalent cases).\n\nThe above graph shows that the incidence of type II diabetes mellitus has been constant for the last 30 years (Choice F), but that prevalence is rising. Because this is a steady-state population with little migration, a constant incidence rate should result in a nearly stable disease prevalence, unless there is some additional factor affecting the duration of the condition. Factors that prolong disease duration can increase disease prevalence even when the incidence is unchanged because diseased individuals live longer on average. In this case, improved quality of care (Choice B) likely led to a lower mortality rate in diabetics over time, resulting in a higher prevalence of the disease in the population.\n\n(Choice A) A decreased hospitalization rate would indicate reduced morbidity (ie, burden of disease) among diabetic individuals. However, a decrease in hospitalization rate would not necessarily be associated with reduced mortality and increasing disease prevalence.\n\n(Choice D) Increased accuracy of diagnostic testing would affect both the prevalence and incidence of a disease as it changes the rate at which new cases are detected.\n\n(Choice E) Increased exposure to diabetes risk factors would likely increase both disease incidence and prevalence.\n\n(Choice G) Selective survival bias occurs in case-control studies when cases are selected from the entire disease population instead of from just those that are newly diagnosed. For instance, a study on cancer survival that is not limited to newly diagnosed patients could contain a higher proportion of relatively benign malignancies, as these patients generally live longer.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nPrevalence equals the incidence rate multiplied by the average disease duration. Changing disease prevalence in a steady-state population with a constant incidence rate means that there is an additional factor affecting the duration of the condition. A factor that prolongs disease duration (eg, improved quality of care) will increase disease prevalence, as affected patients survive longer.",
    "zh": "发病率和患病率是评估疾病对人群影响的重要概念。发病率对应于在特定时期内在有风险的人群中诊断出的新发病例数。患病率指的是特定时间点人群中患病个体的总数；它取决于发病率和疾病的平均持续时间（即，从诊断到治愈或死亡的时间）：\n\n患病率 =（发病率）x（疾病持续时间）\n\n简化的图表将发病率和患病率比作向收集水的洗涤槽（患病病例）中添加新的水滴（新发病例）。\n\n上图显示，在过去 30 年中，2 型糖尿病的发病率一直保持不变（选项 F），但患病率正在上升。由于这是一个迁移很少的稳定状态人群，恒定的发病率应该导致疾病患病率基本稳定，除非存在影响病程的某些附加因素。延长病程的因素可以增加疾病患病率，即使发病率没有变化，因为患病个体平均寿命更长。在这种情况下，护理质量的提高（选项 B）可能导致糖尿病患者的死亡率随着时间的推移而降低，从而导致人群中疾病的患病率更高。\n\n（选项 A）住院率下降表明糖尿病患者的发病率（即疾病负担）降低。然而，住院率的下降不一定与死亡率降低和疾病患病率增加相关。\n\n（选项 D）诊断测试准确性的提高将影响疾病的患病率和发病率，因为它改变了检测新病例的速度。\n\n（选项 E）增加对糖尿病风险因素的暴露可能会增加疾病的发病率和患病率。\n\n（选项 G）选择性生存偏倚发生在病例对照研究中，当病例是从整个疾病人群中选择，而不是仅从新诊断的病例中选择时。例如，一项未仅限于新诊断患者的癌症生存研究可能包含较高比例的相对良性恶性肿瘤，因为这些患者通常寿命更长。\n\n教育目标：\n\n患病率等于发病率乘以平均病程。在一个发病率恒定的稳定状态人群中，疾病患病率的变化意味着存在影响病程的附加因素。延长病程的因素（例如，护理质量的提高）将增加疾病患病率，因为受影响的患者存活时间更长。"
