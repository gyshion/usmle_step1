    "en": "A 54-year-old man is brought to the office by his friend because of worsening memory impairment over the past several months. The patient is also withdrawn and not focused during conversations. He is slow to answer questions or carry out instructions. The patient has a prolonged history of HIV infection and has had several opportunistic infections due to inconsistent antiretroviral medication use. On physical examination, he is alert and oriented. Muscle strength, deep tendon reflexes, and sensation are normal. MRI of the head shows diffuse cerebral atrophy with no focal mass lesions or areas of demyelination. Viral proliferation in which of the following central nervous system cells is most likely involved in this patient's disease process?",
    "zh": "一名54岁男性由其朋友带来就诊，因为过去几个月记忆力减退。患者在交谈中也表现为退缩和注意力不集中。他回答问题或执行指令很慢。患者有长期的HIV感染病史，并且由于抗逆转录病毒药物使用不一致而患有几次机会性感染。体格检查显示，他警觉且定向力良好。肌力、深腱反射和感觉正常。头部MRI显示弥漫性脑萎缩，无局灶性肿块病变或脱髓鞘区域。以下哪种中枢神经系统细胞的病毒增殖最有可能参与该患者的疾病过程？"

    "en": "In the context of a long history of HIV infection, this patient's memory impairment, subcortical dysfunction (ie, inattention, impaired psychomotor speed), and cerebral atrophy on MRI of the head are consistent with HIV-associated dementia (HAD). HAD is characteristically a subcortical dementia with prominent mood, attention, memory, and psychomotor dysfunction. It is uncommon in patients receiving antiretroviral treatment but can occur in those with inconsistently treated, advanced HIV infection.\n\nAlthough HIV-1 preferentially infects and replicates in CD4+ helper T cells in peripheral blood (Choice A), CNS infection is associated with a change in viral tropism (ie, ability to infect different cell types) to microglia and macrophages, which allows the virus to penetrate deeper into the brain parenchyma. This macrophage tropic (M-tropic) version of the virus becomes \"compartmentalized\" in the CNS and evolves independently from the strain found in the blood.\n\n(Choices B and E) HIV is not neuron or oligodendrocyte tropic. Viruses that are neuron tropic include the lyssaviruses that cause rabies.\n\n(Choice C) HIV does not preferentially infect and replicate in endothelial cells in the CNS. Cytomegalovirus is an example of an endothelial cell-tropic virus.\n\nEducational objective:\nHIV-associated dementia has become rare since the advent of antiretroviral treatment but may still develop in patients with inadequately treated, late-stage HIV infection. In the CNS, HIV preferentially infects and replicates in macrophages.",
    "zh": "在HIV感染病史较长的情况下，该患者的记忆力减退、皮质下功能障碍（即注意力不集中、精神运动速度受损）和头部MRI上的脑萎缩与HIV相关性痴呆（HAD）一致。HAD的特征是皮质下痴呆，伴有明显的精神状态、注意力、记忆和精神运动功能障碍。接受抗逆转录病毒治疗的患者中这种情况并不常见，但可能发生在那些治疗不一致的晚期HIV感染患者中。\n\n尽管HIV-1优先感染并在外周血中CD4+辅助T细胞中复制（选项A），但中枢神经系统感染与病毒嗜性（即，感染不同细胞类型）向小胶质细胞和巨噬细胞的变化有关，这使得病毒能够更深入地渗透到脑实质中。这种巨噬细胞嗜性（M嗜性）版本的病毒在中枢神经系统中变得“分隔化”，并独立于血液中发现的毒株进化。\n\n（选项B和E）HIV对神经元或少突胶质细胞没有嗜性。神经元嗜性病毒包括引起狂犬病的狂犬病毒。\n\n（选项C）HIV在中枢神经系统内皮细胞中并不优先感染和复制。巨细胞病毒是内皮细胞嗜性病毒的一个例子。\n\n教学目标：\n自抗逆转录病毒治疗出现以来，HIV相关性痴呆已经变得罕见，但仍可能发生在HIV感染晚期、治疗不足的患者中。在中枢神经系统中，HIV优先感染并在巨噬细胞中复制。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) and the cell types within the central nervous system that are primarily affected by HIV in the context of HAD. It requires understanding the pathophysiology of HAD and the tropism of HIV in the CNS.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the clinical presentation of HAD in a patient with a history of HIV and to recall that HIV preferentially infects macrophages in the CNS, leading to the neurological symptoms associated with HAD.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对HIV相关性痴呆（HAD）的了解，以及在中枢神经系统中主要受HIV影响的细胞类型。它需要理解HAD的病理生理学以及HIV在中枢神经系统中的嗜性。\n\n最好的方法是在有HIV病史的患者中识别HAD的临床表现，并回忆起HIV优先感染中枢神经系统中的巨噬细胞，从而导致与HAD相关的神经系统症状。"
