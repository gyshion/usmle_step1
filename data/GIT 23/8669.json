    "en": "A 62-year-old man comes to the physician due to intermittent groin pain. The pain is most severe when the patient lifts heavy loads and after a long day at his job as a construction worker. Physical examination shows a right-sided groin bulge directly above the inguinal ligament. The bulge increases in size when he bears down. An ultrasound reveals that the mass originates medial to the inferior epigastric vessels.",
    "zh": "一名62岁男性因间歇性腹股沟疼痛就医。当患者搬运重物以及在他作为建筑工人的工作一天之后，疼痛最为剧烈。体格检查显示，右侧腹股沟直接位于腹股沟韧带上方出现隆起。当他用力时，隆起增大。超声检查显示，肿块起源于腹下壁动脉内侧。"

    "en": "Direct and indirect inguinal hernias are both located above the inguinal ligament. They can be differentiated by their side of origination in relation to the inferior epigastric vessels. Direct inguinal hernias originate medial to the inferior epigastric vessels, while indirect inguinal hernias originate lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels. This patient's groin mass originating medial to the inferior epigastric vessels is characteristic of a direct inguinal hernia in the Hesselbach triangle. The transversalis fascia makes up the floor of the triangle, and defects or weakness involving the transversalis fascia can lead to protrusion of abdominal contents. Failure of this fascial layer is most often due to acquired connective tissue abnormalities or chronic abdominal wall injury (most commonly in older men). {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} Unlike indirect inguinal hernias, direct inguinal hernias do not pass through the internal (deep) inguinal ring but only through the external (superficial) inguinal ring. As a result, they do not have a direct route to the scrotum.\n\n(Choices A and B) Indirect inguinal hernias are the most common type of groin hernia in both sexes. The underlying etiology is usually congenital: due to failure of the processus vaginalis to obliterate (in males) or of the deep inguinal ring to close (in females). Indirect inguinal hernias protrude through the internal inguinal ring, lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels, allowing them to follow the same path as the spermatic cord though the inguinal canal and into the scrotum.\n\n(Choice C) Diastasis rectus abdominis is characterized by an abnormally large separation between the rectus abdominis muscles due to stretching and laxity of the linea alba. This usually occurs in states with increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, pregnancy, obesity) and characteristically presents with a bulge in the midline around the umbilicus (rather than in the groin directly above the inguinal ligament).\n\n(Choice E) Femoral hernias occur mainly in older women due to laxity and widening of the femoral ring, which allows abdominal contents to protrude below the inguinal ligament into the femoral canal.\n\nEducational objective:\nDirect inguinal hernias occur most commonly in older men due to weakness of the transversalis fascia. They protrude medial to the inferior epigastric vessels into the Hesselbach triangle and pass only through the superficial inguinal ring with no direct route to the scrotum. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "直接腹股沟疝和间接腹股沟疝都位于腹股沟韧带上方。它们可以通过它们起源于腹下壁动脉的关系来区分。直接腹股沟疝起源于腹下壁动脉内侧，而间接腹股沟疝起源于腹下壁动脉外侧。该患者的腹股沟肿块起源于腹下壁动脉内侧，是Hesselbach三角内直接腹股沟疝的特征。腹横筋膜构成该三角的底部，涉及腹横筋膜的缺陷或薄弱可导致腹腔内容物突出。该筋膜层的衰竭最常见的原因是获得性结缔组织异常或慢性腹壁损伤（最常见于老年男性）。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} 与间接腹股沟疝不同，直接腹股沟疝不穿过腹股沟内环（深环），而仅穿过腹股沟外环（浅环）。因此，它们没有直接通往阴囊的路径。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）间接腹股沟疝是两性中最常见的腹股沟疝类型。其潜在病因通常是先天性的：由于鞘状突未能闭合（男性）或腹股沟深环未能闭合（女性）。间接腹股沟疝穿过腹股沟内环，位于腹下壁动脉外侧，使它们能够沿着精索穿过腹股沟管并进入阴囊。\n\n（选项 C）腹直肌分离的特征是，由于腹白线的拉伸和松弛，腹直肌之间异常大的分离。这通常发生在腹内压增高的状态下（例如，妊娠、肥胖），并典型地表现为脐周围中线的隆起（而不是直接位于腹股沟韧带上方的腹股沟）。\n\n（选项 E）股疝主要发生在老年女性中，由于股环的松弛和扩大，导致腹腔内容物突出到腹股沟韧带下方进入股管。\n\n教育目标：\n直接腹股沟疝最常见于老年男性，由于腹横筋膜薄弱所致。它们向腹下壁动脉内侧突出进入 Hesselbach 三角，仅穿过浅腹股沟环，没有直接通往阴囊的路径。 {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the different types of groin hernias (direct inguinal, indirect inguinal, femoral) and their anatomical relationships to the inferior epigastric vessels and inguinal ligament. It also tests the ability to differentiate between these hernias based on clinical presentation and risk factors. \n\nTo solve this question, identify the key findings: older male, bulge above the inguinal ligament, and mass medial to the inferior epigastric vessels. This points to a direct inguinal hernia caused by weakness of the transversalis fascia.",
