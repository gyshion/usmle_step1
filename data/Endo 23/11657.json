    "en": "A 65-year-old man comes to the office due to advanced prostate cancer with bone metastases. For the last 4 months, he has been treated with a GnRH agonist, which has significantly reduced his bone pain. However, the patient now reports discomfort at the anterior chest wall. Physical examination reveals bilateral, mildly tender enlargement of the breast tissue behind the nipple-areolar complex. Early initiation of which of the following medications would be most appropriate for preventing this patient's breast symptoms?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Gynecomastia is the development of glandular breast tissue in males. It is characterized by DUCTAL EPITHELIAL HYPERPLASIA with fibrosis of the surrounding stroma. Breast growth is inhibited by androgens and promoted by estrogens; conditions that INCREASE THE ESTROGEN TO ANDROGEN RATIO can lead to gynecomastia. Common pathologic causes include cirrhosis (increased aromatase activity, decreased clearance of estrogens), end-stage renal disease (decreased testosterone production), and medications (eg, spironolactone, ketoconazole).\n\nMen with prostate cancer who receive ANDROGEN-DEPRIVATION THERAPY (eg, orchiectomy, long-acting GnRH agonists, androgen receptor inhibitors) can develop gynecomastia due to dramatic (>95%) reductions in circulating testosterone (with lesser reductions in estrogens). Treatment with tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator that acts as an estrogen antagonist in the breast, can reduce the risk of gynecomastia in these patients.\n\n(Choice A) Bicalutamide is a testosterone receptor antagonist used in the treatment of prostate cancer. This drug can cause or worsen gynecomastia due to the reduced physiologic testosterone effect.\n\n(Choice B) Danazol is a synthetic steroid with androgenic and antiestrogenic effects. It may improve gynecomastia in patients with hypogonadism but can lead to rapid growth of prostate cancer and would not be appropriate for this patient.\n\n(Choices C and D) Finasteride is a 5-α reductase inhibitor that reduces the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone; it is used for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and male-pattern hair loss. Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist that also decreases testosterone production and inhibits the testosterone receptor; it is commonly used for heart failure, cirrhosis, and hypertension. Both of these agents are associated with increased risk of gynecomastia.\n\nEducational objective:\nGynecomastia is the development of glandular breast tissue in males and is commonly seen in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. Tamoxifen inhibits the effect of estrogen on breast tissue and can reduce the risk of gynecomastia in these patients.",
    "zh": "男性乳腺发育症是男性乳腺组织的发育。其特征是导管上皮增生伴周围基质纤维化。乳房生长受到雄激素的抑制，并受雌激素的促进；增加雌激素与雄激素比例的情况可导致男性乳腺发育症。常见病理原因包括肝硬化（芳香化酶活性增加，雌激素清除减少）、终末期肾病（睾酮生成减少）和药物（例如螺内酯、酮康唑）。\n\n接受雄激素剥夺疗法（例如睾丸切除术、长效GnRH激动剂、雄激素受体抑制剂）的前列腺癌患者可发生男性乳腺发育症，这归因于循环睾酮的急剧（>95%）减少（雌激素减少幅度较小）。用他莫昔芬（一种在乳房中充当雌激素拮抗剂的选择性雌激素受体调节剂）治疗，可以降低这些患者发生男性乳腺发育症的风险。\n\n（选项 A）比卡鲁胺是一种用于治疗前列腺癌的睾酮受体拮抗剂。由于生理性睾酮作用降低，该药物可引起或加重男性乳腺发育症。\n\n（选项 B）达那唑是一种具有雄激素和抗雌激素作用的合成类固醇。它可能改善患有性腺功能减退症的患者的男性乳腺发育症，但可导致前列腺癌的快速生长，因此不适合该患者。\n\n（选项 C 和 D）非那雄胺是一种5-α还原酶抑制剂，可减少睾酮向二氢睾酮的转化；它用于治疗良性前列腺增生和男性型脱发。螺内酯是一种醛固酮拮抗剂，也可降低睾酮的产生并抑制睾酮受体；它常用于心力衰竭、肝硬化和高血压。这两种药物均与男性乳腺发育症的风险增加有关。\n\n教育目标：\n男性乳腺发育症是男性乳腺组织的发育，常见于接受雄激素剥夺疗法治疗前列腺癌的男性。他莫昔芬抑制雌激素对乳腺组织的作用，并可降低这些患者发生男性乳腺发育症的风险。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of gynecomastia development in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, and the appropriate management with selective estrogen receptor modulators.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the patient's history of prostate cancer treatment with a GnRH agonist, which leads to androgen deprivation and can cause gynecomastia.
