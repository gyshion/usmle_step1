    "en": "A 1-hour-old girl is evaluated in the delivery room. The infant was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery following an uncomplicated pregnancy. The mother is gravida 2 para 2 and has no significant medical history. Apgar scores were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The patient has been skin-to-skin with her mother and breastfed once without difficulty. Physical examination shows a pink, alert infant. Cardiac auscultation reveals a normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs, and femoral pulses are normal. Which of the following hemodynamic changes most likely occurred during the fetal-to-neonatal transition at birth? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Pulmonary expansion and aeration lead to diffuse pulmonary vasodilation, resulting in DECREASED PVR. Umbilical cord clamping abruptly removes the low-resistance placenta from neonatal circulation, resulting in INCREASED SVR. With the cessation of right-to-left shunting through the ductus arteriosus at birth, only the LEFT VENTRICLE contributes to systemic blood flow.\n\nEducational objective: Before birth, high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) facilitate right-to-left shunting through the ductus arteriosus, and both ventricles contribute to fetal systemic blood flow. At birth, decreased PVR (due to oxygenation and ventilation of the lungs) and increased SVR (due to umbilical cord clamping) reverse shunting through the ductus arteriosus (ie, left-to-right shunting), and only the left ventricle contributes to systemic blood flow.",
    "zh": "肺扩张和充气导致弥漫性肺血管舒张，从而导致肺血管阻力(PVR)降低。脐带结扎突然将低阻力的胎盘从新生儿循环中移除，导致全身血管阻力(SVR)增加。出生时，通过动脉导管的右向左分流停止，只有左心室对体循环血流有贡献。\n\n教育目标：出生前，高肺血管阻力(PVR)和低全身血管阻力(SVR)促进通过动脉导管的右向左分流，并且两个心室都对胎儿体循环血流有贡献。出生时，由于肺的氧合和通气，PVR降低；由于脐带结扎，SVR增加，从而逆转了通过动脉导管的分流（即，左向右分流），并且只有左心室对体循环血流有贡献。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the hemodynamic changes that occur during the transition from fetal to neonatal circulation, specifically focusing on pulmonary vascular resistance, systemic vascular resistance, and left ventricular contribution to systemic blood flow.\n\nThe key to solving this question is understanding that at birth, pulmonary vascular resistance decreases due to lung expansion, systemic vascular resistance increases due to umbilical cord clamping, and the left ventricle becomes the primary contributor to systemic blood flow.",
