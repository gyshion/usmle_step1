    "en": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the clinic due to fatigue. A few weeks ago, the patient's mother noticed that he seemed to tire easily after playing. He also appeared pale. The patient has had no recent illnesses and takes no medications. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F). Examination shows mucosal pallor. The abdomen is soft with no organomegaly. The results of a complete blood count are as follows:\n\nHemoglobin 7.5 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 66 µm³\nRed blood cell distribution width 29% (normal: 11.8%-13.8%)\nPlatelets 255,000/mm³\nLeukocytes 6,800/mm³\n\nPeripheral smear shows microcytic, hypochromic erythrocytes. The patient's condition does not respond to a trial of iron therapy. Further evaluation confirms the diagnosis, and the patient's symptoms improve with pyridoxine (vitamin B₆). This patient most likely has an underlying impairment in which of the following reactions? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient with microcytic anemia that improved with vitamin B₆ (pyridoxine) but not iron supplementation likely has X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA). XLSA is an X-linked recessive disorder affecting 5-aminolevulinate synthase. This enzyme, with vitamin B₆ as a cofactor, catalyzes the first, rate-limiting step in porphyrin synthesis in which glycine and succinyl CoA form aminolevulinic acid.\n\nPorphyrin combines with iron to form heme, which then combines with alpha- and beta-globin to form hemoglobin. In XLSA, impaired porphyrin synthesis leads to ineffective erythropoiesis as sufficient amounts of hemoglobin cannot be synthesized. As a result, patients develop microcytic anemia with an increased red blood cell distribution width and an inappropriately normal or low reticulocyte count. The anemia improves with vitamin B₆ supplementation, which enhances the function of the defective 5-aminolevulinate synthase.\n\nVitamin B₆ deficiency or isoniazid therapy (acts as a competitive inhibitor of vitamin B₆) may induce sideroblastic anemia by impairing the function of 5-aminolevulinate synthase.\n\n(Choices B through E) Vitamin B₆ is not a cofactor for these enzymes, and anemia would not improve with vitamin B₆ supplementation. However, other aberrations in the heme synthesis pathway cause clinically recognized disease. For example, porphyria cutanea tarda is an acquired condition in which the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (Choice D) is markedly inhibited, causing porphyrin accumulation in skin and photosensitivity. In addition, acute intermittent porphyria is an autosomal dominant disease in which porphobilinogen deaminase (Choice C) deficiency leads to episodes of abdominal pain and peripheral neuropathy.\n\nEducational objective:\nVitamin B₆ (pyridoxine) is a required cofactor for the enzyme 5-aminolevulinate synthase, which catalyzes the first, rate-limiting step in porphyrin synthesis. Defects in this enzyme cause X-linked sideroblastic anemia. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者出现小细胞性贫血，经维生素B₆（吡哆醇）治疗后改善，但铁剂补充无效，很可能患有X连锁成铁细胞性贫血（XLSA）。XLSA是一种X连锁隐性遗传病，影响5-氨基乙酰丙酸合酶。该酶以维生素B₆为辅助因子，催化卟啉合成中的第一个限速步骤，其中甘氨酸和琥珀酰辅酶A形成氨基乙酰丙酸。\n\n卟啉与铁结合形成血红素，血红素再与α-和β-珠蛋白结合形成血红蛋白。在XLSA中，卟啉合成受损导致无效红细胞生成，因为无法合成足够量的血红蛋白。因此，患者出现小细胞性贫血，红细胞分布宽度增加，网织红细胞计数异常正常或偏低。贫血经维生素B₆补充后改善，这增强了有缺陷的5-氨基乙酰丙酸合酶的功能。\n\n维生素B₆缺乏或异烟肼治疗（作为维生素B₆的竞争性抑制剂）可能通过损害5-氨基乙酰丙酸合酶的功能而诱发成铁细胞性贫血。\n\n（选项B到E）维生素B₆不是这些酶的辅助因子，贫血不会因维生素B₆补充而改善。然而，血红素合成途径的其他异常会导致临床上可识别的疾病。例如，迟发性皮肤卟啉病是一种获得性疾病，其中尿卟啉原脱羧酶（选项D）受到明显抑制，导致卟啉在皮肤中积聚并对光敏感。此外，急性间歇性卟啉病是一种常染色体显性遗传病，其中卟啉原脱氨酶（选项C）缺乏导致腹痛和周围神经病变的发生。\n\n教育目标：\n维生素B₆（吡哆醇）是酶5-氨基乙酰丙酸合酶的必需辅助因子，该酶催化卟啉合成中的第一个限速步骤。该酶的缺陷会导致X连锁成铁细胞性贫血。 {{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the heme synthesis pathway and the etiology of sideroblastic anemia, specifically X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) caused by a defect in 5-aminolevulinate synthase. It also tests the role of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) in this pathway.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the microcytic anemia unresponsive to iron but responsive to pyridoxine. Recall that XLSA involves a defect in the first step of heme synthesis catalyzed by 5-aminolevulinate synthase, which requires vitamin B6 as a cofactor.",
