    "en": "A 9-month-old boy is brought to the clinic by his parents for a well-child check. The mother says that he cannot roll over, sit without support, or crawl. The patient can reach for toys with his left hand but not with his right. He was born at 28 weeks gestation, and Apgar scores were 5 and 6 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The patient's birth weight was 1.2 kg (2 lb 10 oz), and he was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for 3 months. Head circumference and length are at the 50th percentile; weight is at the 15th percentile. Vital signs are normal. On examination, the patient keeps his right hand fisted shut. Muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes are increased in the right arm and leg. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",

    "en": "This premature infant has gross motor delay, hypertonia, and hyperreflexia, findings concerning for cerebral palsy (CP). CP is a nonprogressive neurologic injury that causes motor dysfunction. Spastic CP is the most common subtype and can affect the bilateral lower extremities (diplegia), unilateral arm and leg (hemiplegia), or in more severe cases, all four extremities (quadriplegia).\n\nCP is more common in premature and low birthweight infants because they are susceptible to white matter loss (ie, periventricular leukomalacia) around the lateral ventricles. In contrast to term infants, in whom watershed injury of the cerebral cortex is more likely to occur with poor perfusion, premature infants have sparse vascularization of the periventricular cerebral white matter. Ischemia to this area disrupts normal myelination, leading to neuronal cell death and cystic necrosis. In addition, prematurity is also associated with increased risk for intraventricular hemorrhage, which can further contribute to the development of CP. However, in some cases, no underlying cause is identified. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nDelayed gross motor milestones are often the first sign of CP in infancy, as seen in this patient (age 6 months when corrected for gestation) who cannot roll over or sit up. Early hand preference (age <1) is also common with spastic hemiplegia, as seen in this infant whose right hand remains fisted and unable to relax due to increased tone.\n\n(Choice A) Brachial plexus injuries are typically the result of birth trauma and present with arm weakness and low tone. Reflexes are usually diminished or absent in the affected upper extremity, and the lower extremities would not be affected.\n\n(Choice B) Diffuse cerebral atrophy can be seen in premature infants with cerebral palsy but would present with global neurologic deficits involving bilateral extremities. This patient's spastic hemiparesis is most likely due to a focal left-sided brain lesion.\n\n(Choice C) Holoprosencephaly is due to incomplete division of the forebrain during embryologic development. This brain abnormality can cause spasticity, but bilateral findings would be expected. In addition, a midfacial defect is typically present in these patients.\n\n(Choice D) Mesial temporal sclerosis is a characteristic MRI finding in patients with focal temporal lobe epilepsy and is not associated with CP. Moreover, the temporal lobe is responsible for sensory processing and memory formation, not motor function.\n\nEducational objective:\nCerebral palsy is a nonprogressive neurologic injury that most commonly presents with delayed gross motor milestones, spasticity, and hyperreflexia. Premature infants are particularly susceptible due to periventricular leukomalacia (white matter necrosis). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "这个早产儿有粗大运动发育迟缓、肌张力增高和反射亢进，这些发现提示脑瘫（CP）。脑瘫是一种非进行性神经损伤，可导致运动功能障碍。痉挛型脑瘫是最常见的亚型，可影响双下肢（双瘫）、单侧手臂和腿（偏瘫），或在更严重的情况下，影响所有四肢（四肢瘫）。\n\n脑瘫在早产儿和低出生体重儿中更常见，因为他们容易出现侧脑室周围的白质丢失（即脑室周围白质软化）。与足月儿相比，足月儿更容易因灌注不良而发生大脑皮质的灌注区损伤，早产儿的脑室周围白质的血管分布较稀疏。该区域的缺血会破坏正常的髓鞘形成，导致神经元细胞死亡和囊性坏死。此外，早产也与颅内出血的风险增加有关，这可能会进一步促进脑瘫的发展。然而，在某些情况下，无法确定根本原因。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n粗大运动里程碑延迟通常是婴儿脑瘫的第一个征兆，如本患者（根据孕龄纠正为6个月）不能翻身或坐起来。早期手偏好（年龄 <1岁）在痉挛性偏瘫中也很常见，如该婴儿，其右手保持握拳状态，由于张力增加而无法放松。\n\n（选项A）臂丛神经损伤通常是出生创伤的结果，表现为手臂无力和低张力。受影响的上肢的反射通常减弱或消失，下肢不会受到影响。\n\n（选项B）弥漫性脑萎缩可见于脑瘫的早产儿，但会出现涉及双侧肢体的全身性神经功能缺损。该患者的痉挛性偏瘫最可能是由于局灶性左侧脑损伤所致。\n\n（选项C）前脑无裂畸形是由于胚胎发育过程中前脑分裂不完全所致。这种脑部异常可引起痉挛，但预计会出现双侧发现。此外，这些患者通常存在面中部缺陷。\n\n（选项D）内侧颞叶硬化是局灶性颞叶癫痫患者的特征性MRI发现，与脑瘫无关。此外，颞叶负责感觉处理和记忆形成，而不是运动功能。\n\n教育目标：\n脑瘫是一种非进行性神经损伤，最常表现为粗大运动里程碑延迟、痉挛和反射亢进。早产儿特别容易受到脑室周围白质软化（白质坏死）的影响。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cerebral palsy (CP), specifically its risk factors, clinical presentation, and underlying pathophysiology related to prematurity and periventricular leukomalacia.
