The patient has been hospitalized twice in the past year for similar symptoms and states that a diagnosis was never found. He declines when asked to sign a release of information to obtain his prior medical records. Vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, heart and lung sounds are normal. Abdomen is soft and nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds. The patient grimaces and moans in pain throughout the evaluation. Laboratory evaluation and abdominal CT scan show no abnormalities.

    "en": "Malingering is characterized by intentional falsification or exaggeration of symptoms to obtain an obvious external reward (eg, medications, financial gain, avoidance of work responsibilities or criminal prosecution). This patient's subjective report of severe pain and distress without objective findings (normal physical examination, repeated hospitalizations without diagnosis), refusal to provide release for prior medical records, and evidence of external gain (time off from work) are suggestive of malingering. Malingering is a behavior characterized by INTENTIONAL FALSIFICATION or exaggeration of symptoms to obtain an obvious EXTERNAL REWARD (eg, medications, financial gain, avoidance of work responsibilities or criminal prosecution). These patients often have a dramatic presentation based on subjective complaints rather than objective findings and may refuse to provide a release of information.\n\nMalingering should be differentiated from factitious disorder, in which the patient intentionally falsifies symptoms with the goal of assuming the patient role, rather than obtaining an external reward. Patients with factitious disorder often welcome invasive diagnostic testing and surgical procedures. In contrast, patients who are malingering will often REFUSE TO UNDERGO INVASIVE medical procedures.\n\n(Choice A) Chronic feelings of helplessness are associated with depression and some personality disorders. Although patients with these disorders may also be preoccupied with somatic symptoms, they do not intentionally exaggerate or falsify their symptoms for an external gain like this patient.\n\n(Choice B) Excessive anxiety about unexplained physical symptoms is characteristic of somatic symptom disorder. These patients do not intentionally falsify their symptoms; their presentation is genuine. In contrast, this patient is not excessively anxious and appears to be exaggerating his symptoms for an external gain.\n\n(Choice C) Preoccupation with having a serious illness is a key feature of illness anxiety disorder. These patients fear having a serious diagnosis despite few or no symptoms. This patient has exaggerated symptoms and is focused on avoiding work responsibilities rather than fear that a serious medical condition has been missed.\n\n(Choice D) Although malingering can be associated with conditional threats of self-harm, suicide, or violence (eg, a patient threatens to kill himself if demands are not met), recurrent suicidal behaviors (eg, gestures and attempts) are associated with borderline personality disorder and are often motivated by fears of abandonment.\n\nEducational objective:\nMalingering is characterized by intentional falsification or exaggeration of symptoms to obtain an obvious external reward. The presentation is typically based on a subjective report of symptoms, and these patients commonly refuse to undergo invasive medical procedures.",
    "zh": "诈病（Malingering）的特征是有意伪造或夸大症状以获得明显的外部奖励（例如，药物、经济利益、逃避工作责任或刑事起诉）。该患者主诉严重的疼痛和痛苦，但没有客观体征（体格检查正常，反复住院但未确诊），拒绝提供其之前的病历，以及有获得外部利益的证据（请假），提示诈病。诈病是一种行为，其特征是有意伪造或夸大症状以获得明显的外部奖励（例如，药物、经济利益、逃避工作责任或刑事起诉）。这些患者的症状通常基于主观诉求，而不是客观发现，并且可能拒绝提供信息披露。\n\n诈病应与人为障碍区分开来，人为障碍是指患者故意伪造症状，目的是扮演患者的角色，而不是获得外部奖励。患有人为障碍的患者通常欢迎侵入性诊断检测和外科手术。相比之下，诈病的患者通常拒绝接受侵入性医疗程序。\n\n（选项A）长期感到无助与抑郁症和一些人格障碍有关。尽管患有这些疾病的患者也可能专注于躯体症状，但他们不会像该患者那样为了获得外部利益而故意夸大或伪造其症状。\n\n（选项B）对无法解释的身体症状过度焦虑是躯体症状障碍的特征。这些患者不会故意伪造其症状；他们的表现是真实的。相比之下，该患者并未过度焦虑，似乎是为了获得外部利益而夸大其症状。\n\n（选项C）专注于患有严重疾病是疾病焦虑症的一个关键特征。这些患者害怕被诊断出患有严重疾病，尽管他们很少或没有症状。该患者夸大了症状，并且专注于逃避工作责任，而不是担心被漏诊严重的医学状况。\n\n（选项D）尽管诈病可能与有条件的自残、自杀或暴力威胁有关（例如，患者威胁说，如果未满足其要求，他将自杀），但反复出现的自杀行为（例如，姿势和企图）与边缘型人格障碍有关，并且通常是出于对被遗弃的恐惧。\n\n教育目标：诈病的特征是有意伪造或夸大症状以获得明显的外部奖励。其表现通常基于对症状的主观报告，并且这些患者通常拒绝接受侵入性医疗程序。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of malingering, a condition characterized by the intentional exaggeration or falsification of symptoms for external gain. It requires differentiating malingering from other psychiatric conditions presenting with somatic complaints.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the key features suggestive of malingering, such as the discrepancy between subjective complaints and objective findings, the history of repeated unexplained hospitalizations, refusal to release medical records, and the request for time off work. The patient's behavior points towards an external reward, and a common characteristic of malingering is the refusal of invasive medical procedures.",
