    "en": "A 65-year-old man comes to the office due to a 6-month history of exertional dyspnea. Over the past few weeks he has also developed a nonproductive cough. Medical history is notable for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Temperature is 36.9 C (98.4 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 18/min. Examination shows late inspiratory crackles in both lung bases and mild digital clubbing. The patient undergoes lung biopsy; histologic examination shows areas of dense collagen fibrosis, foci of proliferating fibroblasts, mild interstitial inflammation, and honeycomb changes. The interstitial inflammation is patchy and consists of a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in the alveolar septa associated with hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocytes. Pharmacotherapy aimed at which of the following is most helpful in treating this patient's lung condition?",

    "en": "This patient with progressive dyspnea, dry cough, digital clubbing, and crackles on examination has signs of an interstitial lung disease. The histologic findings of patchy dense collagen fibrosis in the interstitium, foci of proliferating fibroblasts, honeycomb, and mild lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates with hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocytes are highly suggestive of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). {{exhibit_1}} IPF is a chronic, progressive fibrotic lung disease thought to be due to recurrent episodes of lung injury and disordered healing. Persistent inflammation likely triggers excessive activity of growth factors normally involved in wound healing, including transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This leads to increased fibroblast activity, myofibroblast formation, and collagen production, which contribute to pulmonary fibrosis. Pirfenidone is an antifibrotic agent that inhibits TGF-β; another treatment option is nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits PDGF, FGF, and VEGF. Although neither drug is curative, these therapies have been shown to slow progressive fibrosis in patients with IPF. {{exhibit_2}} (Choice A) Alpha-1 antitrypsin infusion is used to treat patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which causes panacinar emphysema and typically presents in young patients with dyspnea and cough. Histologic findings in emphysema include large alveoli with thin septa. {{exhibit_3}} (Choice B) Endothelin-1 inhibitors (eg, ambrisentan, bosentan) are used to treat idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. Histologic findings of pulmonary hypertension include pulmonary vascular media and intima hypertrophy and intimal fibrosis. {{exhibit_4}} (Choice C) Monoclonal antibodies directed at interleukin-5 (eg, reslizumab) inhibit eosinophil recruitment and proliferation, and are used in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. Histologic findings in asthma include goblet cell hyperplasia, bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy, edema, eosinophilia, and Charcot-Leyden crystals. {{exhibit_5}} (Choice D) Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors (ie, roflumilast) block the degradation of cyclic AMP, leading to reduced airway inflammation and smooth muscle relaxation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Histologic findings include both airspace enlargement with thin septa (emphysema) and goblet cell hyperplasia with excess mucus production (chronic bronchitis). {{exhibit_6}} Educational objective: Histologic findings of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis include patchy dense collagen fibrosis in the interstitium, focal fibroblastic proliferation, honeycombing, and mild lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates with hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocytes. Therapies are directed at slowing the progression of fibrosis by inhibiting transforming growth factor-beta and other fibrogenic growth factors (eg, PDGF, fibroblast growth factor, and VEGF).",
    "zh": "该患者出现进行性呼吸困难、干咳、杵状指和检查时出现爆裂音，有间质性肺病的迹象。组织学发现间质中有斑片状致密胶原纤维化、增殖成纤维细胞灶、蜂窝状改变，以及轻度淋巴浆细胞浸润伴2型肺细胞增生，高度提示特发性肺纤维化（IPF）。{{exhibit_1}} IPF 是一种慢性进行性纤维化肺病，被认为是由于反复发作的肺损伤和愈合紊乱所致。持续性炎症可能触发通常参与伤口愈合的生长因子过度活化，包括转化生长因子β (TGF-β)、血小板衍生生长因子 (PDGF)、成纤维细胞生长因子 (FGF) 和血管内皮生长因子 (VEGF)。这会导致成纤维细胞活性增加、肌成纤维细胞形成和胶原蛋白产生，从而导致肺纤维化。吡非尼酮是一种抑制TGF-β的抗纤维化药物；另一种治疗选择是尼达尼布，一种酪氨酸激酶抑制剂，可抑制 PDGF、FGF 和 VEGF。虽然这两种药物都不能根治，但已证实这些疗法可以减缓IPF患者的进行性纤维化。{{exhibit_2}} (选项A) α-1抗胰蛋白酶输注用于治疗α-1抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症患者，该病可引起全小叶肺气肿，通常表现为年轻患者出现呼吸困难和咳嗽。肺气肿的组织学发现包括具有薄壁的大肺泡。{{exhibit_3}} (选项B) 内皮素-1抑制剂（例如，安立生坦、波生坦）用于治疗特发性肺动脉高压。肺动脉高压的组织学发现包括肺血管中层和内膜肥厚和内膜纤维化。{{exhibit_4}} (选项C) 针对白细胞介素-5的单克隆抗体（例如，雷利珠单抗）可抑制嗜酸性粒细胞的募集和增殖，并用于重度嗜酸性粒细胞性哮喘患者。哮喘的组织学发现包括杯状细胞增生、支气管平滑肌肥大、水肿、嗜酸性粒细胞增多和夏科-莱登结晶。{{exhibit_5}} (选项D) 磷酸二酯酶-4抑制剂（即罗氟司特）可阻断环磷酸腺苷的降解，从而减少慢性阻塞性肺病患者的气道炎症和平滑肌松弛。组织学发现包括肺泡腔扩大伴有薄壁（肺气肿）和杯状细胞增生伴有粘液过度产生（慢性支气管炎）。{{exhibit_6}} 教学目标：特发性肺纤维化的组织学发现包括间质中的斑片状致密胶原纤维化、局灶性成纤维细胞增殖、蜂窝状改变和轻度淋巴浆细胞浸润伴2型肺细胞增生。治疗旨在通过抑制转化生长因子β和其他纤维生成生长因子（例如，PDGF、成纤维细胞生长因子和VEGF）来减缓纤维化的进展。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic and progressive interstitial lung disease. It requires correlating clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and histopathological features with targeted pharmacotherapy.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the constellation of symptoms and findings suggestive of IPF. Then, understanding the underlying fibrotic process driven by growth factors like TGF-β is crucial. Finally, identifying the pharmacologic agents that target these specific pathways is key to selecting the correct answer.",
