    "en": "A 48-year-old man is hospitalized due to severe depression. The patient became increasingly depressed over the past month and stopped going to work last week because he was unmotivated to get out of bed. He sleeps up to 16 hours a day, has no energy, and has gained 4.54 kg (10 lb) over the past month. The patient has had daily thoughts of suicide for the past week but says he will not act on them because of his children. He also describes several weeklong periods when he had extra energy and took on many projects at once. During these times, the patient rarely slept and believed he had superhuman powers to control other people's minds with his eyes. Physical and laboratory evaluations are unremarkable.",

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's current symptoms and past psychiatric history are consistent with BIPOLAR I DISORDER. He is currently experiencing a major depressive episode (ie, ≥2 weeks of depressed mood, low energy, increased appetite, hypersomnia, and suicidal ideation), and his history is consistent with manic episodes characterized by weeklong periods of increased energy, hyperactivity, decreased need for sleep, and grandiose delusions.\n\nThe goal of long-term treatment of bipolar disorder is to delay or prevent recurrence of manic and depressive episodes. Treatment options for BIPOLAR MAINTENANCE include the mood stabilizers LITHIUM, VALPROATE, and LAMOTRIGINE or second-generation antipsychotics (eg, QUIETIAPINE, RISPERIDONE). Maintenance treatment with lithium has also been shown to reduce the risk of suicidal ideation, making it a good choice for this patient.\n\n(Choices A, D, and G) Bupropion (a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor), duloxetine (a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), and sertraline (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) are antidepressants that would be appropriate in unipolar bipolar depression or as an adjunct in bipolar depression if symptoms persist despite an adequate dose of a mood stabilizer. Antidepressant monotherapy should be avoided in patients with bipolar disorder due to the risk of inducing mania.\n\n(Choice B) Clozapine is a second-generation antipsychotic that is used in treatment-resistant cases of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder but is not a first-line treatment because of the risk of life-threatening agranulocytosis.\n\n(Choice C) Benzodiazepines (eg, diazepam) are not indicated for bipolar maintenance treatment and are associated with the risk of abuse and dependence.\n\n(Choice E) Haloperidol is a first-generation antipsychotic that may be used to treat acute mania. However, it is not used for long-term bipolar maintenance due to its adverse effect profile (eg, dyskinesia).\n\nEducational objective:\nThe goal of bipolar maintenance treatment is to delay or prevent recurrent manic and depressive episodes. Lithium is first-line treatment and has the added benefit of reducing the risk of suicide.",
    "zh": "该患者目前的症状和既往精神病史与I型双相情感障碍一致。他目前正经历重度抑郁发作（即，≥2周的抑郁情绪、低能量、食欲增加、嗜睡和自杀意念），他的病史与躁狂发作一致，其特征是持续一周的精力增加、过度活跃、睡眠需求减少和夸大妄想。\n\n双相情感障碍的长期治疗目标是延迟或预防躁狂和抑郁发作的复发。双相情感障碍维持治疗的方案包括情绪稳定剂锂盐、丙戊酸盐和拉莫三嗪或二代抗精神病药（如喹硫平、利培酮）。锂盐的维持治疗也被证明可以降低自杀意念的风险，这使其成为该患者的良好选择。\n\n（选项A、D和G）安非他酮（去甲肾上腺素-多巴胺再摄取抑制剂）、度洛西汀（选择性5-羟色胺和去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂）和舍曲林（选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂）是抗抑郁药，适用于单极性双相抑郁症或作为双相抑郁症的辅助治疗，如果症状在足量的情绪稳定剂后仍然持续存在。应避免对双相情感障碍患者进行抗抑郁药单药治疗，因为有诱发躁狂的风险。\n\n（选项B）氯氮平是二代抗精神病药，用于治疗难治性精神分裂症或双相情感障碍，但不是一线治疗，因为它有危及生命的粒细胞缺乏症的风险。\n\n（选项C）苯二氮卓类药物（例如，地西泮）不适用于双相情感障碍维持治疗，并与滥用和依赖的风险相关。\n\n（选项E）氟哌啶醇是一代抗精神病药，可用于治疗急性躁狂。然而，由于其不良反应（例如，运动障碍），它不用于长期双相情感障碍维持治疗。\n\n教育目标：\n双相情感障碍维持治疗的目标是延迟或预防反复发作的躁狂和抑郁发作。锂盐是一线治疗，并具有降低自杀风险的额外益处。"
