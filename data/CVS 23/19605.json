    "en": "A 16-year-old boy is evaluated in the office due to leg cramps. He plays soccer but frequently stops in the middle of practice due to cramps in both legs. The patient is afebrile. Blood pressure is 170/90 mm Hg bilaterally in the upper extremities. The point of maximal impulse is nondisplaced. S1 is present and S2 is physiologically split. An S4 is heard, as well as a continuous murmur best auscultated over the back at the left interscapular area. There is no appreciable murmur on auscultation of the anterior chest. Distal pulses in the radial arteries are prominent. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are difficult to palpate. The rest of the physical examination findings: {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient has upper extremity hypertension with diminished lower extremity pulses. These findings are consistent with coarctation of the aorta (COA), a congenital defect involving aortic narrowing that is usually just distal to the left subclavian artery. The defect leads to increased aortic pressure proximally and decreased flow distally.\n\nPatients with severe COA may develop cardiogenic shock in the neonatal period due to critical aortic obstruction. In contrast, those with milder COA typically present in childhood or adulthood as enough blood is able to pass through the defect to prevent development of heart failure; findings include hypertension and bounding pulses in the upper extremities with hypotension and diminished pulses in the lower extremities. Decreased distal perfusion can also lead to lower extremity claudication (leg pain/cramps with exertion).\n\nOver time, a compensatory network of collateral vessels that bypasses the coarctation can develop. For instance, distal branches of the ascending aorta (eg, internal thoracic artery) can supply the intercostal arteries below the obstruction; the relatively low pressure distally allows retrograde flow through the intercostal arteries into the descending aorta. This flow through collateral blood vessels frequently causes a continuous murmur that can be heard over the back in the interscapular area; patients may also have a systolic murmur caused by flow through the coarctation itself. Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy can also develop due to pressure overload, creating an S4.\n\n(Choices A and D) An atrial septal defect is a left-to-right intracardiac shunt that leads to right-sided volume overload, causing increased flow through the tricuspid valve and pulmonary arteries. Examination reveals a fixed and widely split S2 and a systolic ejection murmur best heard over the second left intercostal space (ie, pulmonic flow murmur).\n\n(Choice C) Increased cardiac output due to low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) can occur during septic shock. SVR is effectively increased in COA due to the aortic obstruction.\n\n(Choice E) A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) typically causes a continuous murmur, but it is best heard over the left infraclavicular area (anterior chest). In addition, a PDA would not explain this patient's prominent difference in upper and lower extremity pulse strength.\n\nEducational objective:\nAortic coarctation classically leads to lower extremity claudication and increased blood pressure in the arms compared to the legs. Over time, if the defect remains unrepaired, a compensatory collateral circulation develops and supplies blood to the descending aorta. Blood flow through collateral vessels creates a continuous murmur heard over the interscapular area. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者上肢高血压，下肢脉搏减弱。这些发现与主动脉缩窄（COA）一致，主动脉缩窄是一种先天性缺陷，涉及主动脉狭窄，通常位于左锁骨下动脉的远端。该缺陷导致近端主动脉压力升高，远端血流减少。\n\n患有严重COA的患者可能会因主动脉严重梗阻而在新生儿期发生心源性休克。相比之下，患有较轻COA的患者通常在儿童或成年期出现，因为有足够的血液能够通过该缺陷，从而防止心力衰竭的发生；其表现包括上肢高血压和搏动性脉搏，以及下肢低血压和脉搏减弱。远端灌注减少还会导致下肢跛行（运动时腿部疼痛/痉挛）。\n\n随着时间的推移，可以形成一个绕过缩窄的代偿性侧支血管网络。例如，升主动脉的远端分支（例如，胸廓内动脉）可以为梗阻以下的肋间动脉供血；远端相对较低的压力允许血液通过肋间动脉逆行流入降主动脉。这种通过侧支血管的血流经常引起连续性杂音，可在肩胛间区背部听到；患者也可能出现因通过主动脉缩窄本身的血流引起的收缩期杂音。由于压力超负荷，也可发生向心性左心室肥大，产生S4。\n\n（选项A和D）房间隔缺损是一种从左向右的intracardiac分流，导致右侧容量超负荷，引起通过三尖瓣和肺动脉的血流量增加。检查显示S2固定且广泛分裂，以及在第二肋间隙左侧听诊最清楚的收缩期喷射性杂音（即肺动脉血流杂音）。\n\n（选项C）由于全身血管阻力（SVR）低，心输出量增加可能发生在感染性休克期间。由于主动脉梗阻，COA中的SVR实际上会增加。\n\n（选项E）动脉导管未闭（PDA）通常引起连续性杂音，但最好在左锁骨下区（前胸）听诊。此外，PDA无法解释该患者上下肢脉搏强度的显着差异。\n\n教学目标：\n主动脉缩窄通常导致下肢跛行，上肢血压高于腿部。随着时间的推移，如果该缺陷未修复，就会形成代偿性侧支循环，并为降主动脉供血。通过侧支血管的血流会产生在肩胛间区听到的连续性杂音。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of coarctation of the aorta (COA), including its clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and associated findings like upper extremity hypertension, lower extremity claudication, and collateral vessel development. It also requires differentiating COA from other cardiac conditions that can cause murmurs.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key findings of upper extremity hypertension and diminished lower extremity pulses, which are highly suggestive of COA. Consider the location of the murmur (interscapular area) and the presence of an S4, which further supports the diagnosis. Rule out other conditions based on their typical murmur locations and associated findings.",
