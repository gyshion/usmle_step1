    "en": "A 23-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to 7 days of fever and malaise. He has also had nausea and a poor appetite. The patient has no significant medical history but regularly uses injection drugs and has had multiple sexual partners. Temperature is 38 C (100.4 F). On physical examination, there is scleral icterus. A tender, smooth liver edge is palpable 4 cm below the right costal margin. Appropriate therapy is initiated. The following graph illustrates this patient's hepatitis B serologic markers over time {{exhibit_1}}.",

    "en": "Educational objective:\nThe presence of anti-HBc and anti-HBs antibodies in the serum without detectable viral antigens indicates recovery from acute hepatitis B infection. In contrast, patients vaccinated against hepatitis B will have anti-HBs antibodies without detectable levels of anti-HBc. Chronic hepatitis B is indicated by persistent levels of HBsAg and HBV DNA in the serum.\n\n(Choices A and B) Patients with chronic hepatitis B have elevated HBsAg >6 months after initial infection. Chronic hepatitis B with high infectivity is represented by persistent elevation of HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA with no anti-HBe. Transition from high infectivity to low infectivity usually occurs years later and is marked by anti-HBe, the elimination of HBeAg, and the continued production of HBsAg.\n\n(Choice C) Patients with an exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B have an abrupt increase in liver enzymes and increased levels of HBV DNA. Exacerbations are often asymptomatic, but some individuals develop symptoms of acute hepatitis.\n\n(Choice D) Vaccination against hepatitis B would be identified by the presence of anti-HBs with no anti-HBc, anti-HBe, or viral antigens. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "教育目标：\n血清中存在抗-HBc和抗-HBs抗体，但无病毒抗原，表明已从急性乙型肝炎感染中恢复。 相比之下，接种过乙型肝炎疫苗的患者将有抗-HBs抗体，但检测不到抗-HBc水平。 慢性乙型肝炎的特征是血清中持续存在HBsAg和HBV DNA。\n\n（选项A和B）患有慢性乙型肝炎的患者在初次感染后6个月以上HBsAg升高。 高传染性慢性乙型肝炎的特征是HBsAg、HBeAg和HBV DNA持续升高，无抗-HBe。 从高传染性到低传染性的转变通常发生在几年后，其特征是抗-HBe、HBeAg的消除和HBsAg的持续产生。\n\n（选项C）慢性乙型肝炎加重的患者肝酶突然升高，HBV DNA水平升高。 加重通常无症状，但一些人会出现急性肝炎的症状。\n\n（选项D）接种乙型肝炎疫苗的特征是存在抗-HBs，但无抗-HBc、抗-HBe或病毒抗原。 {{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the interpretation of hepatitis B serologic markers to differentiate between acute infection, chronic infection, vaccination, and recovery. The key is to analyze the presence or absence of HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc antibodies to determine the patient's hepatitis B status.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully examine the graph showing the serologic markers over time. Identify the presence of anti-HBc and anti-HBs antibodies without detectable viral antigens, which indicates recovery from acute hepatitis B infection.",
