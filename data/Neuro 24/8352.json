    "en": "This patient's constellation of symptoms (ie, paresthesias, weakness, dizziness, nausea) and history of fish consumption are strongly suggestive of food poisoning by pufferfish, a Japanese delicacy. Pufferfish can be lethal if not properly prepared. It is necessary to remove the organs containing high quantities of tetrodotoxin, a toxin produced by microorganisms associated with the fish.\n\nTetrodotoxin binds to voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve and cardiac tissue, preventing sodium influx and depolarization. Symptoms of tetrodotoxin poisoning occur quickly after ingestion and include dizziness, weakness, loss of reflexes, paresthesias of the face and extremities, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Higher exposures can cause severe hypotension and general paralysis; death can occur from respiratory failure and hypotension. Treatment includes supportive care and intestinal decontamination with gut lavage and charcoal.\n\n(Choice A) The resting potential is equal to approximately -70 mV. It is maintained by high membrane K+ permeability and low Na+ permeability. K+ efflux occurs via non-gated K+ channels (leak channels).\n\n(Choice B) Phase B of the action potential curve represents the rapid depolarization phase, which is caused by the rapid influx of Na+ ions into the cell through voltage-gated sodium channels. Tetrodotoxin blocks these channels, preventing Na+ influx and thus impairing depolarization. This leads to a failure of action potential generation and propagation, resulting in the patient's neurological symptoms.\n\n(Choice C) Overshoot represents the maximal value of the action potential during which the membrane potential is positive. At this point, open sodium channels become inactivated and close, preventing further increase in the membrane potential.\n\n(Choice D) Repolarization results from closure of Na+ channels and simultaneous opening of K+ channels. This results in a sharp decrease in Na+ conductance and a significant increase in K+ conductance. Potassium efflux is responsible for returning the membrane potential to the resting potential.\n\n(Choice E) Hyperpolarization occurs for a short moment following repolarization due to the slow closure of voltage-gated potassium channels. The membrane potential becomes more negative than the normal resting potential and approaches the K+ equilibrium potential of -85 mV. When the voltage-gated K+ channels close, the membrane potential returns to the resting value.\n\nKey clinical pearls:\nTetrodotoxin poisoning is associated with pufferfish consumption and causes paralysis by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels, thus impairing NEURONAL DEPOLARIZATION.",

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology of tetrodotoxin poisoning, specifically how it affects the action potential of neurons. It requires correlating clinical symptoms with the mechanism of action of the toxin on voltage-gated sodium channels.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the likely cause of the patient's symptoms based on the history of eating pufferfish. Then, recall or deduce that tetrodotoxin blocks voltage-gated sodium channels. Finally, relate this blockade to the specific phase of the action potential that is dependent on sodium influx, which is the depolarization phase.",
