    "en": "A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of involuntary movements and behavioral disturbance. The patient has frequent, jerky, irregular movements of his upper extremities that have progressively worsened over the past month. His family and friends also say that he has become increasingly irritable over the past year. Genetic testing shows a mutation affecting the huntingtin protein that results in transcriptional repression of several other genes. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for this transcriptional repression?",

    "en": "Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by an increased number of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein. Expansion of the protein's polyglutamine region results in a gain-of-function mutation that leads to pathologic interaction with other proteins, including various transcription factors.\n\nTranscriptional repression (silencing) is one of the mechanisms by which mutated huntingtin is thought to cause disease. Regulation of transcription occurs in part due to histones. Small proteins that complex with DNA to help compact the strands. Histones can undergo a variety of modifications (eg, methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation) that affect the accessibility of the genome for transcription. Acetylation of histones (via histone acetyltransferase) enhances gene transcription by weakening DNA-histone bonding (ie, relaxed chromatin) and making DNA segments more accessible for transcription factors and RNA polymerases.\n\nIn Huntington disease, abnormal huntingtin reduces functioning of histone acetyltransferase. The resulting hypoacetylation increases DNA-histone bonding, leading to a relative increase in compact chromatin. Decreased DNA accessibility reduces transcription of genes that code for neurotrophic (ie, survival) factors, thus contributing to impaired neuronal survival. Increased neuron death in the striatum leads to classic features of Huntington disease in adulthood, including chorea, behavioral abnormalities (eg, irritability), and progressive dementia.\n\n(Choice A) Chromatin relaxation allows portions of DNA to be accessible for transcription. In contrast, the pathophysiology of Huntington disease involves chromatin that is excessively compact and inaccessible to transcription due to histone deacetylation.\n\n(Choice B) DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that inhibits gene transcription. Hypermethylation of the promoter region of a gene results in transcriptional silencing, as in fragile X syndrome; hypomethylation improves gene expression and is not involved in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease.\n\n(Choice D) Homeodomain (homeobox) genes are critical for the sequential development of organs and tissues along the body axis during embryogenesis. Mutations affecting these genes alter body structure, leading to congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion.\n\n(Choice E) Thymidine dimerization is a mechanism of DNA damage induced by ultraviolet radiation.\n\nEducational objective:\nHuntington disease is caused by a pathologic gain-of-function mutation that promotes histone deacetylation. The resulting increase in DNA-histone bonding makes the chromatin less accessible for transcription, which limits expression of neurotrophic (ie, survival) factors. Increased neuron death within the striatum leads to classic features of Huntington disease in adulthood (eg, chorea, behavioral abnormalities, progressive dementia).",

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional repression in Huntington disease, specifically focusing on epigenetic modifications of chromatin structure. It assesses the knowledge of how mutations in the huntingtin protein lead to altered histone acetylation and subsequent gene silencing.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the key features of Huntington disease, including the genetic mutation and its effect on protein function. Understanding the role of histone acetylation in gene regulation is crucial. By recognizing that the mutation leads to reduced histone acetyltransferase activity, one can deduce that histone deacetylation and subsequent chromatin compaction are responsible for transcriptional repression.",
