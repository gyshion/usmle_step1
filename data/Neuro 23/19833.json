    "en": "A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to weakness and difficulty speaking. He has a history of hypertension, cigarette smoking, and polysubstance use. The patient experienced a headache while smoking crack cocaine the previous night. This morning, he was found on the bed unable to move or speak. On physical examination, the patient is awake with normal pupillary responses. Vertical eye movements are intact, but horizontal eye movements are impaired. There is loss of motor strength in the upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Ischemic infarction from cocaine-induced vasospasm is suspected. A lesion involving which of the brain regions is the most likely cause of this patient's current condition? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient with quadriplegia and speechlessness with preserved consciousness and eye movements has locked-in syndrome, which can be caused by ischemic injury to the bilateral ventral pons. Locked-in syndrome classically leads to:\n\nAbsent voluntary motor function of the limbs (quadriplegia) and oral structures (loss of speech) due to destruction of the cortical spinal and cortical bulbar pathways, which prevents cranial nerves or the limbs from receiving cortical signals.\n\nAbsent horizontal eye movements. However, vertical eye movements and eyelid elevation are preserved because they are controlled in the rostral midbrain.\n\nPreserved consciousness because the midbrain reticular formation is spared (Choice C). Behavioral arousal and sleep-wake cycles are also preserved because the diencephalon-upper brainstem arousal systems are unaffected.\n\nPreserved sensation because sensory pathways are not affected and preserved brainstem and spinal reflexes because they do not require cortical input.\n\n(Choice A) Damage to the angular gyrus of the dominant parietal lobe classically results in Gerstmann syndrome, which is characterized by agraphia (inability to write), acalculia (inability to carry out mathematical calculations), finger agnosia (inability to identify individual fingers on the hand), and left-right disorientation.\n\n(Choice B) Damage to the cingulate gyrus can result in significant behavioral symptoms (eg, abulia).\n\n(Choice E) Damage to the medial medulla can result in contralateral hemiparesis (due to damage of the lateral corticospinal tract), contralateral hemisensory loss (dorsal column/medial lemniscal pathway), and ipsilateral tongue paralysis (hypoglossal nucleus).\n\n(Choice F) Damage to the lateral medulla can result in Wallenberg syndrome, which is characterized by vertigo/nystagmus, ipsilateral cerebellar signs (eg, ataxia, dysmetria), loss of pain/temperature sensation in the ipsilateral face and contralateral body, bulbar weakness (eg, dysphagia), and ipsilateral Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, anhidrosis). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}\n\nEducational objective:\nIschemic injury to the bilateral ventral pons can lead to locked-in syndrome, a condition in which patients are unable to move or speak (due to interruption of the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts) but retain consciousness, sensation, eye opening, and vertical eye movements.",
    "zh": "这名四肢瘫痪、失语、意识和眼球运动保留的患者患有闭锁综合征，这可能是由于双侧腹侧脑桥缺血性损伤引起的。闭锁综合征通常会导致：\n\n肢体（四肢瘫痪）和口腔结构（失语）的自主运动功能缺失，这是由于皮质脊髓和皮质延髓通路受损，阻止脑神经或肢体接收皮质信号。\n\n水平眼球运动缺失。然而，垂直眼球运动和眼睑上抬得以保留，因为它们由吻侧中脑控制。\n\n意识保留，因为中脑网状结构得以保留（选项C）。行为唤醒和睡眠-觉醒周期也得以保留，因为间脑-上脑干唤醒系统未受影响。\n\n感觉保留，因为感觉通路未受影响，并且脑干和脊髓反射得以保留，因为它们不需要皮质输入。\n\n（选项A）优势半球顶叶角回损伤通常会导致Gerstmann综合征，其特征是失写症（无法书写）、计算不能（无法进行数学计算）、手指失认症（无法识别手上的各个手指）和左右定向障碍。\n\n（选项B）扣带回损伤可导致明显的行为症状（例如，意志缺失）。\n\n（选项E）内侧延髓损伤可导致对侧偏瘫（由于侧皮质脊髓束受损）、对侧感觉缺失（背索/内侧丘系通路）和同侧舌麻痹（舌下神经核）。\n\n（选项F）外侧延髓损伤可导致Wallenberg综合征，其特征是眩晕/眼球震颤、同侧小脑体征（例如，共济失调、运动失调）、同侧面部和对侧身体的疼痛/温度感觉丧失、延髓无力（例如，吞咽困难）和同侧Horner综合征（缩瞳、上睑下垂、无汗）。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}\n\n教育目标：\n双侧腹侧脑桥缺血性损伤可导致闭锁综合征，在这种情况下，患者无法移动或说话（由于皮质脊髓束和皮质延髓束中断），但保留意识、感觉、眼睑睁开和垂直眼球运动。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of locked-in syndrome, its clinical presentation, and the anatomical location of the lesion causing it. Specifically, it assesses the ability to recognize the characteristic features of locked-in syndrome (quadriplegia, preserved consciousness, impaired horizontal eye movements) and correlate them with damage to the ventral pons. \n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key clinical features of locked-in syndrome. Recognize that the preserved consciousness and vertical eye movements, coupled with quadriplegia and loss of speech, point towards a lesion in the ventral pons. Eliminate other options based on their distinct clinical presentations.",
