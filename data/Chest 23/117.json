  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast that has an antiphagocytic polysaccharide capsule, a major virulence factor. The polysaccharide capsule appears as a clear, unstained zone with India ink and stains red with mucicarmine (as seen in this patient). C neoformans usually affects immunocompromised patients (eg, kidney transplantation patients on chronic immunosuppression). It is a neurotropic fungus that is transmitted via the respiratory route and most commonly presents with subacute or chronic meningoencephalitis. Cryptococcal lung disease can occasionally cause pneumonia-like symptoms, including cough with scant sputum production, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. Chest x-ray findings are nonspecific (eg, infiltrates, nodules). Diagnosis is usually confirmed by identifying Cryptococcus in sputum, bronchoalveolar washings, or tissue samples.",
    "zh": "新型隐球菌是一种酵母菌，具有抗吞噬多糖荚膜，是主要的毒力因子。多糖荚膜在墨汁染色下呈透明、未染色的区域，并在粘液胭脂红染色下呈红色（如本患者所示）。新型隐球菌通常影响免疫功能低下的患者（例如，长期接受免疫抑制治疗的肾移植患者）。它是一种嗜神经真菌，通过呼吸道传播，最常见表现为亚急性或慢性脑膜脑炎。隐球菌性肺病偶尔可引起类似肺炎的症状，包括咳嗽伴少量痰液、胸膜炎性胸痛、呼吸困难和咯血。胸部X光片结果无特异性（例如，浸润、结节）。诊断通常通过在痰液、支气管肺泡灌洗液或组织样本中鉴定隐球菌来确诊。"
