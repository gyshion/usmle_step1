    "en": "A 46-year-old woman comes to the office due to frequent episodes of headache, nausea, sweating, and a feeling as if she is going to pass out. The patient has had 3 such episodes in the past 2 weeks, with symptoms occurring when she skips a meal. During the most recent episode, finger-stick glucose was 50 mg/dL. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 3 years ago and initially treated with metformin monotherapy; glipizide was added 3 months ago due to inadequate glycemic control. The patient has no other medical conditions. Vital signs are within normal limits and physical examination shows no abnormalities. Hemoglobin A1c is 6.9%.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has symptomatic hypoglycemia following initiation of a sulfonylurea medication (ie, glipizide) for diabetes mellitus. Sulfonylureas inhibit the ATP-sensitive potassium channel on the pancreatic beta cell membrane, inducing depolarization with opening of L-type calcium channels (ie, increased Ca2+ influx), stimulating insulin release. Sulfonylurea-induced stimulation of beta cells is independent of blood glucose and occurs even when blood glucose levels are normal, increasing the risk for hypoglycemia.\n\nThe risk for hypoglycemia associated with sulfonylureas is increased in the setting of skipped meals (as in this patient), in excessively high medication doses, and with concurrent renal or hepatic disease (which decreases drug metabolism and clearance). Although hypoglycemia can occur with any sulfonylurea medication, the risk is highest with longer-acting sulfonylureas (eg, glyburide).\n\n(Choice A) Metformin inhibits the mitochondrial enzymes required for gluconeogenesis, leading to decreased hepatic glucose production and lower circulating glucose levels. It also increases peripheral glucose uptake and improves insulin sensitivity by activating AMP-activated protein kinase. Metformin does not increase endogenous insulin secretion and therefore is not associated with hypoglycemia.\n\n(Choice B) Thiazolidinediones (eg, pioglitazone) decrease insulin resistance by binding to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.\n\n(Choice D) Glucagon-like polypeptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted by the intestine in response to food intake and slows gastric emptying and increases glucose-dependent insulin release. GLP-1 agonists (eg, exenatide) act through cell surface receptors that are coupled with a G protein–adenyl cyclase system. Because the effects of GLP-1 agonists are glucose dependent (eg, occur primarily in the presence of food), these medications are not typically associated with hypoglycemia.\n\n(Choice E) Insulin acts by binding to a cell surface receptor consisting of 2 alpha and 2 beta subunits. The alpha subunits are located extracellularly and provide binding sites for insulin. The membrane-spanning beta subunits contain the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains.\n\nEducational objective:\nSulfonylureas inhibit the ATP-sensitive potassium channel on the pancreatic beta cell membrane, inducing depolarization Ca2+ influx, and insulin release independent of blood glucose concentrations. Sulfonylureas can induce hypoglycemia because they stimulate insulin secretion even when blood glucose levels are normal.",
    "zh": "该患者在开始使用磺酰脲类药物（即格列吡嗪）治疗糖尿病后出现症状性低血糖。磺酰脲类药物抑制胰腺β细胞膜上的ATP敏感性钾通道，引起去极化，伴随L型钙通道开放（即，Ca2+内流增加），从而刺激胰岛素释放。磺酰脲类药物诱导的β细胞刺激作用与血糖无关，即使血糖水平正常也会发生，从而增加了低血糖的风险。\n\n与磺酰脲类药物相关的低血糖风险，在漏餐（如该患者）、药物剂量过高以及合并肾脏或肝脏疾病（降低药物代谢和清除率）的情况下会增加。尽管任何磺酰脲类药物都可能发生低血糖，但风险在长效磺酰脲类药物（如格列本脲）中最高。\n\n(选项A) 二甲双胍抑制糖异生所需的线粒体酶，导致肝脏葡萄糖生成减少和循环葡萄糖水平降低。它还通过激活AMP活化蛋白激酶来增加外周葡萄糖摄取并改善胰岛素敏感性。二甲双胍不增加内源性胰岛素分泌，因此与低血糖无关。\n\n(选项B) 噻唑烷二酮类药物（如吡格列酮）通过与过氧化物酶体增殖物激活受体γ结合来降低胰岛素抵抗，后者是参与葡萄糖和脂质代谢的基因的转录调节因子。\n\n(选项D) 胰高血糖素样肽-1 (GLP-1) 由肠道分泌，以响应食物摄入，并减缓胃排空并增加葡萄糖依赖性胰岛素释放。GLP-1激动剂（如艾塞那肽）通过与G蛋白-腺苷酸环化酶系统偶联的细胞表面受体发挥作用。由于GLP-1激动剂的作用是葡萄糖依赖性的（例如，主要在有食物存在的情况下发生），因此这些药物通常与低血糖无关。\n\n(选项E) 胰岛素通过与由2个α亚基和2个β亚基组成的细胞表面受体结合而发挥作用。α亚基位于细胞外，提供胰岛素的结合位点。跨膜β亚基包含细胞内酪氨酸激酶结构域。\n\n教育目标：\n磺酰脲类药物抑制胰腺β细胞膜上的ATP敏感性钾通道，诱导去极化Ca2+内流，以及与血糖浓度无关的胰岛素释放。磺酰脲类药物可诱发低血糖，因为它们即使在血糖水平正常时也会刺激胰岛素分泌。"
