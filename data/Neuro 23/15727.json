    "en": "A 19-year-old man comes to the emergency department after being stabbed in the right arm during a fight. The patient has no chronic medical conditions. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right upper extremity shows a 4-cm laceration oriented transversely over the volar (flexor) surface of the proximal forearm. The patient is taken to the operating room for surgical repair. While exploring the wound, a nerve that courses between the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus muscles is found to be transected. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "The median nerve is formed from spinal nerves C5-T1 via the medial and lateral cords of the brachial plexus. It courses with the brachial artery between the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles before entering the forearm. In the anterior (volar) forearm, the median nerve passes between the heads of the pronator teres before coursing between the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus muscles. It ultimately passes into the hand through the carpal tunnel beneath the flexor retinaculum. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nThe median nerve is most commonly injured by compression within the carpal tunnel (ie, carpal tunnel syndrome), leading to pain and numbness in the first 3 digits and lateral half of the fourth, along with weakness of thumb flexion and opposition. However, the nerve can be injured more proximally by penetrating trauma to the upper forearm, supracondylar fracture, or entrapment between the heads of pronator teres. In addition to the above symptoms, proximal injury causes decreased sensation over the thenar eminence and weakness of flexion in the wrist and second and third digits (ie, preacher or benediction hand).\n\n(Choices A and B) The adductor pollicis muscle (adduction of the thumb) and palmar interossei (adduction of the third and fourth digits) are innervated by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve courses between the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor carpi ulnaris in the medial forearm.\n\n(Choices C and F) The extensor digitorum (extension of digits at metacarpophalangeal joints) and supinator (supination of forearm) are innervated by the deep branch of the radial nerve (posterior interosseous nerve). This nerve runs in the posterior forearm between the deep and superficial extensor muscles.\n\n(Choice D) Extension of the wrist is largely performed by extensor carpi ulnaris and extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis, which are innervated by the radial nerve. The radial nerve courses between the medial and lateral heads of the triceps brachii in the upper arm before splitting into deep and superficial branches.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe median nerve is most commonly injured within the carpal tunnel, leading to pain and numbness in the first 3 digits and lateral half of the fourth, as well as weakness of thumb flexion and opposition. More proximal injury (in the forearm) additionally causes decreased sensation over the thenar eminence and weakness of flexion in the wrist and second and third digits. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "正中神经由臂丛的内侧和外侧束的C5-T1脊髓神经形成。它与肱动脉一起，在肱二头肌和肱肌之间穿行，然后进入前臂。在前臂前侧（掌侧），正中神经穿过旋前圆肌的头之间，然后走行于指浅屈肌和指深屈肌之间。它最终通过腕管，在屈肌支持带下方进入手部。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n正中神经最常因腕管内的压迫（即腕管综合征）而受损，导致前3个手指和第4个手指的侧半部分出现疼痛和麻木，以及拇指屈曲和对掌无力。然而，神经也可能因上臂穿透性损伤、肱骨髁上骨折或旋前圆肌头之间的嵌夹而发生更近端的损伤。除了上述症状外，近端损伤还会导致大鱼际感觉减退，以及腕关节和第二和第三指屈曲无力（即传教士手或祝福手）。\n\n（选项A和B）拇收肌（拇指内收）和掌骨间肌（第三和第四指内收）由尺神经的深支支配。尺神经在前臂内侧的指深屈肌和尺侧腕屈肌之间走行。\n\n（选项C和F）指伸肌（掌指关节的伸展）和旋后肌（前臂旋后）由桡神经的深支（骨间后神经）支配。该神经在后臂中，在深层和浅层伸肌之间走行。\n\n（选项D）腕关节的伸展主要由尺侧腕伸肌和桡侧腕长伸肌和短伸肌完成，它们由桡神经支配。桡神经在上臂的肱三头肌内侧头和外侧头之间走行，然后分成深支和浅支。\n\n教学目标：\n正中神经最常在腕管内受损，导致前3个手指和第4个手指的侧半部分出现疼痛和麻木，以及拇指屈曲和对掌无力。更近端的损伤（在前臂）还会导致大鱼际感觉减退，以及腕关节和第二和第三指屈曲无力。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of median nerve anatomy and function, specifically the motor deficits that result from proximal median nerve injury in the forearm. It requires understanding the muscles innervated by the median nerve and the movements they control.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the course of the median nerve in the forearm and its innervation of the thenar muscles responsible for thumb opposition. Recognize that proximal injury to the median nerve will affect all muscles distal to the injury, including those responsible for thumb opposition.",
