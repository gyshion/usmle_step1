    "en": "A 60-year-old man who was recently diagnosed with hypertension comes to the office for follow-up. He was treated with lisinopril but stopped a week ago due to a dry, nagging cough. Past medical history is notable for type 2 diabetes mellitus with moderately increased albuminuria but normal creatinine clearance. His other medications include metformin and rosuvastatin. The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol. His blood pressure is 150/92 mm Hg. BMI is 31 kg/m². Physical examination, including the heart and lungs, is unremarkable. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient's hypertension?",
    "zh": "一位60岁男性，最近被诊断为高血压，前来复诊。他曾接受赖诺普利治疗，但由于干咳、不停咳嗽，一周前已停药。既往病史值得关注，包括2型糖尿病伴中度蛋白尿，但肌酐清除率正常。他的其他药物包括二甲双胍和瑞舒伐他汀。患者不吸烟也不饮酒。他的血压为150/92 mmHg。BMI为31 kg/m²。体格检查，包括心脏和肺部，无特殊发现。以下哪项是该患者高血压的最佳治疗方法？"

    "en": "Diabetes causes impaired autoregulation of glomerular blood flow, leading to significant elevations of intraglomerular pressures and chronic glomerular injury. Patients with diabetes and hypertension are at especially high long-term risk for chronic kidney disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (eg, lisinopril) cause preferential dilation of the glomerular efferent arteriole, lowering intraglomerular pressures and reducing the risk of chronic glomerular injury.\n\nIn addition to converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, ACE normally degrades bradykinin and substance P. Inhibition of ACE leads to elevated bradykinin and substance P levels and a nonproductive cough. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have hemodynamic effects similar to those of ACE inhibitors but do not affect bradykinin levels and do not cause a cough. Replacing this patient's ACE inhibitor with an ARB (eg, losartan, valsartan) will eliminate the cough while still providing the same long-term renovascular benefits.\n\n(Choices A, B, and C) Careful blood pressure control can help reduce the long-term risk of kidney injury, regardless of the agent used. However, none of these drugs are as effective as ACE inhibitors or ARBs for preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease.\n\n(Choice D) Replacement of one ACE inhibitor with another carries a high likelihood of inducing the same nonproductive cough.\n\nEducational objective:\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce the risk of chronic kidney disease in patients with hypertension and diabetes. ACE inhibitors raise levels of bradykinin and can cause a nonproductive cough, an effect not seen with ARBs.",
    "zh": "糖尿病导致肾小球血流的自主调节受损，导致肾小球内压力显著升高，并造成慢性肾小球损伤。患有糖尿病和高血压的患者发生慢性肾脏病的长期风险特别高。血管紧张素转换酶 (ACE) 抑制剂（例如，赖诺普利）会导致肾小球出球小动脉优先扩张，降低肾小球内压力，并降低慢性肾小球损伤的风险。\n\n除了将血管紧张素 I 转化为血管紧张素 II 外，ACE 通常还会降解缓激肽和 P 物质。抑制 ACE 会导致缓激肽和 P 物质水平升高，并引起非生产性咳嗽。血管紧张素受体阻滞剂 (ARB) 的血流动力学效应与 ACE 抑制剂相似，但不会影响缓激肽水平，也不会引起咳嗽。用 ARB（例如，氯沙坦、缬沙坦）替代该患者的 ACE 抑制剂，将消除咳嗽，同时仍提供相同的长期肾血管益处。\n\n（选项 A、B 和 C）仔细控制血压有助于降低肾脏损伤的长期风险，无论使用何种药物。然而，这些药物都不能像 ACE 抑制剂或 ARB 那样有效地预防慢性肾脏病的进展。\n\n（选项 D）用另一种 ACE 抑制剂替代一种 ACE 抑制剂极有可能诱发相同的非生产性咳嗽。\n\n教育目标：\n血管紧张素转换酶 (ACE) 抑制剂和血管紧张素受体阻滞剂 (ARB) 可降低高血压和糖尿病患者发生慢性肾脏病的风险。ACE 抑制剂会升高缓激肽水平，并可能引起非生产性咳嗽，而 ARB 则不会出现这种作用。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hypertension management in a patient with diabetes and albuminuria, specifically the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. It also assesses understanding of the mechanism of ACE inhibitor-induced cough and the benefits of ARBs in this setting.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the contraindication to ACE inhibitors (cough) and the need for a similar agent that does not cause this side effect.
