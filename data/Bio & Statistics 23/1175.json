  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This question is meant to challenge your knowledge of how absolute risk reductions (ARR) are calculated. The ARR equals the event rate in the control group (ERcontrol) minus the event rate in the treatment group (ERtreatment). In this example, the event rate represents the incidence of recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE); ERtreatment is the incidence of recurrent PE in the drug A group, and ERcontrol is the incidence in the standard therapy group. ERtreatment can be determined from the ARR (given as 4%) and ERcontrol (given as 6%):\n\nARR = ERcontrol – ERtreatment\n\n4% = 6% – ERtreatment\n\nERtreatment = 2% = 0.02\n\nThis value (ERtreatment) also represents the number of events in the treatment arm divided by the number of subjects in the treatment arm. Therefore, knowing the total number of events in the treatment arm (24 instances of recurrent PE in the drug A group), the number of subjects in the treatment arm can be easily calculated:\n\nERtreatment = Number of events in the treatment arm / Number of subjects in the treatment arm\n\n0.  02 = 24 / Number of subjects in the treatment arm\n\nNumber of subjects in the treatment arm = 24 / 0.02 = 1200\n\nEducational objective:\n\nAbsolute risk reduction = event rate in the control group – event rate in the treatment group.",
    "zh": "这道题旨在考察你对绝对风险降低(ARR)计算方法的掌握程度。ARR等于对照组的事件发生率(ERcontrol)减去治疗组的事件发生率(ERtreatment)。在本例中，事件发生率代表复发性肺栓塞(PE)的发生率；ERtreatment是药物A组复发性PE的发生率，而ERcontrol是标准治疗组的发生率。ERtreatment可以从ARR（给定为4%）和ERcontrol（给定为6%）确定：\n\nARR = ERcontrol – ERtreatment\n\n4% = 6% – ERtreatment\n\nERtreatment = 2% = 0.02\n\n这个值(ERtreatment)也表示治疗组的事件数量除以治疗组的受试者数量。因此，知道了治疗组中的事件总数（药物A组中24例复发性PE），就可以很容易地计算出治疗组中的受试者数量：\n\nERtreatment = 治疗组的事件数 / 治疗组的受试者数\n\n0.  02 = 24 / 治疗组的受试者数\n\n治疗组的受试者数 = 24 / 0.02 = 1200\n\n教育目标：\n\n绝对风险降低 = 对照组的事件发生率 – 治疗组的事件发生率。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of calculating absolute risk reduction (ARR) and using it to determine the number of subjects in a treatment group. It requires understanding the relationship between ARR, event rates in control and treatment groups, and the number of events within a treatment arm.\n\nTo solve this, first calculate the event rate in the treatment group using the ARR formula. Then, use the treatment event rate and the number of events in the treatment arm to solve for the total number of subjects in the treatment arm.",
