    "en": "A 36-year-old man comes to the emergency department after briefly losing consciousness while watching television half an hour ago. The patient had no preceding chest pain or shortness of breath, but he has been having recurrent palpitations over the past several days. One month ago, he noticed a non-itchy rash on his thigh that he treated with an over-the-counter steroid cream. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. There is no family history of heart disease or sudden cardiac death. The patient recently began working as a forest ranger in Pennsylvania. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg and pulse is 46/min. The lungs are clear on auscultation and heart sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. ECG reveals complete atrioventricular block. Echocardiography shows normal ventricular function with no major valvular disease. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's current condition?",
    "zh": "一名36岁男性在半小时前看电视时短暂失去意识后，来到急诊科就诊。患者既往没有胸痛或呼吸急促的病史，但在过去几天里反复出现心悸。一个月前，他注意到大腿上出现非瘙痒性皮疹，他用非处方药类固醇药膏进行了治疗。其他病史无特殊。无心脏病或心脏性猝死的家族史。患者最近开始在宾夕法尼亚州担任森林管理员。他不吸烟、不饮酒，也不使用违禁药物。血压130/80 mmHg，脉搏46次/分。肺部听诊清晰，心音正常。其余检查未见异常。心电图显示完全性房室传导阻滞。超声心动图显示室功能正常，无主要瓣膜疾病。以下哪项最可能是该患者目前状况的潜在原因？"

    "en": "This patient most likely has early disseminated Lyme disease. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterial spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the Ixodes tick that is endemic to the northeastern and parts of the midwestern United States. Most cases initially present with a non-itchy, bull's-eye-shaped rash, known as erythema migrans, at the site of infection. Left untreated for several weeks or more, a small percentage of those infected will develop cardiac involvement (Lyme carditis).\n\nLyme carditis most commonly manifests with varying degrees of atrioventricular (AV) conduction block. Many patients remain asymptomatic; however, patients who develop complete AV block are likely to have symptoms of dyspnea, lightheadedness, or syncope. Treatment for symptomatic AV block due to Lyme carditis typically requires hospitalization with temporary pacing and the administration of intravenous antibiotics (ceftriaxone is the drug of choice).\n\n(Choice B) Granulomatous myocardial inflammation occurs in cardiac sarcoidosis, and AV conduction block is the most common disease manifestation. However, this patient's recent rash and residence in an endemic area make Lyme carditis more likely.\n\n(Choice C) A missense mutation affecting the cardiac sarcomere protein beta-myosin heavy chain is a common cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Myocardial disarray creates a propensity for ventricular arrhythmias, but AV conduction block is not typical.\n\n(Choice D) Congenital long QT syndrome results from a mutation affecting cardiomyocyte potassium channels. It can cause syncope or sudden cardiac death, typically via the triggering of torsades de pointes (polymorphic ventricular tachycardia). AV conduction block would be an unusual manifestation.\n\n(Choice E) Viral infection of the heart typically manifests as myocarditis. The most common symptomatic presentation is decompensated heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy. AV conduction block is not typical.\n\nEducational objective:\nEarly disseminated Lyme disease can have cardiac involvement (Lyme carditis) that most commonly manifests with varying degrees of atrioventricular (AV) conduction block. Patients may be asymptomatic, but those with complete AV conduction block are likely to have dyspnea, lightheadedness, or syncope. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有早期播散性莱姆病。莱姆病由伯氏疏螺旋体引起，伯氏疏螺旋体是一种细菌性螺旋体，通过硬蜱传播，硬蜱是美国东北部和中西部部分地区的特有物种。大多数病例最初表现为在感染部位出现非瘙痒性、靶形皮疹，称为游走性红斑。如果不治疗数周或更长时间，一小部分感染者会发生心脏受累（莱姆心脏炎）。\n\n莱姆心脏炎最常见的表现是不同程度的房室（AV）传导阻滞。许多患者仍然没有症状；然而，出现完全性房室传导阻滞的患者很可能有呼吸困难、头晕或晕厥的症状。由于莱姆心脏炎引起的有症状的房室传导阻滞的治疗通常需要住院，进行临时起搏，并静脉注射抗生素（头孢曲松是首选药物）。\n\n（选项B）肉芽肿性心肌炎症发生在心脏结节病中，房室传导阻滞是最常见的疾病表现。然而，该患者最近的皮疹和居住在流行地区使得莱姆心脏炎更有可能。\n\n（选项C）影响心脏肌节蛋白β-肌球蛋白重链的错义突变是肥厚型心肌病的一个常见原因。心肌紊乱会增加室性心律失常的倾向，但房室传导阻滞并不典型。\n\n（选项D）先天性长QT综合征是由影响心肌细胞钾通道的突变引起的。它可引起晕厥或心脏性猝死，通常通过触发尖端扭转型室速（多形性室性心动过速）发生。房室传导阻滞是不寻常的表现。\n\n（选项E）心脏病毒感染通常表现为心肌炎。最常见的症状表现是由于扩张型心肌病导致的心力衰竭失代偿。房室传导阻滞不典型。\n\n教育目标：\n早期播散性莱姆病可累及心脏（莱姆心脏炎），最常见的表现是不同程度的房室（AV）传导阻滞。患者可能没有症状，但那些患有完全性房室传导阻滞的患者很可能有呼吸困难、头晕或晕厥。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Lyme carditis, a cardiac manifestation of Lyme disease, specifically focusing on its presentation with atrioventricular (AV) block. It requires recognizing the clinical features of Lyme disease, including the characteristic rash and geographic location, and associating them with cardiac conduction abnormalities.\n\nThe best approach is to consider the patient's symptoms (syncope, palpitations, AV block), recent rash, and geographic location (Pennsylvania, endemic for Lyme disease). This should lead to considering Lyme carditis as a likely cause, differentiating it from other potential causes of AV block.",
