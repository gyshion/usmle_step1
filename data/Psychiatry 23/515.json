    "en": "A 24-year-old man is hospitalized after a violent episode in which he destroyed his television with a baseball bat. Over the past year, the patient was convinced that people on television were monitoring his thoughts and movements and that certain newscasters were laughing at him. At night, he was unable to sleep and reported hearing the voices of demons threatening to kill him. The patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia and initially treated with chlorpromazine. He now is reluctant to take the medication, saying, \"I don't like how it makes me feel.\" His medication is subsequently changed to fluphenazine. Compared to the patient's initial treatment, fluphenazine is more likely to cause which of the following?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's medication was changed from chlorpromazine (a low-potency, first-generation antipsychotic) to fluphenazine (a high-potency, first-generation antipsychotic). First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) are classified according to potency. Low-potency FGAs primarily cause anticholinergic, histaminergic, and alpha-1 adrenergic blockade side effects, leading to sedation, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and orthostatic hypotension. High-potency FGAs are associated primarily with extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) due to potent D2 dopamine receptor antagonism in the nigrostriatal pathway. EPS include acute dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism, and tardive dyskinesia. Muscular rigidity is a manifestation of parkinsonism, which is an extrapyramidal symptom. Therefore, fluphenazine, a high-potency FGA, is more likely to cause muscular rigidity than chlorpromazine, a low-potency FGA.\n\n(Choice A, C, and G) Constipation, dry mouth, and urinary retention are anticholinergic side effects due to cholinergic receptor blockade. They are more common with low-potency antipsychotics like chlorpromazine. Other anticholinergic side effects include blurred vision and impaired cognitive function.\n\n(Choice B) Dizziness and orthostatic hypotension are due to alpha-1 adrenergic blockade and are more common with low-potency FGAs. Orthostatic hypotension is particularly problematic in the elderly due to the risk of falls.\n\n(Choice D) Hyperglycemia is a metabolic side effect seen more commonly with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), although it can occur with FGAs.\n\n(Choice F) Sedation is due to histaminergic blockade and is more common with low-potency FGAs like chlorpromazine.\n\nEducational objective: First-generation antipsychotics can be classified according to high or low potency and have characteristic side effect profiles. Low-potency antipsychotics are more likely to cause sedation, anticholinergic side effects, and orthostatic hypotension. High-potency antipsychotics are more likely to cause extrapyramidal symptoms (eg, dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism).",
    "zh": "患者的药物从氯丙嗪（一种低效、第一代抗精神病药）改为氟哌啶（一种高效、第一代抗精神病药）。第一代抗精神病药 (FGAs) 根据效力进行分类。低效FGAs主要引起抗胆碱能、组胺能和α-1肾上腺素能阻滞副作用，导致镇静、口干、便秘、视力模糊和体位性低血压。高效FGAs主要与锥体外系症状（EPS）相关，这归因于在黑质纹状体通路中D2多巴胺受体的强烈拮抗作用。EPS包括急性肌张力障碍、静坐不能、帕金森病和迟发性运动障碍。肌肉僵硬是帕金森病的表现，这是一种锥体外系症状。因此，与低效FGA氯丙嗪相比，高效FGA氟哌啶更容易引起肌肉僵硬。\n\n（选项A、C和G）便秘、口干和尿潴留是由于胆碱能受体阻滞引起的抗胆碱能副作用。它们在氯丙嗪等低效抗精神病药中更为常见。其他抗胆碱能副作用包括视力模糊和认知功能障碍。\n\n（选项B）头晕和体位性低血压是由于α-1肾上腺素能阻滞所致，在低效FGA中更为常见。由于跌倒风险，体位性低血压在老年人中尤其成问题。\n\n（选项D）高血糖是第二代抗精神病药 (SGAs) 中更常见的代谢副作用，尽管它也可能发生在FGAs中。\n\n（选项F）镇静是由于组胺能阻滞所致，在氯丙嗪等低效FGAs中更为常见。\n\n教育目标：第一代抗精神病药可以根据高效或低效进行分类，并具有特征性的副作用。低效抗精神病药更容易引起镇静、抗胆碱能副作用和体位性低血压。高效抗精神病药更容易引起锥体外系症状（例如，肌张力障碍、静坐不能、帕金森病）。"
