    "en": "A 45-year-old man comes to the office for progressive weakness and fatigue over the last year. The patient was adopted and does not know his family history. After a comprehensive physical examination and laboratory evaluation, the patient undergoes genetic testing. A loss of expression mutation is identified in a gene coding for a protein found on the basolateral surface of hepatocytes and enterocytes. The protein is known to interact with the transferrin receptor. Which of the following conditions is this patient at greatest risk of developing?",

    "en": "Primary hemochromatosis (ie, hereditary hemochromatosis) is most commonly caused by mutations affecting the HFE protein. This protein normally interacts with the transferrin receptor to form a complex that functions as a sensor of iron stores. Mutations that inactivate the HFE protein cause enterocytes and hepatocytes to detect falsely low iron levels. This increases iron accumulation in the body through the following 2 mechanisms:\n\n*   Enterocytes respond by increasing apical expression of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), increasing iron absorption from the intestinal lumen\n*   Hepatocytes respond by decreasing hepcidin synthesis; low hepcidin levels result in increased ferroportin expression on the basolateral surface of enterocytes. This allows increased iron secretion into the circulation, leading to iron overload\n\nWhen body iron levels exceed 20 g, patients typically develop the classic triad of micronodular cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and skin pigmentation (ie, \"bronze diabetes\"). These patients are at an increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, congestive heart failure, and testicular atrophy/hypogonadism.\n\n(Choice A) Basal ganglia atrophy is a potential complication commonly seen in Wilson disease (ie, hepatolenticular degeneration).\n\n(Choice B) Exocrine pancreatic function is usually preserved in patients with hemochromatosis. Therefore, fat malabsorption and osteoporosis (due to decreased vitamin D) would not typically be seen.\n\n(Choice C) Iron deficiency anemia is a potential complication of blood loss, lack of dietary iron, or an inability to absorb iron (eg, celiac disease). Hemochromatosis results in iron overload, not iron deficiency.\n\n(Choice E) Pulmonary emphysema is a potential complication of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.\n\nEducational objective:\nHFE protein mutations are the most common cause of primary hemochromatosis. Inactivation of the HFE protein results in decreased hepcidin synthesis by hepatocytes and increased DMT1 expression by enterocytes, leading to iron overload. Patients with hemochromatosis are at an increased risk for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "原发性血色病（即遗传性血色病）最常见的原因是影响HFE蛋白的突变。该蛋白通常与转铁蛋白受体相互作用，形成一个作为铁储存传感器的复合物。使HFE蛋白失活的突变导致肠细胞和肝细胞检测到虚假的低铁水平。这通过以下2种机制增加了体内铁的积累：\n\n*   肠细胞通过增加二价金属转运蛋白1（DMT1）的顶端表达来响应，从而增加铁从肠腔的吸收\n*   肝细胞通过减少铁调素合成来响应；低铁调素水平导致肠细胞基底外侧表面铁转运蛋白表达增加。这使得铁能够更多地分泌到循环中，导致铁超载\n\n当体内铁水平超过20克时，患者通常会出现经典的三联征，即小结节性肝硬化、糖尿病和皮肤色素沉着（即“青铜糖尿病”）。这些患者发生肝细胞癌、充血性心力衰竭和睾丸萎缩/性腺功能减退的风险增加。\n\n（选项A） 基底神经节萎缩是威尔逊病（即肝豆状核变性）中常见的潜在并发症。\n\n（选项B） 外分泌胰腺功能通常在血色病患者中得到保留。因此，脂肪吸收不良和骨质疏松症（由于维生素D减少）通常不会出现。\n\n（选项C） 缺铁性贫血是失血、缺乏膳食铁或无法吸收铁（例如，乳糜泻）的潜在并发症。血色病导致铁超载，而不是缺铁。\n\n（选项E） 肺气肿是α-1抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症的潜在并发症。\n\n教育目标：\nHFE蛋白突变是原发性血色病最常见的原因。HFE蛋白失活导致肝细胞铁调素合成减少和肠细胞DMT1表达增加，从而导致铁超载。血色病患者发生肝硬化和肝细胞癌的风险增加。{{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hemochromatosis, specifically the pathophysiology of HFE protein mutations and their association with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It also tests the ability to differentiate hemochromatosis from other conditions with similar symptoms.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of hemochromatosis, such as the genetic mutation affecting iron regulation and the resulting iron overload. Consider the long-term complications of iron overload, particularly liver damage and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Rule out other conditions based on their distinct pathophysiology.",
