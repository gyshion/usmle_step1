    "en": "This patient's hyperactivity, impulsivity, and disorganization that are resulting in behavioral problems both at school and at home are characteristic of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Psychostimulants (methylphenidate and amphetamines) are first-line treatment for ADHD in school-age children and are generally safe and well tolerated. They have a rapid onset of action, resulting in improvement in core ADHD symptoms for the expected duration of action (Choices C and F).\n\nThe most common adverse effects include decreased appetite, weight loss, and insomnia. Most affected children will experience a mild decrease in appetite that can typically be managed by minimizing the medication after meals and encouraging the child to eat nutrient-dense foods. Other psychostimulant adverse effects that are less common include tics and increases in heart rate and blood pressure. During treatment, patients are typically seen monthly to monitor weight, height, heart rate, and blood pressure.\n\n(Choices A, E, and H) Increased appetite, weight gain, and sedation are adverse effects commonly associated with second-generation antipsychotics; acute dystonia is an extrapyramidal side effect most commonly seen with high-potency first-generation antipsychotics. These drugs do not have a role in the treatment of ADHD.\n\n(Choice D) The mood stabilizer lithium has been associated with polyuria and polydipsia due to its potential to cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Lithium is used to treat bipolar disorder and is not effective in ADHD.\n\n(Choice G) The risk of life-threatening rash, such as seen in Stevens-Johnson syndrome, has been associated with lamotrigine, an anticonvulsant used to treat seizure and bipolar disorders.\n\nEducational objective:\nDecreased appetite and insomnia are the most common adverse effects of psychostimulant medications used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. They are usually mild and can be managed without stopping the medication.",
    "zh": "该患者在学校和家中的多动、冲动和无组织行为问题是注意力缺陷多动障碍 (ADHD) 的特征。兴奋剂（哌甲酯和苯丙胺）是学龄儿童 ADHD 的一线治疗方法，通常安全且耐受性良好。它们起效迅速，可在预期作用持续时间内改善 ADHD 的核心症状（选项 C 和 F）。\n\n最常见的不良反应包括食欲下降、体重减轻和失眠。大多数受影响的儿童会经历轻度的食欲下降，这通常可以通过减少饭后用药并鼓励孩子吃营养丰富的食物来控制。其他不太常见的兴奋剂不良反应包括抽动症以及心率和血压升高。在治疗期间，患者通常每月就诊一次，以监测体重、身高、心率和血压。\n\n（选项 A、E 和 H）食欲增加、体重增加和镇静是与二代抗精神病药相关的常见不良反应；急性肌张力障碍是最常见于高效一代抗精神病药的锥体外系副作用。这些药物在 ADHD 的治疗中没有作用。\n\n（选项 D）情绪稳定剂锂与多尿和烦渴有关，因为它可能导致肾性尿崩症。锂用于治疗双相情感障碍，对 ADHD 无效。\n\n（选项 G）危及生命的皮疹（如史蒂文斯-约翰逊综合征）的风险与拉莫三嗪有关，拉莫三嗪是一种用于治疗癫痫发作和双相情感障碍的抗惊厥药。\n\n教育目标：\n食欲下降和失眠是用于治疗注意力缺陷多动障碍的兴奋剂药物最常见的不良反应。它们通常是轻微的，无需停药即可控制。"
