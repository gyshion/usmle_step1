    "en": "A 38-year-old man is brought to the office for evaluation of behavioral changes. His wife says the patient has had frequent outbursts of anger, depressive mood, and insomnia. The patient recently lost his job as a machine operator because of lack of focus and poor memory. Over the past several years, he also has had involuntary, jerky, nonpurposeful movements of the extremities and face that have progressively worsened. These abnormal movements are present while he is awake but not during sleep. His 55-year-old mother has similar abnormal body movements and is at a nursing home with dementia. Which of the following labeled regions of a normal brain {{exhibit_1}} is likely to be most affected by this patient's disease process?",

    "en": "The findings are highly suggestive of HUNTINGTON DISEASE (HD). This autosomal dominant disease results from an excessive number of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the huntingtin gene, causing a gain-of-function mutation that results in the accumulation of toxic mutant huntingtin protein. The abnormal protein buildup causes loss of inhibitory (GABA) neurons in the caudate nucleus, leading to the characteristic movement abnormalities observed in HD. Although the diagnosis of HD is best confirmed by genetic analysis, imaging studies will typically show atrophy of the caudate nuclei, causing ex-vacuo enlargement of the lateral ventricles. The caudate nucleus is a curved or C-shaped structure in its complete form. The head of the caudate can be identified in the inferolateral walls of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. The caudate nucleus and putamen together make up the striatum, which is critical for movement control and coordination along with behavioral regulation.\n\n(Choice B) This structure is the internal capsule. The anterior limb of the internal capsule separates the caudate nucleus from the globus pallidus and putamen and carries a portion of the thalamocortical fibers. The posterior limb of the internal capsule separates the globus pallidus and putamen from the thalamus and carries corticospinal motor and somatic sensory fibers as well as visual and auditory fibers.\n\n(Choice C) This structure is the insular cortex (insula). The insula plays a role in the limbic system (emotion) as well as in the coordination of some autonomic functions.\n\n(Choice D) Although the degeneration in HD affects both parts of the striatum (caudate and putamen), atrophy is most prominent in the caudate rather than the putamen both clinically (eg, MRI) and pathologically (eg, autopsy).\n\n(Choice E) Atrophy of the globus pallidus is observed late in the progression of HD when generalized cortical atrophy occurs.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe head of the caudate lies in the inferolateral wall of the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle. It is separated from the globus pallidus and putamen by the internal capsule. Atrophy of the caudate nuclei with enlargement of the lateral ventricles is characteristic of Huntington disease and can be observed on neuroimaging.",
    "zh": "这些发现高度提示亨廷顿病（HD）。这种常染色体显性遗传病是由于huntingtin基因中CAG三核苷酸重复次数过多引起的，导致功能获得性突变，从而导致有毒的突变型huntingtin蛋白的积累。这种异常的蛋白质积聚会导致尾状核中抑制性（GABA）神经元的丧失，从而导致HD中观察到的特征性运动异常。尽管HD的诊断最好通过基因分析来确定，但影像学研究通常会显示尾状核萎缩，导致侧脑室的真空扩大。尾状核是一种弯曲或C形结构。尾状核的头部可以在侧脑室额角的下外侧壁中识别出来。尾状核和壳核共同构成纹状体，纹状体对于运动控制和协调以及行为调节至关重要。\n\n(选项 B) 该结构是内囊。内囊的前肢将尾状核与苍白球和壳核分开，并携带部分丘脑皮质纤维。内囊的后肢将苍白球和壳核与丘脑分开，并携带皮质脊髓运动和躯体感觉纤维以及视觉和听觉纤维。\n\n(选项 C) 该结构是岛叶皮质（岛叶）。岛叶在边缘系统（情感）中以及在某些自主功能的协调中起作用。\n\n(选项 D) 尽管HD的变性影响纹状体的两个部分（尾状核和壳核），但萎缩在临床上（例如，MRI）和病理学上（例如，尸检）在尾状核中比在壳核中更明显。\n\n(选项 E) 苍白球的萎缩在HD进展后期当发生广泛的皮质萎缩时观察到。\n\n教育目标：\n尾状核的头部位于侧脑室额角的下外侧壁。它与苍白球和壳核通过内囊分隔。尾状核萎缩伴侧脑室扩大是亨廷顿病的特征，可以在神经影像学检查中观察到。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Huntington disease, specifically the brain regions affected and the resulting clinical presentation. The key to solving this question is recognizing the classic symptoms of Huntington disease (chorea, behavioral changes, family history) and associating them with the characteristic atrophy of the caudate nucleus.\n\nTo solve this question, first identify the key features of the clinical vignette that point towards Huntington disease. Then, recall the neuroanatomical changes associated with the disease, specifically the atrophy of the caudate nucleus. Finally, match the anatomical location of the caudate nucleus on the brain image {{exhibit_2}} with the correct answer choice.",
