    "en": "A 37-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 0, at 30 weeks gestation comes to the emergency department with her husband for heavy vaginal bleeding. An hour ago, she started to have bright red vaginal bleeding that has increased to large clots over the past few minutes. The patient has mild abdominal cramping and minimal fetal movement. She has received no prenatal care during this pregnancy. Blood pressure is 90/64 mm Hg and pulse is 102/min. When the patient is told that a pelvic examination needs to be performed, she becomes uncomfortable and appears nervous. The patient requests a female health care provider for the examination. However, only male health care providers are available at this emergency department for the next several hours. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The pelvic examination is intimate, and many women are uncomfortable or embarrassed by it and prefer a female examiner. Under most circumstances, this request should be accommodated whenever possible to respect patient autonomy:\n\n*   Most patients presenting for a routine office visit (eg, routine prenatal visit) have nonemergent conditions; therefore, patients may be able to defer the examination or wait for the next available female provider.\n*   However, in emergency situations, such as in this patient with heavy vaginal bleeding and maternal hypotension concerning for placenta previa or placental abruption, immediate evaluation with pelvic examination is required for diagnosis and management. Although a female health care provider is not available, every effort should be made to provide the same standard of care. Therefore, deferring the examination (eg, monitoring the patient only) or transferring the patient to another facility is inappropriate because it risks maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality (Choices B and E).\n\nIn both emergent and nonemergent situations, other alternatives should be explored to balance the need for timely and appropriate medical care with respect to patient autonomy and consent (ie, the right to accept or refuse medical care). One solution is asking whether the patient would agree to the examination with a female chaperone present. Regardless of patient or provider gender, having a chaperone present for sensitive portions of the physical examination (eg, breast, genitourinary, rectal) is becoming more commonplace.\n\n(Choice C) This patient is an adult with capacity (ie, understands the risks, benefits, and alternatives to make an informed medical decision). Capable patients have the right to make their own treatment decisions. Therefore, obtaining consent from the patient's husband is inappropriate.\n\n(Choice D) Performing a pelvic examination on a nonconsenting adult is coercion and/or assault, regardless of the emergent circumstances. This approach would also likely erode patient-provider trust and could worsen medical outcomes.",
    "zh": "盆腔检查是私密的，许多女性对此感到不舒服或尴尬，更喜欢女性检查者。在大多数情况下，应尽可能满足这一要求以尊重患者自主权：\n\n*   大多数前来常规门诊就诊的患者（例如，例行产前检查）病情不紧急；因此，患者可以推迟检查或等待下一位可用的女性医护人员。\n*   然而，在紧急情况下，例如本例患者阴道大量出血和孕妇低血压，提示可能存在前置胎盘或胎盘早剥，需要立即进行盆腔检查以进行诊断和治疗。虽然没有可用的女性医护人员，但应尽一切努力提供相同的护理标准。因此，推迟检查（例如，仅监测患者）或将患者转到另一家机构是不合适的，因为这会增加孕产妇和胎儿的发病率和死亡率（选项B和E）。\n\n在紧急和非紧急情况下，应探索其他替代方案，以平衡及时和适当的医疗护理需求与患者自主权和知情同意（即，接受或拒绝医疗护理的权利）。一种解决方案是询问患者是否同意在有女性陪同的情况下进行检查。无论患者或医护人员的性别如何，在身体检查的敏感部位（例如，乳房、泌尿生殖系统、直肠）有陪同人员在场已变得越来越普遍。\n\n（选项C）该患者是具有行为能力（即，了解风险、益处和替代方案，以做出知情的医疗决定）的成年人。有能力的患者有权做出自己的治疗决定。因此，征得患者丈夫的同意是不合适的。\n\n（选项D）在未经同意的成年人身上进行盆腔检查是胁迫和/或侵犯，无论紧急情况如何。这种方法也可能侵蚀患者与医护人员之间的信任，并可能恶化医疗结果。"

    "en": "This question tests the ethical and practical considerations in managing a pregnant patient presenting with vaginal bleeding who requests a female healthcare provider for a pelvic examination when only male providers are available. It emphasizes balancing patient autonomy, the need for timely medical evaluation in emergent situations, and the importance of informed consent.\n\nThe best approach is to explore alternative solutions that respect the patient's preferences while ensuring necessary medical care. This includes offering a female chaperone during the examination and explaining the importance of immediate evaluation due to the potential risks of maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality.",
