The patient's condition deteriorates throughout the course of hospitalization, and he dies 5 days after admission. Autopsy reveals chalky white lesions in the mesentery. Histologic evaluation of the lesions reveals adipose cell destruction and calcium deposition. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's autopsy findings?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with abdominal pain and chalky white mesenteric lesions likely had ACUTE PANCREATITIS. To prevent autodigestion, most pancreatic digestive enzymes (except for amylase and lipase) are secreted in an inactive form and are activated on arrival in the duodenum. In acute pancreatitis, intrapancreatic activation of enzymes result in acinar cell damage and pancreatic inflammation.\n\nThe release of LIPASE and other digestive enzymes from the inflamed pancreas damages nearby adipose cells. Liberated fatty acids bind calcium ions, precipitating as INSOLUBLE CALCIUM SALTS (i.e. saponification) that have a chalky white appearance grossly. Microscopically, NECROTIC ADIPOCYTES (i.e. anucleate adipocytes with necrotic debris) and blue calcium deposits are seen (compared to a normal pancreas).\n\nIn mild cases, small areas of fat necrosis may be found within and around the pancreas, along with an edematous and inflamed pancreatic parenchyma. If the inflammatory process continues, acute necrotic pancreatitis develops. This is characterized by parenchymal necrosis and more extensive fat necrosis, which can spread to involve the mesentery, omentum, and other parts of the abdominal cavity (due to widespread lipase activity). Elastase-mediated destruction of blood vessel walls can cause hemorrhage into the necrotic areas (i.e. hemorrhagic pancreatitis), and black hemorrhage may be seen grossly.\n\n(Choice B) Bacterial peritonitis is characterized by a dull-appearing peritoneal surface with areas of viscous white-yellow suppurative exudate. Microscopic examination of the ascitic fluid shows numerous neutrophils.\n\n(Choice C) In celiac disease, gross examination of an involved bowel segment would show normal-appearing serosa and mesentery.\n\n(Choice D) Crohn disease often shows mesenteric fat grossly extending around the serosa of an affected intestinal segment (ie, \"creeping fat\"). The serosa looks dull-gray, edematous, and granular. The mesentery of an involved segment may become fibrotic due to chronic inflammation.\n\n(Choice E) With intestinal perforation, a full-thickness defect in the intestinal wall is seen on gross examination.\n\n(Choice F) With mesenteric ischemia, gross examination of an affected bowel segment would show dusky red serosa, edema, and hemorrhagic mucosa. Microscopically, areas of coagulative necrosis may be present. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "这位出现腹痛和粉笔状白色肠系膜病变的患者很可能患有急性胰腺炎。为了防止自身消化，大多数胰腺消化酶（淀粉酶和脂肪酶除外）以非活性形式分泌，并在到达十二指肠后被激活。在急性胰腺炎中，胰腺内酶的激活会导致腺泡细胞损伤和胰腺炎症。\n\n来自发炎胰腺的脂肪酶和其他消化酶的释放会损害附近的脂肪细胞。游离脂肪酸与钙离子结合，沉淀为不溶性钙盐（即皂化），肉眼观察呈粉笔状白色。在显微镜下，可以看到坏死脂肪细胞（即无核脂肪细胞，伴有坏死碎片）和蓝色钙沉积（与正常胰腺相比）。\n\n在轻度病例中，可以在胰腺内和周围发现小的脂肪坏死区域，以及水肿和发炎的胰腺实质。如果炎症过程持续存在，则会发展为急性坏死性胰腺炎。其特征是实质坏死和更广泛的脂肪坏死，可扩散到肠系膜、大网膜和其他腹腔部位（由于广泛的脂肪酶活性）。弹性蛋白酶介导的血管壁破坏可导致出血到坏死区域（即出血性胰腺炎），肉眼可见黑色出血。\n\n（选项 B）细菌性腹膜炎的特征是腹膜表面呈暗淡外观，伴有粘稠的白色-黄色化脓性渗出物。腹水的显微镜检查显示大量中性粒细胞。\n\n（选项 C）在乳糜泻中，受累肠段的肉眼检查将显示外观正常的浆膜和肠系膜。\n\n（选项 D）克罗恩病通常显示肠系膜脂肪肉眼延伸到受累肠段的浆膜周围（即“蠕动脂肪”）。浆膜呈暗灰色、水肿和颗粒状。受累节段的肠系膜可能会因慢性炎症而纤维化。\n\n（选项 E）发生肠穿孔时，肉眼检查可见肠壁全层缺损。\n\n（选项 F）发生肠系膜缺血时，受累肠段的肉眼检查将显示暗红色浆膜、水肿和出血性粘膜。在显微镜下，可能存在凝固性坏死区域。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis and its characteristic autopsy findings, specifically the saponification process leading to chalky white lesions in the mesentery due to fat necrosis.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key autopsy findings (chalky white lesions, adipose cell destruction, calcium deposition) and associate them with the enzymatic damage caused by lipase in acute pancreatitis. Rule out other conditions based on their distinct gross and microscopic features.",
