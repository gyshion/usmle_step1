    "en": "A 54-year-old man comes to the office due to shortness of breath that has slowly worsened over the last 6 months. He also has a persistent, nonproductive cough. The patient does not use alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. Temperature is 36.8 C (98 F), blood pressure is 132/78 mm Hg, pulse is 74/min, and respirations are 16/min. Physical examination reveals fine crackles bilaterally on pulmonary auscultation and drumstick-shaped fingers. Chest x-ray reveals diffuse reticular opacities. Pulmonary function testing shows decreased FVC, increased FEV1/FVC ratio, and expiratory flow rates that are higher than normal when corrected for lung volume. This patient's supernormal expiratory flow rates are best explained by an increase in which of the following parameters?",

    "en": "This patient's clinical presentation (progressive dyspnea, fine crackles, clubbing, diffuse reticular opacities) is consistent with interstitial lung disease (ILD). Most ILDs cause progressive pulmonary fibrosis with thickening and stiffening of the pulmonary interstitium. This causes increased lung elastic recoil, as well as airway widening due to increased outward pulling (radial traction) {{exhibit_1}} by the surrounding fibrotic tissue. The resulting decrease in airflow resistance leads to supernormal expiratory flow rates (higher than normal when corrected for lung volume).\n\nAdditional pulmonary function test findings in restrictive lung diseases include reduced total lung capacity, vital capacity, inspiratory capacity, functional residual capacity, and residual volume. The FVC and FEV1 are decreased as well. However, the FEV1/FVC ratio is typically normal or increased as FEV1 decreases less than FVC (due to airway widening relative to the low lung volumes). In addition, fibrosis causes a reduction in the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide.\n\n(Choice A) Lung compliance is defined as the change in lung volume for a given change in pressure. Increased compliance means that the lung tissue stretches and expands more in response to increased pressure. Restrictive lung diseases cause decreased lung compliance and lower lung volumes due to interstitial fibrosis.\n\n(Choice B) The outward recoil of the chest wall limits the volume of air that can be expired during maximal exhalation. An increase in outward chest wall recoil would decrease expiratory flow rates, as the respiratory muscles must work harder during expiration to oppose the increased outward force.\n\n(Choice C) Physiological dead space refers to the volume of inspired air that does not participate in gas exchange. Changes in the amount of physiological dead space can affect alveolar ventilation but do not affect expiratory flow rates.\n\n(Choice E) Thickening of the bronchioles, which occurs in some obstructive lung diseases (eg, asthma), leads to narrowing of the airways. Although reduced airway radius leads to local increase in airflow velocity, overall the increased resistance causes a decrease in expiratory flow rates. In fibrotic lung disease, the interstitium, not the bronchiolar walls, is thickened.\n\nEducational objective:\nInterstitial lung disease is associated with decreased lung volumes and increased lung elastic recoil caused by fibrotic interstitial tissue. The increased elastic recoil results in increased radial traction (outward pulling) on the airways, leading to increased expiratory flow rates when corrected for the low lung volume. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现（进行性呼吸困难、细湿啰音、杵状指、弥漫性网状阴影）与间质性肺病 (ILD) 相符。大多数ILD会导致进行性肺纤维化，伴有肺间质增厚和僵硬。这会导致肺弹性回缩增加，以及由于周围纤维化组织增加的向外牵引（径向牵引）{{exhibit_1}}导致气道扩张。由此导致的气流阻力降低会导致超正常的呼气流量（校正肺容积后高于正常）。\n\n限制性肺疾病的其他肺功能检查结果包括总肺容量、肺活量、吸气量、功能残气量和残余容积减少。FVC和FEV1也降低。然而，由于FEV1的下降小于FVC（由于相对于低肺容积的气道扩张），FEV1/FVC比值通常正常或升高。此外，纤维化会导致一氧化碳弥散能力的降低。\n\n（选项A）肺顺应性定义为在给定的压力变化下肺容积的变化。顺应性增加意味着肺组织在对压力增加的反应中拉伸和扩张更多。限制性肺疾病由于间质纤维化导致肺顺应性降低和肺容积降低。\n\n（选项B）胸壁向外回缩限制了在最大呼气期间可以呼出的空气量。胸壁向外回缩的增加会降低呼气流量，因为呼吸肌必须在呼气期间更加努力地工作以抵抗增加的向外力。\n\n（选项C）生理无效腔是指未参与气体交换的吸入空气的体积。生理无效腔的变化会影响肺泡通气，但不会影响呼气流量。\n\n（选项E）细支气管增厚，这发生在一些阻塞性肺病（如哮喘）中，会导致气道狭窄。尽管气道半径减小会导致局部气流速度增加，但总的来说，阻力增加会导致呼气流量降低。在纤维化肺病中，增厚的是间质，而不是细支气管壁。\n\n教学目标：\n间质性肺病与肺容积减少和肺弹性回缩增加有关，这由纤维化间质组织引起。弹性回缩增加导致气道上的径向牵引力（向外拉），导致校正低肺容积后的呼气流量增加。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"
