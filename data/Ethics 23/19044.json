  "explanation": {
    "en": "The process of informed consent requires disclosure of key information so that the patient can make an informed medical decision. The essential components of an informed consent discussion include explanation of the patient's diagnosis and proposed treatment, other treatment options, risks and benefits of the proposed treatment, and risks of refusing the proposed treatment. In this case, the surgeon has not yet addressed the risks to the patient if the surgery is not performed (eg, increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular events).\n\nThe informed consent discussion should be conducted by the surgeon who will perform the procedure and should use language that is easily comprehended. The patient must be given an opportunity to ask questions. The content of the informed consent discussion should be documented in the patient's medical record.\n\n(Choice A) Information regarding cost is not a required component of informed consent. This information likely depends on the patient's insurance plan and is not a question the physician can accurately answer.\n\n(Choice B) Disclosure of the mortality rate of a procedure performed by the surgeon is not a required element of informed consent. However, if asked, a physician must answer truthfully and disclose this information.\n\n(Choice C) Although all patients have the right to a second opinion, explicitly stating this option is not a requirement of the informed consent process.\n\n(Choice E) Discussing the risks of specific anesthetic agents is outside the surgeon's scope of practice. This should be discussed during the informed consent process with the anesthesiologist, which is typically conducted as part of the preanesthesia evaluation.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe essential components of informed consent include explanation of the patient's diagnosis and proposed treatment, other treatment options, the risks and benefits of the proposed treatment, and the risks of refusing the proposed treatment.",
    "zh": "知情同意的过程需要披露关键信息，以便患者做出知情的医疗决定。知情同意讨论的基本组成部分包括对患者诊断和拟议治疗方案的解释、其他治疗方案、拟议治疗方案的风险和益处以及拒绝拟议治疗方案的风险。在这种情况下，外科医生尚未讨论如果未进行手术对患者的风险（例如，随后发生心血管事件的风险增加）。\n\n知情同意讨论应由将要进行手术的外科医生进行，并且应使用易于理解的语言。必须给患者提问的机会。知情同意讨论的内容应记录在患者的病历中。\n\n（选项 A）有关费用的信息不是知情同意的必要组成部分。此信息可能取决于患者的保险计划，并且不是医生可以准确回答的问题。\n\n（选项 B）披露外科医生进行的手术的死亡率不是知情同意的必要要素。但是，如果被问及，医生必须如实回答并披露此信息。\n\n（选项 C）尽管所有患者都有权获得第二诊疗意见，但明确说明此选项并不是知情同意过程的要求。\n\n（选项 E）讨论特定麻醉剂的风险超出了外科医生的执业范围。这应在与麻醉师的知情同意过程中进行讨论，这通常作为术前评估的一部分进行。\n\n教育目标：\n知情同意的基本组成部分包括对患者诊断和拟议治疗方案的解释、其他治疗方案、拟议治疗方案的风险和益处以及拒绝拟议治疗方案的风险。"
