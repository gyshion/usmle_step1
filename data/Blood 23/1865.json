    "en": "This patient likely has LEAD poisoning. Lead poisoning (ie, plumbism) is often a pediatric condition that results from children ingesting lead-containing paint chips. However, lead poisoning can also occur in adults. Affected individuals are usually miners or industrial workers (especially those in battery manufacturing) who inhale particulate lead while working.\n\nAdults with lead poisoning experience weakness, headache, abdominal pain, and constipation. In severe cases, there may be neurologic manifestations (eg, headache, cognitive symptoms, peripheral neuropathy). On physical examination, patients may have blue \"lead lines\" at the junction of the teeth and gingivae.\n\nThe classic findings on peripheral blood smear are coarse basophilic stippling and hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Basophilic stippling results from impaired degradation of ribosomal RNA, which is normally degraded and eliminated during reticulocyte maturation. Lead inhibits an enzyme involved in this process, resulting in ribosomal precipitates that appear as dark blue-purple granules throughout red blood cells (RBCs). Hypochromic microcytic anemia results from inhibition of delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (delta-ALA dehydratase) and ferrochelatase, which are involved in heme synthesis. This causes decreased hemoglobin synthesis, which gives the RBCs a pale appearance.\n\n(Choice A) Acute intermittent porphyria is characterized by reduced activity of porphobilinogen deaminase (an enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway) in the liver, causing buildup of neurotoxic heme pathway intermediates. It can cause attacks of abdominal pain (without abdominal tenderness) due to autonomic neuropathy. Erythropoiesis is not affected, and the peripheral blood smear is normal.\n\n(Choice B) Myeloblasts containing cytoplasmic Auer rods on peripheral blood smear are a characteristic finding of acute myeloid leukemia, which typically presents with complications of pancytopenia (eg, bruising from thrombocytopenia, infection from neutropenia).\n\n(Choice C) Autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells causes atrophic gastritis, which can lead to pernicious anemia (a type of megaloblastic anemia) due to vitamin B12 malabsorption. Megaloblastic anemia is characterized by hypersegmented neutrophils and macro-ovalocytes (large, oval RBCs).\n\n(Choice E) Babesiosis is endemic in the northeastern United States and commonly presents with fever, fatigue, and myalgia. Although it can be detected in a peripheral blood smear, Babesia typically appears as a ring or tetrad form (ie, Maltese cross) within RBCs. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice F) Patients with splenic dysfunction (eg, functional asplenia, splenectomy) may have Howell-Jolly bodies (nuclear remnants normally removed by the spleen), which typically appear as solitary, dark blue-purple inclusions at the periphery of RBCs).\n\nEducational objective:\nCoarse basophilic stippling (dark blue-purple granules throughout red blood cells) and hypochromic, microcytic anemia are common peripheral blood smear findings in lead poisoning. High-risk groups include young children ingesting paint chips and industrial workers inhaling particulate lead. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}",
    "zh": "该患者可能患有铅中毒。铅中毒（即铅中毒）通常是一种儿科疾病，是儿童摄入含铅油漆碎屑所致。然而，铅中毒也可能发生在成人身上。受影响的个体通常是矿工或产业工人（尤其是在电池制造行业），他们在工作时吸入颗粒状铅。\n\n铅中毒的成年人会出现虚弱、头痛、腹痛和便秘。在严重的情况下，可能会出现神经系统表现（如头痛、认知症状、周围神经病变）。在体格检查中，患者的牙齿和牙龈交界处可能有蓝色的“铅线”。\n\n外周血涂片的典型发现是粗糙的嗜碱性点彩和低色素性、小细胞性贫血。嗜碱性点彩是由于核糖体RNA的降解受损所致，核糖体RNA通常在网织红细胞成熟过程中降解和消除。铅会抑制参与该过程的酶，导致核糖体沉淀物，这些沉淀物呈深蓝紫色颗粒，遍布红细胞(RBC)。低色素性小细胞性贫血是由于δ-氨基乙酰丙酸脱水酶(δ-ALA脱水酶)和亚铁血红素合酶受到抑制所致，它们参与血红素合成。这会导致血红蛋白合成减少，从而使红细胞呈现苍白外观。\n\n(选项A) 急性间歇性卟啉症的特征是肝脏中尿卟啉原脱氨酶（血红素合成途径中的一种酶）的活性降低，导致神经毒性血红素途径中间体的积累。它会导致由于自主神经病变引起的腹痛发作（无腹部压痛）。红细胞生成不受影响，外周血涂片正常。\n\n(选项B) 外周血涂片上含有细胞质Auer小体的成髓细胞是急性髓细胞性白血病的特征性发现，通常表现为全血细胞减少症的并发症（如血小板减少症引起的瘀伤、中性粒细胞减少症引起的感染）。\n\n(选项C) 胃壁细胞的自身免疫破坏会导致萎缩性胃炎，由于维生素B12吸收不良，可导致恶性贫血（一种巨幼细胞性贫血）。巨幼细胞性贫血的特征是多分叶中性粒细胞和巨卵圆细胞（大的卵圆形红细胞）。\n\n(选项E) 巴贝斯虫病在美国东北部是地方性流行病，通常表现为发热、疲劳和肌痛。尽管它可以在外周血涂片中检测到，但巴贝斯虫通常以环状或四联体形式（即马耳他十字）出现在红细胞内。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n(选项F) 脾功能障碍（如功能性无脾、脾切除术）的患者可能出现Howell-Jolly小体（通常由脾脏清除的核残余物），它们通常表现为孤立的深蓝紫色内含物，位于红细胞的周边。 \n\n教育目标：\n粗糙的嗜碱性点彩（遍布红细胞的深蓝紫色颗粒）和低色素性、小细胞性贫血是铅中毒的常见外周血涂片发现。高危人群包括摄入油漆碎屑的幼儿和吸入颗粒状铅的产业工人。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of lead poisoning, its clinical presentation in adults, and characteristic findings on peripheral blood smear, specifically basophilic stippling and hypochromic microcytic anemia. It also requires differentiating lead poisoning from other conditions presenting with abdominal pain or anemia.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's occupation as an industrial laborer and the presence of abdominal pain and weakness. Recognize the peripheral blood smear findings of basophilic stippling as a key indicator of lead poisoning, and rule out other causes of abdominal pain and anemia based on their distinct clinical and laboratory features.",
