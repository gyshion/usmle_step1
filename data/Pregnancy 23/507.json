    "en": "A 27-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the office for a routine visit. Medical history is significant for epilepsy that is well controlled with valproate and chronic hypertension for which she takes nifedipine. She hopes to conceive in the next few months and plans to start prenatal vitamins soon. The patient takes no other medications and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Physical examination is normal. If the patient conceives now, her fetus is at increased risk for which of the following anomalies?",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is D. Valproate is a known teratogen that significantly increases the risk of neural tube defects, such as myelomeningocele. This is due to its interference with folate metabolism, which is crucial for proper neural tube closure in early pregnancy. The table shows that valproate is associated with neural tube defects. The explanation states that valproate is contraindicated in pregnancy because it interferes with folate metabolism and causes maternal folate deficiency. Folic acid is required to regulate fetal neural tube closure in early pregnancy; therefore, patients taking valproate are at increased risk for incomplete neural tube closure (eg, meningocele, myelomeningocele) compared to the general population.\n\n(Choices A and E) Epiphyseal stippling (pinpoint calcification) and nasal hypoplasia (depression of the nasal bridge) are characteristics of warfarin embryopathy caused by first-trimester exposure to warfarin.\n\n(Choices B and G) Maternal hypothyroidism, neonatal hypothyroidism, and fetal tricuspid valve malformation (ie, Ebstein anomaly) are associated with lithium use during pregnancy. Neonatal hypothyroidism can also result from exposure to maternal antithyroid medications (eg, propylthiouracil, methimazole).\n\n(Choice C) Micrognathia, or hypoplasia of the mandible, is a craniofacial malformation that can occur with fetal exposure to isotretinoin. It is also commonly associated with genetic syndromes (eg, Trisomy 18).\n\n(Choice F) Renal dysgenesis and fetal anuria/oligohydramnios can result from the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers during pregnancy. These medications are contraindicated in pregnancy, but other antihypertensive medications such as nifedipine and labetalol are safe because they have no teratogenic effects.\n\nKey clinical pearls:\nVALPROATE is a HIGH-YIELD teratogen associated with NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS and decreased maternal FOLATE levels.\nPRECONCEPTION COUNSELING is crucial for women of reproductive age with chronic medical conditions and those on teratogenic medications.\nFOLIC ACID supplementation is recommended for all women of childbearing potential, and HIGH-DOSE supplementation is recommended for those with risk factors such as current valproate use or a prior child with a neural tube defect.",
    "zh": "正确答案是D。丙戊酸盐是一种已知的致畸剂，会显著增加神经管缺陷的风险，例如脊髓脊膜膨出。这是由于它干扰叶酸代谢，而叶酸代谢对于早期妊娠中神经管的正常闭合至关重要。该表显示丙戊酸盐与神经管缺陷有关。解释说明，丙戊酸盐在妊娠期间禁用，因为它会干扰叶酸代谢并导致母体叶酸缺乏。叶酸是调节早期妊娠胎儿神经管闭合所必需的；因此，与一般人群相比，服用丙戊酸盐的患者发生神经管闭合不全（例如，脑膜膨出、脊髓脊膜膨出）的风险会增加。\n\n（选项A和E）骨骺点状钙化（针尖样钙化）和鼻发育不全（鼻梁凹陷）是华法林胚胎病的特征，由妊娠早期暴露于华法林引起。\n\n（选项B和G）母体甲状腺功能减退症、新生儿甲状腺功能减退症和胎儿三尖瓣畸形（即，Ebstein畸形）与妊娠期间使用锂有关。新生儿甲状腺功能减退症也可能由母体抗甲状腺药物（例如，丙硫氧嘧啶、甲巯咪唑）的暴露引起。\n\n（选项C）小颌畸形或下颌发育不全是一种颅面畸形，可能发生在胎儿暴露于异维A酸后。它也常与遗传综合征相关（例如，18三体综合征）。\n\n（选项F）妊娠期间使用ACE抑制剂和血管紧张素受体阻滞剂会导致肾脏发育不良和胎儿无尿/羊水过少。这些药物在妊娠期间禁用，但其他降压药（如硝苯地平和拉贝洛尔）是安全的，因为它们没有致畸作用。\n\n关键临床要点：\n丙戊酸盐是一种与神经管缺陷和母体叶酸水平降低相关的高产致畸剂。\n对于患有慢性疾病和服用致畸药物的育龄妇女，孕前咨询至关重要。\n建议所有有生育能力的妇女补充叶酸，对于有风险因素（例如目前使用丙戊酸盐或以前的子女患有神经管缺陷）的妇女，建议高剂量补充。"

It assesses the understanding of how certain drugs interfere with critical developmental processes, such as folate metabolism, leading to specific birth defects.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the patient's medication history, particularly any known teratogens. Recall or refer to a list of teratogenic medications and their corresponding fetal risks. Evaluate the patient's medication (valproate) and match it with the most likely fetal anomaly based on established teratogenic profiles, paying close attention to the mechanism of action and the timing of fetal development.",
