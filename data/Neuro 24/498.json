    "en": "This patient's brain CT is diagnostic for ACUTE HYPERTENSIVE INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE of the thalamus. Hypertensive vasculopathy involving the small penetrating branches of the cerebral arteries is the most common cause of deep intracranial hemorrhage. Chronic hypertension can lead to progressive arteriolar hyalinization and fibrinoid necrosis, weakening the vessel wall and predisposing to the formation of CHARCOT-BOUCHARD ANEURYSMS. Aneurysmal rupture may ultimately lead to hemorrhage within the brain. The most common sites of intracranial hemorrhage are DEEP BRAIN STRUCTURES, such as the basal ganglia (putamen), cerebellar nuclei, thalamus, and pons. ACUTE NEUROLOGIC DEFICITS can vary depending on hemorrhage location. This patient's contralateral weakness/numbness and extensor plantar response is consistent with thalamic hemorrhage with edema/mass effect on the internal capsule. Symptoms may worsen within minutes to hours and can be associated with headache, nausea/vomiting, or decreased level of consciousness as the hematoma expands. Acute bleeding appears as hyperattenuated, or bright, lesions on noncontrast head CT. (Choices A) Arteriovenous malformations are the most common cause of intracranial hemorrhage in children. This patient's older age makes the diagnosis less likely. (Choices B and C) Carotid artery atherosclerosis and cardiac embolism are 2 common causes of ischemic stroke, which can present similar to hemorrhagic stroke; however, this patient's CT shows intracranial hemorrhage (not ischemia). Spontaneous hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke would be rare within hours of symptom onset. (Choice D) Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is the most common cause of lobar/cortical parenchymal hemorrhage, particularly in older adults. This patient's deep intracranial hemorrhage makes hypertensive vasculopathy more likely. (Choice F) Hypertensive encephalopathy is characterized by a PROGRESSIVE headache and nausea/vomiting followed by nonlocalizing neurologic symptoms (eg, confusion). This patient's focal neurologic deficits and evidence of hemorrhage on CT exclude this diagnosis. (Choice G) Hypoxic encephalopathy is caused by decreased oxygenation of blood (eg, due to cardiac arrest). It most often presents with decreased consciousness (eg, coma or vegetative state); focal neurologic deficits and intracranial hemorrhage would not be seen. (Choice H) Intracranial vasculitis can lead to intraparenchymal hemorrhage but is a far less common etiology compared to hypertensive vasculopathy. (Choice I) Saccular aneurysm rupture is typically associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage as opposed to intraparenchymal hematoma. Patients usually have an abrupt onset of severe headache (thunderclap headache), and focal neurologic deficits are less common. On CT, subarachnoid hemorrhage appears as hyperattenuation of the sulci and basal cisterns. Educational objective: Deep intraparenchymal hemorrhage is most commonly caused by hypertensive vasculopathy of the small penetrating branches of the cerebral arteries (Charcot-Bouchard aneurysm rupture). This is in contrast to rupture of saccular aneurysms, which typically cause subarachnoid hemorrhage.",
    "zh": "该患者的脑CT扫描诊断为丘脑急性高血压脑内出血。累及脑动脉小穿支的高血压性血管病变是深部颅内出血最常见的原因。慢性高血压可导致进行性小动脉透明质样变性和纤维素样坏死，削弱血管壁并易于形成Charcot-Bouchard动脉瘤。动脉瘤破裂最终可能导致脑内出血。颅内出血最常见的部位是深部脑结构，如基底神经节（壳核）、小脑核、丘脑和脑桥。急性神经功能缺损可因出血部位而异。该患者的对侧无力/麻木和伸性跖反射与丘脑出血伴内囊水肿/占位效应一致。症状可能在几分钟到几小时内恶化，并可能伴有头痛、恶心/呕吐或意识水平下降，因为血肿扩大。急性出血在非对比头CT上显示为高密度或亮区。（选项A）动静脉畸形是儿童颅内出血最常见的原因。该患者的年龄较大使得该诊断的可能性降低。（选项B和C）颈动脉粥样硬化和心脏栓塞是两种常见的缺血性卒中病因，其表现可能与出血性卒中相似；然而，该患者的CT扫描显示颅内出血（而非缺血）。缺血性卒中自发性出血性转化在症状出现后数小时内发生的情况很少见。（选项D）脑淀粉样血管病是脑叶/皮质实质内出血最常见的原因，尤其是在老年人中。该患者的深部颅内出血使得高血压性血管病变更有可能。（选项F）高血压脑病的特征是进行性头痛和恶心/呕吐，随后出现非定位神经系统症状（如意识模糊）。该患者的局灶性神经功能缺损和CT扫描的出血证据排除了该诊断。（选项G）缺氧性脑病是由血氧减少引起的（例如，由于心脏骤停）。它最常表现为意识下降（如昏迷或植物人状态）；不会出现局灶性神经功能缺损和颅内出血。（选项H）颅内血管炎可导致脑实质内出血，但与高血压性血管病变相比，这是一种不太常见的病因。（选项I）囊性动脉瘤破裂通常与蛛网膜下腔出血相关，而不是脑实质内血肿。患者通常会突然出现剧烈头痛（雷击样头痛），并且局灶性神经功能缺损较少见。在CT扫描中，蛛网膜下腔出血表现为脑沟和基底池的高密度。教育目标：深部脑实质内出血最常见的原因是脑动脉小穿支的高血压性血管病变（Charcot-Bouchard动脉瘤破裂）。这与囊性动脉瘤破裂形成对比，后者通常引起蛛网膜下腔出血。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the etiology of deep intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage, specifically differentiating between various causes based on patient presentation and CT findings. It emphasizes the role of hypertension in the formation and rupture of Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms as a common cause of deep hemorrhages.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the type of intracranial hemorrhage from the CT scan (deep, intraparenchymal). Then, consider the patient's risk factors, particularly hypertension, and correlate these with the typical locations and causes of different types of cerebral hemorrhages. Ruling out other etiologies like AVMs, emboli, or aneurysms based on the clinical scenario and imaging characteristics is crucial.",
