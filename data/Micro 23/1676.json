    "en": "This patient's annular, erythematous rash with central clearing suggests *erythema migrans* (EM), the hallmark feature of early localized *Lyme disease*. Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete *Borrelia burgdorferi* and is transmitted by the *Ixodes scapularis* tick during blood feeding. *B burgdorferi* replicates at the site of inoculation, which generates a rash 7-14 days after transmission in most patients.\n\nEM typically begins as a confluent macule that expands outward as *B burgdorferi* spreads through the dermis. Most cases evolve over days into an annular lesion with central clearing, which resembles a bull's-eye. Pain is rare, and pruritis is typically mild or absent. Some patients have systemic manifestations (eg, malaise, fever, headache). Because many patients with Lyme disease do not recall a tick bite, suspicion for Lyme disease should be raised in any individual from an endemic area who develops a characteristic EM rash. Although this patient's location is not known, a spreading annular rash with central clearing is highly suggestive of Lyme disease.\n\n(Choice A) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen) can sometimes cause a fixed drug reaction, which is marked by the activation of cytotoxic T cells in a particular location within the dermis. Although patients frequently develop an annular rash, it is usually a dusky red plaque with no central clearing.\n\n(Choice B) Tinea corporis can sometimes be spread through contact with fomites (eg, gym equipment). Although this fungal infection often causes an annular lesion with central clearing that spreads outward, the advancing edge is often scaly with raised borders, and the lesions are usually intensely pruritic.\n\n(Choice C) A type 1 hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction to an insect bite usually arises within minutes and is marked by an edematous lesion that is intensely pruritic. This patient with 2 days of progressive rash that is minimally pruritic is unlikely to be experiencing an allergic reaction.\n\n(Choice E) *Streptococcal* lymphangitis is marked by the formation of erythematous streaks up the lymphatic channel. The formation of an annular lesion with central clearing would be atypical.\n\nEducational objective:\nLyme disease should be considered in any individual who develops erythema migrans, a slowly expanding annular lesion with central clearing (bull's-eye rash). Most cases are not pruritic or painful, but patients sometimes have systemic symptoms (eg, fever, myalgia, headache).",
    "zh": "该患者的环状、红斑性皮疹伴中央清除提示*游走性红斑* (EM)，这是早期局限性*莱姆病*的标志性特征。莱姆病由螺旋体*伯氏疏螺旋体*引起，并通过蜱虫*肩突硬蜱*在吸血时传播。在大多数患者中，*伯氏疏螺旋体*在接种部位复制，接种后7-14天会产生皮疹。\n\nEM通常开始表现为融合性斑疹，随着*伯氏疏螺旋体*通过真皮扩散而向外扩展。大多数病例会在几天内演变成一个环状病变，伴有中央清除，类似于靶心。疼痛罕见，瘙痒通常轻微或不存在。一些患者会出现全身表现（例如，不适、发烧、头痛）。由于许多莱姆病患者不记得被蜱虫叮咬，因此对于来自地方病流行区且出现特征性EM皮疹的任何个体，都应怀疑患有莱姆病。虽然不知道该患者的位置，但伴有中央清除的扩散性环状皮疹高度提示莱姆病。\n\n(选项A) 非甾体抗炎药（例如，布洛芬）有时会导致固定性药物反应，其特征是在真皮内的特定位置激活细胞毒性T细胞。尽管患者经常出现环状皮疹，但它通常是暗红色斑块，没有中央清除。\n\n(选项B) 体癣有时可以通过接触污染物（例如，健身器材）传播。尽管这种真菌感染经常引起向外扩散的环状病变，并伴有中央清除，但进行性边缘通常有鳞屑和隆起的边界，并且病变通常剧烈瘙痒。\n\n(选项C) 对昆虫叮咬的I型超敏反应（过敏反应）通常在几分钟内发生，其特征是水肿性病变，并伴有剧烈瘙痒。该患者的皮疹持续2天，呈进行性发展，但轻微瘙痒，不太可能出现过敏反应。\n\n(选项E) *链球菌*性淋巴管炎的特征是沿着淋巴管形成红斑条纹。形成伴有中央清除的环状病变是不典型的。\n\n教育目标：\n任何出现游走性红斑（缓慢扩展的环状病变，伴有中央清除（靶心皮疹））的个体都应考虑莱姆病。大多数病例不瘙痒或无疼痛，但患者有时会出现全身症状（例如，发烧、肌痛、头痛）。"

It assesses the ability to recognize the classic bull's-eye rash and differentiate it from other dermatological conditions.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the description of the rash (annular, erythematous with central clearing) and the patient's lack of systemic symptoms.
