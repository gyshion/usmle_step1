    "en": "A 45-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after an episode during which she abruptly lost consciousness and had rhythmic jerking movements of the limbs followed by a period of confusion. The patient has had mild daily headaches associated with nausea that have progressed over the past 2 years. The headaches are worse at night and occasionally awaken her. The patient reports no head trauma, visual changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty swallowing or speaking. She does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. There is no family history of seizures. An intracranial mass is discovered on neuroimaging and a biopsy of the mass is shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}.",

    "en": "This patient's biopsy findings are consistent with meningioma {{exhibit_2}}, a slow growing benign tumor derived from meningothelial cells of the arachnoid. Note the syncytial nests and whorled pattern of cellular growth, which may calcify and appear as round, laminar structures called psammoma bodies. Other examples of tumors that form psammoma bodies include papillary thyroid carcinoma, mesothelioma, and serous carcinoma of the ovary and endometrium.\n\nMeningiomas form well-circumscribed, round masses attached to the dura and are commonly found at the falcine, parasagittal, or lateral convexity regions of the brain. Seizure can occur due to compression of the adjacent cerebral cortex. Headaches, nausea, and vomiting may result from increased intracranial pressure, which worsens during recumbency and with sleep (due to increased intracranial blood volume). Individuals may also develop focal neurologic deficits depending on tumor size/location.\n\n(Choice A) Adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas most often present as benign suprasellar tumors in children and appear as cords/nests of palisading squamous epithelium with areas of lamellar \"wet\" keratin under light microscopy {{exhibit_3}}.\n\n(Choice B) Ependymomas typically present as paraventricular tumors (eg, floor of the fourth ventricle) and have characteristic perivascular pseudorosettes under light microscopy {{exhibit_4}}.\n\n(Choice C) Glioblastomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults. They are often located in the cerebral hemispheres and may cross the corpus callosum (\"butterfly glioma\"). Light microscopy shows hypercellular areas of atypical astrocytes bordering regions of necrosis (pseudo-palisading) {{exhibit_5}}.\n\n(Choice D) Medulloblastomas are malignant cerebellar tumors that typically occur in children and are characterized by small blue cells that may surround neuropil (ie, interwoven nerve fibers and synapses), forming Homer Wright rosettes under light microscopy {{exhibit_6}}.\n\n(Choice F) Oligodendrogliomas typically involve the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, and tumor cells have a \"fried egg\" appearance (round nuclei surrounded by a halo of clear cytoplasm) under light microscopy {{exhibit_7}}.\n\n(Choice G) Pilocytic astrocytomas typically are usually benign tumors that involve the cerebellum in children and young adults. Light microscopy typically shows tumor cells with elongated hairlike processes, eosinophilic granular bodies, and Rosenthal fibers {{exhibit_8}}.\n\n(Choice H) Schwannomas are benign tumors that commonly arise from the vestibular branch of cranial nerve VIII at the cerebellopontine angle. Light microscopy typically shows spindle cells with palisading nuclei arranged around eosinophilic cores of fibrillary cell processes (Verocay bodies) {{exhibit_9}}.\n\nEducational objective:\nMeningiomas are slow-growing, well-circumscribed, benign intracranial tumors typically found at the cerebral convexities in adults. Characteristic histopathologic features include syncytial nests and a whorled pattern of cellular growth, which may calcify into round, laminar structures called psammoma bodies.",
    "zh": "该患者的活检结果与脑膜瘤{{exhibit_2}}一致，脑膜瘤是一种缓慢生长的良性肿瘤，来源于蛛网膜的脑膜细胞。注意合胞巢和细胞呈漩涡状生长模式，其可能发生钙化，并呈现为圆形、层状结构，称为砂粒体。其他形成砂粒体的肿瘤的例子包括乳头状甲状腺癌、间皮瘤以及卵巢和子宫内膜的浆液性癌。\n\n脑膜瘤形成边界清楚的圆形肿块，附着于硬脑膜，常见于大脑的镰旁、矢状旁或外侧凸起区域。由于压迫邻近的大脑皮质，可能发生癫痫发作。头痛、恶心和呕吐可能由颅内压增高引起，卧位和睡眠期间会加重（由于颅内血容量增加）。根据肿瘤大小/位置，患者也可能出现局灶性神经功能缺损。\n\n(选项A) 腺瘤型颅咽管瘤最常表现为儿童的良性鞍上肿瘤，在光学显微镜下表现为栅栏状鳞状上皮的索状/巢状结构，并伴有层状“湿润”角蛋白区域{{exhibit_3}}。\n\n(选项B) 室管膜瘤通常表现为脑室旁肿瘤（例如，第四脑室底），在光学显微镜下具有特征性的血管周围假菊形团{{exhibit_4}}。\n\n(选项C) 胶质母细胞瘤是成人中最常见的原发性恶性脑肿瘤。它们通常位于大脑半球，并可能穿过胼胝体（“蝴蝶胶质瘤”）。光学显微镜显示非典型星形胶质细胞的高细胞区域，其边缘为坏死区域（假栅栏状）{{exhibit_5}}。\n\n(选项D) 髓母细胞瘤是恶性小脑肿瘤，通常发生在儿童中，其特征是小的蓝细胞，可能围绕神经纤维网（即交织的神经纤维和突触），在光学显微镜下形成Homer Wright菊形团{{exhibit_6}}。\n\n(选项F) 少突胶质细胞瘤通常涉及大脑半球的白质，在光学显微镜下，肿瘤细胞呈“油煎蛋”样外观（圆形核周围环绕着透明细胞质晕）{{exhibit_7}}。\n\n(选项G) 毛细胞型星形细胞瘤通常是良性肿瘤，涉及儿童和年轻成人的小脑。光学显微镜下通常显示肿瘤细胞具有细长的毛发状突起、嗜酸性颗粒体和Rosenthal纤维{{exhibit_8}}。\n\n(选项H) 神经鞘瘤是良性肿瘤，通常起源于颅神经VIII的前庭分支，位于小脑桥脑角。光学显微镜下通常显示梭形细胞，其具有排列在嗜酸性纤维细胞突起核心周围的栅栏状核（Verocay小体）{{exhibit_9}}。\n\n教育目标：\n脑膜瘤是缓慢生长的、边界清楚的良性颅内肿瘤，通常见于成人的大脑凸起处。特征性组织病理学特征包括合胞巢和细胞呈漩涡状生长模式，其可能钙化成圆形、层状结构，称为砂粒体。"
