    "en": "A 21-year-old man with asthma comes to the office for follow-up. His asthma symptoms are not adequately controlled with albuterol as needed, and a daily inhaled therapy was added at the previous visit. The patient says he feels much better and has been using his rescue inhaler less frequently. He has no other medical conditions. The patient does not use tobacco or illicit drugs and drinks one or two 12-oz cans of beer daily. He received childhood vaccinations but has refused the flu and pneumococcal vaccines. Vital signs are within normal limits, and lungs are clear to auscultation. White mucosal plaques that can be easily scraped off using a tongue depressor are present in the oropharynx. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following measures would have been most effective in preventing this patient's abnormal oropharyngeal findings?",
    "zh": "一名患有哮喘的 21 岁男性前来复诊。他的哮喘症状在按需使用沙丁胺醇后未得到充分控制，并且在上次就诊时增加了每日吸入治疗。患者表示感觉好多了，并且使用急救吸入器不那么频繁了。他没有其他疾病。患者不吸烟或吸毒，每天喝一两罐 12 盎司的啤酒。他接种了儿童疫苗，但拒绝接种流感和肺炎球菌疫苗。生命体征在正常范围内，肺部听诊清澈。在口咽部存在白色粘膜斑块，可以使用舌压板轻松刮除。体格检查的其余部分未见异常。以下哪项措施最能有效预防该患者的口咽异常发现？"

    "en": "Patients with intermittent asthma may be managed with an as-needed, short-acting beta-agonist alone; however, persistent symptoms or severe disease necessitates the addition of long-term controller medications. Inhaled glucocorticoids are recommended for all such patients and have been shown to improve symptoms, reduce the need for short-acting bronchodilators, and lower the risk of serious exacerbations and associated hospitalization.\n\nLow-dose inhaled glucocorticoids are well tolerated and rarely cause systemic adverse effects. However, poor inhalation technique can cause much of the medication to deposit on the oral mucous membranes, where it is ineffective and can lead to oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) {{exhibit_1}} (evidenced by white plaques that are easily scraped off). Patients can avoid this complication by using a spacer and rinsing the mouth after inhalation. Dysphonia unrelated to OPC can also occur with inhaled glucocorticoids due to myopathy of laryngeal muscles and mucosal irritation.\n\n(Choice A) Excessive alcohol intake may increase the risk of developing OPC; however, this patient's intake of 1 or 2 beers per day is within acceptable limits and is an unlikely contributing factor.\n\n(Choice B) Diphtheria (due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae) is a serious infection that typically presents with pharyngitis and gray oropharyngeal pseudomembranes; it can be prevented with vaccination. However, there is no vaccine to prevent OPC.\n\n(Choice D) Patients with chronically elevated blood glucose levels have increased risk of developing OPC; however, there is no evidence that this patient has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.\n\n(Choice E) Prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated for OPC and, in fact, are likely to increase the risk of developing OPC by altering the normal oropharyngeal bacterial flora. Prophylactic antifungals are also not indicated for OPC.\n\n(Choice F) Vitamin A deficiency can impair cell-mediated immunity and create higher susceptibility to OPC. However, patients with vitamin A deficiency typically have drying and thickening of the skin and ocular conjunctivae. Improper administration of inhaled glucocorticoids is far more likely in this patient.\n\nEducational objective:\nImproper administration of inhaled glucocorticoids for the treatment of asthma can lead to adverse effects, including oropharyngeal candidiasis and dysphonia. Using a spacer during administration and rinsing the mouth after each use can help prevent these adverse effects. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "间歇性哮喘患者可能仅通过按需使用的短效 β 受体激动剂来控制；然而，持续性症状或严重疾病需要添加长期控制药物。建议所有此类患者使用吸入型糖皮质激素，已证实可改善症状，减少对短效支气管扩张剂的需求，并降低严重恶化和相关住院的风险。\n\n低剂量吸入型糖皮质激素耐受性良好，很少引起全身不良反应。然而，吸入技术差会导致大部分药物沉积在口腔粘膜上，使其无效并可能导致口咽念珠菌病 (OPC) {{exhibit_1}}（表现为易于刮除的白色斑块）。患者可以通过使用储雾罐和吸入后漱口来避免这种并发症。与 OPC 无关的嘶哑也可能因吸入型糖皮质激素引起，这与喉部肌肉的肌病和粘膜刺激有关。\n\n(选项 A) 过量饮酒可能会增加发生 OPC 的风险；然而，该患者每天摄入 1 或 2 瓶啤酒在可接受的范围内，不太可能是一个促成因素。\n\n(选项 B) 白喉（由白喉棒状杆菌引起）是一种严重的感染，通常表现为咽炎和灰色的口咽假膜；可以通过疫苗接种来预防。但是，没有疫苗可以预防 OPC。\n\n(选项 D) 患有慢性高血糖水平的患者发生 OPC 的风险增加；但是，没有证据表明该患者的糖尿病控制不佳。\n\n(选项 E) 预防性抗生素不适用于 OPC，事实上，通过改变正常的口咽细菌菌群，它们可能会增加发生 OPC 的风险。预防性抗真菌药也不适用于 OPC。\n\n(选项 F) 维生素 A 缺乏症会损害细胞介导的免疫力，并增加对 OPC 的易感性。然而，维生素 A 缺乏症患者通常会出现皮肤和眼结膜干燥和增厚。在该患者中，吸入型糖皮质激素使用不当的可能性要大得多。\n\n教育目标：\n用于治疗哮喘的吸入型糖皮质激素使用不当可导致不良反应，包括口咽念珠菌病和声音嘶哑。在给药期间使用储雾罐并在每次使用后漱口可以帮助预防这些不良反应。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids, specifically the development of oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush) and how to prevent it. It also tests the ability to differentiate this condition from other potential causes of oropharyngeal lesions. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the clinical presentation of thrush (white plaques in the oropharynx) in a patient using inhaled corticosteroids. The most effective preventative measure is oral rinsing after inhaler use to remove residual medication from the oral mucosa.",
