    "en": "A 66-year-old man comes to the clinic due to numbness and tingling in his hands and feet that developed over the last few weeks. The patient was healthy until he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis 3 months ago. He takes only isoniazid and rifampin. Temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F), blood pressure is 126/80 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 16/min. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. Neurologic examination shows ataxia and decreased pain sensation in the distal extremities. This patient's condition is most likely due to which of the following?",

    "en": "This patient with tuberculosis has developed paresthesia and ataxia consistent with isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy. Isoniazid is structurally similar to pyridoxine (vitamin B6), a cofactor for enzymes involved in synthesis of certain neurotransmitters. Because of this similarity, isoniazid acts as a competitive inhibitor of pyridoxine and can cause dose-related peripheral neuropathy (eg, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet). Sensory ataxia (due to loss of peripheral proprioception) and decreased pain sensation are also common features.\n\nPatients at increased risk of isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy include those who are elderly, are malnourished (eg, alcohol use disorder), or have liver or kidney dysfunction; management involves supplementation with pyridoxine.\n\n(Choice A) Paresthesia is common in Guillain-Barré syndrome, an immune-mediated demyelinating disorder, but a progressive ascending paralysis would be seen. Multiple sclerosis is also an immune-mediated demyelinating disease, and ataxia can occur, but symmetric, bilateral paresthesia would not be expected. Neither condition is associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection or isoniazid therapy.\n\n(Choice B) Advanced glycation end products (eg, hemoglobin A1c) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) contribute to the development of peripheral nerve ischemia. This typically occurs in those with chronic (ie, >20 years), poorly controlled DM. In contrast, this otherwise healthy patient developed neuropathy within months of starting isoniazid without pyridoxine, making diabetic neuropathy far less likely.\n\n(Choice C) Certain chemotherapeutic drugs (eg, vincristine) may directly cause peripheral neuropathy by inhibiting microtubule formation. In contrast, isoniazid is not directly toxic to neurons.\n\n(Choice D) Infection with Mycobacterium leprae (ie, leprosy) can cause peripheral neuropathy from impaired myelin production (due to bacterial replication within infected Schwann cells); however, skin findings (eg, erythematous macules, nodules) are also characteristic but are not seen in this patient. In contrast, this patient has pulmonary tuberculosis caused by M tuberculosis, which does not affect myelin production.\n\nEducational objective:\nIsoniazid is structurally similar to pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and competes for binding sites on pyridoxine-dependent enzymes. This leads to decreased synthesis of certain neurotransmitters, which may result in peripheral neuropathy. Management involves pyridoxine supplementation.",
    "zh": "这位结核病患者出现了感觉异常和共济失调，这与异烟肼引起的周围神经病变相符。异烟肼在结构上与吡哆醇（维生素B6）相似，吡哆醇是参与某些神经递质合成的酶的辅因子。由于这种相似性，异烟肼充当吡哆醇的竞争性抑制剂，并可引起剂量相关的周围神经病变（如手脚麻木和刺痛）。感觉性共济失调（由于周围本体感觉丧失）和疼痛感降低也是常见特征。\n\n异烟肼诱导的周围神经病变风险增加的患者包括老年人、营养不良者（如酒精使用障碍）或患有肝或肾功能障碍的患者；治疗包括补充吡哆醇。\n\n(选项A)感觉异常在格林-巴利综合征中很常见，这是一种免疫介导的脱髓鞘疾病，但会出现进行性上升性麻痹。多发性硬化症也是一种免疫介导的脱髓鞘疾病，并且可能发生共济失调，但预计不会出现对称性、双侧感觉异常。这两种情况均与结核分枝杆菌感染或异烟肼治疗无关。\n\n(选项B)糖尿病患者（DM）的晚期糖基化终末产物（例如，血红蛋白A1c）有助于周围神经缺血的发展。这通常发生在患有慢性（即>20年）、控制不良的DM的患者中。相比之下，这位原本健康的患者在开始服用异烟肼而未补充吡哆醇后的几个月内出现了神经病变，这使得糖尿病性神经病变的发生可能性大大降低。\n\n(选项C)某些化疗药物（如长春新碱）可能通过抑制微管形成而直接引起周围神经病变。相比之下，异烟肼对神经元没有直接毒性。\n\n(选项D)麻风分枝杆菌（即麻风病）感染可因髓磷脂产生受损（由于细菌在受感染的施万细胞内复制）而引起周围神经病变；然而，皮肤表现（如红斑性斑疹、结节）也是特征性的，但在此患者中未见。相比之下，该患者患有由结核分枝杆菌引起的肺结核，这不会影响髓磷脂的产生。\n\n教育目标：\n异烟肼在结构上与吡哆醇（维生素B6）相似，并与吡哆醇依赖性酶的结合位点竞争。这导致某些神经递质的合成减少，这可能导致周围神经病变。治疗包括补充吡哆醇。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of peripheral neuropathy as an adverse effect of isoniazid, a common medication for tuberculosis. It specifically assesses the knowledge of the mechanism of isoniazid-induced neuropathy, which is related to its structural similarity to vitamin B6 and its interference with neurotransmitter synthesis.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the patient's symptoms (numbness, tingling, ataxia, decreased pain sensation) and correlate them with the medications being taken (isoniazid). Recognizing that isoniazid can cause a vitamin B6 deficiency-like state leading to neuropathy is key. Evaluating the differential diagnoses provided in the options and eliminating those that do not fit the clinical presentation or known side effects of the medications is also crucial.",
