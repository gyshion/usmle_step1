    "en": "An intern in the endocrinology department is asked to complete a chart review of cholesterol levels of all patients hospitalized with diabetes mellitus-related cardiovascular complications in the past 6 months. The intern's preliminary data analysis reveals that there were 400 such patients, and that serum cholesterol levels were normally distributed among the patients with a mean of 220 mg/dL and a standard deviation of 10 mg/dL. Based on these results, how many patients in this study would be expected to have serum cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Because the cutoff point of ≥240 mg/dL is 2 SDs from the mean, it follows that 2.5% of the observations must lie below 200 mg/dL and 2.5% above 240 mg/dL. Therefore, of 400 patients included in the analysis, 10 PATIENTS (ie. 2.5%) would have a cholesterol level ≥240 mg/dL.",
    "zh": "由于截止点≥240 mg/dL距离均值2个标准差，因此2.5%的观察值必须低于200 mg/dL，2.5%高于240 mg/dL。因此，在纳入分析的400名患者中，10名患者（即2.5%）的胆固醇水平将≥240 mg/dL。"
