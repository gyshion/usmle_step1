    "en": "A 66-year-old man comes to the office after his employer urged him to undergo medical evaluation for repeated mistakes at work. The patient was a highly successful accountant until 6 months ago when he started making uncharacteristic errors and turning in projects late. He says, \"I don't know why, but it's suddenly really hard for me to organize and plan for these projects.\" His wife has had to take over managing their finances at home. The patient is also having difficulty shopping for groceries and preparing meals. He has not seen a physician in many years and takes no medications. Blood pressure is 159/96 mm Hg and pulse is 72/min. Physical examination shows impaired executive neurocognitive function. Reflexes are 2+ in the right lower extremity and 3+ in the left. Strength is 5/5 on the right side and 4/5 in the left lower extremity. He has an unsteady gait.",

    "en": "This patient's relatively abrupt cognitive decline with prominent executive dysfunction (eg, difficulty planning and organizing) and localizing neurologic findings (eg, asymmetric reflexes, asymmetric muscle weakness, gait disturbances) is strongly suggestive of vascular dementia (VaD) due to unrecognized stroke(s) 6 months ago. VaD is often caused by 2 (potentially overlapping) mechanisms:\n\n*   Large artery infarction (often causing an overt stroke) produces a cortical-type VaD, in which accompanying neurologic signs/symptoms reflect the specific cortical region involved (eg, middle cerebral artery infarction causing contralateral weakness and sensory impairment).\n*   Small artery (ie, arteriole) infarcts can cause enough cumulative damage to the brain, resulting in noticeable cognitive deficits. Although the clinical picture is varied, a subcortical-type VaD is common because there is less arteriole collateralization in the subcortical regions compared to the cerebral cortex. As in this patient, subcortical-type VaD is often accompanied by focal motor deficits (eg, reflex asymmetry, strength differences), abnormal gait, urinary symptoms, and psychiatric symptoms (eg, depressive syndromes).\n\nSubcortical VaD is due to either cerebral amyloid angiopathy or, more commonly, small vessel arteriosclerosis. Arteriolosclerosis is common in older patients, especially those with a history of hypertension. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice B) Degeneration of the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain is seen in Alzheimer disease, which presents with progressive memory loss and functional impairments. However, Alzheimer disease typically progresses gradually with early, prominent short-term memory loss, and it would not cause focal neurologic findings (eg, strength deficits, reflex asymmetry).\n\n(Choice C) Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is characteristic of Parkinson disease, which can cause executive and visuospatial dysfunction with relatively mild memory impairment. However, Parkinsonian features (eg, rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia) occur at least a year before the onset of dementia.\n\n(Choice D) Sudden acceleration-deceleration or rotational forces during blunt head injury can cause diffuse shearing of the long white matter tracts (diffuse axonal injury). Patients have a history of acute trauma and neurologic impairment out of proportion to neuroimaging findings.\n\n(Choice E) Neuronal loss and atrophy of hypothalamic mamillary bodies characteristically occurs in Wernicke encephalopathy, a complication of THIAMINE DEFICIENCY. Although it can cause ataxia and confusion, it also typically presents with oculomotor dysfunction (nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia), and patients typically have a history of either chronic alcohol use or malnutrition.\n\nEducational objective:\nSmall artery cerebral arteriosclerosis can lead to ischemia that predominantly affects the subcortical areas. This can lead to vascular dementia associated with focal motor deficits, abnormal gait, urinary symptoms, and psychiatric symptoms.",
    "zh": "该患者的认知功能相对突然下降，伴有明显的执行功能障碍（例如，难以计划和组织）和定位神经学发现（例如，不对称反射、不对称肌无力、步态障碍），强烈提示6个月前由于未被发现的中风引起的血管性痴呆 (VaD)。 VaD 通常由两种（可能重叠的）机制引起：\n\n*   大动脉梗死（通常导致明显的中风）产生皮质型 VaD，其中伴随的神经系统体征/症状反映了涉及的特定皮质区域（例如，大脑中动脉梗死导致对侧无力和感觉障碍）。\n*   小动脉（即，小动脉）梗死可引起对大脑的足够累积性损伤，导致明显的认知缺陷。虽然临床表现各异，但皮质下型 VaD 较为常见，因为皮质下区域的小动脉侧支循环较皮质少。如同本患者一样，皮质下型 VaD 常常伴有局灶性运动功能障碍（例如，反射不对称、肌力差异）、步态异常、泌尿系统症状和精神症状（例如，抑郁综合征）。\n\n皮质下 VaD 是由于脑淀粉样血管病或更常见的小血管动脉硬化引起的。动脉硬化在老年患者中很常见，尤其是有高血压病史的患者。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项 B）阿尔茨海默病可见基底前脑胆碱能神经元的变性，表现为进行性记忆力丧失和功能障碍。然而，阿尔茨海默病通常逐渐进展，早期出现明显的短期记忆力丧失，并且不会引起局灶性神经学发现（例如，肌力缺陷、反射不对称）。\n\n（选项 C）黑质多巴胺能神经元的变性是帕金森病的特征，可引起执行和视觉空间功能障碍，伴有相对轻度的记忆障碍。然而，帕金森病表现（例如，僵硬、静止性震颤、运动迟缓）在痴呆发病前至少一年发生。\n\n（选项 D）钝性头部损伤期间的突然加速-减速或旋转力可导致长白质束（弥漫性轴索损伤）的弥漫性剪切。患者有急性外伤病史，神经系统损伤与神经影像学发现不成比例。\n\n（选项 E）下丘脑乳头体的神经元损失和萎缩特征性地发生在韦尼克脑病中，这是硫胺素缺乏症的并发症。虽然它可引起共济失调和意识模糊，但也通常表现为眼动功能障碍（眼球震颤、眼肌麻痹），并且患者通常有慢性饮酒或营养不良病史。\n\n教学目标：\n小动脉脑动脉硬化可导致主要影响皮质下区域的缺血。这可导致与局灶性运动功能障碍、步态异常、泌尿系统症状和精神症状相关的血管性痴呆。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of vascular dementia (VaD), specifically the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of subcortical VaD due to small vessel arteriosclerosis. It requires differentiating VaD from other neurodegenerative diseases based on the acuity of onset, presence of focal neurological deficits, and associated risk factors.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the abrupt onset of cognitive decline with executive dysfunction and focal neurological signs, which points towards a vascular etiology. Rule out other conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, traumatic brain injury, and Wernicke encephalopathy based on their typical presentations and associated risk factors.",
