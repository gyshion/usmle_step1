  "explanation": {
    "en": "Incretins are gastrointestinal hormones produced by the gut mucosa that stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion in response to sugar-containing meals. This response is independent of blood glucose levels, and typically occurs prior to any elevation in blood glucose level following a meal. Two hormones with incretin effects are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory peptide (glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, GIP). Insulin levels will also increase following intravenous administration of glucose due to the sensitivity of the pancreatic beta-cells to increases in blood glucose, but this increase will not be as marked as that seen following oral glucose administration because the effect of incretin is absent.\n\n(Choice A) Insulin-like growth factor-1 is produced by the liver in response to stimulation by growth hormone. It functions as a mitogen and as an inhibitor of apoptosis.\n\n(Choice C) Somatostatin is produced by cells in the stomach, small bowel and pancreas and inhibits the production and release of most other gastrointestinal hormones, including insulin.\n\n(Choice D) Secretin is a hormone produced in the duodenum in response to increased luminal acidity. It stimulates the release of bicarbonate-rich secretions from the pancreas, gallbladder and duodenum. It also increases the activity of cholecystokinin.\n\n(Choice E) Cholecystokinin is produced by the duodenum in response to a fat or protein-rich meal. It has many functions including inhibition of further gastric emptying, stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion and stimulation of bile production and gallbladder contraction.",
    "zh": "肠促胰素是由肠粘膜产生的胃肠激素，可刺激胰腺胰岛素分泌以响应含糖食物。这种反应与血糖水平无关，并且通常在餐后血糖水平升高之前发生。两种具有肠促胰素效应的激素是胰高血糖素样肽-1 (GLP-1) 和胃抑制性多肽（葡萄糖依赖性促胰岛素多肽，GIP）。由于胰腺β细胞对血糖升高的敏感性，静脉注射葡萄糖后胰岛素水平也会升高，但这种升高不如口服葡萄糖后明显，因为肠促胰素的作用不存在。\n\n(选项 A) 胰岛素样生长因子-1 由肝脏产生，以响应生长激素的刺激。它是一种有丝分裂原和细胞凋亡抑制剂。\n\n(选项 C) 生长抑素由胃、小肠和胰腺中的细胞产生，并抑制大多数其他胃肠激素（包括胰岛素）的产生和释放。\n\n(选项 D) 促胰液素是一种在十二指肠中产生的激素，以响应管腔酸度增加。它刺激胰腺、胆囊和十二指肠释放富含碳酸氢盐的分泌物。它也增加胆囊收缩素的活性。\n\n(选项 E) 胆囊收缩素由十二指肠产生，以响应富含脂肪或蛋白质的膳食。它具有许多功能，包括抑制进一步的胃排空、刺激胰酶分泌以及刺激胆汁生成和胆囊收缩。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of incretins, specifically glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and their role in stimulating insulin release following oral glucose intake compared to intravenous glucose administration. It highlights the incretin effect, which is more pronounced with oral glucose due to the release of gastrointestinal hormones that enhance insulin secretion.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves understanding the physiological differences between oral and intravenous glucose administration and recognizing the role of incretins in amplifying insulin secretion after oral glucose intake. By understanding that incretins are released from the gut in response to oral glucose, one can deduce that GLP-1 is the correct answer.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对肠促胰素（特别是胰高血糖素样肽-1 (GLP-1)）的了解，以及它们在刺激口服葡萄糖摄入后胰岛素释放与静脉注射葡萄糖相比的作用。它突出了肠促胰素效应，口服葡萄糖后这种效应更明显，因为释放的胃肠激素增强了胰岛素的分泌。\n\n解决这个问题的方法包括了解口服和静脉注射葡萄糖的生理差异，并认识到肠促胰素在口服葡萄糖摄入后放大胰岛素分泌中的作用。通过了解肠促胰素是在口服葡萄糖时从肠道释放的，可以推断出GLP-1是正确的答案。"
