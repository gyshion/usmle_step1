The patient has no history of seizures or other medical conditions but has been having recurrent headaches for the past several months. Physical examination shows mild weakness with increased deep tendon reflexes in the left upper extremity. MR imaging of the brain reveals a large mass in the right frontal lobe. Stereotactic biopsy of the mass yields hypercellular white matter with extensive astrocytic aberration, microvascular proliferation, and areas of necrosis lined by tumor cells.

    "en": "This patient's seizure, headache, motor weakness, and brain mass composed of abnormal astrocytes with necrosis and microvascular proliferation raises strong suspicion for glioblastoma (GBM), a highly aggressive tumor that stems from glial or pluripotent neural stem cells. A number of characteristic oncogenic mutations are usually present in GBM, but >95% of cases are associated with the overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the surface of neoplastic cells. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nEGFR is a tyrosine-kinase signal transduction system that conducts external growth signals into the nucleus, thereby promoting cellular survival and proliferation. Mutations that enhance this pathway (eg, overexpression of EGFR or EGFR-ligand) are associated with uncontrolled cellular proliferation and are seen in GBM and other cancer types (eg, non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer). Therefore, drugs that inhibit the EGFR/EGFR-ligand interaction (eg, erlotinib) are often used as part of treatment.\n\n(Choice A) Tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with abnormal tuberin and hamartin. It generally causes benign tumors in the skin (eg, ash-leaf lesions, angiofibromas), central nervous system (eg, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas [SEGA]), and other tissues. SEGA commonly presents as an intraventricular mass composed of large cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm; necrosis and microvascular proliferation would be atypical.\n\n(Choice B) Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with constitutive activation to the RET proto-oncogene, leading to increased risk for medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism. GBM is not classically linked to RET protein alterations.\n\n(Choice C) Neurofibromatosis type 2 is due to mutations that inactivate the merlin tumor suppressor protein. It is associated with vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas; patients may also have eye and skin lesions. A frontal lobe mass would be unusual.\n\n(Choice E) In immunosuppressed patients, primary CNS lymphoma often expresses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genes and is thought to be linked to EBV reactivation in B lymphocytes (the site of latent infection). However, biopsy would reveal atypical lymphoid cells, not astrocyte aberration.\n\nEducational objective:\nGlioblastoma is an aggressive primary brain neoplasm that generally presents with slowly worsening headache, seizure, and/or focal neurologic issues. Most cases are associated with oncogenic mutations that increase epidermal growth factor receptor expression on the tumor cells, leading to increased transduction of growth signals that promote cellular survival and proliferation. {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者的癫痫发作、头痛、运动无力以及由伴有坏死和微血管增生的异常星形细胞组成的脑部肿块，强烈提示为胶质母细胞瘤（GBM），这是一种高度侵袭性的肿瘤，来源于神经胶质细胞或多能神经干细胞。GBM通常存在一些特征性的致癌突变，但>95%的病例与肿瘤细胞表面表皮生长因子受体（EGFR）的过度表达有关。{{exhibit_2}}\n\nEGFR是一种酪氨酸激酶信号转导系统，可将外部生长信号导入细胞核，从而促进细胞存活和增殖。增强该通路的突变（例如，EGFR或EGFR配体的过度表达）与不受控制的细胞增殖相关，并且可见于GBM和其他类型的癌症（例如，非小细胞肺癌、乳腺癌、前列腺癌）。因此，抑制EGFR/EGFR-配体相互作用的药物（例如，厄洛替尼）通常被用作治疗的一部分。\n\n（选项A）结节性硬化症是一种常染色体显性遗传病，与异常的结节蛋白和错构瘤蛋白有关。它通常会导致皮肤良性肿瘤（例如，白叶状斑、血管纤维瘤）、中枢神经系统（例如，室管膜下巨细胞星形细胞瘤[SEGA]）和其他组织。SEGA通常表现为由具有丰富嗜酸性细胞质的大细胞组成的脑室内肿块；坏死和微血管增生是不典型的。\n\n（选项B）多发性内分泌肿瘤2型是一种常染色体显性遗传病，与RET原癌基因的组成性激活有关，导致髓样甲状腺癌、嗜铬细胞瘤和甲状旁腺功能亢进的风险增加。GBM通常与RET蛋白改变无关。\n\n（选项C）神经纤维瘤病2型是由于使神经纤维瘤病2型基因抑癌蛋白失活的突变所致。它与前庭神经鞘瘤和脑膜瘤有关；患者也可能出现眼部和皮肤病变。额叶肿块是不常见的。\n\n（选项E）在免疫抑制患者中，原发性中枢神经系统淋巴瘤通常表达Epstein-Barr病毒（EBV）基因，并被认为与B淋巴细胞（潜伏感染部位）中EBV的再激活有关。然而，活检会显示非典型淋巴样细胞，而不是星形细胞变异。\n\n教学目标：\n胶质母细胞瘤是一种侵袭性原发性脑肿瘤，通常表现为缓慢恶化的头痛、癫痫发作和/或局灶性神经系统问题。大多数病例与增加肿瘤细胞上表皮生长因子受体表达的致癌突变有关，导致促进细胞存活和增殖的生长信号的转导增加。{{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), its typical presentation, and common molecular alterations, specifically the overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It requires recognizing the clinical scenario suggestive of GBM and associating it with the most frequent genetic abnormality.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the key features of GBM from the vignette (seizure, headache, frontal lobe mass, astrocytic aberration, necrosis) and then recall the most common molecular alteration associated with this tumor. Understanding the pathophysiology of EGFR in GBM is crucial for selecting the correct answer.",
