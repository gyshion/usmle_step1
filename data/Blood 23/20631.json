    "en": "A 64-year-old man comes to the office due to several weeks of worsening back pain, fatigue, and polyuria. Physical examination reveals mucosal pallor and diffuse bony tenderness. Laboratory studies are significant for normocytic anemia, hypercalcemia, and renal failure. Serum protein electrophoresis demonstrates a monoclonal spike in the gamma globulin region. Bone marrow biopsy shows a large number of abnormal plasma cells. Treatment with lenalidomide is started; this medication increases affinity of E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme to substrate transcription factors.",

    "en": "Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell neoplasm associated with the overproduction of MONOCLONAL immunoglobulins. Proliferation of neoplastic plasma cells in the bone marrow often causes bone pain (eg, back pain), hypercalcemia (eg, polyuria), and osteolytic lesions; patients also frequently develop normocytic anemia and renal insufficiency. Treatment frequently includes medications that inhibit proteasome activity (eg, bortezomib) or increase ubiquitination of regulatory proteins produced in excess in neoplastic cells (eg, lenalidomide).\n\nLenalidomide is a derivative of thalidomide, an antiemetic agent used in pregnancy until significant teratogenic effects were identified. Lenalidomide increases the binding affinity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to specific transcription factors (TFs) (eg, Ikaros and Aiolos 2 zinc finger transcription factors) that are overexpressed in myeloma cells. Binding attaches ubiquitin to the TFs, which leads to their subsequent DESTRUCTION by the proteasome. Because these TFs are required for myeloma cell survival, diminished intracellular concentrations cause cell death. Other mature B-cell malignancies such as mantle cell lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndrome (some cases are caused by B-cell proliferation) also overexpress these TFs; therefore, lenalidomide is often effective against these neoplasms.\n\n(Choice A) TFs are proteins that bind to a specific DNA sequence to increase or suppress its transcription to messenger RNA; they are not expressed on the cell surface.\n\n(Choice B) Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles with hydrolytic enzymes that break down molecules from outside the cell (via endocytosis) or within the cytoplasm (autophagy). Although lysosomes and proteasomes are the 2 major pathways of protein degradation in the cell, lysosomes digest proteins independent of ubiquitination; therefore, lenalidomide does not alter lysosome proteolysis.\n\n(Choice C) Ubiquitin binding does not alter the way TFs interact with DNA; instead, it results in increased proteolysis of the TFs by proteasomes. In contrast, phosphorylation or acetylation can affect TF binding to promoter regions of DNA.\n\n(Choice E) Proteins targeted for the nucleus have nuclear localization signals, short chains of amino acids that promote transport into the nucleus. These are added during protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum; ubiquitination does not affect nuclear localization.\n\nEducational objective:\nMultiple myeloma is often treated with medications that block proteasome activity (eg, bortezomib) or increase ubiquitination of specific transcription factors (eg, lenalidomide). Lenalidomide increases E3 ubiquitin ligase binding to transcription factors overexpressed in myeloma, which results in increased transcription factor destruction by the proteosome and subsequent cancer cell death.",
    "zh": "多发性骨髓瘤是一种浆细胞肿瘤，与单克隆免疫球蛋白的过度产生有关。骨髓中肿瘤性浆细胞的增殖常引起骨痛（如背痛）、高钙血症（如多尿）和溶骨性病变；患者也常发生正细胞性贫血和肾功能不全。治疗通常包括抑制蛋白酶体活性的药物（如硼替佐米）或增加肿瘤细胞中过量产生的调节蛋白的泛素化（如来那度胺）。\n\n来那度胺是他沙利度胺的衍生物，他沙利度胺是一种在妊娠期间使用的止吐剂，直到发现明显的致畸作用。来那度胺增加了E3泛素连接酶复合物与在骨髓瘤细胞中过度表达的特定转录因子（TFs）（如Ikaros和Aiolos 2锌指转录因子）的结合亲和力。结合将泛素连接到TFs，这导致它们随后被蛋白酶体破坏。由于这些TFs是骨髓瘤细胞存活所必需的，细胞内浓度的降低会导致细胞死亡。其他成熟的B细胞恶性肿瘤，如套细胞淋巴瘤和骨髓增生异常综合征（某些病例是由B细胞增殖引起的），也过度表达这些TFs；因此，来那度胺通常对这些肿瘤有效。\n\n（选项A）TF是与特定DNA序列结合以增加或抑制其转录成信使RNA的蛋白质；它们不在细胞表面表达。\n\n（选项B）溶酶体是具有水解酶的膜结合细胞器，可分解来自细胞外（通过内吞作用）或细胞质内（自噬）的分子。尽管溶酶体和蛋白酶体是细胞中蛋白质降解的2条主要途径，但溶酶体独立于泛素化消化蛋白质；因此，来那度胺不会改变溶酶体蛋白水解。\n\n（选项C）泛素结合不会改变TFs与DNA相互作用的方式；相反，它会导致蛋白酶体对TFs的蛋白水解增加。相比之下，磷酸化或乙酰化会影响TF与DNA启动子区域的结合。\n\n（选项E）靶向细胞核的蛋白质具有核定位信号，短链氨基酸可促进转运进入细胞核。这些是在内质网中蛋白质合成过程中添加的；泛素化不影响核定位。\n\n教育目标：\n多发性骨髓瘤通常用阻断蛋白酶体活性的药物（如硼替佐米）或增加特定转录因子泛素化的药物（如来那度胺）治疗。来那度胺增加E3泛素连接酶与骨髓瘤中过度表达的转录因子的结合，这导致蛋白酶体对转录因子的破坏增加，并随后导致癌细胞死亡。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of multiple myeloma treatment with lenalidomide and its mechanism of action involving E3 ubiquitin ligase and proteasome-mediated degradation of transcription factors. It assesses understanding of how lenalidomide targets specific proteins to induce cell death in myeloma cells. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that lenalidomide enhances the binding of E3 ubiquitin ligase to transcription factors, leading to their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. This process reduces the intracellular concentration of these transcription factors, ultimately causing cell death in myeloma cells.",
