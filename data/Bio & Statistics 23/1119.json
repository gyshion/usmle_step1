    "en": "As part of a research study investigating enzymatic activity in both normal and diseased liver tissue, hepatocytes are isolated from biopsy samples obtained from patients undergoing routine care at a local tertiary referral center. The cells are homogenized and centrifuged to remove membrane components and organelles. Following subsequent rounds of centrifugation, the remaining supernatant contains only cytosol and cytosolic proteins.",

    "en": "Enzymes and the biochemical processes they catalyze often require distinct chemical environments for optimal function; small variations in temperature, molecular concentrations, and pH may render them ineffective. CELLULAR COMPARTMENTALIZATION provides a means by which multiple heterogeneous environments can exist within a cell. Organelles such as the nucleus and mitochondria form distinct, membrane-bound regions with a chemical composition different from the cytosol. This allows multiple biochemical processes to occur simultaneously at maximum efficiency.\n\nThe cytosol and mitochondria are the predominant sites of metabolism in the cell. Mitochondria are the site of beta-oxidation of fatty acids, the citric acid cycle, and the carboxylation of pyruvate (gluconeogenesis). The cytosol is home to enzymes necessary for glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, and the PENTOSE PHOSPHATE PATHWAY. Transketolase is an enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway that uses thiamine (vitamin B1) as a cofactor to shuttle 2-carbon fragments between sugar molecules. Other processes such as heme synthesis, the urea cycle, and gluconeogenesis rely on a complex interplay between the mitochondria and cytosol to function optimally; enzymes present in both cellular compartments are required for these metabolic pathways.\n\n(Choice A) 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG CoA) lyase is a mitochondrial enzyme necessary for ketogenesis. It is also responsible for metabolism of the ketogenic amino acid, leucine.\n\n(Choice B) Ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes the combination of ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to form citrulline in the urea cycle. This reaction occurs within the mitochondria.\n\n(Choice C) Pyruvate carboxylase catalyzes the initial step in gluconeogenesis by converting pyruvate to oxaloacetate. This enzyme requires biotin as a cofactor, and functions within the mitochondria.\n\n(Choice D) Succinate dehydrogenase is a TCA cycle enzyme that converts succinate to fumarate. It is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein and functions as part of the electron transport chain.",
    "zh": "酶及其催化的生化过程通常需要不同的化学环境才能发挥最佳功能；温度、分子浓度和 pH 值的小幅变化可能会使其失效。细胞区室化提供了一种使多个异质环境存在于细胞中的方法。细胞器（如细胞核和线粒体）形成与胞质溶胶不同的、由膜结合的区域，其化学成分也不同。这使得多个生化过程能够同时以最大效率发生。\n\n胞质溶胶和线粒体是细胞中主要的代谢场所。线粒体是脂肪酸的 β-氧化、柠檬酸循环和丙酮酸的羧化（糖异生）的场所。胞质溶胶是糖酵解、脂肪酸合成和磷酸戊糖途径所必需的酶的所在地。转酮醇酶是磷酸戊糖途径中的一种酶，它使用硫胺素（维生素 B1）作为辅助因子，在糖分子之间穿梭 2-碳片段。其他过程，如血红素合成、尿素循环和糖异生，依赖于线粒体和胞质溶胶之间的复杂相互作用才能发挥最佳功能；这些代谢途径需要存在于两个细胞区室中的酶。\n\n(选项 A) 3-羟基-3-甲基戊二酰辅酶 A (HMG CoA) 裂解酶是一种线粒体酶，是生酮作用所必需的。它也负责生酮氨基酸亮氨酸的代谢。\n\n(选项 B) 鸟氨酸氨甲酰转移酶催化鸟氨酸和氨甲酰磷酸结合，形成尿素循环中的瓜氨酸。这种反应发生在线粒体中。\n\n(选项 C) 丙酮酸羧化酶通过将丙酮酸转化为草酰乙酸来催化糖异生的初始步骤。这种酶需要生物素作为辅助因子，并在线粒体中发挥作用。\n\n(选项 D) 琥珀酸脱氢酶是一种 TCA 循环酶，可将琥珀酸转化为延胡索酸。它是一种线粒体内膜蛋白，并作为电子传递链的一部分发挥作用。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of cellular compartmentalization and the location of different metabolic pathways and their associated enzymes within the cell (cytosol vs. mitochondria). The question requires one to know which enzymes are located in the cytosol.\n\nThe question can be answered by knowing that the pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis, and fatty acid synthesis occur in the cytosol, and the enzymes of these pathways would be found in the supernatant after cell lysis and centrifugation. Recognizing the enzyme that functions in the pentose phosphate pathway will lead to the correct answer.",
