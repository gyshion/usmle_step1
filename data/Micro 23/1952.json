    "en": "A 19-year-old man comes to the office with an ulcer on his penis. The patient first noticed the lesion 3 days ago. His temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F). Physical examination shows an indurated and painless ulcer near the glans penis, with no surrounding erythema and no inguinal lymphadenopathy. The patient is a college student. He has no significant past medical history and takes no medications. He has no known drug allergies. The first-line treatment for this patient has structural similarities with which of the following?",

    "en": "This patient likely has a chancre due to primary syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Spirochetes are universally sensitive to penicillin because they are all gram-negative organisms with a peptidoglycan cell wall.\n\nPenicillins work by covalently binding to and inhibiting transpeptidase. This enzyme catalyzes the final cross-linking step in peptidoglycan cell wall formation: the joining of the amino acid in the third position of a peptidoglycan molecule to the terminal D-alanine-D-alanine of another peptidoglycan molecule. The structural similarity of penicillins to D-alanine-D-alanine likely facilitates their binding to transpeptidase. When transpeptidase is inhibited, cell wall synthesis ceases and cell wall degradation by bacterial autolysins proceeds unchecked. The weakened cell wall integrity causes osmotic lysis of the bacterium.\n\nVancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, directly binds to the D-alanine-D-alanine residues, preventing the incorporation of new subunits into the cell wall. Vancomycin acts at an earlier stage of cell wall formation than do the penicillins.\n\n(Choices B and D) D-glutamic acid-D-glutamic acid and L-alanine-D-glutamine are not sequences targeted by transpeptidase. Penicillin is not a structural analog of either molecule.\n\n(Choice C) Sulfonamide antibiotics are antimetabolites that compete with para-aminobenzoic acid for incorporation into folic acid. Trimethoprim blocks another step in folic acid synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase.\n\n(Choices E and F) Peptidoglycan precursor molecules consist of a disaccharide composed of N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc).\n\nEducational objective:\nPenicillins, structurally similar to D-alanine-D-alanine, inhibit transpeptidase by binding covalently to its active site. The result is failed synthesis of the bacterial peptidoglycan cell wall.",
    "zh": "该患者可能患有由梅毒螺旋体（梅毒的病原体）引起的性传播感染（梅毒）引起的硬下疳。螺旋体对青霉素普遍敏感，因为它们都是革兰氏阴性生物，具有肽聚糖细胞壁。\n\n青霉素通过共价结合并抑制转肽酶起作用。该酶催化肽聚糖细胞壁形成的最后交联步骤：将肽聚糖分子第三位的氨基酸与另一肽聚糖分子的末端D-丙氨酸-D-丙氨酸连接。青霉素与D-丙氨酸-D-丙氨酸的结构相似性可能促进其与转肽酶的结合。当转肽酶被抑制时，细胞壁合成停止，而细菌自溶素进行的细胞壁降解不受控制。细胞壁完整性的减弱导致细菌的渗透性溶解。\n\n万古霉素，一种糖肽类抗生素，直接与D-丙氨酸-D-丙氨酸残基结合，阻止新亚基掺入细胞壁。万古霉素的作用早于青霉素的细胞壁形成阶段。\n\n（选项 B 和 D）D-谷氨酸-D-谷氨酸和L-丙氨酸-D-谷氨酰胺不是转肽酶靶向的序列。青霉素不是任何一个分子的结构类似物。\n\n（选项 C）磺胺类抗生素是抗代谢物，与对氨基苯甲酸竞争，并掺入叶酸中。甲氧苄啶通过抑制二氢叶酸还原酶来阻断叶酸合成的另一步骤。\n\n（选项 E 和 F）肽聚糖前体分子由二糖组成，该二糖由N-乙酰胞壁酸（MurNAc）和N-乙酰葡糖胺（GlcNAc）组成。\n\n教育目标：\n青霉素在结构上与D-丙氨酸-D-丙氨酸相似，通过共价结合其活性位点来抑制转肽酶。结果导致细菌肽聚糖细胞壁合成失败。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of penicillin and its structural similarity to D-alanine-D-alanine, which is essential for bacterial cell wall synthesis. It also tests the ability to differentiate between different antibiotics and their mechanisms of action.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's presentation as primary syphilis and recall that penicillin is the first-line treatment. Then, remember that penicillin inhibits transpeptidase by mimicking the structure of D-alanine-D-alanine, which is crucial for peptidoglycan cross-linking in bacterial cell walls.",
    "zh": "本题考察对青霉素作用机制及其与细菌细胞壁合成必需的D-丙氨酸-D-丙氨酸的结构相似性的认识。它还考察了区分不同抗生素及其作用机制的能力。\n\n为了解决这个问题，需要认识到患者的临床表现为原发性梅毒，并回忆起青霉素是一线治疗药物。然后，记住青霉素通过模拟D-丙氨酸-D-丙氨酸的结构来抑制转肽酶，这对于细菌细胞壁中肽聚糖的交联至关重要。"
