    "en": "A 66-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis and atrial fibrillation is scheduled for an elective right total knee arthroplasty in a tertiary care hospital. The patient speaks mostly Spanish and understands limited English. Informed consent is obtained during a preoperative clinic visit using a certified interpreter. On the day of the procedure, the operating room is running behind schedule, and the patient's procedure is delayed by 3 hours. When the surgeon and circulating nurse visit the patient to confirm the site and side of the procedure, the certified interpreter is in the emergency department assisting with another patient and will be unavailable for an hour. The patient talks rapidly and has several questions for the team. The surgeon has taken a 3-week course in medical Spanish, and the nurse can speak short sentences in Spanish. The surgeon converses with the patient in a mixture of Spanish and English. The patient nods frequently as the surgeon speaks. Which of the following best describes the patient-provider communication in this encounter?",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) have a legal right to access health care services in their preferred language. Health care institutions receiving any federal funding (eg, most hospitals) must comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin; they are required to establish professional interpretation and translation systems (eg, qualified bilingual staff, teleconference services) for patients with LEP. Interpreter qualifications include demonstration of sufficient fluency in medical terminology and training in interpreter ethics and skills.\n\nPatients with LEP who receive professional interpreter services experience fewer errors during high-risk processes (eg, informed consent, medication reconciliation, hospital discharge). This patient was appropriately provided an interpreter during the high-risk process of informed consent. However, communication accuracy must be maintained in the presurgery encounter given the patient's questions and pending safety processes (eg, confirming procedure site and side) (Choice C). Therefore, the surgeon should provide the patient access to a certified interpreter, even if the surgery (which is not an emergency procedure) will be delayed.\n\nAd hoc interpretation (eg, by bilingual family members or staff lacking interpreter qualification) should be avoided in non-emergency situations due to potential error and bias. Providers with partial language skills (eg, this surgeon, nurse) often overestimate their ability to accurately communicate with patients of LEP, increasing error risk. Although the surgeon and nurse can speak some Spanish, their ability to clearly convey and comprehend complex (ie, more than basic) information in Spanish is likely limited; furthermore, the surgeon's minimal training in Spanish and use of English in addressing the patient raise concern for possible miscommunication (Choices B and D).\n\n(Choice A) Asking patients to describe their understanding of communicated information, known as teach-back, is a best practice for verifying patient comprehension. However, it is not reliable in this case because of the uncertainty regarding the ability of the surgeon and nurse to accurately comprehend the patient's response.",
    "zh": "英语水平有限 (LEP) 的患者有权以他们首选的语言获得医疗保健服务。接受任何联邦资金的医疗机构（例如，大多数医院）必须遵守 1964 年《民权法案》第六章，该法案禁止基于种族、肤色和国籍的歧视；他们需要为 LEP 患者建立专业的口译和翻译系统（例如，合格的双语工作人员、电话会议服务）。口译员的资格包括证明具备足够的医学术语流利程度以及口译员伦理和技能方面的培训。\n\n接受专业口译服务的 LEP 患者在高风险流程（例如，知情同意、药物调配、出院）中遇到的错误更少。这位患者在知情同意的高风险过程中得到了适当的口译员。然而，鉴于患者的问题和待定的安全流程（例如，确认手术部位和侧面）（选择 C），必须在术前就诊中保持沟通的准确性。因此，外科医生应该为患者提供获得认证口译员的机会，即使手术（这不是紧急手术）将被推迟。\n\n在非紧急情况下应避免临时口译（例如，由缺乏口译员资格的双语家庭成员或工作人员提供），因为存在潜在的错误和偏见。部分语言技能的提供者（例如，这位外科医生、护士）常常高估他们与 LEP 患者进行准确沟通的能力，从而增加了错误风险。尽管外科医生和护士会说一些西班牙语，但他们用西班牙语清楚地传达和理解复杂（即，不仅仅是基本）信息的能力可能有限；此外，外科医生在西班牙语方面的最少培训以及在与患者交谈中使用英语，引发了对可能沟通不畅的担忧（选项 B 和 D）。\n\n（选项 A）要求患者描述他们对所传达信息的理解，即所谓的“回传教学”，是验证患者理解的最佳实践。但是，在这种情况下它并不可靠，因为无法确定外科医生和护士是否能够准确地理解患者的回答。"
