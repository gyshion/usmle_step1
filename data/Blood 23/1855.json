They do not know what caused the swelling and say that the boy cries when his hands or feet are touched. The patient has no history of recent illness and is up to date on all immunizations. The boy attends day care, but his parents are unsure about any sick contacts. His family history is significant for an older brother who died of pneumococcal sepsis at age 6. Physical examination shows bilateral, severe swelling of the hands and feet {{exhibit_1}}.",

    "en": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in African Americans. Its manifestations include the following:\n\n*   **Hemolysis:** Repeated sickling of red blood cells leads to permanent deformation and premature erythrocyte destruction by macrophages and mechanical stress. This causes intra- and extravascular hemolysis, resulting in increased indirect bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase and decreased haptoglobin. Haptoglobin binds circulating hemoglobin and reduces renal excretion of free hemoglobin, preventing tubular injury.\n*   **Vasoocclusive symptoms:** Patients with SCD may experience pain from hypoxic tissue injury and infarctions due to obstruction of small vessels by sickled cells. Microvascular occlusion typically involves the bone marrow, periosteum, and deep muscles but can occur in other organs. This patient is presenting with dactylitis (hand-foot syndrome), which results from small infarctions in the bones of the extremities. These infarctions cause swelling, tenderness, and warmth. Dactylitis is common in patients with SCD during the first few years of life as the affected bones still contain hematopoietic bone marrow. In older children and adults, vascular occlusion leads to pain crises, acute chest syndrome, leg ulceration, priapism, autosplenectomy, and stroke.\n*   **Infections:** Patients with SCD are predisposed to infections with encapsulated organisms (eg, *Streptococcus pneumoniae*) because repeated splenic infarcts cause functional asplenia.\n\n(Choices A and E) The chronic anemia in SCD can result in cardiomegaly due to chronically increased cardiac output (systolic function is largely preserved due to an increase in stroke volume). However, this typically does not occur until after infancy. Older patients can develop congestive heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy and present with decreased cardiac output and increased systemic venous pressure.\n\n(Choices B and F) Serum albumin and urine cortisol excretion are typically normal in patients with SCD.\n\n(Choice C) Hereditary angioedema is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that is associated with painless episodes of swelling involving the face, lips, larynx, and extremities. It is caused by C1-inhibitor deficiency, not vasoocclusion.\n\nEducational objective:\nDactylitis (painful swelling of the hands and feet) is a common presentation of sickle cell disease (SCD) in young children. It is one of many vasoocclusive manifestations of SCD. Sickling episodes result in hemolysis, which leads to increased indirect bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase and decreased levels of haptoglobin.",
    "zh": "镰状细胞病 (SCD) 是非裔美国人中最常见的常染色体隐性遗传病。其表现包括以下内容：\n\n*   **溶血：** 红细胞反复镰变会导致永久性变形，并因巨噬细胞和机械应激而过早破坏红细胞。这会导致血管内和血管外溶血，导致间接胆红素和乳酸脱氢酶升高，结合珠蛋白降低。结合珠蛋白与循环血红蛋白结合，减少游离血红蛋白的肾脏排泄，防止肾小管损伤。\n*   **血管闭塞症状：** SCD 患者可能因缺氧组织损伤和梗死而出现疼痛，这是由于镰状细胞阻塞小血管所致。微血管闭塞通常涉及骨髓、骨膜和深层肌肉，但也可发生在其他器官。该患者出现手指-足综合征（手足综合征），这是由于四肢骨骼的小梗死所致。这些梗死会导致肿胀、触痛和发热。在患有 SCD 的患者中，在生命的最初几年，手指-足综合征很常见，因为受影响的骨骼仍然包含造血骨髓。在较大的儿童和成人中，血管闭塞会导致疼痛危象、急性胸部综合征、腿部溃疡、阴茎异常勃起、自体脾切除和卒中。\n*   **感染：** SCD 患者易感染包膜生物（例如，肺炎链球菌）引起的感染，因为反复脾梗死会导致功能性无脾症。\n\n（选项 A 和 E）SCD 中的慢性贫血可导致心脏扩大，这归因于慢性心输出量增加（由于心搏量增加，收缩功能基本保持）。但是，这通常不会发生在婴儿期之前。年龄较大的患者可能会因缺血性心肌病而发展为充血性心力衰竭，并出现心输出量减少和体静脉压增高。\n\n（选项 B 和 F）SCD 患者的血清白蛋白和尿皮质醇排泄通常是正常的。\n\n（选项 C）遗传性血管性水肿是一种罕见的常染色体显性遗传病，与涉及面部、嘴唇、喉部和四肢的无痛性肿胀发作相关。它是由 C1 抑制剂缺乏引起的，而不是血管闭塞引起的。\n\n教学目标：\n手指-足综合征（手脚疼痛性肿胀）是镰状细胞病（SCD）在幼儿中的常见表现。它是 SCD 的许多血管闭塞表现之一。镰变发作导致溶血，导致间接胆红素和乳酸脱氢酶升高，结合珠蛋白水平降低。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of sickle cell disease (SCD) presentation, specifically dactylitis, and the associated laboratory abnormalities, particularly decreased haptoglobin due to hemolysis. It also tests understanding of the pathophysiology of SCD and its common complications.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the patient's age, ethnicity, and presentation of dactylitis, which is highly suggestive of SCD. Knowing that SCD causes hemolysis and that haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin, leading to decreased haptoglobin levels, will lead to the correct answer.",
