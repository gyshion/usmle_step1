    "en": "This patient has chronic **allergic contact dermatitis** (ACD), presenting with localized itching and lichenification (ie, skin thickening). **Nickel** is a common trigger and typically causes symptoms at the wrists (eg, watches), earlobes (eg, earrings), or umbilicus (eg, belt buckles). Corrosion of metal alloys by electrolytes in sweat releases soluble metal ions that trigger a hypersensitivity reaction. ACD is a type IV (**delayed-type**) hypersensitivity reaction occurring in 2 phases:\n\n1.  Sensitization: Cutaneous Langerhans cells take up haptens (ie, allergens) and present them to naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in regional lymph nodes, resulting in clonal expansion of hapten-sensitive T cells. This phase takes 10-14 days and does not result in cutaneous lesions.\n2.  Elicitation: On reexposure, sensitized T cells are recruited to the dermis. There, they release cytokines (eg, interferon gamma) that recruit additional inflammatory cells (eg, macrophages, mast cells, eosinophils), resulting in erythema and pruritus. Dermal edema, caused by leaky dermal vessels, seeps into the epidermal intercellular spaces (spongiosis), pulling apart intercellular attachments and sometimes resulting in intraepidermal vesicles. With persistent exposure, the lesions become thickened and less vesicular; histopathology shows epidermal hyperplasia (ie, acanthosis).\n\n(Choice A) Extravasated erythrocytes, siderophages, and perivascular lymphocytes are characteristic of venous stasis dermatitis, which typically occurs at the lower extremities and presents with brown discoloration (hemosiderin deposition).\n\n(Choice B) Hyperkeratosis and sawtoothed rete ridges are characteristic of lichen planus, which presents as small pruritic, purplish, polygonal papules or plaques. It frequently occurs at the volar wrist but is typically multifocal; a large, localized plaque is atypical.\n\n(Choice D) In pemphigus vulgaris, autoantibodies against desmosomes lead to loss of intercellular adhesion (ie, acantholysis) and intraepithelial cleavages that manifest as flaccid bullae. Unlike ACD, pemphigus vulgaris may show a sparse inflammatory infiltrate; loss of intercellular adhesion is caused by autoantibodies, not edema.\n\n(Choice E) Neutrophilic microabscesses and epidermal hyperplasia (ie, acanthosis) are characteristic of psoriasis, which presents as erythematous plaques with thick scales typically on the extensor, not flexor, surfaces of the extremities. Although epidermal hyperplasia is seen in chronic ACD, neutrophilic microabscesses are not expected.\n\nEducational objective:\nAllergic contact dermatitis (eg, nickel allergy) is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction characterized by epidermal intercellular edema (ie, spongiosis) and an inflammatory infiltrate (eg, lymphocytes, eosinophils). Clinical findings can include vesicles, erythema, and pruritus for acute lesions and lichenification for chronic lesions.\n\n{{exhibit_2}}\n{{exhibit_3}}\n{{exhibit_4}}\n{{exhibit_5}}\n{{exhibit_6}}\n{{exhibit_7}}\n{{exhibit_8}}\n{{exhibit_9}}\n{{exhibit_10}}\n{{exhibit_11}}\n{{exhibit_12}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有慢性**过敏性接触性皮炎**（ACD），表现为局部瘙痒和苔藓样变（即，皮肤增厚）。**镍**是一种常见的诱因，通常会导致手腕（例如，手表）、耳垂（例如，耳环）或脐部（例如，皮带扣）出现症状。汗液中的电解质腐蚀金属合金，释放可溶性金属离子，从而引发超敏反应。ACD是一种IV型（**迟发型**)超敏反应，分为两个阶段：\n\n1.  敏化：皮肤朗格汉斯细胞摄取半抗原（即，过敏原），并将其呈递给区域淋巴结中的幼稚CD4+和CD8+ T细胞，导致半抗原敏感性T细胞的克隆扩增。此阶段需要10-14天，且不会导致皮肤病变。\n2.  激发：再次暴露时，敏化T细胞被募集到真皮。在那里，它们释放细胞因子（例如，干扰素γ），募集其他炎性细胞（例如，巨噬细胞、肥大细胞、嗜酸性粒细胞），从而导致红斑和瘙痒。真皮水肿，由渗漏的真皮血管引起，渗入表皮细胞间隙（海绵形成），使细胞间连接分离，有时导致表皮内水疱。持续暴露后，病变变得增厚且水疱减少；组织病理学显示表皮增生（即，棘层增生）。\n\n（选项A）溢出的红细胞、含铁血黄素巨噬细胞和血管周围淋巴细胞是静脉淤滞性皮炎的特征，通常发生在下肢，表现为棕色变色（含铁血黄素沉积）。\n\n（选项B）角化过度和锯齿状钉突是扁平苔藓的特征，表现为小的瘙痒性、紫红色、多边形的丘疹或斑块。它经常发生在掌侧腕部，但通常是多灶性的；大的、局限性斑块是不典型的。\n\n（选项D）在寻常型天疱疮中，针对桥粒的自身抗体导致细胞间粘附丧失（即，棘细胞松解）和上皮内裂解，表现为松弛性大疱。与ACD不同，寻常型天疱疮可能显示稀疏的炎症浸润；细胞间粘附丧失是由自身抗体而非水肿引起的。\n\n（选项E）中性粒细胞性微脓肿和表皮增生（即，棘层增生）是银屑病的特征，表现为红斑性斑块，有厚鳞屑，通常位于四肢的伸侧，而不是屈侧。尽管在慢性ACD中可见表皮增生，但预计不会出现中性粒细胞性微脓肿。\n\n教育目标：\n过敏性接触性皮炎（例如，镍过敏）是一种IV型超敏反应，其特征是表皮细胞间水肿（即，海绵形成）和炎症浸润（例如，淋巴细胞、嗜酸性粒细胞）。临床表现可包括急性病变的水疱、红斑和瘙痒，以及慢性病变的苔藓样变。\n\n{{exhibit_2}}\n{{exhibit_3}}\n{{exhibit_4}}\n{{exhibit_5}}\n{{exhibit_6}}\n{{exhibit_7}}\n{{exhibit_8}}\n{{exhibit_9}}\n{{exhibit_10}}\n{{exhibit_11}}\n{{exhibit_12}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), its pathophysiology as a type IV hypersensitivity reaction, common triggers like nickel, and characteristic histological findings. It requires differentiating ACD from other skin conditions based on clinical presentation and expected histopathology. \n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's history of wearing a new watch, the location of the rash, and the associated symptoms. Recall that ACD is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction, leading to spongiosis and inflammatory infiltrate on histology. Rule out other conditions based on their distinct histological features.",
