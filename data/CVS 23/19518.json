    "en": "A 36-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, at 30 weeks gestation comes to the office for a prenatal visit. The patient has noticed some ankle swelling at the end of the day that is relieved with elevating her legs, but she has no other concerns. The pregnancy has been uncomplicated, and her only medications are a prenatal vitamin and iron supplement. The patient has no chronic medical conditions. She does not use tobacco or alcohol. Blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg and pulse is 72/min. BMI is 30 kg/m². Fetal heart tones are normal. There is trace bilateral pedal edema to the shins. Physical examination is otherwise unremarkable. Urinalysis shows no protein. Compared to a nonpregnant state, which of the following cardiac changes are most likely to be found in this patient?",
    "zh": "一位36岁的女性，孕2产1，孕30周，前来就诊进行产前检查。患者注意到在一天结束时出现一些踝部水肿，抬高腿后可缓解，但她没有其他担忧。妊娠过程未见并发症，她唯一的药物是产前维生素和铁补充剂。患者无慢性病。她不使用烟草或酒精。血压为118/78 mmHg，脉搏为72次/分钟。BMI为30 kg/m²。胎儿心音正常。胫骨处有轻微的双侧足部水肿。体格检查无其他异常。尿液分析显示无蛋白。与非妊娠状态相比，该患者最有可能出现以下哪种心脏变化？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "During pregnancy, the increased metabolic demand required for fetal growth and development leads to multiple physiologic maternal adaptations, particularly CARDIOVASCULAR changes. These changes both benefit the fetus and protect the patient against the risks of delivery (eg, hemorrhage).\n\nThe driving force behind maternal hemodynamic changes is a significant DECREASE in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) due to both increased release of peripheral vasodilators (eg, nitric oxide, prostacyclin) and formation of a high-flow, low-resistance uteroplacental circuit (increases blood flow to the placenta and fetus). There is also significantly increased blood volume. These changes have the following effects on cardiac preload and afterload:\n\nBoth increased blood volume and decreased SVR (which allows blood to return to the heart more quickly and easily) contribute to increased cardiac venous return (ie, increased preload).\n\nThe marked reduction in SVR leads to decreased blood pressure (ie, reduced afterload).\n\nBoth the increased preload and decreased afterload facilitate an increase in stroke volume, which is the primary cause of increased cardiac output (ie, stroke volume x heart rate) in early pregnancy. As the pregnancy progresses, the stroke volume decreases but maternal heart rate gradually increases, contributing to an overall increase in cardiac output of up to 30%-50% during pregnancy.\n\nEducational objective:\nDuring pregnancy, increased metabolic demands lead to multiple physiologic cardiovascular changes, including decreased systemic vascular resistance and increased blood volume. These changes cause increased preload and decreased afterload, resulting in increased stroke volume and cardiac output. Heart rate also gradually increases during pregnancy and is the major contributor to increased cardiac output in late pregnancy.",
    "zh": "在妊娠期间，胎儿生长发育所需的代谢需求增加会导致多种生理性母体适应，特别是心血管变化。这些变化既有利于胎儿，又能保护患者免受分娩风险（例如，出血）。\n\n母体血流动力学变化背后的驱动力是全身血管阻力（SVR）的显著降低，这归因于周围血管舒张剂（例如，一氧化氮、前列环素）释放的增加以及高流量、低阻力子宫胎盘循环的形成（增加流向胎盘和胎儿的血流）。血容量也有显著增加。这些变化对心脏前负荷和后负荷有以下影响：\n\n血容量增加和SVR降低（这使血液能够更快、更容易地回流到心脏）都有助于增加心脏静脉回流（即，前负荷增加）。\n\nSVR的显著降低导致血压降低（即，后负荷降低）。\n\n前负荷的增加和后负荷的降低都有利于心搏量的增加，这是早孕期心输出量增加（即，心搏量x心率）的主要原因。随着妊娠的进展，心搏量减少，但母体心率逐渐增加，导致妊娠期间心输出量总体增加高达30%-50%。\n\n教育目标：\n在妊娠期间，增加的代谢需求会导致多种生理性心血管变化，包括全身血管阻力降低和血容量增加。这些变化导致前负荷增加和后负荷降低，从而导致心搏量和心输出量增加。心率在妊娠期间也会逐渐增加，是晚孕期心输出量增加的主要因素。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the normal cardiovascular changes that occur during pregnancy, specifically how preload, afterload, and cardiac output are affected. Understanding these physiological adaptations is crucial for managing pregnant patients.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that pregnancy leads to increased blood volume and decreased systemic vascular resistance. These changes result in increased preload, decreased afterload, and ultimately, increased cardiac output to meet the demands of the growing fetus.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对妊娠期间发生的正常心血管变化的了解，特别是前负荷、后负荷和心输出量如何受到影响。理解这些生理适应对于管理孕妇至关重要。\n\n为了解决这个问题，回想一下妊娠会导致血容量增加和全身血管阻力降低。这些变化导致前负荷增加，后负荷降低，最终心输出量增加，以满足胎儿生长的需求。"
