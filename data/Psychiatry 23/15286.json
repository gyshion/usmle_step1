    "en": "A 13-year-old boy is brought to the office due to anxiety and behavioral problems at school. Although he has good grades, he frequently feels overwhelmed at school and his mother worries that he is socially awkward and has no friends. The patient often appears anxious and uncomfortable in new social situations. He insists on sitting in the same row and seat in every class and has had several inappropriate outbursts when told by teachers that this was not possible. After school, the patient prefers to spend time at home. His mother observes that he is obsessed with dates and comparing solar and lunar calendars and can discuss this for hours, but has difficulty shifting to other topics of conversation. The patient was born at full term, and developmental milestones were within normal range. Physical examination is unremarkable.",

    "en": "This patient's behavior is most consistent with mild, high-functioning AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD). Patients diagnosed with ASD later in childhood and adolescence frequently have normal or near-normal language and intellectual ability and come to clinical attention when social and academic demands increase, exposing a lack of flexibility and social skill deficits (more severe ASD is usually diagnosed by age 5). Key features of ASD include DEFICITS IN SOCIAL COMMUNICATION and reciprocal social interactions as well as RESTRICTED, REPETITIVE INTERESTS and stereotyped behaviors.\n\nThis patient's lack of friends, social isolation, insistence on sameness, intensely fixed interests, and trouble taking turns in conversation are characteristic. Patients with autism have difficulty interpreting and responding appropriately to nonverbal aspects of communication. Abnormal eye contact, stilted, overly formal speech, abnormal sensory sensitivity, and unusual repetitive movements (hand flapping, rocking) are common findings.\n\n(Choice B) Obsessive-compulsive disorder may also present with obsessive interests and insistence on routines. However, this patient lacks the intrusive obsessional thoughts and compulsive rituals performed in response to these thoughts required for this diagnosis (eg, thoughts of contamination leading to cleaning rituals).\n\n(Choices C and D) Personality disorders are not diagnosed when the behavior is better explained by another mental disorder and are generally not diagnosed before age 18. Patients with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder are preoccupied with orderliness and control but do not have deficits in social communication. Patients with schizoid personality disorder are socially isolated and disinterested in relationships, but do not exhibit the restricted interests and repetitive patterns seen in ASD.\n\n(Choice E) Separation anxiety disorder is characterized by developmentally inappropriate and excessive anxiety related to separation from the primary attachment figure.\n\n(Choice F) Patients with social anxiety disorder typically have normal communication skills and an interest in socializing, but they avoid social situations due to fear of being judged. In patients with ASD, social anxiety is related to their lack of social skills.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients with milder forms of autism spectrum disorder frequently have normal language and cognitive development. Characteristic features include deficits in social communication and reciprocal social interactions, restricted interests, and behavioral rigidity that become more apparent as social and academic demands increase.",
    "zh": "该患者的行为最符合轻度、高功能自闭症谱系障碍（ASD）。在儿童期和青春期后期被诊断为 ASD 的患者通常具有正常或接近正常的语言和智力能力，并且当社会和学业要求增加时会引起临床关注，从而暴露出缺乏灵活性和社会技能缺陷（更严重的 ASD 通常在 5 岁之前被诊断出来）。ASD 的主要特征包括社交沟通和相互社交互动方面的缺陷，以及受限的、重复的兴趣和刻板的行为。\n\n该患者缺乏朋友、社交孤立、坚持不变、对特定事物有强烈兴趣以及难以轮流谈话是其特征。自闭症患者难以解释和适当地回应沟通的非语言方面。异常的眼神交流、生硬、过于正式的言语、异常的感官敏感性以及不寻常的重复动作（拍手、摇摆）是常见发现。\n\n（选项 B）强迫症也可能表现出强迫性兴趣和坚持常规。然而，该患者缺乏诊断所需的侵入性强迫性想法和为回应这些想法而执行的强迫性仪式（例如，关于污染的想法导致清洁仪式）。\n\n（选项 C 和 D）当行为可以更好地用另一种精神障碍解释时，不会诊断人格障碍，并且通常在 18 岁之前不会被诊断。强迫性人格障碍患者专注于秩序和控制，但没有社交沟通方面的缺陷。分裂型人格障碍患者社交孤立且对人际关系不感兴趣，但没有表现出自闭症谱系障碍中出现的受限兴趣和重复模式。\n\n（选项 E）分离焦虑症的特征是与与主要依恋对象的发育不适当和过度焦虑相关。\n\n（选项 F）社交焦虑症患者通常具有正常的沟通技巧和对社交的兴趣，但由于害怕被评判而避免社交场合。在 ASD 患者中，社交焦虑与其缺乏社交技能有关。\n\n教育目标：\n患有轻度自闭症谱系障碍的患者通常具有正常的语言和认知发展。特征包括社交沟通和相互社交互动方面的缺陷、受限的兴趣以及行为僵化，这些在社会和学业要求增加时变得更加明显。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in a 13-year-old boy, differentiating it from other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing subtle signs of ASD in older children who may have normal intellectual and language development.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully analyze the patient's social interactions, communication patterns, and behavioral characteristics, looking for the core features of ASD: deficits in social communication and interaction, and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. The process involves comparing these findings to the diagnostic criteria of the provided options and ruling out conditions that do not fully align with the clinical picture.",
