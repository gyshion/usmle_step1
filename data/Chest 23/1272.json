    "en": "This patient has a productive cough, hemoptysis, fever, and weight loss with an apical cavitary lung lesion, findings characteristic of active tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an acid-fast bacillus that replicates within the alveoli. The bacteria are phagocytized by alveolar macrophages, which are initially unable to destroy the pathogen due to microbial adaptations that inhibit the formation of an effective phagolysosome. However, in the weeks after the initial infection, antigen presenting cells (eg, macrophages, dendritic cells) display mycobacterial antigens to naïve CD4+ T lymphocytes in regional lymph nodes, which subsequently differentiate into T helper type 1 (Th1) cells that secrete interferon-gamma. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nInterferon-gamma activates macrophages, leading to the formation of fully acidified phagolysosomes capable of destroying intracellular mycobacteria. Activated macrophages also aggregate and differentiate into epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells, which surround extracellular mycobacteria within granulomas. The release of proteases, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species by these cells helps contain the infection. However, these compounds also cause extensive collateral tissue damage and can result in the formation of cavitary lung lesions.\n\n(Choice B) M tuberculosis produces trehalose dimycolate (cord factor), which inhibits phagolysosome maturation and may contribute to the formation of caseating granulomas. However, cord factor does not directly cause the tissue necrosis associated with cavitary lesions; the release of digestive enzymes by activated macrophages lining the granuloma drives caseation and cavitation.\n\n(Choice C) Lobar pneumonia is characterized by the initial accumulation of an abundant proteinaceous exudate within the alveoli, followed by hepatization of the affected lobe. Lobar pneumonia is typically caused by pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, lobar pneumonia presents acutely, not slowly, over several weeks.\n\n(Choice D) Intraalveolar mycobacteria do not directly cause cavitary lesions. Activated macrophages that surround the extracellular mycobacteria are primarily responsible for the tissue damage that leads to cavitation.\n\n(Choice E) Obliterative lower airway inflammation can occur as a feature of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. In this condition, inflammation causes the proliferation of granulation tissue, which obstructs small bronchioles and leads to alveolar consolidation. However, apical cavitary lesions and hemoptysis are uncommon.\n\nEducational objective:\nControl of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is mediated primarily by activated macrophages, which surround extracellular mycobacteria and wall them off within granulomas. The release of digestive enzymes by these cells not only helps control the infection, but also leads to damage of the surrounding tissue and the formation of cavitary lung lesions. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "该患者表现为咳嗽、咯血、发热和体重减轻，伴有肺尖空洞病灶，这些表现是活动性肺结核的特征。结核分枝杆菌是一种抗酸杆菌，在肺泡内复制。细菌被肺泡巨噬细胞吞噬，由于微生物的适应性抑制有效吞噬溶酶体的形成，这些巨噬细胞最初无法摧毁病原体。然而，在最初感染后的几周内，抗原呈递细胞（例如，巨噬细胞、树突状细胞）向区域淋巴结中的初始CD4+ T淋巴细胞呈递分枝杆菌抗原，这些淋巴细胞随后分化为分泌干扰素-γ的T辅助1型（Th1）细胞。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n干扰素-γ激活巨噬细胞，导致形成能够破坏细胞内分枝杆菌的完全酸化的吞噬溶酶体。活化的巨噬细胞还会聚集并分化为上皮样组织细胞和多核巨细胞，包围肉芽肿内的细胞外分枝杆菌。这些细胞释放的蛋白酶、一氧化氮和活性氧有助于控制感染。然而，这些化合物也会引起广泛的侧支组织损伤，并可能导致空洞性肺损伤的形成。\n\n（选项B）结核分枝杆菌产生海藻糖二肉豆蔻酸酯（索状因子），可抑制吞噬溶酶体的成熟，并可能促成干酪性肉芽肿的形成。然而，索状因子不会直接引起与空洞病灶相关的组织坏死；排列在肉芽肿上的活化巨噬细胞释放消化酶是导致干酪样变和空洞形成的原因。\n\n（选项C）大叶性肺炎的特征是最初在肺泡内积聚大量的蛋白质渗出液，随后受累肺叶肝样变。大叶性肺炎通常由肺炎链球菌等病原体引起。然而，大叶性肺炎呈急性发病，而不是数周的缓慢进展。\n\n（选项D）肺泡内分枝杆菌不会直接引起空洞病灶。包围细胞外分枝杆菌的活化巨噬细胞是导致空洞形成的组织损伤的主要原因。\n\n（选项E）阻塞性下呼吸道炎症可作为隐源性机化性肺炎的一个特征。在这种情况下，炎症会导致肉芽组织的增生，从而阻塞小支气管并导致肺泡实变。然而，肺尖空洞病灶和咯血并不常见。\n\n教学目标：\n结核分枝杆菌感染的控制主要由活化的巨噬细胞介导，这些巨噬细胞包围细胞外分枝杆菌，并将其隔离在肉芽肿内。这些细胞释放的消化酶不仅有助于控制感染，还会导致周围组织的损伤和空洞性肺损伤的形成。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"
