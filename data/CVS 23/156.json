    "en": "A 65-year-old man comes to the physician after missing a follow-up appointment for congestive heart failure. He missed his appointment due to an upset stomach that will not go away. A detailed history reveals disturbed color perception, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that have worsened over the past 2 weeks. His congestive heart failure has thus far been controlled effectively with multiple medications. If the cause of this patient's current symptoms is not corrected, which of the following complications is most likely to develop?",

    "en": "This patient most likely has chronic DIGOXIN TOXICITY, which can cause nonspecific gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms. Although rare, CHANGES IN COLOR VISION are particularly associated with digoxin overdose. The most serious complication of digoxin toxicity is the development of potentially fatal CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS of virtually any type.\n\nDigoxin has a narrow therapeutic index, making toxicity relatively common. Precipitating causes include hypokalemia (increased digoxin binding), hypovolemia, and renal failure. Patients with severe toxicity (eg, life-threatening arrhythmias, end-organ dysfunction) are treated with anti-digoxin antibody fragments.\n\n(Choice A) Angioedema is a severe side effect that manifests as rapidly developing edema that often affects the lips and larynx. Of the drugs used to treat heart failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are most commonly associated with angioedema.\n\n(Choice C) Bronchoconstriction can be caused by nonspecific beta-adrenergic blockers (eg, propranolol) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma. Selective beta blockers (eg, metoprolol) are commonly used to treat patients with congestive heart failure and are less likely to cause bronchoconstriction.\n\n(Choice D) Hypotension can occur with digoxin toxicity due to bradyarrhythmias and severe vomiting and diarrhea that lead to hypovolemia. However, digoxin is also an inotropic agent that causes increased cardiac output. Therefore, hypotension is a variable manifestation of digoxin toxicity.\n\n(Choice E) Pulmonary edema may occur with uncontrolled heart failure due to poor forward flow that causes blood to pool in the lungs. It can be caused by both systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction due to decreased forward ejection of blood and impaired ventricular filling.",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有慢性地高辛毒性，可引起非特异性的胃肠道和神经系统症状。尽管罕见，但色觉改变与地高辛过量尤其相关。地高辛毒性最严重的并发症是发展为潜在致命的任何类型的心律失常。\n\n地高辛的治疗指数狭窄，因此毒性相对常见。诱发因素包括低钾血症（增加地高辛结合）、血容量不足和肾功能衰竭。严重毒性的患者（例如，危及生命的心律失常、终末器官功能障碍）用抗地高辛抗体片段治疗。\n\n(选项A) 血管性水肿是一种严重的副作用，表现为快速发展的、常影响嘴唇和喉部的水肿。在用于治疗心力衰竭的药物中，血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂最常与血管性水肿相关。\n\n(选项C) 支气管收缩可由非特异性β受体阻滞剂（例如，普萘洛尔）在患有慢性阻塞性肺病或哮喘的患者中引起。选择性β受体阻滞剂（例如，美托洛尔）常用于治疗充血性心力衰竭患者，不太可能引起支气管收缩。\n\n(选项D) 由于心动过缓和导致低血容量的严重呕吐和腹泻，低血压可发生于地高辛毒性。然而，地高辛也是一种正性肌力药物，可增加心输出量。因此，低血压是地高辛毒性的可变表现。\n\n(选项E) 由于血流前向性差导致血液在肺部积聚，不受控制的心力衰竭可能发生肺水肿。它可由收缩性和舒张性左心室功能障碍引起，因为血液的前向射血减少和心室充盈受损。"
