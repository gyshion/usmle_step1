After initial evaluation, she is hospitalized for septicemia. Blood cultures plated on lactose-containing media grow rapidly dividing gram-negative bacteria. Replication of these microbial cells requires synthesis of two daughter strands of DNA using the parent strands as templates.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Synthesis of the daughter strands occurs simultaneously from both parent strands. Because DNA synthesis can occur only in the 5' -> 3' direction, one daughter strand is synthesized continuously toward the replication fork (leading strand). However, the other strand must be synthesized discontinuously in a direction away from the replication fork (lagging strand), with more and more segments being added as the replication fork moves across the DNA double helix. This results in the formation of OKAZAKI FRAGMENTS, short stretches of newly synthesized DNA that are separated by RNA primers. These primers are removed and replaced with DNA, and the Okazaki fragments are subsequently joined together by DNA ligase. Because of the discontinuous nature of DNA synthesis on the lagging strand, DNA LIGASE acts many more times on the lagging strand than on the leading strand.",
    "zh": "子链的合成同时发生在两条亲本链上。由于DNA合成只能发生在5' -> 3'方向，一条子链朝着复制叉的方向连续合成（前导链）。然而，另一条链必须以远离复制叉的方向不连续地合成（滞后链），随着复制叉在DNA双螺旋上移动，越来越多的片段被添加。这导致了冈崎片段的形成，冈崎片段是新合成的DNA的短片段，被RNA引物分隔开。这些引物被移除并替换为DNA，然后冈崎片段被DNA连接酶连接在一起。由于滞后链上DNA合成的不连续性，DNA连接酶在滞后链上的作用次数远多于前导链。"
