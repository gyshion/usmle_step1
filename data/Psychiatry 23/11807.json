  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's history of recurrent binge eating followed by compensatory exercise—accompanied by physical findings and laboratory values suggestive of self-induced vomiting (pharyngeal erythema, parotid enlargement, hypokalemia and hyperamylasemia)—is consistent with BULIMIA NERVOSA. Other findings seen in bulimia include hypotension, tachycardia, dry skin, menstrual irregularities, erosion of dental enamel, and metabolic alkalosis. Treatment options for bulimia nervosa include nutritional rehabilitation (establishing a structured and consistent meal pattern), cognitive-behavioral therapy, and pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Fluoxetine is considered the DRUG OF CHOICE and has the best evidence of being most effective in combination with nutritional rehabilitation and psychotherapy.\n(Choice A) The antidepressant bupropion is a norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitor that is contraindicated in bulimia nervosa due to elevated risk of seizures.\n(Choice B) Tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine are not first-line treatment for bulimia nervosa.\n(Choice D) The amphetamine lisdexamfetamine has been used to treat binge eating disorder, but not bulimia nervosa.\n(Choice E) Pharmacological treatment, particularly SSRIs, is an effective component of treatment for bulimia nervosa.\n(Choice F) Olanzapine, an antipsychotic associated with weight gain, has been used in patients with anorexia nervosa who fail to gain weight with psychotherapy alone. It has no role in the treatment of bulimia nervosa.",
    "zh": "该患者反复暴食后进行代偿性运动的病史——伴有提示自我诱导呕吐的体征和实验室值（咽部红斑、腮腺肿大、低钾血症和高淀粉酶血症）——与神经性贪食症一致。神经性贪食症的其他发现包括低血压、心动过速、皮肤干燥、月经不规律、牙釉质侵蚀和代谢性碱中毒。神经性贪食症的治疗方案包括营养康复（建立结构化和一致的膳食模式）、认知行为疗法和选择性血清素再摄取抑制剂（SSRIs）的药物治疗。氟西汀被认为是首选药物，并且有最佳证据表明，它与营养康复和心理治疗联合使用最为有效。\n（选项A）抗抑郁药安非他酮是一种去甲肾上腺素多巴胺再摄取抑制剂，由于癫痫发作的风险升高，禁用于神经性贪食症。\n（选项B）三环类抗抑郁药（如地昔帕明）不是神经性贪食症的一线治疗方法。\n（选项D）苯丙胺类药物赖斯右旋苯丙胺已被用于治疗暴食症，但未用于治疗神经性贪食症。\n（选项E）药物治疗，特别是SSRIs，是治疗神经性贪食症的有效组成部分。\n（选项F）奥氮平是一种与体重增加相关的抗精神病药，已用于单独接受心理治疗未能增加体重的神经性厌食症患者。它在神经性贪食症的治疗中没有作用。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the diagnosis and pharmacologic treatment of bulimia nervosa. It requires identifying the key clinical features of the disorder and knowing the first-line medication options.\nTo solve this question, first, recognize the diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa based on the patient's presentation of binge eating and compensatory behaviors. Then, recall or refer to the established treatment guidelines, which prioritize SSRIs, specifically fluoxetine, as the most effective pharmacotherapy for this condition.",
