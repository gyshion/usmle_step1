  "explanation": {
    "en": "*Strongyloides stercoralis* is a roundworm endemic to tropical and subtropical areas of Southeast Asia, Africa, and Western Pacific nations. It is transmitted when filariform larvae (infective) in soil contaminated with human feces come into direct contact with skin (eg, walking barefoot).\n\nAfter penetrating the skin, larva migrate through the bloodstream/lymphatics to the lungs, enter the alveoli, and ascend the tracheobronchial tree to become swallowed. The larvae then burrow into the intestinal mucosa, where they mature. Adult worms lay eggs that hatch within the intestinal lumen, forming rhabditiform larvae (noninfective) that are excreted in stool. Rhabditiform larvae can also transform into filariform larvae that reinfect the host through the intestinal mucosa or perianal skin (autoinoculation).\n\nMost patients are asymptomatic, but pulmonary (eg, dyspnea, wheezing, dry cough) or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain) can occur. Patients may also develop linear, pruritic, erythematous streaks (larva currens) on the thighs and buttocks due to subcutaneous migration of filariform larvae after autoinoculation of the perianal skin.\n\nAlthough serology can aid in the diagnosis, positive S stercoralis IgG can indicate current or resolved infection (IgG often persists following eradication); active infection is diagnosed when rhabditiform larvae are identified in stool. Eggs and adult parasites are usually seen only in intestinal biopsies.\n\n(Choice A) *Echinococcus* is an animal tapeworm (eg, dogs, sheep) that can cause large liver cysts and pulmonary symptoms in humans. It is usually diagnosed with a combination of imaging (eg, hydatid cysts are visualized on liver ultrasound) and serologic tests.\n\n(Choice B) *Enterobius vermicularis* (pinworms) migrate out of the anus at night to deposit eggs on the surrounding perianal folds. Eggs can be detected by examining a piece of adhesive tape briefly applied to the perianal region shortly after the patient awakens. Perianal itching usually occurs.\n\n(Choice C) Intestinal tapeworms (eg, *Taenia solium, Taenia saginata, Diphyllobothrium latum*) are flatworms made up of multiple segments (proglottids). These are shed from the distal end of the worm and can be detected in the stool of infected individuals. Most cases are asymptomatic.\n\n(Choice E) Trophozoites and cysts are seen in the stool of patients with intestinal protozoal infections caused by *Giardia intestinalis* and *Entamoeba histolytica*. Patients typically have diarrhea but no pulmonary symptoms.\n\nEducational objective:\n*Strongyloides stercoralis* infection involves filariform (infective) larvae penetrating human skin, traveling to the lungs, and then being swallowed. The parasites mature in the small intestine, laying eggs in the mucosa that hatch into rhabditiform (noninfective) larvae. Rhabditiform larvae can be detected on stool microscopy, which is diagnostic of active infection. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "*粪圆线虫*是东南亚、非洲和西太平洋国家热带和亚热带地区的常见线虫。当土壤中被人类粪便污染的丝状蚴（感染性）直接接触皮肤（如赤脚行走）时，就会传播。\n\n穿透皮肤后，幼虫通过血液/淋巴系统迁移到肺部，进入肺泡，并沿气管支气管树上升而被吞咽。然后幼虫钻入肠粘膜，在那里成熟。成虫产卵，卵在肠腔内孵化，形成杆状蚴（无感染性），随粪便排出。杆状蚴也可以转化为丝状蚴，通过肠粘膜或肛周皮肤（自身接种）重新感染宿主。\n\n大多数患者无症状，但可能出现肺部（如呼吸困难、喘息、干咳）或胃肠道症状（如便秘、腹泻、腹痛）。由于丝状蚴在肛周皮肤自身接种后皮下迁移，患者还可能在大腿和臀部出现线状、瘙痒性、红斑条纹（幼虫移行症）。\n\n虽然血清学可以帮助诊断，但S stercoralis IgG阳性可能表明当前或已解决的感染（根除后 IgG 经常持续存在）；当在粪便中鉴定出杆状蚴时，诊断为活动性感染。通常只有在肠活检中才能看到虫卵和成虫寄生虫。\n\n(选项A) *包虫*是一种动物绦虫（如狗、羊），可引起人类大肝囊肿和肺部症状。通常通过影像学检查（例如，在肝脏超声检查中可视化包虫囊肿）和血清学检查的组合进行诊断。\n\n(选项B) *蠕形隐裂*（蛲虫）在夜间从肛门排出，将卵沉积在周围的肛周褶皱上。可以通过检查短暂应用于肛周区域的一块胶带在患者醒来后不久检测到虫卵。通常会出现肛周瘙痒。\n\n(选项C) 肠绦虫（例如，*猪肉绦虫、牛肉绦虫、阔节裂头绦虫*）是由多个节片（孕节）组成的扁虫。这些从虫体的远端脱落，可以在感染者的粪便中检测到。大多数病例无症状。\n\n(选项E) 在由*贾第鞭毛虫*和*溶组织内阿米巴*引起的肠道原虫感染患者的粪便中可见滋养体和包囊。患者通常有腹泻，但没有肺部症状。\n\n教育目标：\n*粪圆线虫*感染涉及丝状（感染性）幼虫穿透人体皮肤，到达肺部，然后被吞咽。寄生虫在小肠中成熟，在粘膜中产卵，孵化成杆状蚴（无感染性）。杆状蚴可以通过粪便显微镜检查检测到，这可以诊断活动性感染。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"
