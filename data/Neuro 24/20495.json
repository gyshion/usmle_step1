    "en": "A 74-year-old man with metastatic lung cancer is brought to the emergency department due to sudden-onset severe headache, nausea, and vomiting. The patient was diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer 4 months ago and was found to have metastasis to the right frontal lobe of the brain. He refused chemotherapy and radiation treatments and is receiving palliative care. Blood pressure is 142/86 mm Hg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, the patient is somnolent but wakes up to voice and follows instructions. The right cingulate gyrus is seen herniating beneath the falx cerebri. Urgent CT scan of the head reveals hemorrhage within the tumor, causing significant surrounding edema; the right cingulate gyrus is seen herniating beneath the falx cerebri. Which of the following findings is most likely to be present in this patient given his neuroimaging results?",

    "en": "Brain herniation occurs when an acute increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) causes a portion of the brain to protrude through an opening in the dural folds or foramen magnum. In this patient, mass effect from hemorrhage within the right frontal lobe metastasis is causing the cingulate gyrus, which is located at the medial aspect of the cerebral cortex just above the corpus callosum, to herniate beneath the falx cerebri (ie, subfalcine herniation). {{exhibit_1}} Unlike in other herniation syndromes (eg, uncal, tonsillar), some consciousness is usually preserved in subfalcine herniation because there is no compression of brainstem wakefulness centers (eg, reticular activating system). Initial presentation may be as subtle as a headache; however, signs of increased ICP (eg, nausea, vomiting, lethargy) are often present, as in this patient. As it progresses, subfalcine herniation can cause ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery compression, leading to downstream ischemia and contralateral leg weakness. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choice A) A dilated and fixed right pupil may occur in uncal herniation due to compression of the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve (CN III). Uncal herniation involves herniation of the most medial portion of the temporal lobe (ie, uncus) beneath the tentorium cerebelli.\n\n(Choice C) Conjugate eye deviation is a classic finding in middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. Resulting damage to the frontal eye field interrupts conjugate gaze, with the eyes directed toward the side of the lesion (eg, leftward gaze in left MCA stroke).\n\n(Choice D) Loss of gag and cough reflexes may be seen with brainstem (eg, medulla) compression or injury, as can occur with acute herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum.\n\n(Choice E) Nonfluent/agrammatic speech (ie, expressive [motor] aphasia) is usually the result of injury to the Broca area, as can occur from a stroke involving the superior division of the dominant (typically left) middle cerebral artery.",
    "zh": "脑疝是指颅内压 (ICP) 急剧升高导致部分脑组织穿过硬脑膜褶皱或枕骨大孔的开口而突出。在该患者中，右额叶转移瘤内出血引起的占位效应导致扣带回（位于大脑皮质内侧面，就在胼胝体上方）疝入大脑镰下方（即，镰旁疝）。{{exhibit_1}} 与其他类型的脑疝综合征（例如，钩回疝、小脑扁桃体疝）不同，镰旁疝通常能保留部分意识，因为没有压迫脑干觉醒中枢（例如，网状激活系统）。初始表现可能轻微，如头痛；然而，通常会出现颅内压增高的体征（例如，恶心、呕吐、嗜睡），如该患者。随着病情的进展，镰旁疝可导致同侧大脑前动脉受压，导致下游缺血和对侧腿无力。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(选项A) 右侧瞳孔散大且固定可能发生在钩回疝中，这是由于同侧动眼神经（CN III）受压。钩回疝涉及颞叶最内侧部分（即，钩回）疝入小脑幕下方。\n\n(选项C) 共轭眼偏斜是大脑中动脉 (MCA) 卒中的一个典型发现。对额叶眼区的损伤会中断共轭凝视，导致眼球偏向病灶侧（例如，左侧MCA卒中时向左凝视）。\n\n(选项D) 咽反射和咳嗽反射消失可能见于脑干（例如，延髓）受压或损伤，这可能发生在小脑扁桃体通过枕骨大孔发生急性疝时。\n\n(选项E) 非流畅性/无语法性语言（即，表达性[运动性]失语症）通常是由于损伤Broca区所致，这种情况可能发生在涉及优势（通常是左侧）大脑中动脉上支的卒中时。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of brain herniation syndromes, specifically subfalcine herniation, and its clinical manifestations due to compression of the anterior cerebral artery.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's presentation (headache, nausea, vomiting, somnolence) and the neuroimaging finding of cingulate gyrus herniation.
