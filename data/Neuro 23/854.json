    "en": "General anesthesia encompasses loss of consciousness, analgesia, amnesia, skeletal muscle relaxation and inhibition of reflexes. This complex of symptoms occurs due to the inhibition of electrical activity of neurons. Most of inhalation anesthetics, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines achieve CNS depression by influencing GABA receptors and increasing the inhibitory action of GABA. Inhaled anesthetics have also been shown to affect potassium channels in the neuronal membranes and lock them in the state of hyperpolarization. They may also affect nicotinic and glycine receptors.\nApart from their desirable action on CNS, inhalation anesthetics affect almost all organ systems of the body.\n1. Cardiovascular effects include myocardial depression that leads to a decrease in cardiac output and an increase in atrial and ventricular pressures. Hypotension associated with fluorinated anesthetics is a result of decrease in cardiac output.\n2. Respiratory: all inhalation anesthetics, except nitrous oxide, are respiratory depressants. They decrease tidal volume and minute ventilation and cause hypercapnia. Another undesirable effect is the suppression of mucociliary clearance, which may predispose to postoperative atelectasis. Halothane and sevoflurane have bronchodilatation properties and are preferred in patients with asthma.\n3. In the brain, fluorinated anesthetics decrease vascular resistance and lead to an increase in cerebral blood flow. It is an undesirable effect as it results in increased intracranial pressure.\n4. In kidneys, inhaled anesthetics decrease glomerular filtration rate, increase renal vascular resistance and decrease renal plasma flow.\n5. Fluorinated anesthetics decrease hepatic blood flow.\n(Choice A and B) Renal function in general anesthesia is characterized by decrease in glomerular filtration rate and decrease in renal plasma flow.\n(Choice C) Fluorinated anesthetics are myocardial depressants. They decrease cardiac output which leads to hypotension.\n(Choice D) Fluorinated anesthetics decrease hepatic blood flow.\nEducational Objective:\nAlmost all volatile anesthetics increase cerebral blood flow. It is an undesirable effect as it results in increased ICP. Other important effects of inhalation anesthetics are myocardial depression, hypotension, respiratory depression and decreased renal function.",
    "zh": "全身麻醉包括意识丧失、镇痛、遗忘、骨骼肌松弛和反射抑制。这种复杂的症状是由于神经元电活动的抑制而发生的。大多数吸入麻醉剂、巴比妥类药物和苯二氮卓类药物通过影响GABA受体并增加GABA的抑制作用来实现中枢神经系统抑制。吸入麻醉剂也被证明会影响神经元膜中的钾离子通道，并将其锁定在超极化状态。它们还可能影响烟碱型和甘氨酸受体。\n除了它们对中枢神经系统的有益作用外，吸入麻醉剂还会影响几乎所有身体器官系统。\n1. 心血管效应包括心肌抑制，导致心输出量下降以及心房和心室压力升高。与氟化麻醉剂相关的低血压是由于心输出量下降所致。\n2. 呼吸系统：除氧化亚氮外，所有吸入麻醉剂都是呼吸抑制剂。它们会降低潮气量和每分钟通气量，并导致高碳酸血症。另一个不良反应是粘液纤毛清除功能的抑制，这可能导致术后肺不张。氟烷和七氟烷具有支气管扩张特性，是哮喘患者的首选。\n3. 在大脑中，氟化麻醉剂降低血管阻力并导致脑血流量增加。这是一个不良反应，因为它会导致颅内压升高。\n4. 在肾脏中，吸入麻醉剂会降低肾小球滤过率，增加肾血管阻力并降低肾血浆流量。\n5. 氟化麻醉剂会降低肝血流量。\n（选项A和B）全身麻醉中的肾功能特征是肾小球滤过率下降和肾血浆流量下降。\n（选项C）氟化麻醉剂是心肌抑制剂。它们会降低心输出量，导致低血压。\n（选项D）氟化麻醉剂会降低肝血流量。\n教育目标：\n几乎所有挥发性麻醉剂都会增加脑血流量。这是一个不良反应，因为它会导致颅内压升高。吸入麻醉剂的其他重要作用包括心肌抑制、低血压、呼吸抑制和肾功能下降。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the systemic effects of inhaled anesthetics, specifically fluorinated agents like isoflurane, on various organ systems during general anesthesia. It requires knowledge of how these agents impact cerebral blood flow, cardiovascular function, respiratory drive, renal function, and hepatic blood flow.\nTo solve this question, one must recall the known physiological effects of inhaled anesthetics. The key is to identify which parameter is most likely to increase, as most effects of these anesthetics are depressant or decreasing. Recognizing that inhaled anesthetics cause cerebral vasodilation, leading to increased cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure, is crucial for selecting the correct answer.",
