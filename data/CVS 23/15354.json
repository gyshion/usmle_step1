  "explanation": {
    "en": "Focal dilation of the abdominal aorta >50% above normal (or >3 cm in diameter) is termed ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM (AAA). AAA formation involves transmural inflammation of the aortic wall with subsequent apoptosis of smooth muscle cells and degradation of matrix proteins (eg, elastin, collagen). This causes progressive thinning of the aortic wall with secondary expansion of the lumen due to chronic hemodynamic stress. AAA is generally asymptomatic until aneurysm rupture, which typically presents with acute abdominal pain and hypotension; mortality of AAA rupture is 75%-90%.\n\nMajor risk factors for development of AAA include:\n\n*   Age >65\n*   Smoking (up to 15-fold risk increase)\n*   Male sex\n\nSmoking appears to be associated with increased inflammatory infiltrates and formation of reactive oxygen species (eg, superoxide anion) in the aortic wall. In light of this, screening for AAA with ultrasonography is recommended for men age 65-75 who have ever smoked. The risk of rupture increases with aneurysm diameter, and surgical or endovascular repair is considered for aneurysms ≥5.5 cm in diameter. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices A and E) Although diabetes mellitus increases the risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the risk of AAA is lower in patients with diabetes, possibly due to the effects of glycosylation of matrix proteins in the aortic wall.\n\n(Choices B and C) Female sex is associated with a lower risk of AAA, and the benefit of screening in women (including in women who smoke) has not been shown to outweigh the risks of overdiagnosis and potential treatment complications.\n\n(Choice D) Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of aneurysm rupture, but the relation to aneurysm incidence and expansion is less clear. Although there is a broad coincidence of AAA and atherosclerosis, studies on an epidemiologic link between hyperlipidemia and AAA are mixed.\n\nEducational objective:\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm is focal dilation of the abdominal aorta >50% above normal (or >3 cm in diameter). It is generally asymptomatic until aneurysm rupture, which is frequently fatal. Risk factors include age >65, smoking, and male sex.",
    "zh": "腹主动脉的局灶性扩张超过正常值的50%以上（或直径超过3厘米）称为腹主动脉瘤（AAA）。AAA的形成涉及主动脉壁的全层炎症，随后平滑肌细胞凋亡和基质蛋白（例如，弹性蛋白，胶原蛋白）降解。这导致主动脉壁进行性变薄，继发于慢性血流动力学应激引起的腔扩张。AAA通常无症状，直到动脉瘤破裂，其典型表现为急性腹痛和低血压；AAA破裂的死亡率为75%-90%。\n\nAAA发生的主要危险因素包括：\n\n*   年龄>65岁\n*   吸烟（风险增加高达15倍）\n*   男性\n\n吸烟似乎与主动脉壁中炎症浸润增加和活性氧（例如，超氧阴离子）的形成有关。鉴于此，建议对年龄在65-75岁之间且有吸烟史的男性进行超声波AAA筛查。破裂风险随着动脉瘤直径的增加而增加，对于直径≥5.5厘米的动脉瘤，应考虑手术或血管内修复。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项A和E）虽然糖尿病增加了动脉粥样硬化性心血管疾病的风险，但糖尿病患者发生AAA的风险较低，这可能是由于主动脉壁中基质蛋白的糖基化所致。\n\n（选项B和C）女性发生AAA的风险较低，并且尚未证明对女性（包括吸烟女性）进行筛查的益处超过过度诊断和潜在治疗并发症的风险。\n\n（选项D）高血压与动脉瘤破裂的风险增加有关，但与动脉瘤的发生率和扩张的关系尚不清楚。尽管AAA和动脉粥样硬化之间存在广泛的巧合，但关于高脂血症和AAA之间流行病学联系的研究结果尚不一致。\n\n教育目标：\n腹主动脉瘤是腹主动脉的局灶性扩张，超过正常值的50%以上（或直径超过3厘米）。它通常无症状，直到动脉瘤破裂，这种破裂通常是致命的。危险因素包括年龄>65岁、吸烟和男性。"
