    "en": "This CT scan demonstrates an incidental finding of **pleural plaques** (focal or band-like pleural thickening, often with **calcifications**). Pleural plaques are a hallmark of **asbestos** exposure; inhaled fibers result in chronic inflammation and collagen deposition within the pleura. They occur most commonly along the parietal pleura covering the ribs and diaphragm. Diffuse pleural thickening, benign pleural effusions, and mesothelioma can also occur.\n\nSome patients eventually develop asbestos, which presents with slowly progressive, diffuse **pulmonary fibrosis**. Interstitial lung injury due to fiber inhalation predominantly affects the lower pulmonary zones and manifests radiographically as interstitial densities that predominate in the lung bases.\n\nAsbestos exposure typically occurs during occupational exposure (eg, **insulation manufacturing** and application, shipbuilding, drywall workers). There is usually a **20-30 year latent period** between asbestos exposure and onset of symptoms.\n\n(Choice A) Beryllium is used in the aerospace manufacturing and nuclear weapon industries. Pulmonary berylliosis closely resembles sarcoidosis (nodular infiltrates, enlarged lymph nodes, noncaseating granulomas) but is not strongly associated with pleural plaques.\n\n(Choice B) Coal worker's pneumoconiosis presents radiologically as multiple small, discrete nodules that are most prominent in the upper lung zones. Pleural plaques are not typical.\n\n(Choice D) Hypersensitivity pneumonitis due to inhalation of agricultural dusts or bacteria (eg, farmer's lung) tends to result in diffuse, nodular interstitial infiltrates; pleural plaques are unexpected.\n\n(Choice E) Petroleum processing can result in exposure to sulfur oxides and aromatic hydrocarbons; these can cause occupational asthma and (rarely) bronchiolitis obliterans, which result in air trapping and bronchial wall thickening (as opposed to the pleural thickening seen in asbestos exposure).\n\n(Choice F) Silicosis is most common in patients with a history of sandblasting or mining. Numerous upper lobe nodular densities and eggshell calcifications of the hilar nodes are seen; pleural plaques are unexpected.\n\nEducational objective:\nAsbestos-related pleural disease is characterized by pleural plaques (focal pleural thickening, typically with calcifications). Common occupational exposures include shipbuilding, insulation manufacturing and application, and drywall application. Most affected patients remain asymptomatic for 20-30 years following initial exposure.",
    "zh": "该CT扫描显示偶然发现**胸膜斑块**（局灶性或带状胸膜增厚，常伴有**钙化**）。胸膜斑块是**石棉**暴露的标志；吸入的纤维会导致胸膜内慢性炎症和胶原沉积。它们最常见于覆盖肋骨和膈肌的壁层胸膜。也可发生弥漫性胸膜增厚、良性胸腔积液和间皮瘤。\n\n一些患者最终会患上石棉肺，表现为缓慢进展的、弥漫性**肺纤维化**。由于纤维吸入引起的间质性肺损伤主要影响下肺区，并在影像学上表现为以肺底部为主的间质密度。\n\n石棉暴露通常发生在职业暴露期间（例如，**绝缘材料制造业**和应用、造船业、石膏板工人）。石棉暴露和症状出现之间通常有**20-30年的潜伏期**。\n\n（选项A）铍用于航空航天制造和核武器工业。肺铍病与结节病（结节性浸润、淋巴结肿大、非干酪性肉芽肿）非常相似，但与胸膜斑块没有强相关性。\n\n（选项B）煤矿工人尘肺病在影像学上表现为多个小的、独立的结节，这些结节在上肺区最明显。胸膜斑块不典型。\n\n（选项D）由于吸入农业粉尘或细菌（例如，农民肺）引起的过敏性肺炎往往导致弥漫性、结节性间质浸润；胸膜斑块是意料之外的。\n\n（选项E）石油加工会导致接触硫氧化物和芳香烃；这些物质可引起职业性哮喘和（罕见）闭塞性细支气管炎，导致气滞和支气管壁增厚（与石棉暴露中看到的胸膜增厚相反）。\n\n（选项F）硅肺病在有喷砂或采矿史的患者中最常见。可见多个上叶结节密度和肺门淋巴结的蛋壳样钙化；胸膜斑块是意料之外的。\n\n教育目标：\n与石棉相关的胸膜疾病的特征是胸膜斑块（局灶性胸膜增厚，通常伴有钙化）。常见的职业暴露包括造船业、绝缘材料制造和应用以及石膏板应用。大多数受影响的患者在最初暴露后20-30年内保持无症状。"
