    "en": "A 10-year-old boy is brought to the office due to abrupt onset fever and sore throat that began a day ago. He has had similar illnesses in the past, which were treated with oral antibiotics. The patient has no other medical conditions and has received all recommended vaccinations. Temperature is 38.3 C (101 F). Physical examination shows erythema of the posterior pharyngeal wall and enlarged tonsils, which are covered by white exudate. There are no enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Throat swab specimen is obtained.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Group A streptococcus (GAS), also called Streptococcus pyogenes, is the leading cause of BACTERIAL pharyngitis in children and adolescents. Manifestations include abrupt-onset fever and sore throat; patients may also have nausea, vomiting, and headache. Examination often reveals exudative tonsillopharyngitis and enlarged tonsils. An alternate diagnosis should be suspected in those with manifestations of viral illness (eg, coryza, conjunctivitis, cough, hoarseness, mouth ulcers).\n\nPatients with suspected GAS pharyngitis require microbiologic testing prior to initiation of antimicrobials. Throat swab samples are collected in-office and are subsequently evaluated by the following:\n\nRapid antigen detection testing (RADT) – this immunoassay evaluates for GAS antigens and provides rapid, in-office results. However, due to the test's limited sensitivity, patients with negative RADT require throat culture to confirm they do not have the organism.\n\nThroat culture – samples are plated on blood agar and evaluated for beta-hemolysis within 48 hours. GAS is beta-hemolytic due to the expression of cytolysins (eg, streptolysin O), which create a broad zone of complete hemolysis (not incomplete hemolysis) around plated colonies (Choice D).\n\nPatients with positive RADT or throat culture require antibiotic therapy (eg, amoxicillin) to prevent complications of GAS (eg, rheumatic fever), limit transmission to others, and reduce duration/severity of symptoms.\n\n(Choice A) Gram-stain cannot be used to definitively determine if GAS is present because other oropharyngeal organisms (eg, viridans streptococci) also appear as gram-positive cocci in chains.\n\n(Choice B) Antibodies against M protein, a virulence factor that coats the surface of GAS, provide protective immunity against future infections with a particular GAS strain. However, antibody titers take several weeks to elevate after acute infection; therefore, antibody testing is not used to diagnose acute pharyngitis.\n\n(Choice C) Elevated antibody titers against streptolysin O indicate recent GAS infection and can aid the diagnosis of GAS complications (eg, rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis). However, antibodies against streptolysin take several weeks to form; therefore, they are not used to diagnose acute pharyngitis.\n\nEducational objective:\nGroup A streptococcus (GAS) should be suspected in those with acute-onset sore throat, exudative tonsillopharyngitis, and no evidence of viral symptoms (eg, coryza, cough, conjunctivitis). In-office swab with rapid antigen detection testing (immunoassay for GAS antigens) can provide on-site microbiologic confirmation, allowing for early initiation of treatment.",
    "zh": "A组链球菌（GAS），也称为化脓性链球菌，是儿童和青少年细菌性咽炎的主要病因。临床表现包括突发性发热和喉咙痛；患者还可能出现恶心、呕吐和头痛。检查常发现渗出性扁桃体咽炎和扁桃体肿大。对于出现病毒性疾病表现（如，流涕、结膜炎、咳嗽、声音嘶哑、口腔溃疡）的患者，应考虑其他诊断。\n\n怀疑患有GAS咽炎的患者需要在开始使用抗菌药物之前进行微生物学检测。在诊室采集咽拭子样本，随后通过以下方法进行评估：\n\n快速抗原检测（RADT）——这种免疫分析方法可评估GAS抗原，并提供快速的诊室结果。然而，由于该测试的敏感性有限，RADT阴性的患者需要进行咽培养以确认他们没有该病原体。\n\n咽培养——将样本接种在血琼脂上，并在48小时内评估β-溶血。GAS由于细胞溶解素（如链球菌溶血素O）的表达而呈现β-溶血，该溶血素在接种菌落周围产生大范围的完全溶血区（不是不完全溶血）（选项D）。\n\nRADT或咽培养阳性的患者需要进行抗生素治疗（如阿莫西林），以预防GAS的并发症（如风湿热），限制向他人传播，并减轻症状的持续时间/严重程度。\n\n（选项A）革兰染色不能用于明确确定是否存在GAS，因为其他口咽微生物（如草绿色链球菌）也表现为链状排列的革兰阳性球菌。\n\n（选项B）针对M蛋白（一种覆盖GAS表面的毒力因子）的抗体，可提供针对特定GAS菌株的未来感染的保护性免疫力。然而，抗体滴度在急性感染后需要数周才能升高；因此，抗体检测不用于诊断急性咽炎。\n\n（选项C）抗链球菌溶血素O抗体滴度升高表明近期GAS感染，并可辅助诊断GAS并发症（如风湿热、肾小球肾炎）。然而，抗链球菌溶血素的抗体需要数周才能形成；因此，它们不用于诊断急性咽炎。\n\n教学目标：\n对于那些有急性发作的喉咙痛、渗出性扁桃体咽炎，且无病毒症状（如流涕、咳嗽、结膜炎）证据的患者，应怀疑为A组链球菌（GAS）感染。使用快速抗原检测（GAS抗原的免疫分析）的诊室拭子可以提供现场微生物学确认，从而可以早期开始治疗。"
