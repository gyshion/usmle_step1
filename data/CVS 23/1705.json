    "en": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the office by his parents for evaluation of cyanosis with minimal exertion. The boy has had occasional episodes of \"turning blue\" that first began during infancy and are now occurring more frequently. During the episodes, the boy assumes a squatting position as it makes him \"feel better.\" The family recently immigrated to the United States; the boy has never had a medical checkup prior to this visit. Physical examination reveals a prominent right ventricular impulse and a harsh systolic murmur. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Tetralogy of Fallot results from anterior and cephalad deviation of the infundibular septum during embryologic development, resulting in a malaligned ventricular septal defect (VSD) with an overriding aorta. As a result, the patient has right ventricular outflow obstruction (resulting in a systolic murmur) and squats to increase the peripheral systemic vascular resistance (afterload) and decrease right-to-left shunting across the VSD.",
    "zh": "法洛四联症（Tetralogy of Fallot）是由于胚胎发育过程中漏斗部间隔向前和头侧偏离所致，导致室间隔缺损（VSD）错位，并伴有主动脉骑跨。因此，患者出现右心室流出道梗阻（导致收缩期杂音），并采取蹲姿以增加外周全身血管阻力（后负荷）并减少通过室间隔缺损的右向左分流。"

    "en": "The question describes a child with cyanosis, squatting, and a harsh systolic murmur, suggestive of Tetralogy of Fallot. The correct answer is deviation of the infundibular septum, which is the embryological cause of Tetralogy of Fallot.",
