  "explanation": {
    "en": "This hospitalized patient's fever and watery diarrhea a few days after antibiotic initiation are concerning for *Clostridioides difficile* infection. All hospitalized patients require standard precautions, including handwashing before and after patient contact, proper disposal of cleaning instruments and linens, and occasional use of gowns and gloves as required (eg, contact with body fluids).\n\nHowever, cases of suspected or proven *C difficile* infection require additional contact precautions, including washing hands with soap and water (alcohol-based hand sanitizers do not kill the spores), donning a gown for any patient contact, and wearing nonsterile gloves. Gloves alone would not be sufficient (Choice B). In addition, a dedicated stethoscope and blood pressure cuff should be left in the patient's room.\n\n(Choice C) Airborne precautions include an isolated room with negative pressure ventilation and a respirator mask with filtering capacity (eg, N95 mask) to avoid potential exposure to aerosolized particles (<5 μm) that can remain suspended in air for extended periods. Gloves and gowns are not needed. Airborne precautions are required for certain bacterial (eg, tuberculosis) and viral (eg, varicella) infections but not for *C difficile*.\n\n(Choices D and E) Sterile gowns and/or gloves are generally used for minor procedures or surgeries to avoid introducing contamination into the wound when the skin's protective barrier is being disrupted. They are not required for examining patients with contact precautions, in which nonsterile gown and gloves are sufficient to protect the examiner.\n\nEducational objective: *Clostridioides difficile* requires additional contact precautions, including handwashing with soap and water, a gown for any patient contact, and nonsterile gloves. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers do not kill the bacterial spores.",
    "zh": "这位住院患者在开始使用抗生素几天后出现发烧和水样腹泻，这提示可能感染了艰难梭菌。所有住院患者都需要标准预防措施，包括在接触患者前后洗手，妥善处理清洁仪器和亚麻制品，以及根据需要（例如，接触体液）偶尔使用隔离衣和手套。\n\n然而，对于疑似或确诊的艰难梭菌感染病例，需要额外的接触预防措施，包括用肥皂和水洗手（含酒精的手部消毒剂不能杀死孢子），在与患者接触时穿上隔离衣，并戴上非无菌手套。仅戴手套是不够的（选项B）。此外，应将专用听诊器和血压袖带留在患者的房间内。\n\n（选项C）空气传播预防措施包括一个隔离房间，具有负压通风和具有过滤能力的呼吸器面罩（例如，N95口罩），以避免潜在暴露于可在空气中悬浮较长时间的雾化颗粒（<5μm）。不需要手套和隔离衣。空气传播预防措施适用于某些细菌（例如，结核病）和病毒（例如，水痘）感染，但不适用于艰难梭菌。\n\n（选项D和E）无菌隔离衣和/或手套通常用于小型手术或手术，以避免在皮肤保护屏障被破坏时将污染引入伤口。对于需要接触预防措施的患者，不需要使用无菌隔离衣和手套，非无菌隔离衣和手套足以保护检查者。\n\n教学目标：艰难梭菌需要额外的接触预防措施，包括用肥皂和水洗手，在与患者接触时穿上隔离衣，以及非无菌手套。含酒精的手部消毒剂不能杀死细菌孢子。"
