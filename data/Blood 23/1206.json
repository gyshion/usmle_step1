  "explanation": {
    "en": "According to estimates by the American Cancer Society, the most common cancers (excluding basal and squamous cell skin cancer) in 2019 among women living in the United States are (by order of incidence) breast, lung, and colorectal cancer. Although BREAST CANCER has the HIGHEST INCIDENCE (268,600), its mortality is relatively low (41,760) due to early detection while the tumor is still localized. In contrast, the incidence of LUNG CANCER in women is lower (111,710), but its MORTALITY IS HIGHER (66,020), in part because lung cancer tends to be detected later and is less localized (Choice B). Lung cancer has emerged as the leading cause of cancer mortality in women.\n\n(Choices C and D) The incidence of ovarian (22,530) and cervical (13,170) cancers is much lower than that of the three cancers presented in the figure.\n\n(Choice E) The incidence (67,100) and mortality (23,380) of colorectal cancer are lower than that of either breast or lung cancer. {{exhibit_2}}",
