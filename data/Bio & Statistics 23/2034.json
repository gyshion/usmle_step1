  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient most likely has heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, an autosomal dominant LDL receptor defect that causes high LDL levels and increases the risk of premature atherosclerosis. Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (a rarer and more severe form of the disease due to inheritance of 2 defective LDL receptor alleles) often presents with coronary heart disease in childhood/adolescence.\n\nSouthern blotting is a technique that can be used to detect DNA mutations. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1.  DNA extraction from the individual's cells\n2.  Restriction endonuclease digestion of the DNA sample into fragments\n3.  Gel electrophoresis to separate the various sizes of DNA fragments; larger fragments move slowly and shorter fragments move faster\n4.  DNA probe (a single-stranded segment of labeled DNA complementary to the gene of interest) to identify the target gene\n\nOnce the gene of interest is identified by the DNA probe, various family members' Southern blots can be compared. Because both the patient and his father are affected, the common DNA segment between them (8 kb segment) most likely represents the mutated gene. The patient's son also has the 8 kb segment, meaning that he is probably affected as well.\n\n(Choice A) Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder. X-linked recessive mutations are transmitted from unaffected carrier mothers to their sons. Father-to-son transmission does not occur.\n\n(Choices B and D) The patient (affected by the disease) does not possess the 10 kb segment, so this segment does not correspond to the mutated gene. The patient's brother inherited the 10 kb segment from his father (not the 8kb mutated segment), so he would not be affected.\n\n(Choice C) The patient and his brother, but not their father, have a 12 kb segment on Southern blot analysis. Therefore, this segment was likely inherited from the mother and does not carry the mutation.\n\nEducational objective:\nSouthern blotting is a technique used to identify DNA mutations. It involves restriction endonuclease digestion of sample DNA, gel electrophoresis, and gene identification with a labeled DNA probe.",
    "zh": "该患者很可能患有杂合子家族性高胆固醇血症，这是一种常染色体显性LDL受体缺陷，导致LDL水平升高并增加过早动脉粥样硬化的风险。纯合子家族性高胆固醇血症（由于遗传了2个有缺陷的LDL受体等位基因，该病是一种罕见且更严重的疾病形式）通常在儿童/青少年时期表现为冠心病。\n\nSouthern印迹是一种可用于检测DNA突变的技术。该过程包括以下步骤：\n\n1. 从个体的细胞中提取DNA\n2. 用限制性内切酶消化DNA样本成片段\n3. 凝胶电泳分离各种大小的DNA片段；较大的片段移动较慢，较短的片段移动较快\n4. DNA探针（与感兴趣的基因互补的标记DNA的单链片段）以识别靶基因\n\n一旦通过DNA探针识别出感兴趣的基因，就可以比较各种家庭成员的Southern印迹。由于患者和他的父亲都受到影响，他们之间共同的DNA片段（8 kb片段）最有可能代表突变基因。患者的儿子也有8 kb片段，这意味着他可能也受到影响。\n\n(选项A) 家族性高胆固醇血症是一种常染色体显性遗传病。X连锁隐性突变从未受影响的携带者母亲传递给她们的儿子。不会发生父传子。\n\n(选项B和D) 患者（受该疾病影响）没有10 kb片段，因此该片段与突变基因不对应。患者的兄弟从他的父亲那里继承了10 kb片段（而不是8 kb突变片段），因此他不会受到影响。\n\n(选项C) 患者和他的兄弟，但他们的父亲没有，在Southern印迹分析中有一个12 kb片段。因此，该片段可能来自母亲，并且不携带突变。\n\n教育目标：\nSouthern印迹是一种用于识别DNA突变的技术。它涉及样本DNA的限制性内切酶消化、凝胶电泳和用标记的DNA探针进行基因鉴定。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of familial hypercholesterolemia, its inheritance pattern, and the interpretation of Southern blot results for genetic analysis. It assesses the ability to correlate the presence of a specific DNA fragment with the presence of the disease in different family members.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the affected individuals (patient and father) and look for a common DNA fragment between them. Then, check if the patient's son also has this fragment, indicating inheritance of the mutation. Eliminate options that contradict the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of familial hypercholesterolemia.",
