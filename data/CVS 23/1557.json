    "en": "A 53-year-old man comes to the office due to difficulty breathing and increasing fatigue. He has shortness of breath at night and has been sleeping in a recliner to help relieve his dyspnea. Medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Two months ago, the patient suffered a myocardial infarction that was not revascularized due to a delay in seeking treatment. He quit smoking afterward, but had previously smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years. On cardiac auscultation, a low-frequency diastolic heart sound is heard shortly after the second heart sound when the patient lies in the left lateral decubitus position. Cardiac imaging shows hypokinesis of the left ventricular free wall.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has decompensated heart failure (fatigue, dyspnea) with an audible S3, a low-frequency sound that occurs during early diastole, just after S2. An S3 is likely caused by reverberation of sound within the ventricular cavity during rapid PASSIVE VENTRICULAR FILLING.\n\nS3 can be a normal finding in healthy children and young adults; however, in patients age >40 it is considered abnormal and suggests VENTRICULAR VOLUME OVERLOAD or enlargement. It is often heard with aortic or mitral regurgitation or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (eg, dilated cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease). In this patient's case, imaging is consistent with left ventricular systolic dysfunction secondary to the patient's recent myocardial infarction.\n\nAn S3, and the other commonly heard LEFT VENTRICULAR GALLOP, S4 (caused by blood striking a stiff ventricular wall during atrial contraction at the end of diastole), are best heard with the bell of the stethoscope over the CARDIAC APEX while the patient is in the left lateral decubitus position. Listening at END EXPIRATION makes the sound even more audible by decreasing lung volume and bringing the heart closer to the chest wall.\n\n(Choices A, B, C, and E) Medications and maneuvers that decrease venous return to the heart reduce ventricular blood volume and are likely to lessen the intensity of an S3. Amyl nitrate inhalation causes dilation of venous capacitance veins to decrease venous return, furosemide injection causes brisk diuresis to reduce intravascular blood volume, standing causes blood to pool in the legs to reduce venous return, and Valsalva strain phase increases intrathoracic pressure to compress the vena cava and reduce venous return.\n\nEducational objective:\nAn S3 is a low-frequency sound occurring during early diastole, just after S2. Left ventricular gallops (S3 and S4) are best heard with the bell of the stethoscope over the cardiac apex while the patient is in the left lateral decubitus position at end expiration.",
    "zh": "该患者患有失代偿性心力衰竭（疲劳、呼吸困难），可听到S3，这是一种在舒张早期、S2之后发生的低频声音。S3可能由快速的被动心室充盈过程中心室腔内的声音共振引起。\n\nS3在健康儿童和年轻人中可能是正常发现；然而，在年龄>40岁的患者中，它被认为是异常的，提示心室容量超负荷或扩大。它通常见于主动脉或二尖瓣关闭不全，或射血分数降低的心力衰竭（例如，扩张型心肌病、缺血性心脏病）。在本例患者中，影像学检查结果与患者近期心肌梗死后继发左心室收缩功能障碍一致。\n\nS3和另一种常见的心室奔马律S4（由血液在舒张末期心房收缩时撞击僵硬的心室壁引起）最好用听诊器的钟形头在心脏尖端听诊，同时患者采取左侧卧位。在呼气末听诊通过减少肺容积，使心脏更靠近胸壁，使声音更清晰。\n\n（选项A、B、C和E）减少静脉回心的药物和操作会减少心室血容量，并可能减轻S3的强度。亚硝酸异戊酯吸入导致静脉容量静脉扩张，以减少静脉回流；呋塞米注射引起迅速的利尿作用，以减少血管内血容量；站立导致血液聚集在腿部，以减少静脉回流；而瓦尔萨瓦用力呼气阶段会增加胸腔内压力，以压迫腔静脉并减少静脉回流。\n\n教育目标：\nS3是一种在舒张早期、S2之后发生的低频声音。心室奔马律（S3和S4）最好用听诊器的钟形头在心脏尖端听诊，同时患者采取左侧卧位并在呼气末听诊。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of heart sounds, specifically the S3 gallop, and how different maneuvers affect its audibility. The question requires understanding the pathophysiology of S3 and how venous return influences its intensity.\n\nThe best approach is to recall that S3 is associated with increased ventricular volume and rapid filling. Maneuvers that increase venous return will accentuate the S3 sound, while those that decrease venous return will diminish it. Listening at end expiration brings the heart closer to the chest wall, making the sound more audible.",
    "zh": "本题考察对心音的了解，特别是S3奔马律，以及不同的操作如何影响其可听性。本题需要理解S3的病理生理学以及静脉回流如何影响其强度。\n\n最佳方法是回想起S3与心室容量增加和快速充盈有关。增加静脉回流的操作会增强S3音，而减少静脉回流的操作会减弱S3音。在呼气末听诊使心脏更靠近胸壁，使声音更清晰。"
