    "en": "A 59-year-old woman comes to the office due to recurrent facial pain for the past month. The pain occurs only on the left side. It starts just in front of the ear as a shock-like sensation that quickly radiates down the jaw over 4-8 seconds, then resolves. It is most commonly triggered by chewing, so the patient sometimes skips meals to avoid the pain. Vital signs are normal. The patient has lost 4.5 kg (10 lb) since she was last seen 6 months ago. Physical examination of the oral cavity shows no dental caries. Severe pain is reproduced with light touch of the left cheek. Neurologic examination is otherwise normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",
    "zh": "一位59岁的女性因过去一个月反复发作的面部疼痛来就诊。疼痛仅发生在左侧。它开始于耳前，是一种电击样感觉，迅速沿下颌向下放射，持续4-8秒，然后缓解。它最常由咀嚼触发，因此患者有时会跳过进餐以避免疼痛。生命体征正常。自她上次就诊6个月以来，患者体重减轻了4.5公斤（10磅）。口腔检查显示没有龋齿。轻触左颊会引起剧烈疼痛。神经系统检查其他方面均正常。以下哪项最可能是该患者病情的病因？"

    "en": "This patient's presentation is classic for TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA (TN). TN is characterized by paroxysmal, severe attacks of NEUROPATHIC pain, described as shock-like or stabbing, lasting a few seconds to 2 minutes. The pain is unilateral and typically involves the V2 and V3 distributions of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). It is often triggered by innocuous stimuli such as chewing, talking, brushing teeth, or light touch (ALLODYNIA). The patient's description of pain triggered by chewing and reproduced by light touch, along with the absence of other neurologic deficits, strongly supports the diagnosis of TN. The pathophysiology of TN is most commonly related to COMPRESSION of the trigeminal nerve root as it enters the pons, leading to demyelination and atrophy of the nerve. This compression is frequently caused by an ABERRANT VASCULAR LOOP (artery or vein). Other less common causes include neoplastic growth or a multiple sclerosis plaque.\n\n(Choice A) Inflammatory degradation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can lead to TMJ disorder, which often causes pain with jaw movement (eg, chewing). However, pain due to TMJ is classically dull and waxing and waning rather than neuropathic (eg, shock-like). Clicking/popping noises with jaw movement are common, as are ear-related symptoms (eg, ear pain, stuffiness, tinnitus). This patient's pain is described as shock-like and triggered by light touch, which is not typical for TMJ disorder.\n\n(Choice C) Reactivation of herpes zoster virus in a sensory ganglion can lead to HERPETIC NEURALGIA, which can impact CN V. Dermatomal pain can precede the development of the classic vesicular rash by several days. However, seconds-long paroxysms of pain triggered by eating and unaccompanied by a rash are more consistent with TN. While herpes zoster can cause postherpetic neuralgia, the acute presentation described here is less typical for this etiology without a preceding rash.\n\n(Choice D) Herpesvirus-mediated inflammatory demyelination may underlie the development of Bell palsy (idiopathic palsy of the facial nerve [CN VII]). However, this usually does not cause pain but instead results in unilateral facial weakness. In TN, demyelination and atrophy are due to compression of the nerve root, not typically a viral-mediated inflammatory process causing demyelination in the same way as seen in Bell palsy.\n\nEducational objective: Trigeminal neuralgia is caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) root as it enters the pons, usually by an abnormal vessel loop. This leads to atrophy and demyelination of the nerve and causes short paroxysms of neuropathic pain.",
    "zh": "该患者的表现是典型的三叉神经痛（TN）。TN的特征是阵发性、严重的神经病理性疼痛发作，表现为电击样或刺痛，持续几秒到2分钟。疼痛是单侧的，通常涉及三叉神经（CN V）的V2和V3分布。它常常被无害的刺激触发，例如咀嚼、说话、刷牙或轻触（痛觉过敏）。患者描述的由咀嚼触发并由轻触再现的疼痛，以及没有其他神经功能缺损，有力地支持了TN的诊断。TN的病理生理学最常见的是与三叉神经根进入脑桥时受压有关，导致神经脱髓鞘和萎缩。这种压迫常常是由异常血管袢（动脉或静脉）引起的。其他不太常见的原因包括肿瘤生长或多发性硬化斑块。\n\n（选项A）颞下颌关节（TMJ）的炎症性退变可导致TMJ紊乱，这通常会导致下颌运动（例如，咀嚼）时疼痛。然而，由TMJ引起的疼痛通常是钝痛，呈渐强渐弱，而不是神经病理性（例如，电击样）。下颌运动时出现咔哒/弹响声很常见，耳相关症状（例如，耳痛、闷胀、耳鸣）也很常见。该患者的疼痛被描述为电击样，并由轻触触发，这对于TMJ紊乱来说并不典型。\n\n（选项C）疱疹病毒在感觉神经节内的再激活可导致带状疱疹后神经痛，这会影响CN V。皮节性疼痛可能在典型水疱疹出现前几天发生。然而，由进食触发且无皮疹的数秒钟的阵发性疼痛更符合TN。虽然带状疱疹可引起带状疱疹后神经痛，但此处描述的急性表现对于这种病因来说不太典型，且没有先前的皮疹。\n\n（选项D）疱疹病毒介导的炎症性脱髓鞘可能促成贝尔氏麻痹（面神经[CN VII]特发性麻痹）的发生。然而，这通常不会引起疼痛，而是导致单侧面部无力。在TN中，脱髓鞘和萎缩是由于神经根受压引起的，通常不是病毒介导的炎症过程导致脱髓鞘，这与贝尔氏麻痹中的情况不同。\n\n教学目标：三叉神经痛是由三叉神经（CN V）根进入脑桥时受压引起的，通常由异常的血管袢引起。这会导致神经萎缩和脱髓鞘，并引起短暂的神经病理性疼痛发作。"
