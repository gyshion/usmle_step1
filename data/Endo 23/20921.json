  "explanation": {
    "en": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) is a serine protease that regulates the concentration of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) on the hepatocyte cell surface. Binding of PCSK9 to LDL-R causes increased lysosomal degradation of LDL-R, which leads to decreased uptake of circulating LDL into hepatocytes. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nPCSK9 inhibitors (eg, evolocumab, alirocumab) are monoclonal antibodies that inhibit binding of PCSK9 to LDL-R, which decreases LDL-R degradation and increases the concentration of LDL-R remaining on the cell surface. This results in greater uptake of LDL in the liver and lower circulating LDL levels.\n\nWhen statins are used to treat high LDL levels, circulating levels of PCSK9 are upregulated, suggesting that PCSK9 pathway inhibition may complement the LDL-lowering effect of statins. Therefore, PCSK9 inhibitors are indicated for high-risk patients who have persistently elevated LDL despite statin therapy; PCSK9 inhibitors reduce the risk of cardiovascular events (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke) in these patients.\n\n(Choice A) Statins (eg, atorvastatin) are the primary, first-line lipid-lowering agents for patients who have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or are at increased atherosclerotic risk. They decrease hepatocyte cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase.\n\n(Choice B) Ezetimibe is a lipid-lowering drug that directly inhibits absorption of cholesterol in the small intestine. PCSK9 inhibitors do not inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption.\n\n(Choice D) Insulin upregulates lipoprotein lipase, which hydrolyzes triglycerides in chylomicrons and VLDL; the liberated fatty acids are taken up in adipose tissue, leading to reduced plasma triglyceride levels. In contrast, PCSK9 inhibitors have little effect on triglycerides.\n\n(Choice E) Thyroid hormone increases expression of LDL-R, as does estrogen and various dietary factors (eg, low saturated fat diet). However, the increase in cell-surface LDL-R from PCSK9 inhibitors is due to decreased lysosomal degradation, not increased transcription (synthesis).\n\nEducational objective:\nBinding of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) on the hepatocyte cell surface increases degradation of LDL-R, leading to decreased uptake of circulating LDL. PCSK9 inhibitors (eg, evolocumab, alirocumab) decrease LDL-R degradation, resulting in greater uptake of LDL in the liver and lower circulating LDL levels.",
    "zh": "前蛋白转化酶枯草杆菌蛋白酶kexin 9 (PCSK9) 是一种丝氨酸蛋白酶，调节肝细胞表面低密度脂蛋白受体 (LDL-R) 的浓度。PCSK9 与 LDL-R 的结合会导致 LDL-R 的溶酶体降解增加，从而导致循环 LDL 进入肝细胞的摄取减少。{{exhibit_1}}\n\nPCSK9 抑制剂（例如，evolocumab、alirocumab）是单克隆抗体，可抑制 PCSK9 与 LDL-R 的结合，从而减少 LDL-R 的降解并增加残留在细胞表面的 LDL-R 的浓度。这会导致肝脏中 LDL 的摄取增加和循环 LDL 水平降低。\n\n当使用他汀类药物治疗高 LDL 水平时，PCSK9 的循环水平会上调，这表明 PCSK9 通路的抑制可能补充他汀类药物的降 LDL 作用。因此，对于尽管接受他汀类药物治疗但 LDL 持续升高的患者，PCSK9 抑制剂是适用的；PCSK9 抑制剂可降低这些患者发生心血管事件（例如，心肌梗死、卒中）的风险。\n\n（选项 A）他汀类药物（例如，阿托伐他汀）是主要的一线降脂药物，适用于患有动脉粥样硬化性心血管疾病或动脉粥样硬化风险增加的患者。它们通过抑制 HMG-CoA 还原酶来降低肝细胞胆固醇的合成。\n\n（选项 B）依泽替米贝是一种降脂药物，可直接抑制小肠中胆固醇的吸收。PCSK9 抑制剂不抑制肠道胆固醇吸收。\n\n（选项 D）胰岛素上调脂蛋白脂肪酶，脂蛋白脂肪酶水解乳糜微粒和 VLDL 中的甘油三酯；释放的脂肪酸被吸收到脂肪组织中，导致血浆甘油三酯水平降低。相比之下，PCSK9 抑制剂对甘油三酯的影响很小。\n\n（选项 E）甲状腺激素会增加 LDL-R 的表达，雌激素和各种饮食因素（例如，低饱和脂肪饮食）也会增加 LDL-R 的表达。然而，PCSK9 抑制剂引起的细胞表面 LDL-R 增加是由于溶酶体降解减少，而不是转录（合成）增加。\n\n教育目标：\n前蛋白转化酶枯草杆菌蛋白酶 9 (PCSK9) 与肝细胞表面的低密度脂蛋白受体 (LDL-R) 结合会增加 LDL-R 的降解，从而导致循环 LDL 的摄取减少。PCSK9 抑制剂（例如，evolocumab、alirocumab）可减少 LDL-R 的降解，从而导致肝脏中 LDL 的摄取增加和循环 LDL 水平降低。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of PCSK9 inhibitors, specifically how they affect LDL receptor degradation and LDL uptake in the liver. Understanding the role of PCSK9 in regulating LDL receptor levels is crucial for selecting appropriate lipid-lowering therapies.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that PCSK9 inhibitors prevent the degradation of LDL receptors, leading to increased LDL uptake by hepatocytes. This results in decreased LDL receptor lysosomal degradation and lower circulating LDL levels. Eliminate options that suggest increased degradation or effects on other lipid pathways.",
