    "en": "Molecular biologists undertake a series of experiments designed to classify proteins involved in various intracellular signaling pathways. During one of the experiments, a protein mixture obtained from a cell culture is separated by gel electrophoresis and subsequently transferred to a filter membrane. Labeled double-stranded DNA probes are then used to detect a specific protein of interest in the sample. Which of the following proteins is most likely to be detected by this method?",

    "en": "The Southern, Western, Northern, and Southwestern blot procedures are powerful techniques used to analyze and identify DNA fragments, proteins, mRNA, and DNA-bound proteins, respectively. The same basic technique underlies all of the blot procedures. First, the unknown sample is separated by gel electrophoresis. Separation occurs based on a molecule's size and charge. The separated molecules form bands on the gel that are then blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with a labeled probe to identify the specific DNA fragment, RNA molecule, or protein of interest.\n\nSouthwestern blots are used to identify and isolate proteins that bind DNA. In this technique, the target protein binds to a labeled, double-stranded DNA probe that is homologous to the protein's regulatory sequence. Of the molecules listed, c-Jun is the only DNA-binding protein. c-Jun and c-Fos are nuclear transcription factors that directly bind DNA via a leucine zipper motif. The genes that code for c-Jun and c-Fos are proto-oncogenes, genes that can become oncogenes following a mutation or with constitutive expression.\n\n(Choice A) Ras is a proto-oncogene that codes for a membrane-bound G-protein. This G-protein acts as a secondary mediator for several hormones and cytokines that act on cell membrane receptors. Ras activation activates the MAP kinase pathway and ultimately affects transcription. However, Ras itself does not bind directly to DNA.\n\n(Choices C and E) The β1-adrenergic receptor is a classic Gs-protein-coupled receptor located in the cell membrane. It does not interact directly with DNA. Adenylyl cyclase is the enzyme that cleaves ATP to form cAMP, the second messenger associated with Gs-protein-coupled receptors. cAMP activates protein kinase A for further downstream signaling.\n\n(Choice D) S-100 proteins are homodimeric calcium-binding proteins, similar in structure to calmodulin and important in intracellular functions such as protein phosphorylation and cell growth and differentiation. S-100 is a marker for cells of neural crest derivation (melanocytes and Schwann cells), as well as Langerhans cells and other dendritic cells.\n\nEducational objective:\nSouthwestern blotting is used to detect DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors, nucleases, and histones.",
    "zh": "Southern印迹、Western印迹、Northern印迹和Southwestern印迹程序是用于分别分析和鉴定DNA片段、蛋白质、mRNA和DNA结合蛋白的强大技术。所有印迹程序都基于相同的基本技术。首先，通过凝胶电泳分离未知样品。分离基于分子的尺寸和电荷。分离的分子在凝胶上形成条带，然后将条带转移到硝酸纤维素膜上，并与标记的探针一起孵育，以鉴定特定的DNA片段、RNA分子或感兴趣的蛋白质。\n\nSouthwestern印迹用于鉴定和分离与DNA结合的蛋白质。在这种技术中，靶蛋白与标记的双链DNA探针结合，该探针与该蛋白的调节序列同源。在列出的分子中，c-Jun是唯一一种DNA结合蛋白。c-Jun和c-Fos是核转录因子，通过亮氨酸拉链基序直接与DNA结合。编码c-Jun和c-Fos的基因是原癌基因，这些基因在突变后或组成型表达后可成为癌基因。\n\n(选项A) Ras是一种原癌基因，编码膜结合G蛋白。这种G蛋白充当作用于细胞膜受体的几种激素和细胞因子的二级介质。Ras激活激活MAP激酶通路，并最终影响转录。然而，Ras本身不直接与DNA结合。\n\n(选项C和E) β1-肾上腺素受体是一种经典的Gs蛋白偶联受体，位于细胞膜中。它不直接与DNA相互作用。腺苷酸环化酶是将ATP裂解形成cAMP的酶，cAMP是与Gs蛋白偶联受体相关的第二信使。cAMP激活蛋白激酶A，用于进一步的下游信号传导。\n\n(选项D) S-100蛋白是同源二聚体钙结合蛋白，其结构与钙调蛋白相似，在细胞内功能（如蛋白磷酸化以及细胞生长和分化）中很重要。S-100是神经嵴来源细胞（黑素细胞和许旺细胞）以及朗格汉斯细胞和其他树突状细胞的标志。\n\n教育目标：\nSouthwestern印迹用于检测DNA结合蛋白，如转录因子、核酸酶和组蛋白。"
