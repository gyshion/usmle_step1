  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's symptoms are consistent with **superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome**, a condition that develops when SVC obstruction impairs venous return from the head, neck, upper trunk, and upper extremities.\n\nThe SVC is formed by the union of the right and left brachiocephalic veins behind the right first costal cartilage and descends inferiorly for 6-8 cm before draining directly into the right atrium. During its course, the SVC is surrounded by multiple mediastinal structures (eg, trachea, right bronchus, aorta, right pulmonary artery) and is close to the perihilar and paratracheal lymph nodes.\n\nDue to its thin walls, the SVC can be easily compressed by mediastinal masses (most commonly malignancy) that either extend into the mediastinum from the central lung (eg, small cell lung cancer) or nearby lymph nodes (eg, non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Patients with SVC syndrome often experience the following symptoms due to increased venous pressure in the upper body:\n\n*   Face and neck swelling and conjunctival edema\n*   Distended veins due to increased collateral venous drainage\n*   Headache, dizziness, and/or confusion due to cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure\n*   Cough and/or dyspnea due to laryngeal edema and/or direct compression of adjacent structures (eg, trachea) by the mediastinal mass\n\n(Choices A and B) Airway obstruction and autoimmune disease can cause dyspnea, but facial swelling and dilated collateral veins would not be expected.\n\n(Choice C) Inappropriate secretion of ACTH can occur in small cell lung cancers and cause Cushing syndrome (eg, swollen or moon face due to fatty tissue deposition). However, Cushing syndrome is not associated with conjunctival edema or distended neck veins.\n\n(Choice E) Pericardial effusions can cause dyspnea and distended neck veins; however, facial swelling and headaches would not be expected. In addition, distant heart sounds or pulsus paradoxus (decrease in systolic blood pressure >10 mm Hg during inspiration) is often present.\n\n(Choice F) Patients with pleural effusions often have dyspnea but do not typically have facial swelling or dilated veins.\n\n(Choice G) Superior pulmonary sulcus tumors (Pancoast tumors) arise at the lung apex and are a relatively uncommon cause of SVC syndrome due to their more peripheral location within the lung. Most patients initially present with shoulder pain and other neurologic findings (eg, Horner syndrome, hand weakness) due to tumor invasion through the chest wall and involvement of adjacent structures (eg, brachial plexus).\n\nEducational objective:\nExtrinsic compression of the superior vena cava by a mediastinal mass (eg, malignancy) can cause superior vena cava syndrome, with impaired venous return from the upper body. Signs and symptoms include facial swelling, distended collateral veins, headache, and dyspnea. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}",
    "zh": "该患者的症状与**上腔静脉（SVC）综合征**一致，当SVC阻塞损害来自头部、颈部、上躯干和上肢的静脉回流时，就会发生这种病症。\n\nSVC由右侧和左侧头臂静脉在右侧第一肋软骨后方汇合而成，向下延伸6-8 cm，然后直接排入右心房。在其过程中，SVC被多个纵隔结构包围（例如，气管、右支气管、主动脉、右肺动脉），并且靠近肺门和气管旁淋巴结。\n\n由于其薄壁，SVC很容易被纵隔肿块（最常见的是恶性肿瘤）压迫，这些肿块要么从中央肺部（例如，小细胞肺癌）延伸到纵隔，要么来自附近的淋巴结（例如，非霍奇金淋巴瘤）。患有SVC综合征的患者通常由于上身静脉压升高而出现以下症状：\n\n*   面部和颈部肿胀及结膜水肿\n*   由于侧支静脉引流增加导致的静脉扩张\n*   由于脑水肿和颅内压升高引起的头痛、头晕和/或意识模糊\n*   由于喉水肿和/或纵隔肿块直接压迫邻近结构（例如，气管）引起的咳嗽和/或呼吸困难\n\n（选项A和B）气道阻塞和自身免疫性疾病可引起呼吸困难，但面部肿胀和静脉侧支扩张不常见。\n\n（选项C）小细胞肺癌中可发生ACTH分泌不当，引起库欣综合征（例如，由于脂肪组织沉积引起的脸部肿胀或满月脸）。然而，库欣综合征与结膜水肿或颈静脉扩张无关。\n\n（选项E）心包积液可引起呼吸困难和颈静脉扩张；然而，面部肿胀和头痛不常见。此外，通常存在心音遥远或奇脉（吸气时收缩压降低>10 mm Hg）。\n\n（选项F）胸腔积液患者通常有呼吸困难，但通常没有面部肿胀或静脉扩张。\n\n（选项G）肺上沟瘤（Pancoast肿瘤）起源于肺尖，由于其在肺内的位置更加外周，因此是SVC综合征的相对不常见原因。大多数患者最初表现为肩痛和其他神经系统表现（例如，霍纳综合征、手无力），这是由于肿瘤穿过胸壁并累及邻近结构（例如，臂丛神经）。\n\n教育目标：\n纵隔肿块（例如，恶性肿瘤）对上腔静脉的外部压迫可导致上腔静脉综合征，损害上身的静脉回流。体征和症状包括面部肿胀、静脉侧支扩张、头痛和呼吸困难。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, its etiology (typically mediastinal mass), and characteristic clinical presentation. The key is to recognize the constellation of symptoms: facial swelling, conjunctival edema, distended neck veins, headache, and dyspnea.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the physical exam findings of facial swelling, conjunctival edema, and dilated neck veins. These findings strongly suggest SVC syndrome, which is most commonly caused by a mediastinal mass compressing the superior vena cava.",
