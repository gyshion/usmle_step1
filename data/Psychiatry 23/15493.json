His mother is concerned about his recent reaction to her brother's death. \"Although I told him that Uncle John died and can't be with us anymore, he insists that he is coming for his birthday and will take him to a ballgame. He died over 3 months ago, but my son repeatedly asks me when he is coming back. When I try to explain, he starts crying that his stomach hurts.\" Physical examination is normal. During the examination he tells the physician, \"I try to clean up my toys before bedtime so mommy won't cry.\"",

    "en": "Bereavement reactions in children depend on the child's age. PRESCHOOL CHILDREN (age <6) may not understand the finality of death and can exhibit MAGICAL THINKING in which they fully expect that a dead person can come back to life. Younger children may also attribute events or other's reactions to something they did wrong due to an egocentric thought process (eg, this child believing that he causes his mother's crying). Death should be explained to them in concrete terms, and they should be reassured that other people's grief is not their fault.\n(Choice B) This child's reactions are age-appropriate. Complicated grief (also known as persistent complex bereavement disorder) is characterized by prolonged grief, excessive yearning for the deceased, and inability to move on with life.\n(Choice C) This boy's behavior (not understanding death) is appropriate for a 5-year-old; in contrast, children age ≥7 are typically aware that death is final.\n(Choice D) Post-traumatic stress disorder requires exposure to a life-threatening event that continues to be reexperienced in the form of flashbacks and nightmares. In preschool children this can be manifested by repetitive play about the event, frightening nightmares, and mood or behavioral changes (eg, temper tantrums, separation anxiety).\n(Choice E) Regression refers to returning to a former, less developed stage of development. It is often seen in response to traumatic or anxiety-provoking situations (eg, if this child started wetting the bed following a stressful event after having achieved continence previously).\n(Choice F) Children commonly develop somatic symptoms as a nonverbal expression of psychological distress. This child is not excessively focused on his stomachaches to the extent of impairment, as would be seen in somatic symptom disorder.\nEducational objective:\nPreschool children have not developed an understanding of the finality of death, which typically occurs around age 7. They may have magical thoughts that death is temporary or reversible and believe that other people's grief is their fault.",
    "zh": "儿童的悲伤反应取决于孩子的年龄。学龄前儿童（<6岁）可能不理解死亡的终结性，并且可能表现出魔幻思维，在这种思维中，他们完全期望死者可以复活。年幼的孩子也可能将事件或其他人的反应归因于他们做错的事情，这归因于以自我为中心的思维过程（例如，这个孩子认为他导致了他的母亲哭泣）。应该用具体的术语向他们解释死亡，并且应该向他们保证，别人的悲伤不是他们的错。\n(选项 B) 这个孩子的反应是符合年龄的。复杂性悲伤（也称为持续性复杂悲伤障碍）的特征是长时间的悲伤、对死者的过度渴望以及无法继续生活。\n(选项 C) 这个男孩的行为（不理解死亡）适合5岁的孩子；相比之下，7岁或以上的孩子通常意识到死亡是最终的。\n(选项 D) 创伤后应激障碍需要暴露于危及生命的事件中，这些事件会以闪回和噩梦的形式持续被重新体验。在学龄前儿童中，这可以通过重复玩有关该事件的活动、可怕的噩梦以及情绪或行为改变（例如，发脾气、分离焦虑）来表现。\n(选项 E) 退化是指回到以前、发育较差的阶段。通常在应对创伤性或引起焦虑的情况下可见（例如，如果这个孩子在经历压力事件后开始尿床，此前他已经实现了大小便控制）。\n(选项 F) 儿童通常会发展出躯体症状，作为心理困扰的非语言表达。这个孩子并没有过分关注他的腹痛到损害的程度，就像在躯体症状障碍中看到的那样。\n教育目标：\n学龄前儿童尚未理解死亡的终结性，这种情况通常发生在7岁左右。他们可能有一些魔幻的想法，认为死亡是暂时的或可逆的，并认为别人的悲伤是他们的错。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of age-appropriate grief reactions in preschool children following the death of a loved one. It specifically assesses the ability to differentiate normal developmental responses from pathological grief or other psychiatric conditions.\nTo solve this question, one must consider the developmental stage of a 5-year-old child and their cognitive understanding of death. Evaluating the child's statements and behaviors in the context of typical preschooler development is key to identifying age-appropriate reactions versus signs of complicated grief, PTSD, regression, or somatic symptom disorder.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对学龄前儿童在亲人去世后与年龄相符的悲伤反应的理解。它特别评估了区分正常发育反应与病理性悲伤或其他精神疾病的能力。\n要解决这个问题，必须考虑一个5岁儿童的发育阶段以及他们对死亡的认知理解。在典型的学龄前儿童发育的背景下评估孩子的陈述和行为是确定符合年龄的反应与复杂悲伤、PTSD、退化或躯体症状障碍的迹象的关键。"
