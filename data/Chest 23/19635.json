    "en": "An autopsy is performed on a 6-month-old girl who was born at 25 weeks gestation and died of respiratory complications. A sample of the patient's lung tissue is obtained, and histopathologic examination shows few, dilated alveoli with decreased septation. Alveolar capillaries are dysmorphic, and pulmonary arterioles have narrow lumina with thick, muscular walls. These findings are most consistent with which of the following conditions?",

    "en": "The patient's autopsy findings are consistent with BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA (BPD), or chronic lung disease of prematurity. The pathologic findings of BPD have evolved over time as advanced treatment modalities (eg, surfactant, noninvasive ventilation) have improved survival rates and reduced iatrogenic lung injury (eg, airway overdistension, oxygen toxicity).\n\nCurrently, BPD is primarily characterized by disrupted fetal lung development in the early saccular stage. During this stage, which begins at 26 weeks gestation and extends until birth, terminal sacs form and undergo septation, increasing the surface area for gas exchange. This period is also critical for the development and growth of a capillary network within the septa.\n\nCharacteristic histopathologic findings of BPD currently include:\n\n*   Few, dilated alveoli that have poor septation due to disrupted alveolarization. These malformed alveoli have decreased surface area for gas exchange, which manifests as respiratory distress in the neonatal period and a prolonged oxygen requirement.\n*   Dysmorphic alveolar capillaries due to impaired vasculogenesis, contributing to persistent hypoxia.\n\nPatients may also have thickening of the muscular layer of the pulmonary arterioles, which leads to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary hypertension.\n\n(Choice B) Congenital cystic acenomatoid malformation (ie, congenital pulmonary airway malformation) is an anomaly of the respiratory tract in which abnormal lung tissue forms a cystic mass. Histopathologic examination would likely show cystic areas (lined by ciliated columnar epithelium) surrounded by relatively normal alveoli.\n\n(Choice C) Neonatal pneumonia is most commonly bacterial, and a predominance of inflammatory cells with neutrophils within the alveoli would be seen on histopathologic examination.\n\n(Choice D) Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective chloride channel that allows viscous secretions to accumulate in the airways, predisposing patients to chronic inflammation and bronchiectasis. Thickened, dilated bronchi with mucus plugging would be seen.\n\n(Choice E) Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is characterized by surfactant accumulation within the alveoli due to impaired clearance by alveolar macrophages. Histopathologic findings would include granular, proteinaceous material within the alveoli with normal alveolar architecture. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "患者的尸检结果与支气管肺发育不良 (BPD) 或早产儿慢性肺病一致。BPD 的病理学发现随着时间的推移而演变，因为先进的治疗方式（例如，表面活性剂，无创通气）提高了生存率并减少了医源性肺损伤（例如，气道过度扩张，氧中毒）。\n\n目前，BPD 主要的特征是早期囊状期的胎儿肺发育受损。在此阶段，从妊娠26周开始，一直持续到出生，末端囊形成并进行间隔，增加了气体交换的表面积。这一时期对间隔内毛细血管网络的形成和生长也至关重要。\n\n目前，BPD 的特征性组织病理学发现包括：\n\n*   肺泡较少，扩张，由于肺泡化受损而导致间隔不良。这些畸形的肺泡的气体交换表面积减少，这表现为新生儿期的呼吸窘迫和对氧气的长期需求。\n*   由于血管生成受损导致的肺泡毛细血管发育不良，导致持续性缺氧。\n\n患者还可能出现肺小动脉肌肉层增厚，这会导致肺血管阻力增加和肺动脉高压。\n\n（选项 B）先天性囊性腺瘤样畸形（即，先天性肺气道畸形）是呼吸道的异常，其中异常肺组织形成囊性肿块。组织病理学检查可能会显示囊性区域（由纤毛柱状上皮细胞覆盖），周围环绕着相对正常的肺泡。\n\n（选项 C）新生儿肺炎最常见的是细菌性肺炎，组织病理学检查将观察到肺泡内以中性粒细胞为主的炎症细胞。\n\n（选项 D）囊性纤维化是由有缺陷的氯离子通道引起的，该通道允许粘稠的分泌物积聚在气道中，使患者易患慢性炎症和支气管扩张。将会观察到增厚、扩张的支气管，并有粘液栓塞。\n\n（选项 E）肺泡蛋白沉积症的特征是由于肺泡巨噬细胞清除受损而导致表面活性剂在肺泡内积聚。组织病理学发现将包括肺泡内颗粒状、含蛋白质的物质，具有正常的肺泡结构。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease affecting premature infants, focusing on its pathogenesis and histopathological features. It requires understanding the disrupted alveolar and vascular development during the saccular stage of lung development.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key histopathological findings of BPD: dilated alveoli with decreased septation and dysmorphic alveolar capillaries.
