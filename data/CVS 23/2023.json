    "en": "A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to shortness of breath, productive cough, and confusion. His wife mentions that last week he was diagnosed with the flu and his symptoms have progressively worsened. Temperature is 39.4 C (103 F), blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, pulse is 120/min, and respiratory rate is 22/min. Pulse oximetry shows 86% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is obtunded and in respiratory distress. He is intubated, given a 2-L bolus of normal saline, and started on broad spectrum antibiotics after blood cultures are obtained. A central line is placed to access a structure embryonically derived from the common cardinal veins. This structure is represented by which of the following labels shown in the chest CT scan below? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "Patients with hemodynamic instability or shock often have central lines placed into the central venous system to allow rapid infusion of intravenous fluids, blood, and vasopressors. The catheter is usually inserted into the neck (internal jugular vein) or chest (subclavian vein), and is advanced until the catheter tip enters the SUPERIOR VENA CAVA (SVC). The SVC is derived from the common cardinal veins. On CT scan imaging of the upper thorax, the SVC can be identified to the right of the heart, posterolateral to the ascending aorta, anterior to the right pulmonary artery, and just below the level of the carina.\n\nAll veins in the developing embryo ultimately drain into the sinus venosus, which drains into the primitive atrium of the developing heart. In early embryonic development, the body's veins fall into 3 main groups: umbilical, vitelline, and cardinal veins. The umbilical vein degenerates, the vitelline veins form the portal system, and the cardinal veins form constituents of the SYSTEMIC VENOUS CIRCULATION.\n\n(Choice B) The ascending aorta develops from the truncus arteriosus, which also gives rise to the pulmonary trunk. A portion of the aortic arch develops from the fourth branchial (pharyngeal) arch.\n\n(Choice C) The pulmonary trunk is derived from the truncus arteriosus. Neural crest cell migration helps partition the truncus arteriosus into the 2 great arteries (aorta and pulmonary artery) by causing fusion and twisting of the truncal and bulbar ridges. This process results in the normal spiral relation between the aorta and pulmonary artery. Failure of this process results in transposition of the great vessels and tetralogy of Fallot.\n\n(Choice D) The esophagus is embryologically derived from the endodermal foregut. In the thoracic cavity, it descends posterior to the trachea and anterior to the vertebrae.\n\n(Choice E) The descending aorta is derived from fusion of the embryonic right and left dorsal aortas. In the thoracic cavity, it starts left of the vertebral column and approaches the midline as it descends toward the diaphragm.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe common cardinal veins of the developing embryo drain directly into the sinus venosus. These cardinal veins ultimately give rise to the superior vena cava and other constituents of the systemic venous circulation.",
    "zh": "血流动力学不稳定或休克的患者通常会放置中心静脉导管进入中心静脉系统，以便快速输注静脉输液、血液和升压药。导管通常插入颈部（颈内静脉）或胸部（锁骨下静脉），并推进直至导管尖端进入上腔静脉（SVC）。上腔静脉源于共同主静脉。在胸部上部的CT扫描成像中，上腔静脉可以在心脏右侧、升主动脉后外侧、右肺动脉前以及隆突水平下方被识别。\n\n发育中的胚胎中的所有静脉最终都排入静脉窦，再排入发育中的心脏的原始心房。在胚胎早期发育中，身体的静脉分为3组：脐静脉、卵黄静脉和主静脉。脐静脉退化，卵黄静脉形成门静脉系统，主静脉形成体循环的组成部分。\n\n（选项B）升主动脉由动脉干发育而来，动脉干也产生肺动脉干。主动脉弓的一部分由第四鳃（咽）弓发育而来。\n\n（选项C）肺动脉干源自动脉干。神经嵴细胞迁移有助于将动脉干分成两条大动脉（主动脉和肺动脉），通过引起干和球部脊的融合和扭曲。此过程导致主动脉和肺动脉之间的正常螺旋关系。此过程的失败导致大血管转位和法洛四联症。\n\n（选项D）食管在胚胎学上源自内胚层前肠。在胸腔中，它位于气管后方，椎骨前方。\n\n（选项E）降主动脉源自胚胎右侧和左侧背主动脉的融合。在胸腔中，它从椎骨左侧开始，并随着它朝向膈肌下降而接近中线。\n\n教育目标：\n发育中胚胎的共同主静脉直接排入静脉窦。这些主静脉最终形成上腔静脉和体循环的其他组成部分。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the embryological origin of the superior vena cava and its anatomical location on a chest CT scan. It requires understanding the relationship between the common cardinal veins and the development of the systemic venous circulation.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the superior vena cava on the CT scan based on its location relative to the heart and great vessels. Recall that the superior vena cava is derived from the common cardinal veins during embryonic development.",
