    "en": "A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a routine physical examination and follow-up of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient appears irritated, and his mother begins the visit by exclaiming, \"Here's the doctor; he's going to tell you how badly you've been doing.\" Laboratory tests show a random blood glucose of 350 mg/dL and a hemoglobin A1c of 9% (normal: <6%-7%). When the physician asks the patient how he is doing with his insulin, the mother interrupts and shouts, \"He never remembers to use it!\" When the boy is asked about his diet, the mother puts her hands on her hips, glares at her son, and says, \"Pizza, soda, and candy!\" After acknowledging the mother's concerns regarding diabetic control, which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's type 1 diabetes mellitus is poorly managed on his current treatment regimen, as indicated by a random blood glucose >200 mg/dL and hemoglobin A1c of 9.0%. The physician is confronted by an angry, critical parent who does not allow the patient to speak. Continuing the visit in the presence of the patient's mother will likely lead to unproductive conflict or the patient pacifying his mother by agreeing with her or allowing her to continue to speak for him (Choice B).\n\nThe best course of action is to acknowledge the mother's concerns and politely ask her to wait outside while the physician speaks with the patient privately. This will allow the patient to be more open about his difficulty managing his diabetes and to discuss any personal concerns that may be having an impact. All adolescent visits should include an opportunity to interview the patient alone to discuss topics such as drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and sexual activity.\n\n(Choices A and C) Although this patient appears irritable and assessing his mood further is important, this should be done with the patient alone, where he can openly describe how he is feeling without his mother present. Although asking the mother if she has concerns about her son's mood may provide additional information, it is unlikely to give an accurate picture of his mood given the mother's angry frustration with his behavior.\n\n(Choice D) This statement is likely to be perceived as judgmental and to antagonize the mother, especially if it is delivered in front of the patient. A more productive approach is to speak with the patient privately and model appropriate behavior in joint discussions with the patient and mother.\n\nEducational objective:\nIn situations in which a parent's presence may interfere with obtaining honest answers from an adolescent patient, physicians should politely ask the parent to wait outside and interview the patient alone privately. All adolescent visits should include an opportunity to interview the patient alone to discuss topics such as drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and sexual activity.",
    "zh": "该患者目前的1型糖尿病治疗方案控制不佳，随机血糖>200 mg/dL，血红蛋白A1c为9.0%即可证明。医生面对的是一位愤怒、批评的家长，她不允许患者说话。在患者母亲在场的情况下继续就诊可能会导致无效的冲突，或者患者通过同意母亲的意见或允许她继续为他说话来安抚母亲（选项B）。\n\n最好的做法是承认母亲的担忧，并礼貌地请她在外面等待，同时医生与患者单独交谈。这将使患者能够更开放地谈论他在管理糖尿病方面的困难，并讨论任何可能产生影响的个人担忧。所有青少年就诊都应包括一个机会，单独面谈患者，讨论药物、酒精、烟草和性行为等话题。\n\n（选项 A 和 C）虽然该患者看起来很烦躁，进一步评估他的情绪很重要，但这应该与患者单独进行，在那里他可以公开描述他的感受，而无需他母亲在场。虽然询问母亲她是否对儿子的情绪有任何担忧可能会提供更多信息，但考虑到母亲对他的行为感到愤怒，这不太可能准确地反映他的情绪。\n\n（选项 D）这种说法很可能被认为是带有批判性的，并且会激怒母亲，特别是如果它是在患者面前说出的。一个更有成效的方法是与患者私下交谈，并在与患者和母亲的联合讨论中树立适当的行为榜样。\n\n教育目标：\n在父母在场可能妨碍从青少年患者那里获得诚实答案的情况下，医生应礼貌地请父母在外面等待并单独私下与患者面谈。所有青少年就诊都应包括一个机会，单独面谈患者，讨论药物、酒精、烟草和性行为等话题。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to manage an adolescent patient with poorly controlled diabetes in the presence of a critical and overbearing parent. It emphasizes the importance of establishing a private and confidential environment for adolescent patients to facilitate open communication.\n\nThe best approach is to acknowledge the parent's concerns but request to speak with the patient alone. This allows for a more honest and productive discussion about the patient's health and any potential issues they may be facing.",
