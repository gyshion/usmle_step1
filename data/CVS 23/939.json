    "en": "The diagram above depicts a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur, peaking in midsystole, characteristic of aortic or pulmonic stenosis. The most common cause of aortic stenosis (AS) in elderly patients (age ≥70) is degenerative calcification of the aortic valve leaflets. Calcific AS is caused by chronic hemodynamic stress or atherosclerotic inflammation that eventually leads to progressive aortic valve leaflet thickening, calcification, and stenosis. The murmur of valvular AS is best heard over the right second interspace (where the aorta leaves the base of the heart) with radiation to neck and carotid arteries. A longer and late-peaking murmur usually indicates severe AS, whereas a brief and early-peaking murmur indicates less severe stenosis. However, the intensity of the murmur does not correlate with the severity of stenosis.\n\n(Choice A) Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the axial skeleton characterized by progressive pain and stiffness of the spine, sacroiliitis, and increased risk of aortic regurgitation.\n\n(Choice B) Chordal rupture would lead to flail mitral leaflet with mitral valve prolapse and mitral regurgitation. Mitral regurgitation associated with chordal rupture would lead to a holosystolic decrescendo murmur.\n\n(Choice C) Coronary artery disease is not associated with a systolic murmur on auscultation.\n\n(Choice D) Cystic medial necrosis predisposes to the formation of thoracic aortic aneurysms with an increased risk of aortic dissection. It can also cause dilation of the aortic root leading to aortic regurgitation.\n\n(Choice E) Infectious endocarditis of the aortic or mitral valve typically causes aortic or mitral regurgitation, respectively. Aortic regurgitation leads to an early diastolic murmur, best heard over the lower left sternal border or right second interspace with the patient sitting and leaning forward with breath held in full expiration. Mitral regurgitation causes a holosystolic murmur best heard at the cardiac apex in the left lateral decubitus position.\n\n(Choice F) Rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause of AS in the developing world and is invariably accompanied by rheumatic mitral valve disease (mitral stenosis and/or regurgitation). It is an uncommon cause of AS in developed nations.\n\n(Choice G) Right ventricular failure leads to jugular venous distension, along with hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema. Significant right ventricular dilation can cause tricuspid insufficiency, which is characterized by a holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border.\n\nEducational objective: The murmur of valvular aortic stenosis is typically an ejection or midsystolic murmur of crescendo-decrescendo configuration with maximum intensity over the right second interspace and radiation to neck and carotid arteries. The most common cause of aortic stenosis in elderly patients (age ≥70) is degenerative calcification of the aortic valve leaflets.",
    "zh": "上图描述了一种逐渐增强后减弱的收缩期杂音，在中收缩期达到峰值，这是主动脉或肺动脉狭窄的特征。老年患者（年龄≥70岁）主动脉瓣狭窄（AS）最常见的原因是主动脉瓣叶的退行性钙化。钙化性AS是由慢性血流动力学应激或动脉粥样硬化性炎症引起的，最终导致主动脉瓣叶进行性增厚、钙化和狭窄。瓣膜性AS的杂音在右侧第二肋间隙（主动脉离开心脏底部的位置）听诊效果最佳，并向颈部和颈动脉放射。较长且晚达峰值的杂音通常表明AS严重，而短暂且早达峰值的杂音表明狭窄程度较轻。然而，杂音的强度与狭窄的严重程度无关。\n\n（选项A）强直性脊柱炎是一种慢性炎症性疾病，累及中轴骨骼，其特征是脊柱进行性疼痛和僵硬、骶髂关节炎以及主动脉瓣关闭不全的风险增加。\n\n（选项B）腱索断裂会导致二尖瓣脱垂和二尖瓣反流，引起二尖瓣关闭不全。与腱索断裂相关的二尖瓣反流会导致全收缩期减弱的杂音。\n\n（选项C）冠状动脉疾病与听诊时收缩期杂音无关。\n\n（选项D）囊性中膜坏死易于形成胸主动脉瘤，并增加主动脉夹层的风险。它也可以导致主动脉根部扩张，从而导致主动脉瓣关闭不全。\n\n（选项E）主动脉瓣或二尖瓣的感染性心内膜炎通常分别引起主动脉瓣或二尖瓣关闭不全。主动脉瓣关闭不全会导致早期舒张期杂音，在患者坐位和前倾位且完全呼气时，在左胸骨下缘或右侧第二肋间隙听诊效果最佳。二尖瓣反流引起的全收缩期杂音在左侧卧位的心尖处听诊效果最佳。\n\n（选项F）风湿性心脏病是发展中国家AS最常见的原因，并且总是伴有风湿性二尖瓣疾病（二尖瓣狭窄和/或反流）。它在发达国家中不常见。\n\n（选项G）右心衰竭会导致颈静脉扩张，以及肝大、腹水和周围水肿。明显的右心室扩张可引起三尖瓣关闭不全，其特征是在左胸骨下缘出现全收缩期杂音。\n\n教育目的：瓣膜性主动脉瓣狭窄的杂音通常是喷射或中收缩期杂音，呈增强-减弱型，最大强度在右侧第二肋间隙，并向颈部和颈动脉放射。老年患者（年龄≥70岁）主动脉瓣狭窄最常见的原因是主动脉瓣叶的退行性钙化。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of aortic stenosis, specifically its presentation as a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur and its common etiology in elderly patients. It also requires differentiating aortic stenosis from other cardiac conditions based on auscultation findings.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the murmur pattern described in the exhibit as characteristic of aortic stenosis. Consider the patient's age and the most common cause of aortic stenosis in this demographic, which is degenerative calcification.",
