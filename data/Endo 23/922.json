    "en": "A 1-hour-old boy in the newborn nursery is evaluated for jitteriness and irritability. The neonate was born by cesarean delivery due to arrest of the second stage of labor. The patient has not yet breastfed as his mother is still recovering from surgery. The mother's pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus; she was prescribed insulin but did not take it regularly. Birth weight is 4.5 kg (9 lb 15 oz). Cardiopulmonary examination is within normal limits. Serum glucose is 21 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this neonate's hypoglycemia?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Elevated maternal blood glucose leads to excessive transplacental transfer of glucose to the fetus, causing chronic stimulation of the fetal pancreas. This results in beta cell hyperplasia and hyperinsulinism. High levels of both fetal insulin (an anabolic hormone) and glucose promote development of fetal macrosomia with increased central adipose deposition.\n\nAfter delivery, the infant experiences a sudden interruption in transplacental glucose transfer, but the hyperinsulinism remains due to beta cell hyperplasia. This can result in rapid development of profound transient hypoglycemia. In most cases, supportive care only is needed as the beta cell hyperplasia will resolve over time.\n\n(Choice A) Insulin promotes blood glucose storage in the liver as glycogen; therefore, infants of mothers with poorly controlled diabetes have increased glycogen stores. However, after birth these infants have poor mobilization of glycogen stores (glycogenolysis) despite hypoglycemia due to high levels of insulin from islet hyperplasia.\n\n(Choice C) Fetal hyperglycemia may result in increased secretion of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) during gestation, contributing to fetal macrosomia; however, neonatal hypoglycemia is primarily caused by hyperinsulinemia that persists after birth.\n\n(Choice D) Growth hormone is released from the anterior pituitary gland and causes increased insulin resistance, decreasing peripheral uptake of glucose and elevating circulating glucose levels. Therefore, an increase in fetal growth hormone release would result in hyperglycemia.\n\n(Choice E) Maternal insulin is not transferred to the fetus but instead is catabolized by the placenta. It is the fetal pancreatic production of insulin that leads to transient neonatal hypoglycemia.\n\nEducational objective:\nMaternal hyperglycemia causes increased transplacental transfer of glucose to the infant, resulting in fetal hyperglycemia and subsequent pancreatic beta cell hyperplasia. The pancreatic beta cell hyperplasia causes hyperinsulinemia, leading to fetal macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycemia.",
    "zh": "母亲血糖升高导致葡萄糖过度经胎盘转移至胎儿，从而慢性刺激胎儿胰腺。这导致β细胞增生和高胰岛素血症。高水平的胎儿胰岛素（一种合成代谢激素）和葡萄糖促进胎儿巨大儿的形成，伴有中心性脂肪沉积增加。\n\n分娩后，婴儿经历了经胎盘葡萄糖转移的突然中断，但由于β细胞增生，高胰岛素血症仍然存在。这可能导致迅速发展为严重的短暂性低血糖症。在大多数情况下，只需要支持性护理，因为β细胞增生会随着时间的推移而消退。\n\n(选项A) 胰岛素促进血液葡萄糖以糖原的形式储存在肝脏中；因此，母亲糖尿病控制不佳的婴儿具有增加的糖原储存。然而，出生后，这些婴儿尽管出现低血糖症，但由于来自胰岛增生的胰岛素水平高，糖原储存的动员 (糖原分解) 较差。\n\n(选项C) 胎儿高血糖可能导致妊娠期间胰岛素样生长因子2 (IGF-2) 分泌增加，从而导致胎儿巨大儿；然而，新生儿低血糖症主要由出生后持续存在的高胰岛素血症引起。\n\n(选项D) 生长激素从垂体前叶释放，导致胰岛素抵抗增加，降低葡萄糖的外周摄取，并升高循环葡萄糖水平。因此，胎儿生长激素释放增加将导致高血糖症。\n\n(选项E) 母亲胰岛素不会转移到胎儿，而是被胎盘分解代谢。是胎儿胰腺产生胰岛素导致短暂的新生儿低血糖症。\n\n教育目标：母亲高血糖导致葡萄糖过度经胎盘转移至婴儿，导致胎儿高血糖症，随后发生胰腺β细胞增生。胰腺β细胞增生导致高胰岛素血症，进而导致胎儿巨大儿和新生儿低血糖症。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of neonatal hypoglycemia in infants of mothers with gestational diabetes, specifically the pathophysiology of fetal pancreatic beta cell hyperplasia and hyperinsulinism. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the history of gestational diabetes with poor maternal insulin adherence, leading to fetal hyperglycemia and subsequent hyperinsulinism. After delivery, the abrupt cessation of glucose transfer results in hypoglycemia due to the persistent hyperinsulinemia.",
