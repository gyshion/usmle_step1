    "en": "A 62-year-old man with diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia comes to the emergency department of an academic medical center with chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis. An electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevation in the anterior leads, and cardiac enzymes are markedly elevated. Investigators at the center are designing a randomized control trial to test the hypothesis that drug B will decrease the mortality associated with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction compared to standard of care. To ensure that investigators will not miss a difference between drug B and standard of care (if a difference truly exists), which of the following would they want to maximize?",

    "en": "Statistical power, (1 – β), represents a study's ability to detect a difference when one exists. It is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is truly false - ie, the probability of finding a true relationship. Power depends on sample size and the difference in outcome between the groups being tested. In this study, the researchers want to detect a difference between drug B and standard of care if one exists; they want to maximize power.\n\nβ is the probability of committing a Type II error (Choices B and D). Type II error occurs when researchers fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is truly false. This causes investigators to miss true relationships. An example of a type II error would be a study finding that aspirin does not affect platelet function when, in fact, it does. Therefore, if β is set at 0.2, the power will be (1 – β) = 80%; there will be an 80% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is truly false.\n\n(Choices A and C) Type I error occurs when researchers reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is really true. That is, a study finds a statistically significant difference between 2 groups when one does not truly exist. An example would be if a study concluded that candy improves heart failure mortality when, in fact, it does not. α is the maximum probability of making a type I error that a researcher is willing to accept. Generally, α is compared to the p-value, the probability of observing a given result (or more extreme) due to chance alone assuming the null hypothesis is true (eg, if there is no real difference between the groups). The value of α is typically set at 0.05, meaning that researchers are willing to accept up to a 5% chance of making a type I error. In such a scenario, if p <0.05, the result is said to be statistically significant.\n\nEducational objective:\nPower (1 – β) is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is truly false. It is typically set at 80% and depends on sample size and difference between outcomes.",
    "zh": "统计功效，(1 – β)，代表一项研究在存在差异时检测差异的能力。它是在原假设确实为假时拒绝原假设的概率，即找到真实关系的概率。功效取决于样本量和被测试组之间的结果差异。在这项研究中，如果存在差异，研究人员希望检测到药物B和标准护理之间的差异；他们希望最大化功效。\n\nβ是犯II型错误的概率（选项B和D）。当原假设确实为假时，研究人员未能拒绝原假设时，就会发生II型错误。这会导致研究人员错过真实的关系。II型错误的一个例子是，一项研究发现阿司匹林不影响血小板功能，但实际上它确实影响。因此，如果β设定为0.2，则功效将为(1 – β) = 80%；将有80%的概率在原假设确实为假时拒绝原假设。\n\n（选项A和C）当原假设实际上为真时，研究人员拒绝原假设时，就会发生I型错误。也就是说，一项研究发现了2个组之间的统计学上显著的差异，而实际上并不存在这种差异。一个例子是，一项研究得出结论认为糖果可以改善心力衰竭死亡率，但实际上并非如此。α是研究人员愿意接受的犯I型错误的最大概率。通常，α与p值进行比较，p值是由于纯粹的偶然性（假设原假设为真，例如，组之间没有真正的差异）而观察到给定结果（或更极端的结果）的概率。α的值通常设置为0.05，这意味着研究人员愿意接受最多5%的犯I型错误的概率。在这种情况下，如果p <0.05，则该结果被称为具有统计学意义。\n\n教育目标：\n功效(1 – β)是在原假设确实为假时拒绝原假设的概率。它通常设置为80%，并取决于样本量和结果之间的差异。"
