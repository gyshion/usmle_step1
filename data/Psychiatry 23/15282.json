    "en": "A 10-year-old boy is brought to the office due to poor grades and behavioral problems. Although the patient is very intelligent, his parents report that he struggles at school and has received failing grades because he is easily distracted, makes careless mistakes, and often loses his homework. His teacher has called several times to report that he repeatedly disrupts the class by getting out of his seat and by blurting out answers when he is not called on. At home, the patient does not listen to his parents, does not clean up after himself, and fails to complete chores despite repeated redirection. He has no other medical conditions. Family history is significant for a substance use disorder in the patient's 16-year-old brother and depression in his mother. Treatment options are discussed with the parents. They would like to try medication but prefer a nonstimulant option. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's inattentiveness and hyperactivity (eg, being distractible, making careless mistakes, losing things, not listening, struggling with organization, becoming sidetracked with chores, struggling to remain seated, blurting out answers) are consistent with ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER.\n\nAlthough stimulants (eg, dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate) are commonly used for ADHD due to their rapid onset and larger treatment effect size, they have the potential for misuse (Choices F and H). For patients who do not want a stimulant, nonstimulant options, including norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (eg, atomoxetine, viloxazine) or alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (eg, clonidine, guanfacine), are available. ATOMOXETINE is a first-line nonstimulant alternative that lacks abuse potential and is not a controlled substance.\n\n(Choice A) The benzodiazepine alprazolam has abuse potential and is not effective in treating ADHD.\n(Choices B and E) Tricyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline) and norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (eg, bupropion) are not first-line agents in the treatment of ADHD; they are sometimes used for refractory cases.\n(Choice C) Aripiprazole is a second-generation antipsychotic that has no role in the treatment of ADHD.\n(Choice G) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, fluoxetine) have no benefit in the treatment of ADHD.\n\nEducational objective: Atomoxetine is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that can be considered as an alternate to stimulants in the treatment of patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder who have a personal or family history of substance abuse.",
    "zh": "该患者的不专心和多动症（例如，容易分心、粗心犯错、丢失物品、不听话、组织能力差、被家务分心、难以保持坐姿、脱口而出答案）与注意缺陷多动障碍 (ADHD) 一致。\n\n尽管兴奋剂（例如，右旋苯丙胺、哌甲酯）由于起效快且治疗效果更大，常用于治疗 ADHD，但它们有被滥用的潜力（选项 F 和 H）。对于不希望使用兴奋剂的患者，可以使用非兴奋剂类药物，包括去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂（例如，托莫西汀、维洛沙嗪）或 α-2 肾上腺素能受体激动剂（例如，可乐定、胍法辛）。托莫西汀是一种一线非兴奋剂替代药物，无滥用潜力，也不是管制药物。\n\n（选项 A）苯二氮卓类药物阿普唑仑具有滥用潜力，且对治疗 ADHD 无效。\n（选项 B 和 E）三环类抗抑郁药（例如，阿米替林）和去甲肾上腺素和多巴胺再摄取抑制剂（例如，安非他酮）不是治疗 ADHD 的一线药物；它们有时用于难治性病例。\n（选项 C）阿立哌唑是一种第二代抗精神病药，在治疗 ADHD 方面没有作用。\n（选项 G）选择性 5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（例如，氟西汀）对治疗 ADHD 无益。\n\n教育目标：托莫西汀是一种去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂，可以被视为兴奋剂的替代药物，用于治疗有物质滥用个人史或家族史的注意缺陷多动障碍患者。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of pharmacotherapy options for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), particularly in the context of a patient with a family history of substance use disorder who prefers a nonstimulant medication.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the diagnosis of ADHD based on the clinical vignette, recognizing the patient's preference for a nonstimulant due to family history, and then selecting the most appropriate first-line nonstimulant medication from the given options, considering its efficacy, safety profile, and abuse potential.",
