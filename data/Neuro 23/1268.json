    "en": "A 21-year-old man comes to the clinic due to weakness and gait disturbance. For the past few months, he has noticed difficulty opening the lids on jars, along with trouble releasing his grip afterward. The patient has also tripped and fallen several times, particularly when walking up stairs. He has no known chronic medical conditions and takes no medications. Vital signs are normal. The patient has male pattern baldness. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. The abdomen is soft with no organomegaly. A muscle biopsy shows muscle atrophy involving mostly type 1 fibers {{exhibit_1}}. This patient most likely has a form of which of the following neuromuscular diseases?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has distal muscle weakness (eg, difficulty opening jar lids) with delayed muscle relaxation after contraction (myotonia), key features of **myotonic dystrophy** (DM).\n\nDM is an autosomal dominant muscular dystrophy caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the *DMPK* gene, which is then transcribed into **mutant mRNA**. The mutant mRNA is untranslatable and **toxic** to the expression of other genes, particularly those related to skeletal muscle chloride channels, resulting in **myotonia**. Grip myotonia is classic and characterized by impaired muscle relaxation after voluntary release of a contracted hand.\n\nThe toxic mRNA also affects T tubules, which usually facilitate synchronized release of calcium ions for organized muscle contraction, resulting in weakness due to impaired excitation-contraction coupling. **Weakness** classically involves the **face** (eg, long, narrow face with sagging) and **distal skeletal muscles**. This patient's recent falls are likely due to footdrop, but quadriceps involvement can occasionally occur and may be contributing to his difficulty walking up stairs. Muscular atrophy in DM preferentially affects the **type I (slow-twitch) fibers**, as seen on this patient's muscle biopsy {{exhibit_2}}.\n\nOther common features of DM include cataracts, Insulin resistance, and early-onset frontal balding.\n\n(Choice A) Inflammatory myopathies (eg, dermatomyositis, polymyositis) present with symmetric proximal muscle weakness without myotonia. In addition, inflammatory cell infiltration is seen on muscle biopsy.\n\n(Choice B) Certain ion channel myopathies can manifest with myotonia, but those that do so are associated with muscle hypertrophy (not atrophy) due to muscle overactivity. In contrast, the genetic defects causing muscular dystrophy result in progressive muscle damage that leads to atrophy of muscle fibers.\n\n(Choice C) Mitochondrial myopathies are characterized by varying degrees of muscle weakness, typically presenting in infancy or early childhood with multisystem involvement (eg, seizures). In addition, ragged red fibers (due to bright red mitochondrial bundles) are classically seen on muscle biopsy.\n\n(Choice D) Motor neuron disease (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is characterized by progressive nerve degeneration, resulting in skeletal muscle weakness. Muscle wasting and a weak grip are common, but impaired muscle relaxation does not occur.\n\n(Choice F) Myasthenia gravis, caused by postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor antibodies, is the most common neuromuscular junction disorder and presents with proximal muscle weakness. However, the weakness is fluctuating and fatigable, and hand weakness and relaxation impairment would not be expected.",
    "zh": "这位患者有远端肌无力（例如，难以打开罐子盖）和收缩后肌肉松弛延迟（肌强直），这是 **肌强直性营养不良** (DM) 的关键特征。\n\nDM 是一种常染色体显性遗传的肌营养不良，由 *DMPK* 基因中的三核苷酸重复序列扩张引起，然后转录成 **突变 mRNA**。 突变 mRNA 无法翻译，并且对其他基因的表达具有 **毒性**，特别是那些与骨骼肌氯离子通道相关的基因，从而导致 **肌强直**。 握力肌强直是典型的，其特征是收缩的手自愿松开后肌肉松弛受损。\n\n有毒的 mRNA 也会影响 T 小管，T 小管通常促进钙离子的同步释放，以进行有组织的肌肉收缩，导致由于兴奋-收缩偶联受损而导致的无力。 **无力** 经典地涉及 **面部**（例如，长而窄的脸部下垂）和 **远端骨骼肌**。 这位患者最近的摔倒可能是由于足下垂，但股四头肌受累有时也可能发生，并且可能导致他难以爬楼梯。 在 DM 中，肌肉萎缩优先影响 **I 型（慢肌）纤维**，如这位患者的肌肉活检所示 {{exhibit_2}}。\n\nDM 的其他常见特征包括白内障、胰岛素抵抗和早发性额秃。\n\n（选项 A）炎性肌病（例如，皮肌炎、多发性肌炎）表现为对称性近端肌无力，无肌强直。此外，在肌肉活检中可见炎性细胞浸润。\n\n（选项 B）某些离子通道肌病可表现为肌强直，但那些表现为肌强直的疾病与肌肉肥大（而非萎缩）有关，这是由于肌肉过度活动所致。 相比之下，导致肌营养不良的基因缺陷会导致进行性肌肉损伤，进而导致肌纤维萎缩。\n\n（选项 C）线粒体肌病的特征是不同程度的肌无力，通常在婴儿期或幼儿期出现，伴有多系统受累（例如，癫痫发作）。此外，在肌肉活检中通常可见粗糙的红色纤维（由于明亮的红色线粒体束）。\n\n（选项 D）运动神经元疾病（例如，肌萎缩侧索硬化症）的特征是进行性神经变性，导致骨骼肌无力。 肌肉消瘦和握力减弱很常见，但不会发生肌肉松弛受损。\n\n（选项 F）重症肌无力，由突触后乙酰胆碱受体抗体引起，是最常见的神经肌肉接头疾病，表现为近端肌无力。 然而，无力是波动的和易疲劳的，并且不应预期出现手部无力和松弛障碍。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of myotonic dystrophy, including its clinical presentation (distal weakness, myotonia, facial weakness, male pattern baldness), inheritance pattern (autosomal dominant), and underlying pathophysiology (trinucleotide repeat expansion in the DMPK gene). It also requires differentiating myotonic dystrophy from other neuromuscular disorders based on clinical and pathological findings.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of myotonic dystrophy in the vignette: distal weakness, grip myotonia, and type 1 fiber atrophy on muscle biopsy. Consider the patient's age and additional findings like male pattern baldness. Rule out other neuromuscular disorders based on their distinct clinical and pathological characteristics.",
