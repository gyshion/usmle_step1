    "en": "A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to persistent abdominal pain. Yesterday, during a soccer game, he collided with another player while running at full speed. The patient had abdominal pain at the time but did not seek care until this morning when the pain seemed to worsen. It is suspected that he has an injury involving an organ that is supplied by an artery of the foregut although the organ itself is not a foregut derivative. Which of the following organs is most likely to be injured in this patient? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "Organ damage from blunt abdominal trauma (eg, collision while running at full speed) most commonly involves the spleen and liver and less commonly the kidneys. In this case, the affected organ is the spleen. The spleen is an intraperitoneal organ derived from the mesoderm of the dorsal mesentery. However, the spleen is unique in that its blood supply originates from a foregut derivative (the splenic artery from the celiac trunk). Venous return from the spleen courses through the splenic vein to the portal circulation rather than to the systemic circulation.\n\nBy convention, CT scans are presented such that the patient's left is on the reader's right (imagine that the patient is supine with the feet directed toward the viewer). This patient's cross-sectional image represents a relatively caudal (lower) abdominal view that includes the kidneys; therefore, only the tail of the spleen is visible {{exhibit_2}}.\n\n(Choices A and D) The liver and pancreas are endoderm-derived structures of the foregut and both receive arterial blood supply from branches of the celiac trunk: the proper hepatic artery supplies the liver and the superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries supply the pancreas.\n\n(Choice B) Like the spleen, the kidneys are derived from the mesoderm. However, the kidneys are retroperitoneal and supplied by the renal arteries (from the abdominal aorta), which do not perfuse the foregut.\n\n(Choice C) The first two-thirds of the transverse colon is derived from the midgut and supplied by the superior mesenteric artery. The last one-third of the transverse colon arises from the hindgut and is supplied by branches of the inferior mesenteric artery.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe spleen is of mesodermal origin (dorsal mesentery), but its blood supply (splenic artery) is derived from the major foregut vessel, the celiac trunk. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "钝性腹部外伤造成的器官损伤（例如，以全速奔跑时发生碰撞）最常见的是脾脏和肝脏，其次是肾脏。在这种情况下，受影响的器官是脾脏。脾脏是腹膜内器官，源自背侧肠系膜的间质。然而，脾脏的独特之处在于其血液供应来自前肠衍生物（来自腹腔干的脾动脉）。来自脾脏的静脉回流通过脾静脉进入门静脉循环，而不是体循环。\n\n按照惯例，CT扫描的呈现方式是患者的左侧在读者的右侧（想象患者仰卧，双脚朝向观看者）。该患者的横断面图像代表一个相对尾侧（较低）的腹部视图，包括肾脏；因此，只有脾脏的尾部可见 {{exhibit_2}}。\n\n（选项A和D）肝脏和胰腺是前肠的内胚层衍生物，并且都接收来自腹腔干分支的动脉供血：肝固有动脉为肝脏供血，胰十二指肠上动脉和下动脉为胰腺供血。\n\n（选项B）像脾脏一样，肾脏也源自间质。然而，肾脏是腹膜后器官，由肾动脉（来自腹主动脉）供血，肾动脉不灌注前肠。\n\n（选项C）横结肠的前三分之二源自中肠，并由肠系膜上动脉供血。横结肠的最后三分之一来自后肠，并由肠系膜下动脉的分支供血。\n\n教育目标：\n脾脏起源于间质（背侧肠系膜），但其血液供应（脾动脉）来自前肠的主要血管，即腹腔干。 {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the embryological origin and blood supply of abdominal organs, specifically the spleen, and how this relates to blunt abdominal trauma. It also tests the ability to interpret CT scan images.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that the spleen is derived from mesoderm but receives its blood supply from the celiac trunk (a foregut derivative). Consider the mechanism of injury and the relative frequency of organ damage in blunt abdominal trauma.",
    "zh": "本题测试对腹部器官（特别是脾脏）的胚胎学起源和血液供应的知识，以及这与钝性腹部外伤的关系。它还测试了解释CT扫描图像的能力。\n\n要解决这个问题，请记住脾脏源自间质，但其血液供应来自腹腔干（前肠衍生物）。考虑损伤的机制以及钝性腹部外伤中器官损伤的相对频率。"
