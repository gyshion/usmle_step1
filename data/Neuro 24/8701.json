    "en": "A 59-year-old man comes to the office due to diplopia and a drooping right eyelid. His symptoms began a day earlier and have since worsened. Physical examination shows a dilated right pupil that is nonreactive to both light and accommodation. There is vertical and horizontal diplopia. When the patient is asked to stare straight ahead, the right eye is directed inferiorly and laterally with respect to the left eye. MRI of the brain reveals an aneurysm involving the right posterior communicating artery.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a right oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy secondary to a compressive aneurysm. Lesions involving CN III cause ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid) and impair adduction, depression, and elevation of the eye. As a result, diagonal (eg, horizontal and vertical) diplopia is frequently present. The eye rests in a \"down and out\" position due to the unopposed action of the superior oblique (CN IV) and lateral rectus (CN VI) muscles. Pupillary constriction and accommodation can also be affected as CN III carries parasympathetic fibers to the ciliary muscle and the iris sphincter.\n\nCN III palsy can be due to a variety of causes, including intracranial tumors or aneurysms, nerve ischemia, and head trauma. Aneurysms causing CN III palsy most often involve the posterior communicating artery. When due to an aneurysm, symptoms that develop acutely are especially worrisome as they suggest active aneurysmal dilation and possible impending rupture.\n\n(Choices A, B, D, E, and F) All of these muscles are innervated by CN III, so their function will be impaired in this patient.\n\nEducational objective:\nLesions involving the oculomotor nerve (CN III) cause ptosis, a downward and laterally deviated eye, impaired pupillary constriction and accommodation, and diagonal diplopia. The most dreaded cause of CN III palsy is an enlarging intracranial aneurysm.",
    "zh": "该患者患有继发于压迫性动脉瘤的右侧动眼神经（CN III）麻痹。涉及CN III的病变会导致上睑下垂（上眼睑下垂），并损害眼睛的内收、下压和上抬。因此，经常出现对角（例如，水平和垂直）复视。由于上斜肌（CN IV）和外直肌（CN VI）的对抗作用，眼睛处于“向下和向外”的位置。瞳孔收缩和调节也可能受到影响，因为CN III携带副交感神经纤维到睫状肌和虹膜括约肌。\n\nCN III麻痹可由多种原因引起，包括颅内肿瘤或动脉瘤、神经缺血和头部外伤。导致CN III麻痹的动脉瘤最常累及后交通动脉。当由于动脉瘤引起时，急性出现的症状尤其令人担忧，因为它们提示主动的动脉瘤扩张和可能即将破裂。\n\n（选项A、B、D、E和F）所有这些肌肉都由CN III支配，因此它们的功能将在此患者中受损。\n\n教育目标：\n涉及动眼神经（CN III）的病变会导致上睑下垂、眼睛向下和向外偏斜、瞳孔收缩和调节受损以及对角复视。CN III麻痹最可怕的原因是扩大的颅内动脉瘤。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy, its common causes, and the specific eye muscles innervated by CN III. It requires correlating clinical findings such as ptosis, pupillary abnormalities, and eye movement deficits with the underlying neurological lesion, specifically an aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the affected cranial nerve based on the constellation of symptoms (ptosis, dilated pupil, \"down and out\" eye position). Then, recall the muscles innervated by that nerve and their functions. The question asks which muscle is *least* likely to be affected, implying it is innervated by a different cranial nerve. The presence of an aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery strongly points to CN III involvement.",
    "zh": "此问题测试对动眼神经（CN III）麻痹的理解、其常见病因以及CN III支配的特定眼部肌肉。它需要将临床发现（如上睑下垂、瞳孔异常和眼球运动缺陷）与潜在的神经系统病变相关联，特别是后交通动脉的动脉瘤。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须首先根据症状的组合（上睑下垂、瞳孔散大、“向下和向外”的眼位）确定受影响的颅神经。然后，回忆由该神经支配的肌肉及其功能。这个问题询问哪个肌肉*最不可能*受到影响，这意味着它由不同的颅神经支配。后交通动脉动脉瘤的存在强烈指向CN III的参与。"
