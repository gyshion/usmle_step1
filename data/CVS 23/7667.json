  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's bilateral hippocampal necrosis is characteristic of the effects of global cerebral ischemia due to systemic hypotension. The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable during shock because of the high metabolic demand of its CA1 pyramidal neurons. Watershed areas located between the distal terminal branches of 2 different vascular territories (border zones) are also susceptible to ischemia because they have a low baseline perfusion pressure and poorly tolerate sustained decreases in systemic blood pressure.\n\nImportant watershed areas in the body include:\n\n*   Gastrointestinal (colon)\n    *   Splenic flexure: the border zone supplied by branches of the superior mesenteric artery and inferior mesenteric artery {{exhibit_1}}\n    *   Rectosigmoid junction: the border zone supplied by the sigmoid arteries and the superior rectal arteries\n*   Brain: the borders of the areas supplied by the anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and posterior cerebral artery\n\n(Choices A, B, C, and D) The ascending colon, cecum, hepatic flexure, and ileocolic junction are well perfused by the superior mesenteric artery and do not lie in watershed areas.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nSevere systemic hypotension (eg, shock) is most likely to cause ischemia first in areas of high metabolic demand (eg, hippocampus) or watershed zones, which are areas that are supplied by the distal branches of two different major arteries. Commonly affected areas in the colon include the splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction.",
    "zh": "该患者的双侧海马坏死是全身低血压引起的整体脑缺血的特征。海马在休克期间特别脆弱，因为它对CA1锥体神经元的新陈代谢需求量很高。位于两个不同血管区域（边界区）的远端末梢分支之间的分水岭区域也容易发生缺血，因为它们具有较低的基线灌注压力，并且对持续降低的全身血压耐受性差。\n\n重要的体内分水岭区域包括：\n\n*   胃肠道（结肠）\n    *   脾曲：由肠系膜上动脉和肠系膜下动脉的分支供血的边界区 {{exhibit_1}}\n    *   直乙状结肠交界处：由乙状结肠动脉和直肠上动脉供血的边界区\n*   大脑：由大脑前动脉、大脑中动脉和大脑后动脉供血的区域的边界\n\n（选项 A、B、C 和 D）升结肠、盲肠、肝曲和回盲部由肠系膜上动脉充分灌注，不位于分水岭区域。\n\n教育目标：\n\n严重的全身低血压（例如，休克）最有可能首先导致代谢需求高的区域（例如，海马）或分水岭区域发生缺血，这些区域由两条不同主要动脉的远端分支供血。结肠中常受影响的区域包括脾曲和直乙状结肠交界处。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of watershed areas and their susceptibility to ischemia during systemic hypotension. It requires understanding the vascular supply of the colon and identifying areas at risk during periods of low perfusion.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that watershed areas are most vulnerable to ischemia. Recall the important watershed areas in the colon (splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction) and their arterial supply. Eliminate options that are well-perfused and not located in watershed zones.",
