  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has otalgia in the setting of a normal ear examination, which is likely referred pain (pain perceived at a different site than its true origin). Further evaluation shows an ulcerative mass in the hypopharynx with an enlarged lymph node, which is consistent with mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).\n\nMany sources of pain in the head and neck can be referred to the ear because several cranial nerves also innervate parts of the ear. Common causes of referred ear pain include temporomandibular joint disease, dental disease, or cancer affecting the tongue base, hypopharynx, or larynx.\n\nThis patient's referred otalgia is most likely due to his hypopharyngeal carcinoma causing irritation of the vagus nerve (CN X). The vagus nerve has afferent fibers innervating the larynx and hypopharynx and also has a branch that provides afferent sensory input from the external auditory canal. Similarly, the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), which innervates the upper pharynx and base of tongue, also provides sensory innervation to the external auditory canal and can contribute to referred otalgia from tumors in these areas.\n\n(Choices A, B, and F) The trigeminal nerve (CN V) provides sensory innervation for much of the face, including parts of the ear. The facial nerve (CN VII) and great auricular nerve (originates from C2 and C3) innervate portions of the external auditory canal. Although these nerves carry sensation from the ear, they do not provide innervation to the hypopharynx.\n\n(Choice C) The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) contributes special sensory (hearing, balance) from the ear but does not contribute to general sensation. Therefore, lesions that impact the vestibulocochlear nerve tend to cause hearing loss or imbalance (eg, vertigo) rather than pain.\n\n(Choice E) The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) innervates the muscles of the tongue. It has motor function only, so dysfunction tends to produce weakness (eg, deviation of the tongue) rather than pain.",
    "zh": "该患者在耳部检查正常的情况下出现耳痛，这很可能是牵涉痛（在与真实起源不同的部位感知到的疼痛）。进一步评估显示咽下部有溃疡性肿块，伴有淋巴结肿大，这与黏膜头颈部鳞状细胞癌 (HNSCC) 相符。\n\n头颈部的许多疼痛来源都可能牵涉到耳朵，因为几条脑神经也支配耳朵的某些部位。引起牵涉性耳痛的常见原因包括颞下颌关节疾病、牙科疾病或影响舌根、咽下部或喉部的癌症。\n\n该患者的牵涉性耳痛最可能由其咽下癌引起，导致迷走神经 (CN X) 受到刺激。迷走神经具有支配喉部和咽下部的传入纤维，并且有一分支提供来自外耳道的传入感觉输入。同样，支配上咽部和舌根的舌咽神经 (CN IX) 也为外耳道提供感觉神经支配，并可能导致来自这些区域的肿瘤的牵涉性耳痛。\n\n（选项 A、B 和 F）三叉神经 (CN V) 为面部的大部分提供感觉神经支配，包括耳朵的某些部位。面神经 (CN VII) 和耳大神经（起源于 C2 和 C3）支配外耳道的某些部分。尽管这些神经从耳朵传递感觉，但它们不为咽下部提供神经支配。\n\n（选项 C）前庭蜗神经 (CN VIII) 提供来自耳朵的特殊感觉（听觉、平衡），但不影响一般感觉。因此，影响前庭蜗神经的病变往往会导致听力损失或平衡失调（例如，眩晕）而不是疼痛。\n\n（选项 E）舌下神经 (CN XII) 支配舌部肌肉。它只有运动功能，因此功能障碍往往会产生无力（例如，舌头偏斜）而不是疼痛。"
