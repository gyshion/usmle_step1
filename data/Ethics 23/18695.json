    "en": "A 4-year-old girl is sent to the emergency department from her day care center due to fever, right ear pain, and repeated vomiting. Examination shows a bulging, cloudy tympanic membrane associated with erythema, swelling, and tenderness over the right mastoid. CT scan reveals opacification of the mastoid air cells with destruction of bony septa. When the patient's parents arrive, they report that the patient has had recurrent episodes of otitis media. However, the parents decline antibiotic therapy, stating, \"In our family, we believe that natural healing techniques are better than shooting up our children with chemicals.\"",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This child with a history of recurrent otitis media now has acute mastoiditis, a purulent infection of the mastoid air cells. UNTREATED MASTOIDITIS can lead to serious complications, including BRAIN ABSCESS AND DEATH, and requires aggressive management. Initial treatment includes parenteral antibiotics, and patients often require surgical intervention.\n\nPatients and surrogate decision-makers (eg, parents, guardians) often have limited understanding of serious but uncommon conditions, such as mastoiditis. They also may have misconceptions regarding the potential risks and benefits of medical treatment. Decision-making can be further complicated by the urgency to make life-or-death decisions quickly in unfamiliar environments (eg, emergency department).\n\nThe initial step in counseling patients and surrogate decision-makers regarding REFUSAL OF TREATMENT is to calmly probe their UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISEASE PROCESS. This can be followed by COUNSELING AND EDUCATION tailored to the decision-maker's LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING AND HEALTH LITERACY and an objective assessment of treatment options. Although a court order may be necessary to compel the parents to allow life-saving treatment, legal action can be distressing to all involved. Often, once the disease process and treatment options are better understood, decision-makers become less resistant to treatment.\n\n(Choice B) For non-life-threatening conditions for which standard therapies are undesirable or ineffective, clinicians can lend their expertise to patients regarding nonstandard therapies, even if the clinician does not fully endorse such therapies. However, there are no nonpharmacologic therapies that are adequate for treating mastoiditis.\n\n(Choice C) This statement begins with an appropriate gesture of concern. However, it is inadequate because it simply reiterates treatment recommendations and does not attempt to provide the information needed for the patient's parents to make an informed decision.\n\n(Choice D) Although discussion with this child's family should include the risks of untreated mastoiditis, presenting scare tactics and worst-case scenarios is likely only to further distress the family and inhibit rational decision-making.\n\n(Choice E) Delayed treatment of mastoiditis is not recommended. Wasting time with ineffective treatments will only delay having a more appropriate conversation.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients and surrogate decision-makers often have misconceptions regarding medical conditions and the potential risks and benefits of treatment. The initial step in counseling patients and surrogate decision-makers regarding treatment refusal is to calmly probe their understanding of the disease process. This can be followed by counseling and education tailored to the decision-maker's level of understanding and health literacy.",
    "zh": "这个有复发性中耳炎病史的孩子现在患有急性乳突炎，这是一种乳突气房的化脓性感染。未经治疗的乳突炎可导致严重并发症，包括脑脓肿和死亡，需要积极治疗。初始治疗包括肠外抗生素，患者通常需要手术干预。\n\n患者和替代决策者（例如，父母、监护人）通常对严重但罕见的疾病（如乳突炎）的了解有限。他们也可能对医疗治疗的潜在风险和益处存在误解。在陌生环境（例如，急诊科）中快速做出生死攸关的决定的紧迫性可能会使决策进一步复杂化。\n\n在就拒绝治疗对患者和替代决策者进行咨询的初始步骤是，平静地探究他们对疾病过程的理解。之后可以进行咨询和教育，以适应决策者的理解水平和健康素养，并对治疗方案进行客观评估。尽管可能需要法院命令才能迫使父母允许挽救生命的治疗，但法律诉讼可能会给所有相关人员带来困扰。通常，一旦更好地理解了疾病过程和治疗方案，决策者对治疗的抵触情绪就会降低。\n\n（选项B）对于标准疗法不可取或无效的非危及生命的疾病，临床医生可以就非标准疗法向患者提供专业知识，即使临床医生没有完全认可此类疗法。然而，没有足够的非药物疗法可以治疗乳突炎。\n\n（选项C）该声明以适当的关切姿态开头。但是，它是不够的，因为它只是重申了治疗建议，并且没有试图提供患者父母做出知情决定所需的信息。\n\n（选项D）虽然与这个孩子的家人讨论应该包括未经治疗的乳突炎的风险，但呈现恐吓策略和最坏情况的可能性只会进一步困扰家人并抑制理性决策。\n\n（选项E）不建议延迟治疗乳突炎。将时间浪费在无效的治疗上只会延迟进行更合适的对话。\n\n教育目标：\n患者和替代决策者通常对医疗状况以及治疗的潜在风险和益处存在误解。在就拒绝治疗对患者和替代决策者进行咨询的初始步骤是，平静地探究他们对疾病过程的理解。之后可以进行咨询和教育，以适应决策者的理解水平和健康素养。"

    "en": "This question tests the approach to treatment refusal, specifically in the context of a serious pediatric infection (mastoiditis) where parents are hesitant to use conventional medical treatment. It assesses the ability to initiate a conversation that explores the parents' understanding and beliefs before providing education.\n\nThe best approach is to first understand the parents' perspective and level of understanding. Avoid scare tactics or simply reiterating recommendations. Focus on open communication and education to facilitate informed decision-making.",
