    "en": "A 75-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to acute-onset profuse vomiting of large amounts of bright red blood. He has had intermittent, dull epigastric pain for the last 3 months. Medical history is significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with multiple exacerbations and lumbar spinal stenosis. The patient has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. Blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg and pulse is 120/min. Examination shows epigastric tenderness. The patient dies an hour after admission despite resuscitation efforts. Autopsy shows a deep peptic ulcer localized proximally on the lesser curvature of the stomach. The ulcer most likely penetrated which of the following arteries?",

    "en": "Massive hemorrhage with hypovolemic shock is a potential life-threatening complication of peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Most cases of PUD are due to Helicobacter pylori infection or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Other risk factors include smoking, glucocorticoid use, and older age.\n\nMost gastric ulcers arise along the lesser curvature of the stomach, usually at the transitional zone between the gastric corpus (body) and antrum. Glands in the corpus contain parietal cells that produce hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor; mucosal glands in the antrum contain G cells that secrete gastrin. This transitional zone provides the optimal microenvironment (eg, pH, host immune factors) for H pylori proliferation. The resultant inflammation leads to mucosal atrophy and ulcer formation.\n\nThe left and right gastric arteries run along and perfuse the lesser curvature of the stomach, and are a common source of hemorrhage from penetrating gastric ulcers. Other potential complications of PUD include penetration into other adjacent structures (eg, biliary tract, colon), gastric outlet obstruction, and free wall perforation with peritonitis.\n\n(Choices A and B) The common hepatic artery perfuses the liver, gallbladder, pylorus, duodenum, and pancreas. It arises from the celiac trunk and ends when it bifurcates into the proper hepatic and gastroduodenal arteries. The gastroduodenal artery supplies blood to the pylorus and proximal duodenum. Ulcers in the posterior duodenal bulb can erode into the gastroduodenal artery, but a gastric ulcer at the lesser curvature would not involve these arteries.\n\n(Choices C and G) The superior mesenteric and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries do not perfuse the stomach.\n\n(Choice E) The right gastroepiploic artery arises from the gastroduodenal artery and perfuses the distal greater curvature of the stomach. Gastric ulcers do not commonly occur in the greater curvature.\n\n(Choice F) The splenic artery arises from the celiac trunk and supplies blood to the spleen. It is separated from the posterior wall of the stomach by the pancreas and is only rarely penetrated by gastric ulcers. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "消化性溃疡病 (PUD) 引起失血性休克是潜在的危及生命的并发症。大多数PUD病例是由于幽门螺杆菌感染或使用非甾体抗炎药引起的。其他危险因素包括吸烟、使用糖皮质激素和高龄。\n\n大多数胃溃疡发生在胃小弯，通常位于胃体和胃窦之间的过渡区。胃体内的腺体含有产生盐酸和内因子的壁细胞；胃窦内的黏膜腺体含有分泌胃泌素的G细胞。该过渡区为幽门螺杆菌增殖提供了最佳的微环境（例如，pH值、宿主免疫因子）。由此产生的炎症导致黏膜萎缩和溃疡形成。\n\n左、右胃动脉沿胃小弯走行并为其供血，是胃溃疡穿透导致出血的常见来源。 PUD 的其他潜在并发症包括穿透到其他相邻结构（例如，胆道、结肠）、胃出口梗阻和伴腹膜炎的游离壁穿孔。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）肝总动脉为肝脏、胆囊、幽门、十二指肠和胰腺供血。它起源于腹腔干，并在分支成固有肝动脉和胃十二指肠动脉处结束。胃十二指肠动脉为幽门和十二指肠近端供血。十二指肠球后部溃疡可侵蚀到胃十二指肠动脉，但位于小弯的胃溃疡不会累及这些动脉。\n\n（选项 C 和 G）肠系膜上动脉和胰十二指肠下动脉不为胃供血。\n\n（选项 E）右胃网膜动脉起源于胃十二指肠动脉，为胃远端大弯供血。胃溃疡不常发生在大弯。\n\n（选项 F）脾动脉起源于腹腔干，为脾脏供血。它通过胰腺与胃后壁分隔开，并且很少被胃溃疡穿透。{{exhibit_1}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the anatomical location of gastric ulcers and the arteries that supply the stomach, specifically the lesser curvature. It also assesses understanding of the complications of peptic ulcer disease, such as massive hemorrhage.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that most gastric ulcers occur along the lesser curvature of the stomach. Identify the arteries that supply this region, which are the left and right gastric arteries. The left gastric artery is the most likely to be penetrated in this scenario.",
