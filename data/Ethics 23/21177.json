    "en": "A 66-year-old, previously healthy woman is admitted to the hospital due to recurrent hemoptysis. Chest x-ray obtained in the emergency department shows a 10-cm perihilar mass in the right lung. The patient undergoes bronchoscopic biopsy, which reveals non–small cell lung cancer. When entering her room to disclose the biopsy results, the physician sees the patient eating lunch with family members and friends who have been at her bedside since admission. They all appear anxious, and the patient tearfully tells the physician, \"I've been dreading this moment. I think I already know what my test results are.\"",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "When discussing serious, potentially life-threatening illness, patients commonly wish to have family and friends present for support. Having others be present may also facilitate better understanding and retention of information when patients are overwhelmed or distracted by ongoing symptoms of illness. However, patient preferences vary widely, both among and within patient subpopulations (eg, elderly, minorities), regarding which (if any) companions should be present during discussion of serious illness.\n\nTherefore, before disclosing any significant information, the physician should first determine how the patient prefers to receive information and which companions should be present during the discussion. The inquiry should be nondirective, avoiding assumptions and giving the patient full scope to express preferences. Care should be taken to avoid alienating involved family members, who may be central in supporting the patient's decision-making and comfort. Only when the patient's preferences are clear should significant information be disclosed.\n\n(Choice A) Although a family meeting can be an appropriate forum to share difficult information and answer questions, the physician should first inquire as to the patient's preferences before postponing delivery of results.\n\n(Choice C) Some patients (eg, elderly) may express the desire for other family members to be informed first about a health condition; however, this preference should not be assumed. The physician must first discuss with the patient how she wishes to receive information.\n\n(Choice D) This response conveys empathy but assumes that the patient prefers all her companions to remain in the room. It also reveals the results are upsetting (\"difficult news\").\n\n(Choice E) When discussing test results in the presence of a patient's family and friends, reviewing what they already know before proceeding to new information is advisable. However, this statement assumes she has already given consent for her companions to be present during the discussion, which she has not.",
    "zh": "当讨论严重的、可能危及生命的疾病时，患者通常希望家人和朋友在场提供支持。让其他人也在场还可以帮助患者更好地理解和记住信息，当患者因持续的疾病症状而不知所措或分心时。然而，患者的偏好差异很大，无论是在患者亚群体之间还是在患者亚群体内部（例如，老年人、少数民族），关于在讨论严重疾病时应该有哪些（如果有的话）同伴在场。\n\n因此，在透露任何重要信息之前，医生应首先确定患者希望如何接收信息以及在讨论期间应有哪些同伴在场。询问应不具指令性，避免假设，并让患者充分表达自己的偏好。应注意避免疏远参与其中的家庭成员，他们可能在支持患者的决策和舒适感方面发挥核心作用。只有当患者的偏好明确后，才应披露重要信息。\n\n（选项 A）虽然家庭会议可能是一个分享困难信息和回答问题的合适场合，但医生应该在推迟结果公布之前先询问患者的偏好。\n\n（选项 C）一些患者（例如，老年人）可能希望先告知其他家庭成员有关健康状况的信息；然而，这种偏好不应被假定。医生必须首先与患者讨论她希望如何接收信息。\n\n（选项 D）此回应传达了同情，但假设患者希望所有同伴都留在房间里。它也表明结果令人不安（“坏消息”）。\n\n（选项 E）当在患者的家人和朋友面前讨论检查结果时，在进行新信息之前先回顾他们已经知道的内容是可取的。然而，该陈述假设她已经同意她的同伴在讨论期间在场，但她并未这样做。"

    "en": "This question assesses the importance of determining patient preferences regarding the presence of family and friends during the disclosure of significant medical information. It emphasizes the need for a non-directive approach to avoid assumptions and respect patient autonomy.\n\nThe best approach is to directly ask the patient who they would like to be present during the discussion.
