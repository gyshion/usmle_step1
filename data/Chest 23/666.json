    "en": "This patient's chronic progressive dyspnea, nonproductive cough, digital clubbing, and inspiratory crackles are concerning for interstitial lung disease. CT reveals peripheral reticular infiltrates (ie, thickened, linear interstitial markings) with subpleural honeycombing (ie, multiple cystic spaces with irregularly thickened walls), which strongly suggests idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a chronic, fibrosing interstitial pneumonia that is histologically defined by foci of fibroblast proliferation and dense collagen deposition intermixed with unaffected lung (ie, usual interstitial pneumonia pattern). {{exhibit_2}}\n\nThe pathogenesis of IPF is thought to be driven by repetitive epithelial injury (eg, smoking, acid reflux) followed by disordered repair:\n\n1.  Repetitive lung microinjuries result in the loss of type 1 pneumocytes, which compose 95% of the gas-exchanging alveolar surface area (Choice E).\n2.  Type 1 pneumocytes are incapable of replication. Therefore, normal repair requires the proliferation of type 2 pneumocytes, with subsequent differentiation into type 1 pneumocytes to reestablish the alveolar epithelial lining.\n3.  In IPF, type 2 pneumocytes undergo reactive hyperplasia but fail to differentiate into type 1 cells because of dysfunctional cell fate pathways (eg, Wnt/transforming growth factor-beta) and abnormalities of the underlying basement membrane (Choices A and C).\n4.  Impaired re-epithelialization causes lung fibroblasts to undergo focal proliferation and begin secreting excessive amounts of collagen, leading to interstitial fibrosis (Choice D).\n5.  The fibrosis exerts radial traction on the distal airways, leading to dilation of the terminal bronchioles and producing the honeycomb appearance characteristic of IPF.\n\nEducational objective:\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an interstitial lung disease characterized by chronic progressive dyspnea, nonproductive cough, inspiratory crackles, and subpleural (peripheral) lung honeycombing. In IPF, repetitive microinjury to the alveolar epithelium (eg, smoking, acid reflux) is focally repaired by fibroblast proliferation/collagen deposition instead of normal restoration via type 2 pneumocyte differentiation. {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者的慢性进行性呼吸困难、无痰咳嗽、杵状指和吸气性爆裂音提示间质性肺疾病。CT显示外周网状浸润（即增厚的、线状的间质标记）伴有肺泡蜂窝状改变（即多个囊性腔隙，壁不规则增厚），强烈提示特发性肺纤维化 (IPF)。IPF是一种慢性、纤维化间质性肺炎，组织学定义为成纤维细胞增生和致密胶原沉积的病灶与未受影响的肺组织（即通常的间质性肺炎模式）混合存在。{{exhibit_2}}\n\nIPF 的发病机制被认为是由重复性上皮损伤（如吸烟、胃酸反流）引起的，随后是修复紊乱：\n\n1.  重复的肺微损伤导致I型肺泡上皮细胞的丢失，I型肺泡上皮细胞构成了 95% 的气体交换肺泡表面积（选项E）。\n2.  I型肺泡上皮细胞无法复制。因此，正常修复需要 II 型肺泡上皮细胞增殖，随后分化为 I 型肺泡上皮细胞以重建肺泡上皮内衬。\n3.  在IPF中，II型肺泡上皮细胞发生反应性增生，但由于细胞命运通路的失调（例如，Wnt/转化生长因子-β）和潜在的基底膜异常（选项 A 和 C），未能分化为 I 型细胞。\n4.  上皮细胞再生受损导致肺成纤维细胞发生局灶性增殖并开始分泌过量胶原蛋白，导致间质纤维化（选项 D）。\n5.  纤维化对远端气道施加径向牵引力，导致末端细支气管扩张，产生IPF 特征性的蜂窝状外观。\n\n教育目标：\n特发性肺纤维化是一种间质性肺疾病，其特征是慢性进行性呼吸困难、无痰咳嗽、吸气性爆裂音和肺泡下（外周）肺蜂窝状改变。在 IPF 中，对肺泡上皮的重复性微损伤（例如，吸烟、胃酸反流）通过成纤维细胞增殖/胶原沉积进行局灶性修复，而不是通过 II 型肺泡上皮细胞分化进行正常修复。{{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), specifically the changes in lung cell populations and basement membrane structure. It requires understanding the role of type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes, fibroblasts, and the basement membrane in the disease process.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of IPF (dyspnea, cough, crackles, clubbing) and the characteristic CT findings (honeycombing). Then, recall the cellular and structural changes in IPF: loss of type 1 pneumocytes, hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocytes, fibroblast proliferation, and basement membrane abnormalities.",
