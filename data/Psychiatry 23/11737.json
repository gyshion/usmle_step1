    "en": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother, who is concerned about his language development. She says, \"I know that children speak at different ages and he is still young, but I am concerned that his speech isn't progressing and that he needs to interact with other children more. His day care teacher says that he is shy and sits in a corner playing with his favorite truck. We have also been busy with a recent move and have not given him as much attention, which doesn't help.\" The patient's birth history, medical history, and audiology screening are unremarkable. His mother is 6 months pregnant with her second child, and the family moved to a new home 3 months ago. In the examination room, the patient sits in a corner, avoiding eye contact with the doctor and repeatedly spinning the wheels of a toy truck. He does not respond to his name. He makes occasional grunting sounds but says no fully formed words. When his mother tries to take his truck away, he begins screaming and pulls it back.",
    "zh": "一位 2 岁男孩被他的母亲带到诊所，母亲担心他的语言发育。她说：“我知道孩子们说话的年龄不同，他还小，但我担心他的语言没有进展，他需要更多地与其他孩子互动。他的日托老师说他很害羞，坐在角落里玩他最喜欢的卡车。最近我们也很忙于搬家，没有给他那么多关注，这也没有帮助。” 患者的出生史、病史和听力筛查均无特殊。他的母亲怀有第二个孩子 6 个月，全家在 3 个月前搬到了新家。在检查室里，患者坐在角落里，避免与医生进行眼神交流，并反复转动玩具卡车的轮子。他没有回应他的名字。他偶尔会发出哼哼声，但没有说出任何完整的词语。当他的母亲试图拿走他的卡车时，他开始尖叫并把它拉回来。"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The child's presentation is highly suggestive of AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD). Key features supporting this diagnosis include deficits in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. Specifically, the child avoids eye contact, does not respond to his name, has limited verbalizations (no fully formed words), and engages in repetitive play (spinning the wheels of a toy truck). The teacher's report of shyness and sitting in a corner further supports social withdrawal. The recent move and decreased parental attention are noted but are unlikely to be the sole cause of such profound developmental delays and behavioral patterns.\n\n(Choice A) Adjustment disorders are diagnosed when symptoms develop within 3 months of an identifiable stressor. While the move and pregnancy are stressors, they do not fully explain the constellation of symptoms, particularly the lack of social engagement and repetitive behaviors. The symptoms in ASD are typically pervasive and not solely reactive to a recent stressor.\n\n(Choice C) Language impairment frequently accompanies ASD. However, an isolated language disorder would not typically explain the significant deficits in social interaction and restricted interests observed in this child.\n\n(Choice D) At age 2, children are expected to be saying 2- or 3-word phrases, engaging in parallel play, using a variety of toys, making eye contact, and responding to their names. This child's development is significantly delayed in these areas, making normal variation unlikely.\n\n(Choice E) Selective mutism involves a failure to speak in specific situations (e.g., school) despite speaking in other settings. This child's language impairment is global, not situation-specific.\n\n(Choice F) Social anxiety disorder involves anxiety in new social circumstances, but typically, individuals with social anxiety disorder have normal communication skills otherwise. This child's deficits are evident in multiple domains, including language and social reciprocity, and are not solely related to anxiety.\n\n(Choice G) Social (pragmatic) communication disorder is characterized by deficits in verbal and nonverbal communication for the purposes of social interaction. While this child has pragmatic communication deficits, the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior (spinning truck wheels, screaming when the truck is touched) points more strongly towards ASD. In ASD, pragmatic communication deficits are often accompanied by restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, which are present here. Therefore, ASD is a more encompassing diagnosis.\n\nKey Pearls:\n- ASD is characterized by deficits in SOCIAL COMMUNICATION AND INTERACTION and RESTRICTED, REPETITIVE PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR.\n- Early signs of ASD often include lack of eye contact, not responding to name, delayed language, and repetitive behaviors.\n- Consider ASD in any child with significant delays in social and language development, especially when accompanied by unusual behaviors.",
    "zh": "该儿童的表现高度提示自闭症谱系障碍 (ASD)。支持此诊断的关键特征包括社交沟通和互动方面的缺陷，以及受限的、重复的行为模式。具体来说，孩子避免眼神交流，不回应自己的名字，言语表达有限（没有完整的词语），并且从事重复性游戏（转动玩具卡车的轮子）。老师关于害羞和坐在角落里的报告进一步支持了社交退缩。最近的搬家和父母关注的减少被注意到，但不太可能是如此严重的 ​​发育迟缓和行为模式的唯一原因。\n\n（选项 A）当症状在可识别的应激源的 3 个月内出现时，会被诊断为适应障碍。虽然搬家和怀孕是应激源，但它们并不能完全解释症状的组合，特别是缺乏社交参与和重复行为。 ASD 中的症状通常是普遍存在的，而不仅仅是对近期应激源的反应。\n\n（选项 C）语言障碍经常伴随 ASD。然而，孤立的语言障碍通常无法解释在此儿童中观察到的社交互动和受限兴趣方面的明显缺陷。\n\n（选项 D）在 2 岁时，儿童应该能够说出 2 或 3 个字的短语，参与平行游戏，使用各种玩具，进行眼神交流并回应他们的名字。这个孩子在这几个方面的发育明显迟缓，因此正常变异的可能性不大。\n\n（选项 E）选择性缄默症是指在特定情况下（例如，学校）无法说话，尽管在其他环境中说话。这个孩子的语言障碍是普遍性的，而不是特定情境的。\n\n（选项 F）社交焦虑症涉及在新的社交环境中出现焦虑，但通常情况下，患有社交焦虑症的人通常具有正常的沟通技巧。这个孩子的缺陷在多个领域都很明显，包括语言和社会互惠，并且不仅仅与焦虑有关。\n\n（选项 G）社交（实用）交流障碍的特征是，在为了社交互动的目的而进行的口头和非口头交流方面存在缺陷。虽然这个孩子有实用的沟通缺陷，但存在受限的、重复的行为模式（转动卡车轮子，当触摸到卡车时尖叫）更强烈地指向 ASD。在 ASD 中，实用的沟通缺陷通常伴随着受限的兴趣和重复的行为，这些在此都存在。因此，ASD 是一种更包容性的诊断。\n\n关键要点：\n- ASD 的特征是社交沟通和互动方面的缺陷，以及受限的、重复的行为模式。\n- ASD 的早期迹象通常包括缺乏眼神交流、不回应名字、语言迟缓和重复行为。\n- 在任何社交和语言发育严重迟缓的儿童中，尤其是当伴有异常行为时，都应考虑 ASD。"
