    "en": "A 72-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to increasing dyspnea on exertion. The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis causing exertional dyspnea, but his symptoms have significantly worsened over the past several weeks. He also notes excessive fatigue and several occasions of black tarry stool. The patient has no history of a blood disorder or other chronic medical conditions. Physical examination shows a harsh systolic ejection murmur radiating to the neck. The abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly. Testing of stool for occult blood is positive. Laboratory results are as follows:\n\nHemoglobin 9.0 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 76 µm³\nPlatelets 380,000/mm³\nPT 11 sec (INR 1.0)\nActivated PTT 50 sec\n\nColonoscopy reveals scattered bleeding angiodysplasias in the right colon. Which of the following is most likely contributing to this patient's gastrointestinal bleeding?",

    "en": "This patient with severe aortic stenosis (AS) has symptomatic anemia (dyspnea, fatigue) with low mean corpuscular volume likely due to chronic bleeding from colonic angiodysplasias. Colonic, mucosal, and cutaneous bleeding is common in patients with severe AS due to acquired von Willebrand syndrome.\n\nVon Willebrand factor (vWF) is a multimeric glycoprotein generated by endothelial cells and platelets. It plays 3 important roles in hemostasis:\n\n*   vWF binds to sites of endothelial injury and serves as a scaffold for platelet aggregation.\n*   vWF promotes platelet aggregation at sites of high shearing pressure (often seen in areas of endothelial injury).\n*   vWF acts as a carrier protein for factor VIII, which dramatically reduces the metabolism of factor VIII.\n\nThe activity of vWF is greatest when it is in large, multimeric forms. However, large multimers of vWF are also most susceptible to unfolding in areas of HIGH shear forces, exposing a cleavage site that makes them more vulnerable to destruction by the ADAMTS13 metalloproteinase. Because patients with severe AS typically have high shearing forces across the damaged valve, they have increased cleavage of vWF multimers, which eventually leads to vWF deficiency. Valve repair can reverse the bleeding diathesis.\n\n(Choice B) The activity of ADAMTS13 is elevated in patients with severe AS because vWF multimers become unfolded by the high shear stress, leading them to be more susceptible to metalloproteinase destruction. Decreased activity of ADAMTS13 is seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which is marked by microvascular thrombosis.\n\n(Choice C) Decreased hepatic synthesis of clotting factors can cause coagulopathy in patients with cirrhosis. Factor VIII levels are frequently low in patients with severe AS, which is due to increased destruction of vWF, not reduced hepatic synthesis.\n\n(Choice D) Acquired antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is seen primarily in those with systemic lupus erythematosus or other rheumatologic conditions. It is marked by arterial or venous thrombosis or pregnancy complications: bleeding diathesis is uncommon.\n\n(Choice E) Uremia reduces platelet adhesiveness and platelet aggregation, leading to an increased risk for bleeding. This patient has AS, not kidney disease.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients with severe aortic stenosis are at high risk for mucocutaneous and colonic bleeding due to acquired von Willebrand deficiency. The von Willebrand factor multimers become unfolded by the high shear stress, leading to increased destruction by the ADAMTS13 metalloproteinase.",
    "zh": "这位患有严重主动脉瓣狭窄 (AS) 的患者出现症状性贫血（呼吸困难、疲劳），平均红细胞体积偏低，这可能是由于来自结肠血管发育不良的慢性出血所致。结肠、黏膜和皮肤出血在患有严重 AS 的患者中很常见，这是由于获得了 von Willebrand 综合征。\n\nVon Willebrand 因子 (vWF) 是一种由内皮细胞和血小板产生的多聚糖蛋白。它在止血中起着 3 个重要作用：\n\n*   vWF 结合到内皮损伤部位，并作为血小板聚集的支架。\n*   vWF 促进在高剪切压力部位的血小板聚集（通常见于内皮损伤部位）。\n*   vWF 充当 VIII 因子载体蛋白，这大大降低了 VIII 因子的代谢。\n\nvWF 的活性在它呈大分子多聚体形式时最大。然而，大型 vWF 多聚体也最容易在高剪切力区域展开，暴露一个切割位点，使其更容易受到 ADAMTS13 金属蛋白酶的破坏。由于严重 AS 患者通常在受损的瓣膜上具有高剪切力，因此他们会增加 vWF 多聚体的切割，最终导致 vWF 缺乏。瓣膜修复可以逆转出血素质。\n\n(选项 B) 严重 AS 患者的 ADAMTS13 活性升高，因为 vWF 多聚体受到高剪切应力的展开，使其更容易受到金属蛋白酶的破坏。血栓性血小板减少性紫癜可见 ADAMTS13 活性降低，其特征是微血管血栓形成。\n\n(选项 C) 凝血因子肝脏合成减少可导致肝硬化患者出现凝血病。VIII 因子水平在患有严重 AS 的患者中通常较低，这是由于 vWF 破坏增加，而不是肝脏合成减少。\n\n(选项 D) 获得性抗磷脂抗体综合征主要见于患有系统性红斑狼疮或其他风湿病患者。其特征是动脉或静脉血栓形成或妊娠并发症：出血素质不常见。\n\n(选项 E) 尿毒症会降低血小板粘附性和血小板聚集，从而导致出血风险增加。该患者患有 AS，而不是肾脏疾病。\n\n教育目标：\n患有严重主动脉瓣狭窄的患者由于获得性 von Willebrand 因子缺乏症，具有发生皮肤黏膜和结肠出血的高风险。von Willebrand 因子多聚体在高剪切应力下展开，导致 ADAMTS13 金属蛋白酶的破坏增加。"
