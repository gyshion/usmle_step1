    "en": "A 26-year-old woman comes to the emergency department accompanied by her boyfriend for evaluation of a broken nose. With the boyfriend present, she explains that she tripped and fell in the bathroom, hitting her face on the countertop. When asked privately if she feels unsafe with her boyfriend, the patient says, \"No, everything is fine. He just gets a little upset when he has too much to drink.\" When questioned further about how she sustained her nasal fracture, she says, \"He pushed me and I fell, but I'm sure it won't happen again.\" After assessing the extent of the injuries, which of the following statements by the physician is the most appropriate?",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient shows several signs suggestive of intimate partner violence (IPV) (eg, head injury; inconsistent explanation of injury; reluctance to disclose, especially in partner's presence). As in this case, many people in abusive relationships do not seek assistance and may MINIMIZE or DENY ABUSE due to shame, fear of partner retaliation, doubt that there is any alternative, or belief that the abuse is deserved.\n\nThe best initial approach is gentle, supportive, open-ended inquiry followed by a safety assessment and identification of emergency SAFETY PLANS. Although the patient currently denies feeling unsafe, she should be asked if she has a plan in case violence escalates in the future. Helping the patient to develop a personalized safety plan (ie, identifying where the patient would go if feeling unsafe) is a priority.\n\n(Choice A) Direct confrontation of this patient's denial would likely place the patient on the defensive and be perceived as unsupportive. This communication would be unlikely to overcome her reluctance to seek help for IPV.\n\n(Choice B) Patients should be encouraged and empowered to speak to physicians about IPV. Simply providing this patient with a referral list and placing the entire burden of getting help on her is likely to leave the patient feeling abandoned and decrease the chances of her seeking assistance now and in the future.\n\n(Choice C) The reasons why a patient stays in an abusive relationship are complex. Asking the patient why she remains in the relationship implies that she should have left; it is also likely to be perceived as judgmental and might discourage her from seeking help in the future.\n\n(Choice E) Asking the patient if she understands why the physician is concerned is condescending and judgmental. It is a closed-ended question that would likely discourage the patient from discussing her own feelings and fears.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients experiencing intimate partner violence should be approached in a supportive, nonjudgmental, open-ended manner. A thorough safety assessment and development of a personalized emergency safety plan are essential.",
    "zh": "该患者表现出一些提示亲密伴侣暴力 (IPV) 的迹象（例如，头部受伤；对受伤的解释前后不一致；不愿透露，尤其是在伴侣在场的情况下）。与本例一样，许多身处虐待关系中的人由于羞耻、害怕伴侣报复、怀疑是否有其他选择，或者认为虐待是应该的，而不寻求帮助，并且可能最小化或否认虐待。\n\n最好的初步方法是温和的、支持性的、开放式的询问，然后进行安全评估和确定紧急安全计划。尽管患者目前否认感到不安全，但应询问她是否有计划以防未来暴力升级。帮助患者制定个性化的安全计划（即，确定患者在感到不安全时会去哪里）是当务之急。\n\n(选项 A) 直接质问患者的否认可能会让患者采取防御姿态，并被认为是缺乏支持。这种沟通不太可能克服她寻求 IPV 帮助的犹豫。\n\n(选项 B) 应鼓励并授权患者就 IPV 与医生交谈。简单地向该患者提供转诊清单，并将寻求帮助的全部负担放在她身上，很可能会让患者感到被抛弃，并降低她现在和将来寻求帮助的机会。\n\n(选项 C) 患者留在虐待关系中的原因很复杂。询问患者为什么还留在这种关系中，暗示她应该离开；这也很可能被认为是带有批判性的，并且可能会阻止她在未来寻求帮助。\n\n(选项 E) 询问患者是否理解医生担心的原因，这是居高临下和带有批判性的。这是一个封闭式问题，很可能会阻止患者讨论她自己的感受和恐惧。\n\n教育目标：\n对待遭受亲密伴侣暴力的患者，应采取支持性的、非评判性的、开放式的方式。彻底的安全评估和制定个性化的紧急安全计划至关重要。"
