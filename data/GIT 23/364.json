    "en": "A 59-year-old woman comes to the office due to fatigue and generalized itching that have developed slowly over the last year. She has not had a visible rash. The patient is reluctant to seek health care and has not seen a physician in years. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are normal. Examination shows mild hepatomegaly. Laboratory studies show a striking increase in serum alkaline phosphatase, with moderate elevations in bilirubin and hepatic transaminases. Liver biopsy reveals dilated bile canaliculi with green-brown plugs and yellowish-green accumulations of pigment within the hepatic parenchyma. The patient does not return for her scheduled follow-up appointment to discuss further management.",
    "zh": "一名59岁女性因疲劳和全身瘙痒就诊，这些症状在过去一年中缓慢出现。她没有出现可见的皮疹。患者不愿就医，多年未看过医生。她不吸烟、不饮酒、不吸毒。生命体征正常。体格检查显示轻度肝肿大。实验室检查显示血清碱性磷酸酶显著升高，胆红素和肝转氨酶中度升高。肝活检显示胆小管扩张，其中有绿棕色栓子，肝实质内有黄绿色色素沉积。患者没有回来复诊讨论进一步的治疗方案。"

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has fatigue, pruritus, hepatomegaly, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level suggesting cholestatic liver disease. Cholestasis can arise secondary to hepatocellular dysfunction or intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Both obstructive and nonobstructive cholestasis are characterized by the deposition of bile pigment within the hepatic parenchyma, often with green-brown plugs in the dilated bile canaliculi. When it is prolonged, the reduction in bile flow causes intestinal malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), which require bile salts for digestion. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Cardiac dilation can result from deficiency of THIAMINE (vitamin B1), a water-soluble vitamin. Deficiency is common in patients with alcohol use disorder, not cholestatic liver disease.\n\n(Choice B) Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal biliary handling of copper. Liver disease with eventual cirrhosis is common. Central nervous system involvement can cause dysarthria, ataxia, and movement disorders including chorea and athetosis. Hepatocellular markers (eg, transaminases) will be elevated more prominently than cholestatic markers.\n\n(Choices D and E) Atrophic gastritis can be due to autoimmune causes (pernicious anemia). Helicobacter pylori infection, radiation, or granulomatous conditions. Loss of intrinsic factor production by parietal cells can lead to deficiency of vitamin B12 with resulting macrocytic anemia.\n\n(Choice F) Seborrheic dermatitis is a common inflammatory condition characterized by accumulation of scaly, greasy skin on the scalp, face, ears, eyelids, and eyebrows. Severe or widespread seborrhea is seen in HIV infection and Parkinson disease, but it is not associated with cholestatic liver disease.\n\nEducational objective:\nCholestatic liver disease can cause malabsorption and nutritional deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins.",
    "zh": "该患者出现疲劳、瘙痒、肝肿大和碱性磷酸酶升高，提示胆汁淤积性肝病。胆汁淤积可继发于肝细胞功能障碍或肝内或肝外胆道梗阻。阻塞性和非阻塞性胆汁淤积的特征均为胆汁色素在肝实质内沉积，常伴有扩张的胆小管内的绿棕色栓子。当病程延长时，胆汁流量减少会导致肠道对脂肪和脂溶性维生素（A、D、E和K）的吸收不良，这些维生素需要胆汁盐来消化。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项A) 心脏扩张可由硫胺素（维生素B1）缺乏引起，这是一种水溶性维生素。缺乏症常见于患有酒精使用障碍的患者，而不是胆汁淤积性肝病。\n\n(选项B) 威尔逊病是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是铜的胆汁处理异常。肝病并最终发展为肝硬化是常见的。中枢神经系统受累可引起言语不清、共济失调和运动障碍，包括舞蹈症和手足徐动症。肝细胞标志物（如转氨酶）的升高将比胆汁淤积标志物更明显。\n\n(选项D和E) 萎缩性胃炎可由自身免疫性原因（恶性贫血）、幽门螺杆菌感染、放射线或肉芽肿性疾病引起。壁细胞产生的内因子丧失可导致维生素B12缺乏，从而导致大细胞性贫血。\n\n(选项F) 脂溢性皮炎是一种常见的炎症性疾病，其特征是在头皮、面部、耳朵、眼睑和眉毛上出现鳞屑、油腻的皮肤堆积。严重或广泛的脂溢症可见于HIV感染和帕金森病，但它与胆汁淤积性肝病无关。\n\n教育目的：\n胆汁淤积性肝病可导致脂溶性维生素的吸收不良和营养缺乏。"
