    "en": "This patient's symptoms (cough, hemoptysis, weight loss), acid-fast bacilli on sputum culture, and upper lobe cavitary lesion are suggestive of secondary (reactivation) tuberculosis. His advanced age, multiple comorbidities, and partial immune suppression secondary to chronic oral corticosteroid use also place him at risk for reactivation disease.\n\nPrimary tuberculosis infection occurs following inhalation of aerosolized Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The organisms are deposited in the lower lungs and phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, where they proliferate until the macrophages are activated by T<sub>H</sub>1 lymphocytes. The infection can be subsequently eliminated if the area of involvement is small enough. However, larger regions of caseating necrosis become walled off, allowing M tuberculosis to survive in a dormant state without causing disease or symptoms. Later in life (usually following immunosuppression by drugs or HIV) the bacteria can reactivate and establish infection in the upper lungs (particularly the apex). The predilection for upper lung regions may be related to decreased lymphatic flow or increased oxygen tension. The organisms multiply in the apices, causing caseous and liquefactive necrosis and extensive cavitary disease. Erosion into the pulmonary vessels can result in severe hemoptysis. Hematogenous dissemination may also occur, causing miliary or extrapulmonary (eg, Potts disease, tuberculous meningitis) tuberculosis. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) Primary tuberculosis infection often begins as a focal lesion in the mid-to-lower lungs (Ghon focus). M tuberculosis then spreads lymphatically to the hilar lymph nodes, forming a Ghon complex. The organisms can remain dormant in a walled-off Ghon complex for many years before reactivating. Alternatively, the lesion may heal, forming a benign, calcified Ranke complex that is not associated with reactivation tuberculosis.\n\n(Choice B) A Ghon complex forms during primary tuberculosis infection and consists of a Ghon focus and hilar lymphadenopathy. This patient's upper lung involvement and cavitary lesion are more characteristic of secondary (reactivation) tuberculosis. Healing of this lesion would result in a persistent cavity that may become secondarily infected with Aspergillus flavus and form fungus balls.\n\n(Choice D) M tuberculosis is a facultative intracellular bacterium that can survive and multiply within macrophages; as a result, circulating antibodies cannot bind it to promote phagocytosis or complement-mediated killing. Therefore, humoral immunity plays no role in the control of M tuberculosis.\n\n(Choice E) A negative skin tuberculin test after M tuberculosis exposure suggests anergy against tuberculosis antigens and a weak cell-mediated immune response. This can occur in the setting of HIV, sarcoidosis, and other illnesses.\n\nEducational objective:\nPrimary tuberculosis causes the formation of Ghon foci in the lower lungs. Secondary (reactivation) tuberculosis occurs in patients with prior tuberculosis infection that never cleared completely. Reactivation tuberculosis occurs most often in immunosuppressed patients and is characterized by apical cavitary lesions and hemoptysis.",
    "zh": "该患者的症状（咳嗽、咯血、体重下降）、痰培养中的抗酸杆菌以及上叶空洞性病变提示继发性（再激活）结核病。 他年龄较大，有多重合并症，并且继发于长期口服皮质类固醇的使用而导致部分免疫抑制，这也使他面临再激活疾病的风险。\n\n原发性结核病感染发生在吸入气溶胶中的结核分枝杆菌后。这些病原体沉积在下肺，并被肺泡巨噬细胞吞噬，它们在其中增殖，直到巨噬细胞被 T<sub>H</sub>1 淋巴细胞激活。如果受累区域足够小，感染随后可以被消除。但是，较大的干酪样坏死区域会被隔离，使结核分枝杆菌能够在休眠状态下存活，而不会引起疾病或症状。 后来在生活中（通常是在药物或 HIV 引起的免疫抑制之后），细菌可以再激活，并在上肺（特别是肺尖）中建立感染。 上肺区域的易感性可能与淋巴流量减少或氧分压升高有关。病原体在肺尖增殖，引起干酪样和液化性坏死和广泛的空洞性疾病。 侵蚀到肺血管中可导致严重的咯血。 也可能发生血源性播散，导致粟粒性或肺外（例如，脊椎结核病、结核性脑膜炎）结核病。 {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(选项A) 原发性结核病感染通常始于中下肺的局灶性病变（Ghon 病灶）。结核分枝杆菌随后通过淋巴系统扩散到肺门淋巴结，形成Ghon复合体。病原体可以在被隔离的Ghon复合体中休眠多年，然后重新激活。 或者，病变可能愈合，形成良性的、钙化的Ranke复合体，这与再激活结核病无关。\n\n(选项B) Ghon复合体在原发性结核病感染期间形成，由Ghon病灶和肺门淋巴结病组成。 该患者的上肺受累和空洞性病变更具继发性（再激活）结核病的特征。 该病变的愈合将导致持续性空洞，该空洞可能继发感染黄曲霉并形成真菌球。\n\n(选项D) 结核分枝杆菌是一种兼性细胞内细菌，它可以在巨噬细胞内生存和繁殖；因此，循环抗体不能与其结合以促进吞噬作用或补体介导的杀灭。因此，体液免疫在控制结核分枝杆菌中不起作用。\n\n(选项E) 结核分枝杆菌暴露后结核菌素皮肤试验阴性表明对结核病抗原的无反应性和细胞介导的免疫反应弱。 这可能发生在 HIV、结节病和其他疾病的情况下。\n\n教育目标：\n原发性结核病导致下肺中Ghon病灶的形成。 继发性（再激活）结核病发生在以前从未完全清除结核病感染的患者中。 再激活结核病最常发生在免疫抑制患者中，其特征是肺尖空洞性病变和咯血。"
