    "en": "Blood microscopy findings that show red blood cells filled with multiple small rings suggest Plasmodium infection (malaria) {{exhibit_2}}. Erythrocytic forms of this parasite are treated with antimalarials such as chloroquine (in nonresistant areas), atovaquone-proguanil, or artemisinins. Primaquine is required to kill Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale liver hypnozoites.\n\nFor malaria acquired in areas known to have chloroquine-sensitive organisms, chloroquine is the treatment of choice. However, most African Plasmodium species are chloroquine resistant and require treatment with atovaquone-proguanil or artemisinins, which are well tolerated and have excellent cure rates. Because P vivax and P ovale have dormant liver forms (hypnozoites), primaquine therapy should be added to the treatment regimen for these species.\n\n(Choice A) Amphotericin B is used to treat leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease transmitted by sandflies. It is endemic to Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Americas. Visceral disease is typically marked by subacute fever, malaise, abdominal pain, and splenomegaly. Giemsa stain usually shows spherical/ovoid bodies (amastigotes) and rod-shaped inclusions (kinetoplast) in the skin/viscera.\n\n(Choice C) Diethylcarbamazine treats filariasis, a nematode infection of the lymphatics and subcutaneous tissue transmitted by mosquito vectors. Giemsa stain of a thick smear of blood would show microfilariae.\n\n(Choice D) Nifurtimox is used to treat trypanosomiasis, a protozoal illness endemic to Africa that causes sleeping sickness. CNS manifestations (eg, altered personality, stupor, excessive daytime somnolence) are prominent due to meningoencephalitis. Giemsa stain would show trypanosomes.\n\n(Choice E) Because most species of Plasmodium are now resistant to pyrimethamine, it is not typically used in treatment of malaria. Pyrimethamine can be used to treat toxoplasmosis, which most often causes symptomatic disease (eg, encephalitis) in patients with AIDS.\n\n{{exhibit_3}}\n\n{{exhibit_4}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of malaria diagnosis and treatment based on peripheral blood smear findings and travel history. It requires recognizing Plasmodium falciparum on microscopy and selecting the appropriate antimalarial therapy.\n\nThe key to solving this question is identifying the ring-form trophozoites on the blood smear, recognizing the patient's travel to central Africa as a risk factor for malaria, and knowing that artemisinins are effective against chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium species.",
