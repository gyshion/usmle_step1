    "en": "A 29-year-old woman comes to the office due to persistent fatigue. The patient has been experiencing daily exhaustion and has \"no energy to do little things.\" Her symptoms began 3 years ago after she closed her jewelry-making business due to financial problems. The patient used to enjoy creating unique jewelry pieces but has had no interest in making anything since her business closed. She has felt unhappy throughout this time, avoiding friends and social gatherings, and is hopeless that her life will improve. She has had no changes in appetite or sleeping patterns, problems with concentration, or suicidal thoughts. Physical examination and laboratory evaluation are unremarkable.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "For the past 3 years, this patient has had an unrelenting depressed mood (eg, unhappy throughout this time), low energy, and feelings of hopelessness. In the absence of additional depressive symptoms (eg, changes in appetite or sleeping patterns, problems with concentration, suicidal thoughts), her presentation is consistent with a PERSISTENT DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (PDD), also known as dysthymia.\n\nTo diagnose PDD, there must be the presence of depressed mood and ≥2 of the following over a period of ≥2 years (without a symptom-free period >2 months):\n• Poor or excessive appetite\n• Insomnia or hypersomnia\n• Low energy or fatigue\n• Low self-esteem\n• Poor concentration or problems making decisions\n• Hopelessness\n\nWhile there is significant overlap with major depressive disorder (eg, depressed mood and/or anhedonia can occur in both), PDD can be differentiated from major depression by the number of concurrent depressive symptoms (eg, guilt, psychomotor disturbance, suicidal ideation, impaired concentration, appetite change, sleep disturbance); ≥5 depressive symptoms (not seen in this patient) need to be present for ≥2 weeks to diagnose major depressive disorder (Choice D).\n\n(Choice A) In adjustment disorders, symptoms occur within 3 months of the onset of the stressor(s) and do not persist for more than 6 months after the stressor or its consequences have terminated. However, adjustment disorders are superseded and not diagnosed if criteria for another disorder (eg, PDD, MDD) are met.\n\n(Choice B) Although this patient is avoiding friends and social gatherings, this is better attributed to her depressed mood and fatigue rather than avoidant personality disorder. In addition, this patient's avoidance started 3 years ago, whereas avoidant personality disorder is characterized by onset in early adulthood with a pervasive pattern of inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to evaluation.\n\n(Choice C) Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterized by ≥6 months of significant reduction in activity with accompanying fatigue not relieved by rest, drastic worsening of symptoms after activity (ie, post-exertional malaise), and sleep impairments plus cognitive impacts (ie, \"brain fog\"). While this patient has low energy and fatigue, the absence of a history of sleep or concentration difficulties makes CFS unlikely.\n\nEducational objective:\nPersistent depressive disorder (ie, dysthymia) is characterized by chronic depressed mood and accompanying depressive symptoms lasting for ≥2 years. It can often be differentiated from major depressive disorder by the number of concurrent depressive symptoms (eg, ≥5 needed for major depression).",
    "zh": "在过去的3年中，该患者一直持续处于抑郁情绪（例如，这段时间一直不快乐）、低能量和绝望感。在没有其他抑郁症状（例如，食欲或睡眠模式的变化、注意力问题、自杀念头）的情况下，她的表现与持续性抑郁障碍（PDD）一致，也称为轻度抑郁症。\n\n要诊断PDD，必须存在抑郁情绪，并满足以下 ≥2 项，持续时间 ≥2 年（没有超过2个月的无症状期）：\n• 食欲不振或过盛\n• 失眠或嗜睡\n• 低能量或疲劳\n• 自卑\n• 注意力不集中或难以做决定\n• 绝望\n\n虽然与重度抑郁障碍有显着重叠（例如，抑郁情绪和/或快感缺失都可能发生），但PDD可以通过同时存在的抑郁症状的数量与重度抑郁症区分开来（例如，内疚感、精神运动性障碍、自杀意念、注意力受损、食欲改变、睡眠障碍）；需要 ≥5 个抑郁症状（在该患者中未见）持续 ≥2 周才能诊断为重度抑郁障碍（选项D）。\n\n（选项A）在适应障碍中，症状发生在应激源出现后的3个月内，并且在应激源或其后果终止后不会持续超过6个月。然而，如果满足另一种疾病（例如，PDD、MDD）的标准，则会取代适应障碍，且不诊断为适应障碍。\n\n（选项B）虽然该患者正在回避朋友和社交聚会，但这更应该归因于她的抑郁情绪和疲劳，而不是回避型人格障碍。此外，该患者的回避行为始于3年前，而回避型人格障碍的特征是成年早期发病，并伴有普遍的抑制模式、自卑感和对评价的过敏。\n\n（选项C）慢性疲劳综合征（CFS）的特征是活动量显着减少 ≥6 个月，伴有休息无法缓解的疲劳、活动后症状急剧恶化（即，劳累后不适）和睡眠障碍以及认知影响（即，“脑雾”）。虽然该患者能量低且疲劳，但缺乏睡眠或注意力困难的病史使得CFS不太可能。\n\n教育目标：\n持续性抑郁障碍（即，轻度抑郁症）的特征是慢性抑郁情绪和持续 ≥2 年的伴随抑郁症状。它通常可以通过同时存在的抑郁症状的数量与重度抑郁障碍区分开来（例如，重度抑郁症需要 ≥5 个症状）。"
