  "explanation": {
    "en": "This image shows an area of necrosis surrounded by columns of tumor cells (ie, pseudopalisading necrosis) with capillaries at the periphery (vascular proliferation); the central necrotic area represents a vascular insult resulting from haphazard tumor growth, with the surviving tumor cells forming columns as they migrate toward the peripheral vasculature. These histologic features are highly characteristic of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a malignant glioma that is the most common primary brain neoplasm in adults. {{exhibit_2}} GBM is usually located within the cerebral hemispheres (eg, frontal lobe, temporal lobe) and often presents with new-onset headache that worsens with bending over (increases intracranial pressure). Nausea/vomiting, focal neurological defects, and/or seizures are also frequently seen. The prognosis for patients with GBM is poor, with median survival at 10-12 months. {{exhibit_3}} (Choice A) Cyst formation and rare mitoses indicate a colloid cyst, a pathologically benign tumor usually found in the third ventricle. Although colloid cysts are usually asymptomatic, they can cause lethal obstructive hydrocephalus. {{exhibit_4}} (Choice B) Reticulin deposits and chronic inflammatory infiltrates are seen in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas. Although they can rarely progress to GBM, these tumors are usually found in children and young adults. {{exhibit_5}} (Choice C) Meningiomas are tumors of the meninges that have a whorled pattern of growth. Although they are not always present, laminar calcifications called psammoma bodies are characteristic of benign meningiomas. {{exhibit_6}} (Choice E) Ependymomas also display prominent vascular proliferation. However, these tumors are usually infratentorial (eg, fourth ventricle, spinal cord), rare in adults, and characterized histologically by proliferating ependymal cells surrounding blood vessels (perivascular pseudorosettes) rather than prominent areas of necrosis.",
    "zh": "该图像显示一个坏死区域，周围环绕着肿瘤细胞柱（即假栅栏状坏死），周围有毛细血管（血管增生）；中央坏死区域代表由于肿瘤无序生长导致的血管损伤，存活的肿瘤细胞形成柱状，迁移至周围血管。这些组织学特征是多形性胶质母细胞瘤 (GBM) 的高度特征，后者是成人中最常见的原发性脑肿瘤。{{exhibit_2}} GBM 通常位于大脑半球内（例如额叶、颞叶），通常表现为新发头痛，弯腰时加重（增加颅内压）。也常出现恶心/呕吐、局灶性神经功能缺损和/或癫痫发作。GBM 患者的预后较差，中位生存期为 10-12 个月。{{exhibit_3}}（选项 A）囊肿形成和罕见的有丝分裂表明胶体囊肿，这是一种病理上良性的肿瘤，通常位于第三脑室。虽然胶体囊肿通常无症状，但它们可导致致命的梗阻性脑积水。{{exhibit_4}}（选项 B）在多形性黄色星形细胞瘤中可见网状纤维沉积和慢性炎症浸润。尽管它们很少进展为GBM，但这些肿瘤通常见于儿童和年轻人。{{exhibit_5}}（选项 C）脑膜瘤是脑膜肿瘤，具有涡旋状生长模式。尽管并非总是存在，但称为砂粒体的层状钙化是良性脑膜瘤的特征。{{exhibit_6}}（选项 E）室管膜瘤也表现出明显的血管增生。然而，这些肿瘤通常位于幕下（例如，第四脑室，脊髓），在成人中很少见，组织学特征是增殖的室管膜细胞围绕血管（血管周围假玫瑰花结），而不是明显的坏死区域。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the recognition of histopathologic features of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and its clinical presentation. It assesses the ability to correlate microscopic findings with a specific brain tumor diagnosis and understand its typical symptoms and prognosis.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully examining the provided histology image for characteristic features such as necrosis and vascular proliferation. These findings should then be matched with the clinical vignette describing a patient with symptoms suggestive of a brain mass. Understanding the differential diagnoses for brain tumors based on their histological appearance is crucial for selecting the correct answer.",
