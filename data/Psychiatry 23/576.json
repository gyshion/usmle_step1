    "en": "A 55-year-old man comes to the office for a checkup. His medical history is significant for major depression treated with sertraline for the past 4 months, hypertension controlled with lisinopril, and diabetes mellitus controlled with diet. He does not use tobacco and drinks a glass of wine with dinner a few times a week. Vital signs are all within normal limits, and no abnormalities are noted on physical examination. Hemoglobin A1c is within normal limits.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Sertraline is one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) frequently used as first-line antidepressant therapy. Compared with older antidepressants (eg, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]), SSRIs have minimal activity at alpha-adrenergic, cholinergic, and histaminic receptors. They are generally more tolerable and significantly safer in overdose. However, SSRIs commonly cause sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido, decreased arousal, anorgasmia in women, and increased ejaculation latency in men. Sexual dysfunction can occur in more than 50% of patients receiving SSRIs and is a frequent cause of nonadherence. Physicians should routinely assess SSRI-treated patients for sexual dysfunction because some may be reluctant to discuss this side effect.\n(Choice A) Although SSRIs can prolong the QT interval slightly, they are unlikely to cause arrhythmias when used in recommended doses in patients who lack other risk factors. Cardiac arrhythmias are a serious side effect of TCA overdose.\n(Choice B) This patient's hypertension is well controlled. Hypertensive crisis is not associated with SSRIs but may occur if a patient taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) ingests foods containing tyramine.\n(Choices C and G) Orthostatic hypotension and urinary hesitancy are common side effects of TCAs due to their antagonism of alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. However, these side effects are rarely seen with SSRIs.\n(Choices D and H) SSRIs are associated with a slightly increased risk of seizures and weight gain, but these effects are less common than sexual dysfunction. Seizures are more of a concern in patients taking TCAs and the norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor bupropion.\n(Choice E) Serotonin syndrome can occur if an SSRI is combined with another serotonergic agent, such as an MAOI, or an illicit serotonergic substance, such as MDMA. It would be uncommon in a patient taking a single serotonergic drug at a normal dosage.\nEducational objective:\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have improved tolerability and a better side-effect profile compared with tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors but are associated with sexual dysfunction. Physicians should routinely inquire about sexual dysfunction because it is a relatively common side effect of SSRIs that may lead to nonadherence.",
    "zh": "舍曲林是常用于一线抗抑郁治疗的5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂(SSRIs)之一。与较老的抗抑郁药（如三环类抗抑郁药[TCAs]）相比，SSRIs对α-肾上腺素能、胆碱能和组胺受体的活性很小。它们通常更易耐受，并且在过量时也更安全。然而，SSRIs常引起性功能障碍，包括性欲减退、唤起障碍、女性性高潮障碍和男性射精潜伏期延长。接受SSRIs治疗的患者中，性功能障碍的发生率可能超过50%，并且是依从性差的常见原因。医生应定期评估接受SSRIs治疗的患者的性功能障碍，因为有些人可能不愿意讨论这种副作用。\n(选项 A) 虽然SSRIs可以略微延长QT间期，但在缺乏其他危险因素的患者中使用推荐剂量时，不太可能引起心律失常。心律失常是三环类抗抑郁药过量的严重副作用。\n(选项 B) 该患者的高血压得到了很好的控制。高血压危象与SSRIs无关，但如果服用单胺氧化酶抑制剂(MAOI)的患者摄入了含酪胺的食物，则可能发生。\n(选项 C 和 G) 体位性低血压和排尿迟缓是三环类抗抑郁药的常见副作用，这归因于它们对α-肾上腺素能和胆碱能受体的拮抗作用。然而，这些副作用在SSRIs中很少见。\n(选项 D 和 H) SSRIs与癫痫发作和体重增加的风险略有增加有关，但这些影响不如性功能障碍常见。癫痫发作更常见于服用三环类抗抑郁药和去甲肾上腺素-多巴胺再摄取抑制剂安非他酮的患者。\n(选项 E) 如果将SSRIs与其他血清素能药物（如MAOI）或非法血清素能物质（如MDMA）联合使用，则可能发生血清素综合征。在服用单一血清素能药物且剂量正常的患者中，这种情况并不常见。\n教育目标：\n选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂(SSRIs)与三环类抗抑郁药和单胺氧化酶抑制剂相比，耐受性有所提高，副作用也更好，但与性功能障碍有关。医生应定期询问性功能障碍，因为它是一种相对常见的SSRIs副作用，可能导致依从性差。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of common side effects associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), specifically sertraline, used in the treatment of depression. It requires differentiating these side effects from those of other antidepressant classes and understanding their relative frequencies.\nTo solve this question, identify the prescribed medication (sertraline, an SSRI) and recall its known adverse effect profile. Focus on the most common and characteristic side effects of SSRIs, such as sexual dysfunction, and compare them to the options provided, ruling out less common or class-specific side effects of other antidepressants.",
