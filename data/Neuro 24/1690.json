    "en": "The patient's symptoms of behavioral changes (anger, depression, insomnia), cognitive decline (lack of focus, poor memory), and involuntary, jerky, nonpurposeful movements (chorea) that worsen over years, along with a family history of similar symptoms and dementia, are highly suggestive of HUNTINGTON DISEASE (HD). This autosomal dominant disease results from an excessive number of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the huntingtin gene, causing a gain-of-function mutation that results in the accumulation of toxic mutant huntingtin protein. The abnormal protein buildup causes LOSS OF INHIBITORY (GABA) NEURONS in the caudate nucleus, leading to the characteristic movement abnormalities observed in HD. Although the diagnosis of HD is best confirmed by genetic analysis, imaging studies will typically show atrophy of the CAUDATE NUCLEUS, causing ex-vacuo enlargement of the lateral ventricles. The caudate nucleus is a C-shaped structure in its complete form. The head of the caudate can be identified in the inferolateral walls of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. The caudate nucleus and putamen together make up the striatum, which is critical for movement control and coordination along with behavioral regulation. {{exhibit_2}} (Choice A) This region represents the head of the caudate nucleus. (Choice B) This structure is the internal capsule. The anterior limb of the internal capsule separates the caudate nucleus from the globus pallidus and putamen and carries a portion of the thalamocortical fibers. The posterior limb of the internal capsule separates the globus pallidus and putamen from the thalamus and carries corticospinal motor and somatic sensory fibers as well as visual and auditory fibers. (Choice C) This structure is the insular cortex (insula). The insula plays a role in the limbic system (emotion) as well as in the coordination of some autonomic functions. (Choice D) Although the degeneration in HD affects both parts of the striatum (caudate and putamen), atrophy is most prominent in the caudate rather than the putamen both clinically (eg, MRI) and pathologically (eg, autopsy). (Choice E) Atrophy of the globus pallidus is observed late in the progression of HD when generalized cortical atrophy occurs. Educational objective: The head of the caudate lies in the inferolateral wall of the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle. It is separated from the globus pallidus and putamen by the internal capsule. Atrophy of the caudate nuclei with enlargement of the lateral ventricles is characteristic of Huntington disease and can be observed on neuroimaging. {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "患者的行为改变（愤怒、抑郁、失眠）、认知能力下降（注意力不集中、记忆力差）以及多年来恶化的非自主性、抽搐性、无目的性运动（舞蹈病）的症状，加上家族史中有类似的症状和痴呆，强烈提示亨廷顿病 (HD)。 这种常染色体显性遗传病是由于 huntingtin 基因中 CAG 三核苷酸重复次数过多引起的，导致功能获得性突变，从而导致有毒的突变 huntingtin 蛋白的积累。 异常的蛋白质堆积会导致尾状核中抑制性 (GABA) 神经元的缺失，从而导致在 HD 中观察到的特征性运动异常。 尽管 HD 的诊断最好通过基因分析来确认，但影像学研究通常会显示尾状核萎缩，导致侧脑室的空位扩大。 尾状核是一种完整的 C 形结构。 尾状核的头部可以在侧脑室额角的下外侧壁中识别出来。 尾状核和壳核共同构成纹状体，这对于运动控制和协调以及行为调节至关重要。 {{exhibit_2}} (选项 A) 该区域代表尾状核的头部。 (选项 B) 这种结构是内囊。 内囊的前肢将尾状核与苍白球和壳核分开，并携带部分丘脑皮质纤维。 内囊的后肢将苍白球和壳核与丘脑分开，并携带皮质脊髓运动和躯体感觉纤维以及视觉和听觉纤维。 (选项 C) 这种结构是脑岛皮层（岛叶）。 岛叶在边缘系统（情绪）以及一些自主功能的协调中起作用。 (选项 D) 尽管 HD 中的变性会影响纹状体的两个部分（尾状核和壳核），但萎缩在临床（例如，MRI）和病理学（例如，尸检）上均在尾状核中比在壳核中更明显。 (选项 E) 当发生广泛的皮质萎缩时，在 HD 进展的后期会观察到苍白球萎缩。 教育目标：尾状核的头部位于侧脑室额角的下外侧壁。 它与苍白球和壳核被内囊分隔。 尾状核萎缩伴侧脑室增大是亨廷顿病的特征，可以在神经影像学上观察到。 {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation and neuroanatomical correlates of Huntington disease. It requires the identification of the brain region most affected by the disease process based on the provided clinical vignette and anatomical image.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the classic triad of symptoms for Huntington disease: chorea, cognitive decline, and psychiatric disturbances. Then, by correlating these symptoms with the known pathophysiology of HD, which involves degeneration of the caudate nucleus, the examinee must identify the caudate nucleus on the provided coronal brain section and select the corresponding labeled option.",
