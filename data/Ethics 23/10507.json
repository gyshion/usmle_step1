    "en": "An 82-year-old man with a history of advanced Alzheimer dementia is brought to the hospital by his daughter, who is his power of attorney and caregiver. She says that her father is increasingly confused and verbally aggressive. He is admitted to the hospital and found to have a urinary tract infection. Intravenous antibiotics are initiated and he appears less disoriented and agitated but remains unable to recall nursing instructions throughout the day and is fairly nonverbal. Three days into his treatment, the antibiotic order expires and is missed by the physician, nurses, and pharmacy staff. The patient receives no medication for 2 days before the error is noted and corrected. There are no consequences to this error other than extension of his hospital stay by 2 days. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Medication errors play a major role in patient morbidity and mortality, particularly in the hospital setting. These errors may be caused by health care professionals (eg, errors in entering medication, failure to renew medication), factors related to the medication (eg, similar names, narrow therapeutic window), and factors related to the patient (eg, poor renal function, polypharmacy). Quality improvement measures such as checklists or medication reconciliation attempt to minimize these preventable errors.\n\nIt is often challenging for physicians to disclose when medication errors have occurred, particularly when no serious harm has come to the patient. Reasons for this reluctance may include fear of litigation or loss of patient trust and confidence. However, full disclosure of medical errors should occur in a timely manner and has been associated with a neutral-to-positive effect on patient response and the physician-patient relationship. When an error is noted, disclosure should be provided in person, in a timely manner that includes an apology for what occurred. Because this patient's altered mental status and advanced dementia prevent him from being able to understand what occurred, it would be more appropriate for the physician to disclose the error to his daughter (Choice D).\n\n(Choice A) Although the patient was not harmed physically, extra days in the hospital certainly expose him to greater financial risk and to hospital-acquired infection. It would not be advisable to withhold this information.\n\n(Choice B) Although having the hospital revoke charges for the extra days would be appropriate, this does not substitute for disclosure and apology for the error.\n\n(Choice E) Waiting to discuss the incident with pharmacy and nursing staff would be the first step if there is doubt about whether a medication error occurred. However, in this case, it is clear that the medication error did occur, making the next best step disclosure and apology for the event.",
    "zh": "用药错误在患者发病率和死亡率中起主要作用，尤其是在医院环境中。这些错误可能是由医护人员造成的（例如，录入药物错误，未续订药物），与药物相关的因素（例如，相似的名称，治疗窗口窄），以及与患者相关的因素（例如，肾功能差，多药治疗）。质量改进措施，如清单或用药核对，试图最大限度地减少这些可预防的错误。\n\n当发生用药错误时，医生通常难以披露，特别是在患者未受到严重伤害的情况下。这种犹豫的原因可能包括害怕诉讼或失去患者的信任和信心。然而，医疗错误的全面披露应及时进行，并与患者反应和医患关系的中性到积极影响相关联。当发现错误时，应亲自、及时地进行披露，包括对所发生的事情道歉。由于该患者的意识状态改变和晚期痴呆症使他无法理解发生了什么，医生向他的女儿披露错误会更合适（选项D）。\n\n(选项A) 虽然患者未受到身体上的伤害，但在医院额外住院几天肯定会使他面临更大的经济风险和医院获得性感染。不建议隐瞒此信息。\n\n(选项B) 虽然让医院撤销额外住院费是合适的，但这并不能替代对错误的披露和道歉。\n\n(选项E) 如果对是否发生用药错误有疑问，等待与药房和护理人员讨论此事将是第一步。然而，在这种情况下，很明显用药错误确实发生了，那么下一步最好的方法是披露并为事件道歉。"

    "en": "This question tests the ethical and legal considerations surrounding medical error disclosure, particularly in the context of a patient with cognitive impairment. It emphasizes the importance of transparency and communication with the patient's representative.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the key ethical principles at play (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice) and apply them to the specific scenario. Consider the patient's capacity to understand the error and the role of the surrogate decision-maker.",
