    "en": "This woman with dull, near-daily headaches has TENSION HEADACHES (THs), the most common form of headache. THs are likely due to sensitization of peripheral nociceptors leading to increased perception of myofascial pain. Patients typically develop mild to moderate, achy, or pressure-like pain that is often BILATERAL and may involve the occipitonuchal, temporal, or frontal regions of the head. Pericranial MUSCLE TENDERNESS (eg, head, neck, shoulder) is common.\n\nTHs are not associated with other neurologic symptoms or nausea/vomiting and are often precipitated by STRESS and fatigue. They may persist for days, months, or even years but (unlike migraines and cluster headaches) do not typically limit a patient's ability to perform daily functions. Treatment is typically with SIMPLE ANALGESICS (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen).\n\n(Choice A) Chronic sinusitis can cause facial pain and tenderness but is often associated with nasal congestion and mucopurulent nasal drainage. A reduced sense of smell and taste is also common.\n\n(Choice B) Cluster headaches most commonly affect men and present as severe, unilateral, orbital or temporal pain with associated autonomic symptoms (eg, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, diaphoresis). The headaches are typically brief (15-180 minutes), debilitating, and may awaken patients from sleep.\n\n(Choice C) Giant cell arteritis is associated with an acute headache that is typically accompanied by scalp tenderness, visual symptoms, and jaw claudication. It occurs exclusively in older patients (age \\u2265 50) and is often associated with polymyalgia rheumatica.\n\n(Choice D) Brain tumors typically cause nausea, vomiting, and headaches that worsen with changes in body position. In addition, the presence of other focal neurologic signs would be expected due to compression of surrounding brain structures by the expanding tumor.\n\n(Choice E) Migraine headaches are characterized by often debilitating, episodic, unilateral, pulsatile headaches typically associated with nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. Some patients have focal neurologic symptoms that precede or accompany the headache (ie, aura).",
    "zh": "这位有钝痛、几乎每天都头痛的女性患有紧张型头痛 (THs)，这是最常见的头痛形式。THs 可能是由于外周伤害性感受器的敏化，导致肌筋膜疼痛的感知增加。患者通常会出现轻度至中度、酸痛或压迫性疼痛，通常是双侧的，可能涉及头部枕颈、颞部或额部区域。颅周肌肉压痛（例如，头部、颈部、肩部）很常见。\n\nTHs 与其他神经系统症状或恶心/呕吐无关，并且通常由压力和疲劳诱发。它们可能会持续数天、数月甚至数年，但（与偏头痛和丛集性头痛不同）通常不会限制患者执行日常功能的能力。治疗通常采用简单镇痛药（例如，非甾体抗炎药、对乙酰氨基酚）。\n\n（选项 A）慢性鼻窦炎可引起面部疼痛和压痛，但通常与鼻塞和黏液脓性鼻漏有关。嗅觉和味觉减退也很常见。\n\n（选项 B）丛集性头痛最常见于男性，表现为严重的、单侧的、眼眶或颞部疼痛，并伴有自主神经症状（例如，流泪、流涕、出汗）。头痛通常很短暂（15-180 分钟）、使人衰弱，并且可能使患者从睡眠中醒来。\n\n（选项 C）巨细胞性动脉炎与急性头痛相关，通常伴有头皮压痛、视觉症状和颌跛行。它仅发生在老年患者（年龄 ≥ 50 岁）中，并且通常与风湿性多肌痛相关。\n\n（选项 D）脑肿瘤通常引起恶心、呕吐和随着体位改变而加重的头痛。此外，由于膨胀的肿瘤对周围脑结构的压迫，预计会出现其他局灶性神经系统体征。\n\n（选项 E）偏头痛的特征是通常使人衰弱的、阵发性的、单侧的、搏动性头痛，通常与恶心、畏光和畏声有关。一些患者在头痛之前或伴随头痛出现局灶性神经系统症状（即，先兆）。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to differentiate between various types of headaches based on their clinical presentation, including characteristics of pain, associated symptoms, and patient demographics. It requires understanding the typical features of tension headaches, migraines, cluster headaches, chronic sinusitis, and intracranial neoplasms.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully analyze the patient's description of the headache, including its location, quality, severity, duration, frequency, and any associated symptoms. Consider the patient's age, sex, and relevant medical history. Compare these findings to the classic diagnostic criteria for each type of headache to determine the most likely diagnosis.",
