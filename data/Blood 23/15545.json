    "en": "This patient's symptomatic anemia (eg, fatigue, weakness), thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis are associated with a predominance of CD20-positive cells (a B-cell surface marker), raising strong suspicion for CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (CLL). In CLL, mature B cells progressively accumulate in the bone marrow and peripheral blood due to oncogenic mutations that inhibit apoptosis. Although most patients are asymptomatic for years, accumulation of B cells in the bone marrow eventually chokes out normal hematopoiesis, leading to symptomatic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and infections (due to neutropenia).\n\nPatients with CLL usually have dramatic elevations in peripheral leukocyte count (often >100,000/mm³) and characteristic findings on peripheral blood smear (eg, numerous small lymphocytes, smudge cells). The diagnosis is supported by flow cytometry of peripheral blood revealing a clonal population of leukocytes with expression of B-cell surface markers such as CD19, CD20, and CD23.\n\n(Choice A) T-cell leukemia is marked by the clonal expansion of a leukocyte population with T-cell surface markers such as CD2, CD3, and CD4. However, this patient's flow cytometry shows very few CD3-positive cells.\n\n(Choice B) Aplastic anemia is characterized by bone marrow failure and is usually triggered by an infection, medication, radiation, toxic substance, or autoimmune disease. Patients have pancytopenia (not leukocytosis) and bone marrow biopsy shows a hypocellular marrow with morphologically normal hematopoietic cells; a clonal population of B cells would not be seen.\n\n(Choice D) Chronic myeloid leukemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by peripheral leukocytosis due to numerous circulating granulocytes (eg, neutrophils in different stages of maturation). Diagnosis is generally made when cytogenetic studies reveal the BCR-ABL fusion gene. A predominant population of CD20-positive cells (B cells) would not be seen.\n\n(Choice E) Classic Hodgkin lymphoma usually causes localized peripheral lymphadenopathy and B-symptoms (eg, fever, night sweats). The diagnosis is made by lymph node excision, which usually reveals Reed-Sternberg cells that are characteristically positive for CD15 and CD30 immunohistochemical stains. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis would be atypical.\n\nEducational objective:\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia is a lymphoproliferative disorder marked by the progressive accumulation of mature B cells. Most patients are asymptomatic for years but eventually develop anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or neutropenia. The diagnosis is generally made when complete blood count reveals dramatic leukocytosis, and flow cytometry subsequently shows a clonal population of leukocytes with B-cell markers such as CD19, CD20, and CD23.",
    "zh": "该患者的症状性贫血（如疲劳、乏力）、血小板减少和白细胞增多与CD20阳性细胞（B细胞表面标志物）的占优势相关，高度提示慢性淋巴细胞白血病（CLL）。在CLL中，成熟B细胞由于抑制细胞凋亡的致癌突变而在骨髓和外周血中进行性积累。尽管大多数患者多年无症状，但B细胞在骨髓中的积累最终会扼杀正常的造血过程，导致症状性贫血、血小板减少和感染（由于中性粒细胞减少）。\n\nCLL患者通常外周白细胞计数显着升高（通常>100,000/mm³），在外周血涂片上具有特征性发现（如大量小淋巴细胞、涂抹细胞）。外周血流式细胞术揭示表达CD19、CD20和CD23等B细胞表面标志物的白细胞的克隆群体，支持该诊断。\n\n（选项A）T细胞白血病以具有T细胞表面标志物（如CD2、CD3和CD4）的白细胞群体的克隆性扩张为特征。然而，该患者的流式细胞术显示CD3阳性细胞非常少。\n\n（选项B）再生障碍性贫血的特征是骨髓衰竭，通常由感染、药物、放射线、毒性物质或自身免疫性疾病引起。患者出现全血细胞减少（而非白细胞增多），骨髓活检显示骨髓细胞减少，具有形态学正常的造血细胞；不会看到B细胞的克隆群体。\n\n（选项D）慢性髓细胞白血病是一种骨髓增生性肿瘤，其特征是由于大量循环的粒细胞（例如，不同成熟阶段的中性粒细胞）引起外周白细胞增多。当细胞遗传学研究显示BCR-ABL融合基因时，通常做出诊断。不会看到CD20阳性细胞（B细胞）的优势群体。\n\n（选项E）经典型霍奇金淋巴瘤通常会导致局部外周淋巴结病和B症状（如发热、盗汗）。诊断通过淋巴结切除术确定，通常显示Reed-Sternberg细胞，这些细胞特征性地表达CD15和CD30免疫组织化学染色。贫血、血小板减少和白细胞增多是不典型的。\n\n教育目标：\n慢性淋巴细胞白血病是一种淋巴增生性疾病，其特征是成熟B细胞的进行性积累。大多数患者多年无症状，但最终会发展为贫血、血小板减少和/或中性粒细胞减少。当全血细胞计数显示白细胞显着增多，随后流式细胞术显示具有B细胞标志物（如CD19、CD20和CD23）的白细胞的克隆群体时，通常做出诊断。"
