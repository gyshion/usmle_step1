    "en": "A 63-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to dyspnea. Over the past several days, the patient has experienced progressively worsening shortness of breath while walking his dog around the block. In addition, he could not breathe while lying in bed last night and fell asleep only after moving to a recliner. The patient had an acute myocardial infarction 2 years ago and has been nonadherent with his medications and follow-up appointments. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 122/74 mm Hg, pulse is 94/min, and respirations are 22/min. Physical examination shows bibasilar lung crackles, jugular venous distension, and bilateral pitting edema in the lower extremities. Chest x-ray reveals cardiomegaly and pulmonary venous congestion {{exhibit_1}}. Which of the following factors is most likely contributing to this patient's symptoms?",

    "en": "This patient's progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity swelling are consistent with acute decompensated heart failure. Heart failure occurs when a structural or functional cardiac disorder impairs ventricular filling or ejection of blood, causing reduced cardiac output and elevated filling pressure. The reduced cardiac output causes an initial drop in blood pressure, which triggers compensatory neurohormonal activity mainly via stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). These adaptations function together in an effort to improve organ perfusion by increasing cardiac chronotropy and inotropy (improves cardiac output), promoting arterial and venous vasoconstriction (maintains perfusion pressure), and expanding the extracellular fluid compartment (improves circulating blood volume). However, over time, these responses lead to adverse consequences that perpetuate a downward spiral of progressive cardiac deterioration. Chronic hemodynamic stress (eg, increased preload and afterload) and prolonged exposure to sympathetic drive (catecholamines) and RAAS stimulation (angiotensin II, aldosterone) lead to deleterious remodeling with worsening cardiac function and eventual symptomatic decompensation.\n\n(Choices A and B) Decreased cardiac output in heart failure stimulates increased RAAS activity and sympathetic output, resulting in increased arteriolar resistance.\n\n(Choice C) Ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic pressures are increased in heart failure due to increased preload and afterload.\n\n(Choice D) Heart failure triggers the myocardium to secrete natriuretic peptides (ie, atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide) in response to myocardial stretch from volume overload. These peptides stimulate vasodilation and increase salt and water excretion to improve the symptoms of heart failure; however, these positive effects are overpowered by the negative effects of increased sympathetic drive and RAAS activation. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nEducational objective:\nThe reduced cardiac output in heart failure triggers compensatory activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway, resulting in vasoconstriction (increased afterload), fluid retention (increased preload), and deleterious cardiac remodeling. These mechanisms perpetuate a downward spiral of cardiac deterioration, leading to symptomatic decompensated heart failure.",
    "zh": "该患者进行性呼吸困难、端坐呼吸和下肢肿胀与急性失代偿性心力衰竭一致。当结构或功能性心脏疾病损害心室充盈或血液射出时，就会发生心力衰竭，导致心输出量减少和充盈压升高。心输出量减少导致血压最初下降，这会触发代偿性神经激素活性，主要通过刺激交感神经系统和肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统（RAAS）。这些适应共同努力，通过增加心脏正性频率和正性肌力（改善心输出量）、促进动脉和静脉血管收缩（维持灌注压力）以及扩大细胞外液室（改善循环血容量）来改善器官灌注。然而，随着时间的推移，这些反应会导致不良后果，从而使进行性心脏恶化的恶性循环持续存在。慢性血流动力学应激（例如，前负荷和后负荷增加）以及长期暴露于交感神经驱动（儿茶酚胺）和RAAS刺激（血管紧张素II、醛固酮）会导致有害的重塑，使心脏功能恶化，并最终出现症状性失代偿。\n\n（选项A和B）心力衰竭时心输出量降低会刺激RAAS活性和交感神经输出增加，导致小动脉阻力增加。\n\n（选项C）由于前负荷和后负荷增加，心力衰竭时心室舒张末期和收缩末期压力升高。\n\n（选项D）心力衰竭会触发心肌分泌利钠肽（即，心房利钠肽、脑利钠肽），以应对因容量超负荷引起的心肌牵张。这些肽刺激血管舒张并增加盐和水的排泄，以改善心力衰竭的症状；然而，这些积极作用被交感神经驱动和RAAS激活增加的负面影响所压倒。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n教育目标：\n心力衰竭时心输出量降低会触发交感神经系统和肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮通路的代偿性激活，导致血管收缩（后负荷增加）、液体潴留（前负荷增加）和有害的心脏重塑。这些机制使心脏恶化的恶性循环持续存在，导致症状性失代偿性心力衰竭。"
