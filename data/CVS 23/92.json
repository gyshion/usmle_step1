  "explanation": {
    "en": "The gross specimen of this patient's heart demonstrates left ventricular (LV) cavity enlargement consistent with eccentric hypertrophy, which is initially an adaptive mechanism that allows the LV to maintain cardiac output in the setting of increasing volume overload. Multiple disease processes can lead to eccentric hypertrophy, including ischemic heart disease, certain types of valvular disease (ie, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation), and primary myocardial dysfunction (eg, due to viral infection, chronic alcohol abuse, inherited disease) manifesting as dilated cardiomyopathy. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nEventually, progressive eccentric enlargement of the LV becomes maladaptive with overwhelming wall stress leading to decreased ventricular contractility. The reduced cardiac output leads to decompensated heart failure manifesting with fatigue, dyspnea, orthopnea, and peripheral edema. The structural changes to the LV also increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (ie, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation), a potential cause of sudden cardiac death in these patients.\n\n(Choice B) Dynamic LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction can be seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as the degree of LVOT obstruction varies with changes in LV blood volume. Maneuvers or clinical conditions that decrease LV blood volume (eg, Valsalva strain phase, dehydration) exacerbate the obstruction, whereas those that increase LV blood volume (eg, squatting) lessen or may resolve the obstruction.\n\n(Choices C and E) Poor ventricular wall compliance leads to impaired LV filling (diastolic dysfunction). This most commonly occurs as the initial manifestation of hypertensive heart disease with pressure overload leading to concentric LV hypertrophy with thickened LV walls and a small LV cavity. Poor LV wall compliance is also typically present in restrictive cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\n(Choice D) Increased pulmonary vascular resistance can cause right heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension. There is initially right ventricular wall thickening eventually leading to right ventricular cavity enlargement as contractile function begins to fail. This patient's right ventricular wall thickness and cavity size appear normal. {{exhibit_3}}\n\nEducational objective:\nDilation of the left ventricular cavity commonly occurs in response to systolic dysfunction (eg, ischemic heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy) or certain types of valvular disease (ie, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation). Chronic volume overload causes progressive eccentric hypertrophy that eventually leads to reduced ventricular contractility and decompensated heart failure.",
    "zh": "该患者的心脏大体标本显示左心室(LV)腔扩大，这与向心性肥大一致，这最初是一种适应性机制，允许左心室在容量负荷增加的情况下维持心输出量。多种疾病过程可导致向心性肥大，包括缺血性心脏病、某些类型的心瓣膜病（如主动脉瓣关闭不全、二尖瓣关闭不全）和原发性心肌功能障碍（例如，由于病毒感染、慢性酒精滥用、遗传性疾病）表现为扩张型心肌病。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n最终，左心室进行性向心性扩大变得不适应，伴有压倒性的壁应力，导致心室收缩力降低。心输出量减少导致失代偿性心力衰竭，表现为疲劳、呼吸困难、端坐呼吸和周围水肿。左心室的结构变化也增加了心室心律失常（即室性心动过速、室颤）的风险，这是这些患者发生心脏性猝死的潜在原因。\n\n（选项B）在肥厚型心肌病中可见动态性左室流出道（LVOT）梗阻，因为LVOT梗阻的程度随左心室血容量的变化而变化。降低左心室血容量的操作或临床情况（例如，Valsalva屏气阶段、脱水）会加重梗阻，而增加左心室血容量的操作或临床情况（例如，下蹲）会减轻或可能消除梗阻。\n\n（选项C和E）心室壁顺应性差导致左心室充盈受损（舒张功能障碍）。这最常作为高血压性心脏病的最初表现，压力超负荷导致同心性左心室肥大，表现为左心室壁增厚和左心室腔小。心室壁顺应性差也通常存在于限制性心肌病、严重的主动脉瓣狭窄和肥厚型心肌病中。\n\n（选项D）肺血管阻力增加可引起肺动脉高压导致右心衰竭。最初出现右心室壁增厚，最终导致右心室腔扩大，因为收缩功能开始衰竭。该患者的右心室壁厚度和腔大小看起来是正常的。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n教育目标：\n左心室腔扩张通常发生在对收缩功能障碍（例如，缺血性心脏病、扩张型心肌病）或某些类型的心瓣膜病（即主动脉瓣关闭不全、二尖瓣关闭不全）的反应中。慢性容量超负荷会导致进行性向心性肥大，最终导致心室收缩力降低和失代偿性心力衰竭。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of dilated cardiomyopathy and its impact on ventricular function, specifically the reduction in ventricular contractility due to eccentric hypertrophy and volume overload. It also requires differentiating dilated cardiomyopathy from other causes of heart failure, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and pulmonary hypertension.\n\nThe best approach is to analyze the autopsy findings of left ventricular cavity enlargement, which points towards eccentric hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy. Then, consider the patient's symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea, which are consistent with decreased ventricular contractility and heart failure. Rule out other options based on their distinct pathophysiologies and clinical presentations.",
