    "en": "A 12-year-old boy is brought to the office due to gait instability and pruritic skin rash for the past several weeks. His mother reports that he has also been irritable and had loose stools during this time. The patient's childhood development has been unremarkable except for several episodes of similar skin rash that resolved spontaneously. Examination shows scaly, erythematous skin lesions in sun-exposed areas and cerebellar ataxia. Laboratory evaluation shows increased levels of neutral amino acids in the urine. This patient's symptoms would most likely respond to which of the following supplements?",
    "zh": "一名12岁男孩因步态不稳和瘙痒性皮疹数周前来就诊。他的母亲报告说，这段时间他也很烦躁，并有稀便。患者的童年发育没有明显异常，只是曾发生过数次类似的皮疹，但均自发缓解。体格检查显示暴露于阳光下的区域出现鳞屑性红斑性皮损和脑性共济失调。实验室评估显示尿中性氨基酸水平升高。该患者的症状最有可能对以下哪种补充剂有反应？"

    "en": "Patients present with intermittent attacks of PELLAGRA-LIKE SKIN ERUPTIONS (development of a red, rough rash following sun exposure) and CEREBELLAR ATAXIA in early childhood that become less severe with increasing age. Conversion of tryptophan to niacin is responsible for the generation of up to half of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) required for redox reactions; the clinical manifestations of Hartnup disease are primarily due to NIACIN DEFICIENCY. The diagnosis is confirmed by detecting excessive amounts of NEUTRAL AMINO ACIDS (alanine, serine, threonine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) in the urine (NEUTRAL AMINOACIDURIA).",
    "zh": "患者表现为间歇性发作的类似糙皮病的皮疹（暴露于阳光后出现红色、粗糙的皮疹）和幼儿期的脑性共济失调，随着年龄的增长，病情会减轻。色氨酸转化为烟酸是产生氧化还原反应所需的一半以上的烟酰胺腺嘌呤二核苷酸 (NAD+) 的原因；Hartnup病的临床表现主要归因于烟酸缺乏症。诊断通过检测尿中过量的中性氨基酸（丙氨酸、丝氨酸、苏氨酸、缬氨酸、亮氨酸、异亮氨酸、苯丙氨酸、酪氨酸和色氨酸）来确诊（中性氨基酸尿症）。"

    "en": "1) Hartnup disease 2) Hartnup disease is caused by impaired transport of neutral amino acids in the small intestine and proximal tubule of the kidney. Symptoms include pellagra-like skin eruptions and cerebellar ataxia, which occur as a result of niacin deficiency. The diagnosis can be confirmed through detection of excessive amounts of neutral amino acids in the urine.",
