    "en": "A 55-year-old man is evaluated for progressive fatigue, weakness, and unintentional weight loss. He has no other medical issues and takes no medications. Physical examination shows mucosal pallor. Stool testing for occult blood is positive, and a subsequent colonoscopy reveals a solitary mass in the ascending colon. Biopsy is consistent with colon adenocarcinoma, and surgical resection is planned.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Tumor stage reflects the extent of tumor expansion and spread to other tissues. It is the GREATEST PROGNOSTIC PREDICTOR of long-term survival in patients with colorectal cancer and is determined by the following features:\n\n*   Depth of invasion into the intestinal wall: Tumors that have not penetrated the muscularis mucosae have a very good long-term outcome and a very low risk of spread because the colorectal mucosa contains sparse lymphatics. In contrast, the risk of death rises significantly when the tumor invades the MUSCULARIS PROPRIA.\n*   Lymph node involvement: The prognosis worsens when tumor is identified within regional lymph nodes.\n*   Distant metastases: The presence of distant metastases (eg, liver) is generally associated with a very poor prognosis.\n\nTumor grade (ie, degree of differentiation of tumor cells) also affects prognosis but is a less important prognostic indicator than the stage of colorectal cancer. Low-grade tumors have well-differentiated cells that form glands. High-grade (ie, poorly differentiated) tumors form fewer well-defined glands and instead show sheets or cords of tumor cells, often with a high degree of aneuploidy, mitotic figures, and pleomorphism (Choices A, B, and C).\n\n(Choice D) Ascending (right-sided) tumors often cause unexplained iron deficiency anemia from tumor bleeding; descending (left-sided) tumors often grow in an annular fashion and result in bowel dysfunction (eg, constipation, diarrhea, obstruction). Although bowel perforation or obstruction may be associated with a slightly worse prognosis, the presence of clinical symptoms does not seem to be of major prognostic importance.\n\nEducational objective: The most important prognostic factor for patients with colorectal cancer is the tumor stage (extent of tumor expansion and spread). Prognosis deteriorates when tumors penetrate the muscularis propria, spread to lymph nodes, and metastasize to distant sites.",
    "zh": "肿瘤分期反映肿瘤扩散和转移到其他组织的程度。它是结直肠癌患者长期生存的最重要的预后预测因素，由以下特征决定：\n\n*   侵入肠壁的深度：尚未穿透黏膜肌层的肿瘤具有非常好的长期预后和非常低的扩散风险，因为结直肠黏膜包含稀疏的淋巴管。相反，当肿瘤侵入肌层时，死亡风险会显着增加。\n*   淋巴结受累：当在区域淋巴结内识别出肿瘤时，预后会恶化。\n*   远处转移：远处转移（例如，肝脏）的存在通常与非常差的预后相关。\n\n肿瘤分级（即肿瘤细胞分化程度）也会影响预后，但它不如结直肠癌的分期重要。低级别肿瘤具有形成腺体的分化良好的细胞。高级别（即分化不良）肿瘤形成的腺体较少，而是显示肿瘤细胞片状或索状，通常具有高度的非整倍体、有丝分裂象和多形性（选项 A、B 和 C）。\n\n（选项 D）升结肠（右侧）肿瘤通常由于肿瘤出血而引起不明原因的缺铁性贫血；降结肠（左侧）肿瘤通常以环形方式生长，并导致肠道功能障碍（例如，便秘、腹泻、梗阻）。尽管肠穿孔或梗阻可能与略差的预后相关，但临床症状的存在似乎并不具有主要的预后重要性。\n\n教育目标：结直肠癌患者最重要的预后因素是肿瘤分期（肿瘤扩张和扩散的程度）。当肿瘤穿透肌层、扩散到淋巴结并转移到远处部位时，预后会恶化。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of prognostic factors in colorectal cancer, specifically the importance of tumor staging and depth of invasion. It emphasizes that tumor stage, particularly penetration into the muscularis propria, is the most significant predictor of long-term survival. \n\nTo solve this question, prioritize factors related to tumor staging over grading or clinical symptoms. Recognize that depth of invasion into the muscularis propria indicates a more advanced stage and a higher risk of metastasis, leading to a worse prognosis.",
