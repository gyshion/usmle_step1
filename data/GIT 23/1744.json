    "en": "A 71-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to several episodes of bright red blood per rectum. His recent colonoscopy revealed numerous colonic diverticula. Laboratory studies on admission are notable for a hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL with an unremarkable coagulation profile. An abdominal angiogram shows active bleeding from the sigmoid colon. Catheter embolization is planned via the femoral artery. During the procedure, the arterial catheter is most likely to proceed in which of the following orders? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "In this patient with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, arterial embolization (mechanical occlusion of the artery using coils or absorbable substances) is planned to stop the active bleeding originating from his sigmoid colon. The distal one-third of the transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum are all hindgut derivatives. Hindgut structures receive blood from the INFERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY (IMA), a branch of the aorta. These structures are drained by the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV), which does not course with the IMA. The IMV drains blood from the hindgut into the splenic vein, which drains into the portal vein.\n\n(Choice A) The celiac trunk supplies blood to most foregut structures from the lower esophagus to the second part of the duodenum. Foregut derivatives include the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. The celiac trunk also supplies the spleen.\n\n(Choice C) The superior mesenteric artery supplies blood to the midgut, which spans from the third part of the duodenum to the proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon.\n\n(Choices D and E) The internal iliac artery supplies portions of the gut through branches such as the inferior rectal artery (a branch of the internal pudendal artery, which arises from the internal iliac artery) and the middle rectal artery (arises from the internal iliac). The internal pudendal artery supplies blood to the external genitalia. The superior rectal artery is a continuation of the IMA.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe hindgut encompasses the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the rectum. These structures receive their main arterial blood supply from the inferior mesenteric artery.",
    "zh": "对于这位反复出现胃肠道出血的患者，计划进行动脉栓塞术（使用线圈或可吸收物质机械性闭塞动脉），以阻止源于其乙状结肠的活动性出血。横结肠的远端三分之一、降结肠、乙状结肠和直肠都属于后肠衍生物。后肠结构从主动脉的分支肠系膜下动脉 (IMA) 获得血液供应。这些结构由肠系膜下静脉 (IMV) 引流，IMV 不与 IMA 走行。IMV 将血液从后肠引流入脾静脉，脾静脉再引流入门静脉。\n\n（选项 A）腹腔干向从食管下端到十二指肠第二部分的大部分前肠结构供血。前肠衍生物包括肝脏、胰腺和胆囊。腹腔干也供应脾脏。\n\n（选项 C）肠系膜上动脉向中肠供血，中肠的范围从十二指肠的第三部分到横结肠的近端三分之二。\n\n（选项 D 和 E）髂内动脉通过其分支（例如直肠下动脉（源自髂内动脉的阴部内动脉的分支）和直肠中动脉（源自髂内动脉））为部分肠道供血。阴部内动脉向外生殖器供血。直肠上动脉是 IMA 的延续。\n\n教育目标：\n后肠包括横结肠的远端三分之一、降结肠、乙状结肠和直肠。这些结构主要从肠系膜下动脉获得动脉血液供应。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the arterial supply to the hindgut, specifically the sigmoid colon, and the expected path of an arterial catheter during embolization.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the anatomical path from the femoral artery to the inferior mesenteric artery, which supplies the sigmoid colon. The catheter would pass through the external iliac, common iliac, and abdominal aorta before reaching the inferior mesenteric artery.",
    "zh": "此题考察对后肠（特别是乙状结肠）动脉供血的知识，以及栓塞术中动脉导管的预期路径。\n\n要解决此问题，请回忆从股动脉到供应乙状结肠的肠系膜下动脉的解剖路径。导管将穿过髂外动脉、髂总动脉和腹主动脉，然后到达肠系膜下动脉。"
