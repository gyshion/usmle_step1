    "en": "A 15-year-old boy is brought to the clinic for a follow-up appointment. Since early childhood, the boy has had recurrent episodes of pancreatitis requiring hospitalization. The patient has not been hospitalized since his last follow-up appointment a few months ago. However, he has been feeling more tired recently and states he has not been taking his prescribed medications. Family history is notable for recurrent pancreatitis in a sibling. Neurologic examination shows hyporeflexia and decreased proprioception in the lower extremities. Laboratory studies show mild hemolytic anemia. This patient's presentation is most likely due to a deficiency of which of the following?",

    "en": "Patients with recurrent pancreatitis (eg, hereditary, cystic fibrosis) are at risk for EXOCRINE PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY, or decreased secretion of pancreatic enzymes that are involved in the digestion of fat (most important), carbohydrates, and protein. Without enzyme replacement (eg, lipase), patients often develop chronic FAT MALABSORPTION and deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). In this case, the patient's neurologic and hematologic findings are most consistent with VITAMIN E deficiency.\n\nVitamin E primarily serves as a free radical scavenger to protect fatty acids from oxidation; deficiency predisposes cell membranes to OXIDATIVE INJURY. The cells that are most susceptible include NEURONS with long axons (due to large membrane surface area) and ERYTHROCYTES (due to high oxygen exposure). Therefore, the most common clinical manifestations of vitamin E deficiency are:\n\n*   Neuromuscular disease: Involvement of the dorsal column in the spinal cord is associated with the LOSS OF PROPRIOCEPTION and vibratory sense. Spinocerebellar tract degeneration causes ATAXIA, and peripheral nerve dysfunction results in motor and sensory loss and HYPOREFLEXIA. Skeletal myopathy can also contribute to muscle weakness.\n*   Hemolysis: Erythrocyte fragility and a shortened red blood cell lifespan result in HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, which can present with fatigue, as seen in this patient.\n\n(Choices A, B, and C) Niacin (vitamin B3), riboflavin (vitamin B2), and thiamine (vitamin B1) are water soluble and unaffected by fat malabsorption, making deficiency unlikely in this patient who has risk factors for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Moreover, the clinical findings of these vitamin deficiencies are inconsistent with this patient's presentation: Niacin deficiency causes pellagra (eg, dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia), riboflavin deficiency manifests with a normocytic anemia and mucosal changes (eg, stomatitis, cheilitis, glossitis), and thiamine deficiency is characterized by beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.\n\n(Choice D) In contrast to this patient's presentation, vitamin A deficiency manifests with night blindness, dry eyes (xerophthalmia), and hyperkeratosis (thickened, dry skin).\n\n(Choice F) Vitamin K is necessary for hepatic synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Deficiency presents with easy bleeding and bruising, not seen in this patient.\n\nEducational objective: Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, and deficiency can occur in individuals with fat malabsorption due to recurrent pancreatitis. Vitamin E deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility of the neuronal and erythrocyte membranes to oxidative stress. Clinical manifestations include decreased proprioception, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy (eg, hyporeflexia), and hemolytic anemia.",
    "zh": "反复发作胰腺炎（如遗传性、囊性纤维化）的患者，有外分泌性胰腺功能不全的风险，即参与脂肪（最重要）、碳水化合物和蛋白质消化的胰酶分泌减少。如果没有酶替代（如脂肪酶），患者通常会发生慢性脂肪吸收不良，并出现脂溶性维生素（A、D、E和K）缺乏。在这种情况下，患者的神经系统和血液学发现与维生素E缺乏症最为一致。\n\n维生素E主要作为自由基清除剂，保护脂肪酸免受氧化；缺乏会导致细胞膜易受氧化损伤。最易受影响的细胞包括具有长轴突的神经元（由于大的膜表面积）和红细胞（由于高氧暴露）。因此，维生素E缺乏症最常见的临床表现是：\n\n*   神经肌肉疾病：脊髓后索受累与本体感觉和振动觉丧失有关。脊髓小脑束变性引起共济失调，周围神经功能障碍导致运动和感觉丧失以及反射减退。骨骼肌病变也可能导致肌肉无力。\n*   溶血：红细胞脆弱性和红细胞寿命缩短导致溶血性贫血，可表现为疲劳，如该患者所见。\n\n（选项A、B和C）烟酸（维生素B3）、核黄素（维生素B2）和硫胺素（维生素B1）是水溶性维生素，不受脂肪吸收不良的影响，因此在这种有外分泌性胰腺功能不全风险的患者中，缺乏的可能性不大。此外，这些维生素缺乏症的临床表现与该患者的临床表现不符：烟酸缺乏症引起糙皮病（如皮炎、腹泻、痴呆），核黄素缺乏症表现为正细胞性贫血和黏膜改变（如口炎、唇炎、舌炎），硫胺素缺乏症的特征是脚气病和Wernicke-Korsakoff综合征。\n\n（选项D）与该患者的临床表现相反，维生素A缺乏症表现为夜盲、干眼症（眼干燥症）和角化过度（皮肤增厚、干燥）。\n\n（选项F）维生素K是肝脏合成凝血因子II、VII、IX和X所必需的。缺乏症表现为容易出血和瘀伤，在该患者中未见。\n\n教学目标：维生素E是一种脂溶性维生素，由于反复发作胰腺炎导致脂肪吸收不良的个体可能会出现维生素E缺乏症。维生素E缺乏症与神经元和红细胞膜对氧化应激的敏感性增加有关。临床表现包括本体感觉减退、共济失调、周围神经病变（如反射减退）和溶血性贫血。"
