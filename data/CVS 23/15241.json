The patient presents with hypotension, confusion, and hemodynamic parameters indicative of distributive shock (high cardiac output, low central venous pressure, low pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, high mixed venous oxygen saturation, and low systemic vascular resistance). {{exhibit_1}} Septic shock is characterized by peripheral vasodilation, leading to decreased systemic vascular resistance, decreased central venous pressure, and decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. {{exhibit_2}} A compensatory increase in sympathetic drive causes an increase in cardiac output. {{exhibit_3}} The resulting high flow rates lead to incomplete oxygen extraction in the tissues, resulting in high mixed venous oxygen saturation. {{exhibit_4}}",
