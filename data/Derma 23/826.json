    "en": "This patient's small, bright-red, papular lesions are cherry hemangiomas, also known as cherry angiomas or senile hemangiomas. They are the most common benign vascular tumors in adults and typically appear during the third or fourth decade of life. The lesions do not regress spontaneously and often multiply with age. Cherry hemangiomas are always superficial on the skin and are not found on the mucosa or deep tissues. Histologically, they appear as sharply circumscribed areas of congested capillaries and post-capillary venules in the papillary dermis.\n\n(Choice A) Acrochordons (skin tags) are pedunculated outgrowths of normal skin. They are typically seen in areas of friction (eg, neck, axilla, inframammary, groin) of patients with obesity and diabetes mellitus.\n\n(Choice B) Cavernous hemangiomas consist of dilated vascular spaces with thin-walled endothelial cells. They present as soft blue, compressible masses up to a few centimeters in size. They may appear on the skin, mucosa, deep tissues, and viscera. When cavernous hemangiomas appear on the skin, they are most frequently based in the dermis.\n\n(Choice D) Cystic hygromas are comprised of lymphatic cysts lined by a thin endothelium. These benign tumors are often present at birth and are most commonly located on the posterior neck and lateral chest wall. Cystic hygromas are frequently found in neonates with Turner syndrome and Down syndrome.\n\n(Choice E) Spider angiomas consist of a bright red central papule surrounded by several outwardly radiating vessels that blanch with pressure and refill centrifugally upon release. They are associated with increased estrogen states (eg, pregnancy, cirrhosis, oral contraceptive use, estrogen supplement use).\n\n(Choice F) Strawberry (also known as infantile or capillary) hemangiomas appear during the first weeks of life. They initially grow rapidly and then frequently regress spontaneously by late childhood. They are bright red when near the epidermis and more violaceous when deeper. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者的红色丘疹性病灶是樱桃状血管瘤，也称为樱桃血管瘤或老年性血管瘤。它们是成人中最常见的良性血管肿瘤，通常在第三或第四个十年出现。病灶不会自发消退，并且通常会随着年龄的增长而增殖。樱桃状血管瘤始终位于皮肤表面，不在粘膜或深层组织中。从组织学上来看，它们表现为乳头真皮中充血的毛细血管和毛细血管后微静脉的明确区域。\n\n(选项 A) 软垂疣（皮赘）是正常皮肤的蒂状生长物。它们通常见于摩擦区域（例如，颈部、腋窝、乳房下、腹股沟），肥胖和糖尿病患者。\n\n(选项 B) 海绵状血管瘤由扩张的血管腔隙组成，具有薄壁内皮细胞。它们表现为柔软的蓝色、可压缩的肿块，大小可达几厘米。它们可能出现在皮肤、粘膜、深层组织和内脏中。当海绵状血管瘤出现在皮肤上时，它们最常见于真皮。\n\n(选项 D) 囊性水瘤由衬有薄内皮的淋巴囊肿组成。这些良性肿瘤通常在出生时出现，最常见于后颈部和侧胸壁。囊性水瘤常见于患有特纳综合征和唐氏综合征的新生儿。\n\n(选项 E) 蜘蛛痣由一个鲜红色的中心丘疹组成，周围环绕着几个向外辐射的血管，这些血管在受到压力时会变白，并在释放时离心性地充盈。它们与雌激素水平升高有关（例如，怀孕、肝硬化、口服避孕药使用、雌激素补充剂使用）。\n\n(选项 F) 草莓状（也称为婴儿型或毛细血管型）血管瘤在出生后的头几周出现。它们最初生长迅速，然后通常在儿童晚期自发消退。它们靠近表皮时呈鲜红色，较深时呈紫红色。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the clinical presentation and diagnosis of cherry hemangiomas, a common benign vascular tumor in adults. It also requires differentiating cherry hemangiomas from other skin lesions such as acrochordons, cavernous hemangiomas, cystic hygromas, spider angiomas, and strawberry hemangiomas.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key characteristics of the lesions described in the vignette: small, bright-red, papular, non-itchy, and located on the skin. Consider the patient's age and lack of other associated symptoms or risk factors. Eliminate options that do not match these features.",
