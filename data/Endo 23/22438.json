    "en": "An 18-month-old child is brought to the office for evaluation of delayed walking and lower limb deformity. The mother has short stature and underwent corrective surgery for bowed legs when she was an adolescent. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows delayed developmental milestones for gross motor function but age-appropriate findings for social function, vision, speech, and hearing. Musculoskeletal examination reveals widening of the knee joints with significant bowing of the legs. Serum laboratory results are as follows: {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient with lower extremity bowing and enlarged knee epiphyses has rickets. Clinical manifestations reflect defective mineralization at sites of rapid bone growth, leading to thickening and disorganization of growth plate cartilage and accumulation of unmineralized osteoid in the adjacent metaphysis.\n\nRickets can be categorized as calcipenic (low calcium) or phosphopenic (low phosphorus). Calcipenic rickets can be due to low calcium intake or to deficiency or metabolic disorders (eg, receptor defects) of vitamin D, which cause reduced intestinal calcium absorption. This patient has a normal serum calcium level with no compensatory rise in parathyroid hormone (PTH), suggesting adequate calcium intake. The patient's 25-hydroxy- and 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels also are normal, suggesting normal vitamin D stores and metabolism; if there were vitamin D resistance (receptor defect), the vitamin D levels would likely be higher and serum calcium would be low. \n\nThis patient's only abnormality is low serum phosphorus, consistent with phosphopenic rickets. The most common cause is a primary defect in renal phosphate reabsorption (eg, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets).\n\n(Choice A) Rickets due to dietary calcium deficiency (not increased intake) causes a compensatory rise in PTH, which can restore serum calcium levels to normal or near normal. Since PTH upregulates 1-alpha-hydroxylase, patients will also have an elevated 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D level.\n\n(Choice B) 1-alpha-hydroxylase converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D (the more active form). Deficiency can cause rickets (ie, vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1), but 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels would be low.\n\n(Choice C) Hereditary vitamin D–resistant rickets is caused by vitamin D receptor mutations. The loss of vitamin D effect causes decreased intestinal calcium absorption, lowering serum calcium; the compensatory rise in PTH induces 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity, raising 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels above normal values (unlike this patient).\n\nEducational objective:\nRickets is characterized by defective mineralization at sites of rapid bone growth. It can be due to deficiency of calcium or phosphorus. Calcium deficiency conditions are mainly due to vitamin D abnormalities or low dietary calcium intake. Phosphorus deficiency is usually due to impaired renal reabsorption. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者出现下肢弓形腿和膝骺增大，患有佝偻病。临床表现反映了快速骨生长部位的矿化缺陷，导致生长板软骨增厚和紊乱，以及未矿化的骨样组织在相邻干骺端的堆积。\n\n佝偻病可分为低钙性（低钙血症）或低磷性（低磷血症）。低钙性佝偻病可由于钙摄入不足或维生素D的缺乏或代谢紊乱（例如，受体缺陷）引起，导致肠道钙吸收减少。该患者血清钙水平正常，且甲状旁腺激素 (PTH) 无代偿性升高，表明钙摄入充足。患者的 25-羟基和 1.25-二羟基维生素D水平也正常，表明维生素D储存和代谢正常；如果存在维生素D抵抗（受体缺陷），维生素D水平可能会更高，血清钙水平会较低。\n\n该患者唯一的异常是血清磷偏低，与低磷性佝偻病一致。最常见的原因是肾脏磷重吸收的 primary defect（例如，遗传性低磷血症性佝偻病）。\n\n(选项A) 饮食中钙缺乏引起的佝偻病（不是摄入增加）会导致PTH代偿性升高，这可以将血清钙水平恢复到正常或接近正常水平。由于PTH上调1-α-羟化酶，患者也会出现1.25-二羟基维生素D水平升高。\n\n(选项B) 1-α-羟化酶将25-羟基维生素D转化为1.25-二羟基维生素D（活性更高的形式）。缺乏可导致佝偻病（即，维生素D依赖性佝偻病1型），但1.25-二羟基维生素D水平会较低。\n\n(选项C) 遗传性维生素D抵抗性佝偻病是由维生素D受体突变引起的。维生素D效应的丧失导致肠道钙吸收减少，从而降低血清钙水平；PTH代偿性升高诱导1-α-羟化酶活性，使1.25-二羟基维生素D水平升高到正常值以上（与该患者不同）。\n\n教育目标：\n佝偻病的特征是在快速骨生长部位发生矿化缺陷。这可能是由于钙或磷缺乏引起的。钙缺乏症主要由于维生素D异常或饮食中钙摄入不足引起。磷缺乏通常是由于肾脏重吸收受损引起。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of rickets, specifically the differentiation between calcipenic and phosphopenic rickets based on laboratory findings and clinical presentation. It requires understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of each type of rickets and the associated hormonal responses. \n\nTo solve this question, focus on the laboratory findings, particularly the low phosphorus level. Rule out causes of calcipenic rickets based on normal calcium and vitamin D levels.
