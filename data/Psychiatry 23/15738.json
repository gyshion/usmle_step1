    "en": "A 42-year-old man is brought to the hospital after a motor vehicle collision. The patient was driving while intoxicated with alcohol and collided with another car. Evaluation reveals a left tibia and fibula fracture but no other major injuries. He reports no prior medical conditions. The patient is hospitalized and operative repair of the fracture is performed. On the third day in the hospital, he becomes agitated and demands to leave. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 162/94 mm Hg, and pulse is 125/min. On physical examination, the patient is diaphoretic, tremulous, and disoriented. There are mild hand tremors but no other neurologic abnormalities.",

    "en": "This patient is agitated, disoriented, and tremulous with autonomic hyperactivity (eg, hypertension, tachycardia). Development of these symptoms after a period of forced abstinence (ie, admission to the hospital) is consistent with ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL, particularly in patients with known problematic alcohol use.\n\nAlcohol is a strong CNS depressant that binds to the GABA A receptor complex, enhancing the inhibitory action of GABA (the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain), leading to sedation. Chronic ethanol use causes compensatory DOWNREGULATION of GABA A receptors in an attempt to maintain CNS homeostasis. In addition to its effects on GABA neurotransmission, alcohol also inhibits excitatory NMDA glutamate receptors in the brain; similar to GABA receptors, chronic exposure leads to compensatory UP-REGULATION of NMDA receptors.\n\nAbrupt cessation of alcohol use leads to significantly DECREASED GABA activity due to the decreased number of GABA A receptors (Choice A) and INCREASED glutamate activity due to the increased number of NMDA receptors, resulting in CNS OVEREXCITATION and the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.\n\n(Choice C) Increased activity of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the CNS decreases sympathetic output and results in peripheral vasodilation, decreased heart rate, and reduced blood pressure.\n\n(Choice D) Increased activation of the opioid mu receptor occurs with opioid intoxication. It would lead to somnolence with shallow breathing and a decreased respiratory rate. Bradycardia, rather than tachycardia, would be expected.\n\n(Choice E) Serotonin syndrome is caused by overactivation of 5-HT receptors. Although it also results in increased sympathetic activity, it is caused by use of serotonergic agents (eg, SSRIs) rather than alcohol use.\n\nEducational objective:\nChronic alcohol use downregulates inhibitory GABA receptors and upregulates excitatory NMDA glutamate receptors. Therefore, sudden cessation of alcohol leads to decreased GABA activity and increased glutamate activity, resulting in CNS overexcitation (eg, agitation, disorientation, tremulousness, autonomic hyperactivity).",
    "zh": "该患者表现出激动、定向力障碍、震颤，并伴有自主神经功能亢进（例如，高血压、心动过速）。在强制戒酒（即入院）后出现这些症状与酒精戒断一致，尤其是在已知有酗酒问题的患者中。\n\n酒精是一种强效的中枢神经系统抑制剂，与GABA A受体复合物结合，增强GABA（大脑中的主要抑制性神经递质）的抑制作用，从而导致镇静。长期乙醇使用会导致GABA A受体的代偿性下调，以维持中枢神经系统的稳态。除了对GABA神经传递的影响外，酒精还会抑制大脑中兴奋性NMDA谷氨酸受体；与GABA受体类似，长期接触会导致NMDA受体的代偿性上调。\n\n突然停止饮酒会导致GABA活性显着降低，原因是GABA A受体数量减少（选项A），以及谷氨酸活性增加，原因是NMDA受体数量增加，导致中枢神经系统过度兴奋并出现酒精戒断的症状。\n\n（选项C）中枢神经系统中α-2肾上腺素能受体活性的增加会降低交感神经输出，导致外周血管舒张、心率降低和血压降低。\n\n（选项D）阿片μ受体激活增加发生在阿片类药物中毒时。它会导致嗜睡、呼吸浅而呼吸频率降低。预计会出现心动过缓，而不是心动过速。\n\n（选项E）5-羟色胺综合征是由5-HT受体过度激活引起的。虽然它也会导致交感神经活性增加，但它是由使用5-羟色胺能药物（例如，SSRI）而不是酒精引起的。\n\n教育目标：\n长期饮酒会下调抑制性GABA受体并上调兴奋性NMDA谷氨酸受体。因此，突然停止饮酒会导致GABA活性降低和谷氨酸活性增加，导致中枢神经系统过度兴奋（例如，激动、定向力障碍、震颤、自主神经功能亢进）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the neurochemical basis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. It requires knowledge of how chronic alcohol use alters GABA and NMDA receptor function and how abrupt cessation leads to withdrawal symptoms due to the imbalance of these neurotransmitter systems.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the clinical presentation as alcohol withdrawal based on the patient's history and symptoms. Recall the effects of chronic alcohol use on GABA and NMDA receptors, specifically the downregulation of GABA receptors and upregulation of NMDA receptors. Understand that withdrawal occurs due to the sudden removal of alcohol's inhibitory effect, leading to unopposed excitatory neurotransmission.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试了对酒精戒断综合征的神经化学基础的理解。它需要了解长期饮酒如何改变GABA和NMDA受体的功能，以及突然停止饮酒如何由于这些神经递质系统的不平衡而导致戒断症状。\n\n要解决这个问题，请根据患者的病史和症状将临床表现确定为酒精戒断。回想一下长期饮酒对GABA和NMDA受体的作用，特别是GABA受体的下调和NMDA受体的上调。了解戒断的发生是由于突然取消了酒精的抑制作用，从而导致无对抗的兴奋性神经传递。"
