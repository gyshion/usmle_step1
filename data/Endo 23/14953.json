    "en": "A 26-year-old pregnant woman at 16 weeks gestation comes to the office for prenatal follow-up. The patient has a 2-year history of mild hyperthyroidism due to Graves disease and started taking propylthiouracil when she decided to attempt pregnancy. The patient has had no tremulousness, palpitations, diarrhea, or heat intolerance. She has no other medical problems and no drug allergies. She takes a prenatal vitamin. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg, and pulse is 88/min. Physical examination reveals no lid lag, exophthalmos, or hand tremors. The thyroid gland is normal to palpation. Fetal heart rate is normal. Thyroid hormone levels are within the laboratory's reference ranges. During this visit, her thyroid treatment is changed from propylthiouracil to methimazole. Switching the patient's therapy at this time is aimed at decreasing which of the following complications?",
    "zh": "一名26岁的孕妇，孕龄16周，前来就诊进行产前随访。该患者有2年轻度甲状腺功能亢进病史，病因是格雷夫斯病，并且在决定尝试怀孕时开始服用丙硫氧嘧啶。患者无震颤、心悸、腹泻或不耐热。她没有其他疾病史，也没有药物过敏史。她服用产前维生素。患者不吸烟、不饮酒，也不使用非法药物。体温为36.7摄氏度（98华氏度），血压为110/60毫米汞柱，脉搏为88次/分钟。体格检查显示无眼睑迟滞、眼球突出或手部震颤。甲状腺触诊正常。胎儿心率正常。甲状腺激素水平在实验室的参考范围内。在这次就诊期间，她的甲状腺治疗从丙硫氧嘧啶改为甲巯咪唑。此时更换患者的治疗方案，旨在减少以下哪种并发症？"

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Thionamide antithyroid drugs (eg, propylthiouracil [PTU], methimazole) are used to decrease thyroid hormone production. In Graves disease, they can be used to induce a euthyroid state in preparation for definitive treatment with radioiodine or surgery and can sometimes achieve remission in patients with mild disease.\n\nMethimazole is preferred for most patients due the hepatotoxicity of PTU; PTU often causes transient elevations in hepatic transaminases and occasionally can cause severe idiosyncratic liver injury with acute liver failure. However, methimazole has potential teratogenic effects (eg, aplasia cutis [Choice A], esophageal atresia, facial anomalies), so PTU is preferred in the first trimester of pregnancy. Thereafter, the patient should be returned to methimazole therapy.\n\n(Choice B) Thyroid dysgenesis (abnormal development of the thyroid gland) can manifest as absence (agenesis), ectopic location, or hypoplasia of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is normally fully developed by week 12; therefore, switching from PTU to methimazole at 16 weeks gestation is unlikely to cause thyroid dysgenesis.\n\nThionamide antithyroid drugs can cause hypothyroidism with goiter (rather than dysgenesis) in newborns, but the effects are typically transient as the drugs are cleared within days.\n\n(Choice D) Graves ophthalmopathy is due to the activation of TSH receptors on orbital fibroblasts by thyrotropin receptor autoantibodies, which leads to the expansion of the ground substance of retro-orbital tissues and edema of the extraocular muscles. Radioiodine therapy for Graves disease can acutely worsen ophthalmopathy, but this is less of a concern with antithyroid drugs.\n\n(Choice E) Risk factors for thyroid cancer include exposure to ionizing radiation, iodine-deficient diet, and certain familial cancer syndromes (eg, familial adenomatous polyposis). Antithyroid drugs do not increase the risk for thyroid cancer.\n\nEducational objective:\nThionamide antithyroid drugs (eg, propylthiouracil [PTU], methimazole) are used to decrease thyroid hormone production. Methimazole is preferred for most patients due to the hepatotoxicity of PTU. However, methimazole has potential teratogenic effects, so PTU is preferred in the first trimester of pregnancy.",
    "zh": "硫脲类抗甲状腺药物（例如，丙硫氧嘧啶[PTU]、甲巯咪唑）用于减少甲状腺激素的产生。在格雷夫斯病中，它们可用于诱导甲状腺功能正常状态，为使用放射性碘或手术的确定性治疗做准备，有时可以在轻度疾病患者中实现缓解。\n\n甲巯咪唑是大多数患者的首选药物，因为PTU具有肝毒性；PTU经常会导致肝转氨酶的短暂升高，偶尔会导致严重的特发性肝损伤，并伴有急性肝衰竭。然而，甲巯咪唑具有潜在的致畸作用（例如，皮肤发育不全[选项A]、食管闭锁、面部异常），因此在妊娠早期首选PTU。此后，应将患者转回甲巯咪唑治疗。\n\n（选项B）甲状腺发育异常（甲状腺异常发育）可表现为甲状腺缺失（发育不全）、异位或发育不良。甲状腺通常在第12周完全发育；因此，在妊娠16周时从PTU切换到甲巯咪唑不太可能导致甲状腺发育异常。\n\n硫脲类抗甲状腺药物可导致新生儿甲状腺功能减退伴甲状腺肿（而不是发育异常），但这些影响通常是短暂的，因为药物会在几天内清除。\n\n（选项D）格雷夫斯眼病是由于促甲状腺激素受体自身抗体激活眶成纤维细胞上的TSH受体，导致眶后组织基质扩张和眼外肌水肿。格雷夫斯病的放射性碘治疗会急性加重眼病，但在使用抗甲状腺药物时，这方面的顾虑较少。\n\n（选项E）甲状腺癌的危险因素包括暴露于电离辐射、缺碘饮食和某些家族性癌症综合征（例如，家族性腺瘤性息肉病）。抗甲状腺药物不会增加患甲状腺癌的风险。\n\n教学目标：\n硫脲类抗甲状腺药物（例如，丙硫氧嘧啶[PTU]、甲巯咪唑）用于减少甲状腺激素的产生。由于PTU的肝毒性，大多数患者首选甲巯咪唑。然而，甲巯咪唑具有潜在的致畸作用，因此在妊娠早期首选PTU。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the management of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, specifically the use of propylthiouracil (PTU) and methimazole and their associated risks. It assesses the understanding of why PTU is preferred in the first trimester and why switching to methimazole is considered later in pregnancy.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the teratogenic effects of methimazole in the first trimester and the higher risk of hepatotoxicity associated with PTU. Therefore, switching from PTU to methimazole after the first trimester aims to reduce the risk of maternal hepatotoxicity.",
