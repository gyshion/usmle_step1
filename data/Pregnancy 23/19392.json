    "en": "A 31-year-old woman, gravida 3 para 2, at 28 weeks gestation comes to the office for a prenatal visit. She has chronic hypertension that has been well controlled during this pregnancy. At the patient's previous prenatal visits, her blood pressure ranged from 120/70 to 130/80 mm Hg. Today, her blood pressure is 150/100 mm Hg and repeat is 152/98 mm Hg. Fundal height is 24 cm. Urinalysis shows 2+ protein. A transabdominal ultrasound reveals oligohydramnios and a fetus with growth restriction. Compared to normal placental parameters, this patient most likely has which of the following hemodynamic changes? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient presents with new-onset hypertension (150/100 mm Hg) and proteinuria (2+), consistent with preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is characterized by abnormal placental development, leading to increased placental vascular resistance. This reduced blood flow to the placenta results in decreased uteroplacental perfusion and consequently, decreased umbilical vein oxygen delivery to the fetus. The ultrasound findings of oligohydramnios and fetal growth restriction are also consistent with these hemodynamic changes. Therefore, the most likely hemodynamic changes are increased placental vascular resistance, decreased uteroplacental perfusion, and decreased umbilical vein oxygen delivery. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "患者出现新发高血压（150/100 mmHg）和蛋白尿（2+），与先兆子痫一致。先兆子痫的特征是胎盘发育异常，导致胎盘血管阻力增加。这导致胎盘血流量减少，从而导致子宫胎盘灌注减少，进而导致脐静脉氧输送减少至胎儿。超声检查发现羊水过少和胎儿生长受限也与这些血流动力学变化一致。因此，最有可能的血流动力学变化是胎盘血管阻力增加、子宫胎盘灌注减少和脐静脉氧输送减少。 {{exhibit_1}}"
