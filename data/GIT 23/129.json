    "en": "A 54-year-old man is evaluated for episodic abdominal discomfort, bloating sensation, and flatulence along with occasional diarrhea. He has neither visible blood in the stool nor unexplained weight loss. The patient has tried avoiding dairy products, but his symptoms did not improve. On examination, there is mild epigastric tenderness on deep palpation. Stool occult blood testing is positive. Endoscopic evaluation reveals an area of nodular hyperemic mucosa, which is biopsied. Histopathologic evaluation shows hyperplasia affecting branched, tubular submucosal glands containing alkaline secretions. This patient's biopsy specimen was most likely taken from which of the following gastrointestinal sites {{exhibit_1}}?",

    "en": "This patient's gastrointestinal biopsy demonstrates submucosal glands, a characteristic microscopic feature of the duodenum. The integrity of the duodenal mucosa depends on the complete and rapid neutralization of hydrochloric acid in gastric contents. This is accomplished by ALKALINE SECRETIONS from 2 primary sources:\n\n*   Submucosal (Brunner) glands secrete copious amounts of alkaline mucus. These glands are most numerous in the first part of the duodenum (near the pylorus) but may be found intermittently up to the ampulla of Vater. The ducts of these glands pass through the muscularis mucosa and terminate in the mucosal crypts (crypts of Lieberkühn).\n*   The epithelial cells of the pancreatic ductules and ducts produce watery secretions containing high concentrations of bicarbonate ions. The strongly alkaline PANCREATIC SECRETIONS are then emptied into the duodenum at the ampulla.\n\nBicarbonate secretion from the submucosal glands is induced by tactile stimulation of the duodenal mucosa and increased parasympathetic activity following meals. In addition, the presence of acid in the duodenum causes the release of secretin from the mucosa, which stimulates bicarbonate secretion from the submucosal glands and pancreas.\n\nExcess gastric acid secretion (eg, caused by antral Helicobacter pylori infection) can eventually lead to HYPERPLASIA of the submucosal glands, imparting a nodular appearance endoscopically. Increasing levels of gastric acid may ultimately overwhelm the mucosal defense systems, resulting in duodenal mucosal injury (eg, epigastric discomfort, bloating, flatulence, bleeding).\n\n(Choices A and C) The antrum of the stomach contains numerous mucosal pyloric glands that secrete copious mucus for protection. The body and fundus of the stomach contain mucosal oxyntic glands that secrete gastric acid. However, submucosal glands are not present in the stomach.\n\n(Choice D) The mucosal villi and crypts in the jejunum contain goblet cells (secrete mucus) and enterocytes (secrete water and electrolytes); these secretions have only minimal bicarbonate content. Submucosal glands are not present in the jejunum.\n\n(Choices E and F) Bicarbonate is secreted by epithelial cells in the ileal villi and colonic crypts to neutralize acid produced by colonic bacteria. Submucosal glands are not present in these locations.\n\nEducational objective:\nGastric acid is neutralized by bicarbonate from the submucosal (Brunner) glands of the duodenum and from pancreatic duct secretions. Chronic overproduction of gastric acid can lead to hyperplasia of the submucosal glands.",
    "zh": "该患者的胃肠活检显示黏膜下腺体，这是十二指肠的特征性微观特征。十二指肠黏膜的完整性取决于胃内容物中盐酸的完全和快速中和。这通过来自两个主要来源的碱性分泌物来实现：\n\n*   黏膜下（Brunner）腺体分泌大量碱性黏液。这些腺体在十二指肠的第一部分（靠近幽门）中最多，但可能间歇性地发现至Vater壶腹。这些腺体的导管穿过黏膜肌层，终止于黏膜隐窝（Lieberkühn隐窝）。\n*   胰管和小管的上皮细胞产生含高浓度碳酸氢根离子的水样分泌物。强碱性胰腺分泌物随后排入十二指肠壶腹。\n\n来自黏膜下腺体的碳酸氢盐分泌由十二指肠黏膜的触觉刺激和餐后增加的副交感神经活动引起。此外，十二指肠中酸的存在导致黏膜释放促胰液素，从而刺激黏膜下腺体和胰腺分泌碳酸氢盐。\n\n过量的胃酸分泌（例如，由胃窦幽门螺杆菌感染引起）最终可能导致黏膜下腺体增生，从而在内镜下呈现结节状外观。胃酸水平升高最终可能压倒黏膜防御系统，导致十二指肠黏膜损伤（例如，剑突下不适、腹胀、胀气、出血）。\n\n（选项A和C）胃窦包含大量黏膜幽门腺，这些腺体分泌大量黏液以提供保护。胃体和胃底包含黏膜壁细胞，分泌胃酸。然而，胃中不存在黏膜下腺体。\n\n（选项D）空肠中的黏膜绒毛和隐窝包含杯状细胞（分泌黏液）和肠细胞（分泌水和电解质）；这些分泌物仅含少量碳酸氢盐。空肠中不存在黏膜下腺体。\n\n（选项E和F）碳酸氢盐由回肠绒毛和结肠隐窝中的上皮细胞分泌，以中和结肠细菌产生的酸。这些位置不存在黏膜下腺体。\n\n教育目标：\n胃酸通过来自十二指肠的黏膜下（Brunner）腺体和胰管分泌物的碳酸氢盐被中和。长期胃酸过度产生可导致黏膜下腺体增生。"
