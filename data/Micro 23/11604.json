    "en": "A 20-year-old woman comes to an urgent care center due to pain with intercourse and dysuria for the last 3 days. She also has had low-grade fevers and a mild headache. The patient is otherwise healthy and takes oral contraceptives only. She has no history of urinary tract or sexually transmitted infections. The patient is sexually active and recently began a relationship with a new partner. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F). The abdomen is soft and nontender. Pelvic examination shows multiple, painful, shallow ulcers with an erythematous base on the left labium. No vaginal discharge is present. Bimanual examination reveals no cervical motion tenderness. There is bilateral tender inguinal lymphadenopathy.",

    "en": "This patient most likely has a HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS (HSV) infection. HSV classically presents with multiple, painful genital ulcers with a characteristic erythematous base, dysuria (likely due to irritation of the ulcers), tender bilateral lymphadenopathy (common with primary genital HSV infection), and systemic symptoms (eg, fever, headache) in the setting of a new sexual partner.\n\nThe appearance of genital HSV lesions can vary and mimic other disease processes as the lesions change from vesicles to ulcers. Therefore, a suspected clinical diagnosis of genital HSV requires laboratory confirmation via PCR, viral culture (low sensitivity, particularly as lesions heal), direct fluorescence antibody testing, or Tzanck smear (showing multinucleated giant cells).\n\n(Choice A) Lymph node biopsy is a relatively invasive procedure typically used to exclude malignancy or certain infections such as tuberculosis. Biopsies of genital lesions may be performed if the diagnosis is unclear or if there is no response to initial treatment.\n\n(Choice B) Darkfield microscopy can be used to diagnose syphilis, which typically presents with painless ulcerations (chancre) and bilateral, nonpainful lymphadenopathy.\n\n(Choice C) Gonorrhea, caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, commonly results in urethritis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease; Gram stain can reveal gram-negative diplococci. Chancroid (due to Haemophilus ducreyi) presents with purulent ulcers with ragged borders and suppurative lymphadenopathy; Gram stain may occasionally reveal gram-negative rods in a school-of-fish chain.\n\n(Choice E) Potassium hydroxide is a strong base that destroys epithelial cells and leukocytes but not fungus. Therefore, KOH can clear a specimen of cellular debris so that fungal elements may be visualized under a microscope. KOH preparation is often used to diagnose vulvovaginal candidiasis, which typically presents with a white vaginal discharge; genital ulcers would be atypical.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe finding of multiple painful genital ulcers and constitutional symptoms in a sexually active patient is highly suggestive of primary genital infection with herpes simplex virus. The diagnosis can be established by PCR testing, direct fluorescence antibody testing, or Tzanck smear.",
    "zh": "该患者很可能患有单纯疱疹病毒(HSV)感染。HSV的典型表现为多发、疼痛的生殖器溃疡，具有特征性的红斑基底，排尿困难（可能由于溃疡刺激），触痛性双侧淋巴结病（常见于原发性生殖器HSV感染）以及全身症状（如发烧、头痛），并且有新的性伴侣。\n\n生殖器HSV病变的表现可能各异，并且随着病变从水疱发展为溃疡，可能与其他疾病过程相似。因此，对生殖器HSV的临床诊断需要通过PCR、病毒培养（敏感性低，尤其是在病变愈合时）、直接荧光抗体检测或Tzanck涂片（显示多核巨细胞）进行实验室确认。\n\n(选项A) 淋巴结活检是一种相对侵入性的操作，通常用于排除恶性肿瘤或某些感染，如结核病。如果诊断不明确或对初始治疗无反应，则可以进行生殖器病变的活检。\n\n(选项B) 暗视野显微镜可用于诊断梅毒，梅毒通常表现为无痛性溃疡（硬下疳）和双侧、无痛性淋巴结病。\n\n(选项C) 淋病，由淋病奈瑟菌引起，常导致尿道炎、宫颈炎和盆腔炎；革兰染色可显示革兰阴性双球菌。软下疳（由杜克雷嗜血杆菌引起）表现为边缘粗糙的脓性溃疡和化脓性淋巴结病；革兰染色偶尔可显示鱼群状排列的革兰阴性杆菌。\n\n(选项E) 氢氧化钾是一种强碱，可破坏上皮细胞和白细胞，但不能破坏真菌。因此，KOH可以清除标本中的细胞碎片，从而可以在显微镜下观察到真菌元素。KOH制剂常用于诊断外阴阴道念珠菌病，其典型表现为白色阴道分泌物；生殖器溃疡是不典型的。\n\n教学目标：\n在有性生活的患者中发现多发疼痛性生殖器溃疡和全身症状，高度提示原发性生殖器单纯疱疹病毒感染。诊断可以通过PCR检测、直接荧光抗体检测或Tzanck涂片来确定。"
