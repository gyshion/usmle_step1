    "en": "A 38-year-old woman comes to the office due to worsening dysmenorrhea and tension headaches for the past 3 months. She was recently promoted to school principal and says, \"It is more stressful than I anticipated; I often have to work late to catch up on paperwork and am not sleeping very well.\" The patient is married and has no children. While answering questions regarding her sexual history, she bursts into tears. When the physician asks the patient what is upsetting her, she covers her face and says she was sexually abused as a child.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Physicians must respond to revelations of sexual abuse with clear expressions of empathy and support. Conveying empathy by acknowledging the patient's distress and a willingness to listen to the patient's thoughts and feelings about the abuse is the most appropriate initial response. This empathic acknowledgment will help the patient feel understood and strengthen the physician-patient relationship. Once this initial support is established, further resources and referrals can be offered as needed.\n\nPatients will have varying degrees of comfort in discussing prior trauma, and the physician should follow the patient's lead in exploring this sensitive area. Patients should be given the opportunity to talk about the abuse but should not be pressured into doing so. Some patients may indicate that they are not ready or willing to talk more about the trauma. In these cases, the physician should acknowledge the trauma and convey willingness to discuss it in the future.\n\n(Choice A) Although referral to a therapist may be indicated later, the physician should initially communicate willingness to hear about the trauma directly.\n\n(Choice B) This statement acknowledges the patient's distress but assumes that she does not wish to talk about the abuse. It may also convey that the physician does not want to listen. It is more appropriate to provide an opportunity for the patient to disclose details if she is willing.\n\n(Choice C) This response puts pressure on the patient to provide further details without first assessing her willingness to divulge more about the abuse.\n\n(Choice D) This statement expresses sympathy (feeling sorry for) rather than empathy (understanding the patient's feelings) and redirects the conversation away from the patient's emotional distress to screening her for symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. This could be perceived by the patient as an implicit message that the physician is not comfortable with or willing to discuss her emotions. Asking further questions about her response to the trauma could be appropriate later in the interview.",
    "zh": "医生必须对性虐待的揭露做出明确的同情和支持的表达。通过承认患者的痛苦以及愿意倾听患者对虐待的想法和感受来传达同情是最合适的初步反应。这种同情的承认将有助于患者感到被理解，并加强医患关系。一旦建立了这种初步的支持，就可以根据需要提供进一步的资源和转诊。\n\n患者在讨论过去的创伤时会有不同程度的舒适度，医生应遵循患者的引导来探索这个敏感的领域。应该给患者机会谈论虐待，但不应强迫这样做。一些患者可能表示他们还没有准备好或不愿意更多地谈论创伤。在这些情况下，医生应该承认创伤并表示愿意在将来讨论它。\n\n(选项 A) 尽管稍后可能需要转诊给治疗师，但医生最初应传达愿意直接听取关于创伤的信息。\n\n(选项 B) 这种说法承认了患者的痛苦，但假设她不想谈论虐待。它也可能传达出医生不想听。更合适的是为患者提供一个机会，如果她愿意，可以透露细节。\n\n(选项 C) 这种反应迫使患者提供更多细节，而没有首先评估她披露更多关于虐待的意愿。\n\n(选项 D) 这种说法表达同情（感到抱歉）而不是同情（理解患者的感受），并将谈话从患者的情绪困扰转移到筛查她的创伤后应激障碍症状。这可能被患者理解为医生对讨论她的情绪感到不舒服或不愿意的暗示。稍后在访谈中询问更多关于她对创伤的反应可能更合适。"
