    "en": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the office by his parents due to behavioral difficulties. His mother says, \"He is physically healthy and affectionate but has become more defiant and often resists our instructions about getting ready for bed. He plays roughly with his 6-year-old brother and sometimes throws tantrums when he has to share his toys or put them away.\" His preschool teacher describes him as an \"active child\" who sometimes talks out loud to classmates while the teacher is speaking. He is easily distracted and often gets up to walk around the classroom. The patient is able to draw circles, speak 3-word sentences, walk up the stairs with alternating feet, and use the toilet, but he cannot wipe himself. His parents express concern about his inability to fully dress himself and about his bed-wetting, which occurs approximately twice a week. Physical examination is unremarkable.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is E. This boy is exhibiting age-appropriate behavior. A short attention span, increased motor activity (eg, difficulty staying seated), occasional impulsivity (eg, speaking out of turn, throwing tantrums when toys are taken), and oppositional behavior at bedtime are consistent with normal developmental variation in young children. This boy also demonstrates normal developmental milestones at age 3, including the ability to copy a circle, walk up stairs with alternating feet, and speak in 3-word sentences. Three-year-olds try to put on some items of clothing (eg, loose-fitting pants, jacket) but need help to fully get dressed, as seen here. In addition, most are potty-trained during the day but still need help wiping and may not achieve nocturnal urinary continence until age 5 (Choice C).\n\n(Choice A) There is substantial overlap between the normal behavior of preschoolers and the symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); therefore, a diagnosis of ADHD is not typically made before age 4. If symptoms of inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity continue and persist through kindergarten and cause impairment in at least 2 settings (eg, school and home), then further evaluation for ADHD and other behavioral disorders is appropriate.\n\n(Choices B and F) The diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is reserved for children and adolescents with a persistent pattern of irritability, defiance, and vindictiveness. In contrast, this boy's defiant behavior at bedtime and fighting with his sibling are common and developmentally normal at his age. In conduct disorder, antisocial behavior is more severe and involves violation of the basic rights of others or major societal norms.\n\n(Choice D) Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by a persistently irritable or angry mood and temper tantrums that are inconsistent with developmental level.\n\nEducational objective:\nShort attention span and varying degrees of hyperactivity, impulsivity (eg, tantrums), and defiant behavior are commonly seen in young children. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder should not be diagnosed until age ≥4.",
    "zh": "正确答案是E。这个男孩表现出符合年龄的行为。注意力不集中、运动活动增加（例如，难以保持坐姿）、偶尔的冲动（例如，插嘴，在拿走玩具时发脾气）以及睡前的对抗行为与幼儿的正常发育变化一致。这个男孩还表现出3岁时的正常发育里程碑，包括能够复制一个圆圈、交替脚上楼梯和说3个字的句子。3岁的孩子会尝试穿上一些衣服（例如，宽松的裤子、夹克），但需要帮助才能完全穿好衣服，就像这里看到的那样。此外，大多数孩子在白天都已经学会了自己上厕所，但仍然需要帮助擦拭，并且可能要到5岁才能实现夜间尿失禁（选项C）。\n\n（选项A）学龄前儿童的正常行为与注意力缺陷多动障碍（ADHD）的症状之间存在很大的重叠；因此，ADHD的诊断通常在4岁之前不做。如果注意力不集中、多动和冲动的症状持续存在并持续到幼儿园，并在至少2个环境中（例如，学校和家庭）引起损害，那么应对ADHD和其他行为障碍进行进一步评估。\n\n（选项B和F）对立违抗性障碍的诊断保留给具有持续的易怒、反抗和报复模式的儿童和青少年。相比之下，这个男孩在睡前和他的兄弟姐妹打架的反抗行为在他的年龄是常见的，并且在发育上是正常的。在行为障碍中，反社会行为更为严重，涉及侵犯他人的基本权利或主要的社会规范。\n\n（选项D）破坏性心境失调障碍的特征是持续的易怒或愤怒情绪和与发育水平不符的暴怒。\n\n教育目标：\n幼儿通常会表现出注意力不集中、不同程度的多动、冲动（例如，发脾气）和反抗行为。注意力缺陷多动障碍不应在≥4岁之前诊断。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of normal developmental milestones in preschoolers and the differentiation between age-appropriate behavior and early signs of behavioral disorders. It requires knowledge of gross motor, fine motor, language, and social/cognitive development for a 3-year-old.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully evaluate the described behaviors and compare them against established developmental norms for a 3-year-old. The provided table of developmental milestones is crucial for this comparison. By identifying that the child's behaviors align with typical development for his age, the correct answer can be determined, ruling out more serious diagnoses.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试了对学龄前儿童正常发育里程碑的理解，以及对符合年龄的行为和行为障碍早期征兆的区分。它需要了解3岁儿童的大肌肉运动、精细运动、语言和社会/认知发展。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须仔细评估所描述的行为，并将它们与3岁儿童的既定发育规范进行比较。所提供的发育里程碑表格对此比较至关重要。通过确定孩子的行为与他这个年龄的典型发育相符，可以确定正确答案，从而排除更严重的诊断。"
