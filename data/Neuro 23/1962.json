    "en": "A 34-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to severe headache. The patient describes unbearable, throbbing pain around his right eye that awakened him. Over the past week, he has had several similar episodes, which spontaneously resolved after 20-30 minutes. He has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. The patient smokes a pack of cigarettes daily and drinks alcohol on social occasions. On physical examination, he appears restless and paces in the room. There is mild conjunctival injection and miosis of the right eye. Neurologic examination shows no abnormalities.",

    "en": "This young man with throbbing, unilateral periorbital headache associated with conjunctival injection and miosis has CLUSTER HEADACHES. The pathogenesis of cluster headaches is poorly understood but likely includes genetic predisposition, vascular dilation, and activation of the trigeminal-autonomic reflex. Males are affected more commonly than females.\n\nCluster headaches present with rapid-onset, severe, UNILATERAL PERIORBITAL and temporal pain; patients are often restless or agitated during episodes. IPSILATERAL AUTONOMIC SYMPTOMS due to parasympathetic hyperactivity are common and include nasal congestion, lacrimation, ptosis, miosis, and conjunctival injection. The headaches typically last 15-180 minutes and tend to occur in clusters (often at the same time each day, even if asleep) over a period of several weeks.\n\n(Choice A) Cavernous sinus thrombosis typically occurs in patients with thrombophilia (eg, malignancy, antithrombin deficiency) or as a septic thrombosis related to a sinus infection or facial cellulitis. Orbital pain is common; however, it is typically worsened with eye movement. Periorbital swelling, fever, and proptosis are other frequent findings.\n\n(Choice C) Migraine without aura typically causes severe, pulsatile, unilateral headache often associated with photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Miosis and lacrimation are unexpected.\n\n(Choice D) Opiate withdrawal can cause lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and diaphoresis, but would usually cause bilateral symptoms. It typically also causes gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, diarrhea, nausea), piloerection, and mydriasis; orbital pain is unexpected.\n\n(Choice E) Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) causes sudden, \"electric\" pain in the distribution of the maxillary and/or mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve, often preceded by light touch. Episodes last for seconds and do not typically occur during sleep.\n\n(Choice F) Vertebrobasilar ischemia can cause headaches but also typically causes dizziness, double vision or vision loss, and ataxia.\n\nEducational objective:\nCluster headaches cause severe, episodic, unilateral periorbital and temporal pain associated with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms (eg, lacrimation, nasal congestion, miosis, conjunctival injection). The headaches typically last 15-180 minutes and tend to occur in clusters (often at the same time each day, even if asleep). Males are affected more commonly than females.",
    "zh": "这位有搏动性、单侧眶周头痛，伴有结膜充血和瞳孔缩小的年轻男性患有丛集性头痛。丛集性头痛的发病机制尚不清楚，但可能包括遗传易感性、血管扩张和三叉神经-自主神经反射的激活。男性比女性更容易受到影响。\n\n丛集性头痛表现为快速发作的、严重的、单侧眶周和颞部疼痛；患者在发作期间通常会烦躁或激动。由于副交感神经功能亢进引起的同侧自主神经症状很常见，包括鼻塞、流泪、眼睑下垂、瞳孔缩小和结膜充血。头痛通常持续15-180分钟，并且往往以丛集形式发生（通常在每天的同一时间，即使在睡眠中）持续数周。\n\n（选项A）海绵窦血栓形成通常发生在有血栓形成倾向的患者（例如，恶性肿瘤、抗凝血酶缺乏症）或与鼻窦感染或面部蜂窝织炎相关的败血性血栓形成。眶周疼痛很常见；然而，通常会因眼球运动而加重。眶周肿胀、发热和眼球突出是其他常见发现。\n\n（选项C）无先兆偏头痛通常会引起严重的、搏动性的、单侧头痛，常伴有畏光、畏声、恶心和呕吐。瞳孔缩小和流泪是意料之外的。\n\n（选项D）阿片类药物戒断可引起流泪、鼻溢和出汗，但通常会引起双侧症状。它通常也会引起胃肠道症状（例如，腹泻、恶心）、竖毛和瞳孔散大；眶周疼痛是意料之外的。\n\n（选项E）三叉神经痛（抽搐性疼痛）会导致三叉神经上颌和/或下颌分支分布区域的突发性“电击样”疼痛，通常先于轻触。发作持续数秒，通常不会在睡眠期间发生。\n\n（选项F）椎基底动脉缺血可引起头痛，但也通常会引起头晕、复视或视力丧失以及共济失调。\n\n教育目标：\n丛集性头痛引起严重的、阵发性的、单侧眶周和颞部疼痛，伴有同侧自主神经症状（例如，流泪、鼻塞、瞳孔缩小、结膜充血）。头痛通常持续15-180分钟，并且往往以丛集形式发生（通常在每天的同一时间，即使在睡眠中）。男性比女性更容易受到影响。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cluster headache presentation, diagnostic criteria, and differentiating features from other headache types. It also assesses understanding of associated autonomic symptoms and risk factors.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the unilateral periorbital headache, associated autonomic symptoms (conjunctival injection, miosis), restlessness, and the episodic nature of the headaches occurring over a period of weeks. Rule out other headache types based on their distinct features.",
