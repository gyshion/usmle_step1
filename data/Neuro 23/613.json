    "en": "A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. His wife reports that he has been having episodic headaches, nausea, and progressive weakness for the past several weeks. The headaches are particularly worse at night and occasionally awaken him. Other medical conditions include well-controlled hypertension and osteoarthritis. On physical examination, the patient is postictal but follows simple commands. He is admitted to the hospital for further evaluation but dies several days later due to aspiration pneumonia and septic shock. During autopsy, examination of the brain shows a poorly circumscribed, hemorrhagic, necrotic mass in the left cerebral hemisphere with a midline shift away from the mass. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient's brain mass likely represents GLIOBLASTOMA, the most common primary cerebral tumor in adults. Glioblastoma is an astrocytic tumor typically located within the cerebral hemispheres. These tumors produce high amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor, resulting in rapid tumor growth and substantial microvascular proliferation. The newly formed (highly fenestrated) vessels generate large amounts of vasogenic edema, causing significant mass effect (frequently with midline shift). Patients have symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (eg, headache, nausea), focal neurologic deficits (eg, weakness), and seizures that rapidly progress within weeks. On gross examination, glioblastomas are typically POORLY CIRCUMSCRIBED lesions with a variegated appearance, often showing areas of NECROSIS and HEMORRHAGE. Some may cross the corpus callosum, creating a characteristic butterfly shape. Glioblastomas are highly malignant with a very poor prognosis; most patients die within 2 years of diagnosis. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) Most adult brain tumors represent metastases from other cancers (eg, lung, breast, melanoma). However, on gross examination, brain metastases typically appear as multiple, well-circumscribed masses at the junction of the gray and white matter.\n\n(Choice C) Meningiomas are benign, slow-growing tumors of adults and are derived from meningothelial cells of the arachnoid (external to the brain parenchyma). They are typically located at sites of dural reflection (eg, falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli), and gross examination often shows a well-circumscribed mass attached to the dura.\n\n(Choice D) Oligodendrogliomas are slow-growing tumors in adults that typically involve the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, often the frontal lobe. On gross examination, they usually appear as gray masses with calcification.\n\n(Choice E) Primary CNS lymphoma is often seen in immunocompromised individuals (eg, patients with AIDS, transplant recipients). Gross examination usually shows solitary or multiple lesions that involve the deep periventricular white matter.\n\n(Choice F) Schwannomas are benign tumors that commonly arise from the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) at the cerebellopontine angle (vestibular schwannoma). Patients typically have sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus. Gross examination often shows an encapsulated mass attached to the nerve.\n\nEducational objective:\nGlioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor of adults and is typically located within the cerebral hemispheres, occasionally crossing the midline (butterfly glioma). Gross examination of this highly malignant tumor often shows a poorly circumscribed, variegated mass containing areas of necrosis and hemorrhage.",
