    "en": "This CT image shows a pancreatic pseudocyst, a potential complication of pancreatitis. In acute pancreatitis, proteolytic enzymes may disrupt the walls of the pancreatic ducts and cause leakage of pancreatic secretions into the peripancreatic space. This fluid has a high pancreatic enzyme content and induces an inflammatory reaction in the walls of the surrounding organs. Granulation tissue forms, encapsulating the fluid collection and forming a pseudocyst.\n\nIn contrast to a true cyst with walls lined by epithelial cells, the walls of a pseudocyst consist of granulation tissue and no epithelial lining. Fibrosis, thickening and organization of the walls occur with time. The formation of firm fibrotic pseudocyst walls (\"maturation\" of the pseudocyst) takes about 4 to 6 weeks following the episode of acute pancreatitis.\n\nThe most common location for a pseudocyst is in the lesser peritoneal sac, bordered by the stomach, duodenum and transverse colon. The pseudocyst walls are closely adherent to the surrounding hollow organs. The pseudocyst in the CT image above is located in the lesser sac, posterior to the stomach.\n\n(Choice A) Glycogen-rich cuboidal epithelium is seen in serous pancreatic neoplasms.\n\n(Choice B) Columnar mucinous epithelium is typically found in mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas.\n\n(Choice C) Atypical cells forming papillary projections are seen in the papillary variant of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\n\n(Choice E) Endothelial cells are not found in the wall of the pseudocyst.\n\nEducational Objective:\nPancreatic pseudocyst is a common complication of acute pancreatitis. It is a collection of fluid rich in enzymes and inflammatory debris. Its walls consist of granulation tissue and fibrosis. Unlike true cysts, pseudocysts are not lined by epithelium.",
    "zh": "该CT图像显示胰腺假性囊肿，这是胰腺炎的潜在并发症。 在急性胰腺炎中，蛋白水解酶可能会破坏胰管壁并导致胰腺分泌物渗漏到胰腺周围空间。 这种液体具有高胰酶含量，并诱导周围器官壁的炎症反应。 肉芽组织形成，包封液体聚集并形成假性囊肿。\n\n与壁由上皮细胞衬砌的真性囊肿相比，假性囊肿的壁由肉芽组织组成，没有上皮衬里。 随着时间的推移，壁会出现纤维化、增厚和组织化。 坚硬的纤维性假性囊肿壁的形成（假性囊肿的“成熟”）大约需要急性胰腺炎发作后的4到6周。\n\n假性囊肿最常见的位置是在小腹膜囊中，其边缘是胃、十二指肠和横结肠。 假性囊肿壁紧密附着于周围的空腔脏器。 上图中的CT图像中的假性囊肿位于小囊内，胃的后方。\n\n（选项A）在浆液性胰腺肿瘤中可见富含糖原的立方上皮细胞。\n\n（选项B）柱状黏液上皮细胞通常见于胰腺的黏液性囊性肿瘤。\n\n（选项C）形成乳头状突起的非典型细胞见于胰腺腺癌的乳头状变异型。\n\n（选项E）在假性囊肿的壁中未发现内皮细胞。\n\n教育目标：\n胰腺假性囊肿是急性胰腺炎的常见并发症。 它是一种富含酶和炎性碎片的液体集合。 它的壁由肉芽组织和纤维化构成。 与真性囊肿不同，假性囊肿不是由上皮细胞衬里的。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pancreatic pseudocyst formation and its characteristic lining. It requires understanding the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis and the subsequent development of a pseudocyst, differentiating it from true cysts.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical scenario of pancreatitis followed by a cystic lesion. Recall that pseudocysts are formed by granulation tissue and fibrosis, not epithelial lining, which distinguishes them from true cysts.",
