He was admitted to the hospital for a prolonged bout of bacterial pneumonia 6 months ago. Both parents are healthy and have no similar symptoms. The child was born at term at home. He is at the 20th percentile for length and 3rd percentile for weight. Vital signs are normal. On examination, the child appears thin and has a nontender, nondistended abdomen. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient with failure to thrive, steatorrhea, and a hospitalization for pneumonia most likely has cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an autosomal recessive disorder in which a defective chloride channel causes the accumulation of thick, dehydrated secretions in multiple organs.\n\nIn the pancreas, viscous mucus obstructs small ducts and acini, preventing digestive enzymes from reaching the intestinal lumen and leading to progressive pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis. This ultimately causes pancreatic insufficiency, which may be present at birth in patients with CF and typically progresses throughout childhood. Signs of fat and protein malabsorption due to pancreatic insufficiency include steatorrhea (bulky, foul-smelling stools), failure to thrive, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (A, D, E, and K).\n\nElastase is a pro-enzyme (ie, zymogen) produced by pancreatic acinar cells and activated by trypsin within the duodenal lumen. Because elastase production and secretion are decreased in patients with pancreatic insufficiency, fecal elastase levels are also decreased; the presence of low fecal elastase is an accurate and noninvasive method for diagnosing pancreatic insufficiency of any cause (eg, CF, chronic pancreatitis).\n\n(Choice A) Dietary absorption of calcium is decreased in CF in part due to vitamin D deficiency, which leads to both hypocalcemia and increased calcium fecal concentration.\n\n(Choice C) Calprotectin is a protein derived from neutrophils that is released into the stool of patients with inflammatory diarrhea (eg, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease). Fecal calprotectin levels are not increased in CF.\n\n(Choice D) Like elastase, chymotrypsin is a pancreatic digestive enzyme whose fecal concentration would be decreased (not increased) in patients with pancreatic insufficiency.\n\n(Choice E) Bicarbonate is produced and secreted by the pancreas to neutralize gastric acid and raise duodenal pH. Because patients with pancreatic insufficiency have less bicarbonate secretion, duodenal pH will decrease. The low pH can inactivate digestive enzymes produced by the stomach and intestine, further impairing nutrient absorption.\n\nEducational objective:\nPancreatic insufficiency is common in cystic fibrosis because thick, viscous secretions in the pancreas block digestive enzymes, leading to malabsorption (eg, steatorrhea, failure to thrive). The presence of low fecal elastase is an accurate and noninvasive method for diagnosing pancreatic insufficiency. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "这位患者出现生长迟缓、脂肪泻和肺炎住院病史，最有可能患有囊性纤维化 (CF)。 CF 是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其中缺陷的氯离子通道会导致多个器官中厚而脱水的分泌物积聚。\n\n在胰腺中，粘稠的粘液会阻塞小导管和腺泡，阻止消化酶到达肠腔，导致进行性胰腺炎症和纤维化。 这最终导致胰腺功能不全，这可能在 CF 患者出生时就出现，并且通常在整个儿童时期都会进展。 由于胰腺功能不全导致的脂肪和蛋白质吸收不良的体征包括脂肪泻（大便体积大、气味难闻）、生长迟缓和脂溶性维生素缺乏（A、D、E 和 K）。\n\n弹性蛋白酶是由胰腺腺泡细胞产生的酶原（即酶原），并在十二指肠腔内被胰蛋白酶激活。 由于胰腺功能不全患者的弹性蛋白酶产生和分泌减少，粪便弹性蛋白酶水平也会降低； 粪便弹性蛋白酶低是诊断任何原因（例如，CF、慢性胰腺炎）引起的胰腺功能不全的准确且无创的方法。\n\n（选项A）CF 中钙的膳食吸收减少部分是由于维生素D缺乏，这会导致低钙血症和粪便钙浓度升高。\n\n（选项C）钙卫蛋白是一种源自中性粒细胞的蛋白质，释放到炎症性腹泻（例如，溃疡性结肠炎、克罗恩病）患者的粪便中。 CF 患者的粪便钙卫蛋白水平不会升高。\n\n（选项D）与弹性蛋白酶一样，胰凝乳蛋白酶是一种胰腺消化酶，其粪便浓度在胰腺功能不全患者中会降低（而不是升高）。\n\n（选项E）胰腺产生和分泌碳酸氢盐以中和胃酸并提高十二指肠 pH 值。 由于胰腺功能不全患者的碳酸氢盐分泌较少，十二指肠 pH 值会降低。 低 pH 值会使胃和肠产生的消化酶失活，从而进一步损害营养吸收。\n\n教育目标：\n囊性纤维化中胰腺功能不全很常见，因为胰腺中的厚而粘稠的分泌物会阻塞消化酶，从而导致吸收不良（例如，脂肪泻、生长迟缓）。 粪便弹性蛋白酶低是诊断胰腺功能不全的准确且无创的方法。 {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cystic fibrosis presentation, specifically the signs and symptoms related to pancreatic insufficiency. It also assesses understanding of diagnostic tests used to evaluate pancreatic function in the context of malabsorption.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic triad of failure to thrive, steatorrhea, and history of pneumonia as suggestive of cystic fibrosis. Recall that pancreatic insufficiency is a common complication, leading to decreased production of digestive enzymes like elastase, which can be measured in stool.",
    "zh": "本题考察对囊性纤维化表现的了解，特别是与胰腺功能不全相关的体征和症状。 同时也评估了对用于评估吸收不良背景下胰腺功能的诊断测试的理解。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要认识到生长迟缓、脂肪泻和肺炎病史的经典三联征提示囊性纤维化。 回忆一下，胰腺功能不全是一种常见的并发症，导致消化酶（如弹性蛋白酶）的产生减少，而弹性蛋白酶可以在粪便中测量。"
