    "en": "A 72-year-old man comes to the clinic due to episodic lightheadedness. The episodes typically occur in the morning when the patient adjusts his shirt collar or tightens his tie and he briefly feels like he is going to pass out. The patient had a thyroidectomy 5 years ago for a large benign tumor. He also has hypertension and takes amlodipine. Blood pressure is 135/78 mm Hg and pulse is 78/min. Physical examination reveals no heart murmurs or carotid bruits. ECG shows normal sinus rhythm. The patient is given an ambulatory ECG monitoring device. During symptomatic episodes, the device is most likely to show which of the following?",

    "en": "This patient with episodes of presyncope (eg, lightheadedness, feeling of impending loss of consciousness) that occur when he adjusts his shirt collar or necktie most likely has CAROTID SINUS HYPERSENSITIVITY (CSH). The condition results from overly sensitive carotid baroreceptors that stimulate an excessive vasovagal response to tactile stimulation. CSH is most commonly seen in elderly men: underlying carotid atherosclerotic disease and prior neck surgery (eg, thyroidectomy) are risk factors.\n\nThe baroreceptor response in CSH mimics the normal response to increased blood pressure but is more exaggerated; increased parasympathetic output leads to a prolonged sinus pause (eg, 3-5 seconds) and decreased sympathetic outflow causes marked peripheral vasodilation. The resulting delay in ventricular contraction and decreased systemic vascular resistance leads to a profound reduction in blood pressure and transient loss of cerebral perfusion that manifests as presyncope or syncope.\n\n(Choices A, C, and E) Intermittent tachyarrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (eg, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia), and ventricular tachycardia, can cause syncope due to loss of cardiac output and reduced cerebral perfusion (of the 3 tachyarrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia is most concerning). However, CSH is more likely in this patient with symptoms associated with tactile stimulation of the carotid sinus.\n\n(Choice B) Advanced atrioventricular block (ie, complete heart block, Mobitz type II second-degree heart block) can cause presyncope or syncope but is also less likely than CSH in this patient with symptoms associated with tactile stimulation of the carotid sinus. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nEducational objective:\nCarotid sinus hypersensitivity is most commonly seen in elderly men and involves an exaggerated vasovagal response to tactile stimulation of carotid sinus baroreceptors (eg, adjusting a shirt collar or necktie). The resulting increase in parasympathetic output leads to a prolonged sinus pause that contributes to the excessive drop in blood pressure, leading to transient loss of cerebral perfusion that manifests as presyncope (eg, lightheadedness) or syncope.",
    "zh": "这位患者出现前晕厥发作（例如，头晕、感觉即将失去意识），当他整理衬衫领子或系领带时发生，最有可能患有颈动脉窦高敏综合征 (CSH)。该病症是由于颈动脉压力感受器过度敏感，刺激对触觉刺激的过度迷走神经反应所致。CSH 最常见于老年男性：潜在的颈动脉粥样硬化性疾病和既往颈部手术（例如，甲状腺切除术）是危险因素。\n\nCSH 中的压力感受器反应模拟了对血压升高的正常反应，但更为夸张；增加的副交感神经输出导致窦性停搏时间延长（例如，3-5 秒），而交感神经流出减少会导致明显的周围血管舒张。由此导致的心室收缩延迟和全身血管阻力降低会导致血压大幅下降，并短暂丧失脑灌注，表现为前晕厥或晕厥。\n\n（选项 A、C 和 E）间歇性快速性心律失常，包括伴有快速心室反应的心房颤动、阵发性室上性心动过速（例如，房室结折返性心动过速）和室性心动过速，可能由于心输出量减少和脑灌注减少而导致晕厥（在这 3 种快速性心律失常中，室性心动过速最令人担忧）。然而，对于这位与颈动脉窦触觉刺激相关的患者，CSH 更有可能。\n\n（选项 B）晚期房室传导阻滞（即，完全性心脏传导阻滞、Mobitz II 型二度房室传导阻滞）可引起前晕厥或晕厥，但在这位与颈动脉窦触觉刺激相关的患者中，也比 CSH 可能性小。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n教育目标：\n颈动脉窦高敏综合征最常见于老年男性，涉及对颈动脉窦压力感受器（例如，调整衬衫领子或领带）的触觉刺激的过度迷走神经反应。由此导致的副交感神经输出增加导致窦性停搏时间延长，这有助于血压过度下降，从而导致短暂的脑灌注丧失，表现为前晕厥（例如，头晕）或晕厥。"
