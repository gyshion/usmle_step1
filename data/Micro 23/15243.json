    "en": "A 5-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother due to 2 weeks of anorexia, nausea, epigastric discomfort, and loose bowel movements. She has had no fever or bloody stools. The patient recently returned from rural Brazil, where she spent the summer with family. She had no gastrointestinal symptoms during the trip but developed intensely pruritic eruptions between the toes of her right foot. The skin rash spontaneously resolved within a few days and was attributed to insect bites from walking barefoot in the fields. The patient has no prior medical conditions, takes no medications, and has received all age-appropriate vaccinations. On physical examination, the abdomen is soft and nontender with normoactive bowel sounds. Stool microscopy reveals smooth, thin-walled eggs. If left untreated, this patient's condition can lead to which of the following complications?",
    "zh": "一位 5 岁女孩因 2 周厌食、恶心、上腹部不适和稀便而被母亲带到诊所就诊。她没有发烧或血便。患者最近从巴西农村回来，在那里与家人度过了夏天。她在旅行期间没有出现胃肠道症状，但在右脚的脚趾之间出现了剧烈瘙痒的皮疹。皮疹在几天内自发消退，被认为是赤脚在田野里行走时被昆虫叮咬所致。该患者没有既往病史，没有服用药物，并且已接种所有与年龄相符的疫苗。体格检查显示，腹部柔软，无压痛，肠鸣音正常。粪便镜检显示光滑、薄壁的虫卵。如果未经治疗，该患者的病情可能导致以下哪种并发症？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Human hookworm infection is caused by *Necator americanus* and *Ancylostoma duodenale*. These pathogens are called hookworms because the head of the worm is often curved away from the body, giving the organism a \"hooked\" appearance. Most cases occur in tropical and subtropical regions where sanitation is poor. Transmission occurs when egg-containing human feces is deposited into shady, warm, moist soil, which allows the eggs to hatch into larvae. Spread occurs when larvae come into direct contact with human skin (eg, when walking barefoot). Dermal penetration often results in a transient, pruritic, maculopapular or serpiginous rash at the entry site. The larvae then spread through the bloodstream to the lungs, where they rupture into the alveoli and are subsequently coughed up and swallowed. In the small intestine, the larvae mature into adults, attach to the gastrointestinal mucosa, and feed on human blood by lacerating capillaries. Because these organisms can live in the gastrointestinal tract for up to 14 years, total blood loss can be substantial. Therefore, the biggest risk of hookworm infection is iron-deficiency anemia (microcytic anemia) due to chronic blood loss.\n\nAlthough many patients with hookworm infection are asymptomatic for months or years, some individuals develop transient pulmonary symptoms (eg, cough) during pulmonary migration or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) during gastrointestinal migration. Diagnosis is generally made when smooth, thin-walled hookworm eggs are identified by stool microscopy. Peripheral eosinophilia is also an important diagnostic clue.\n\n(Choice A) Lymphatic filariasis is a mosquito-borne illness caused by roundworms (eg, *Wuchereria bancrofti*). Most patients are infected in childhood and remain asymptomatic, but a minority develops chronic lymphedema, which may result in elephantiasis. Eggs are not present in stool; diagnosis is made by serology or by identifying worms in the lymphatic system.\n\n(Choice B) Chagas disease is linked to dilated cardiomyopathy and is most common in Latin America. It is caused by the protozoa *Trypanosoma cruzi*. Transmission occurs during a triatomine bug bite. Although transient skin and gastrointestinal symptoms can occur during acute infection, eggs are not seen in the stool; diagnosis is made mostly by serology or by blood microscopy.\n\n(Choice C) Toxocariasis is caused by infection with dog or cat roundworms. Migrating larva cause a significant eosinophilic granulomatous response that can result in ocular (endophthalmitis) and organ damage. Diagnosis is made by serology; the organism does not shed eggs in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n(Choice E) Diphyllobothriasis is caused by infection with a fish tapeworm and is classically linked with megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Although the eggs can be seen on stool microscopy, they are distinguished by a lid-like opening (operculum). In addition, a transient skin rash would not be a feature of this disease.\n\nEducational objective: Hookworms are transmitted when human skin comes into contact with soil contaminated with human feces. The larvae penetrate the skin, travel to the lungs, are coughed up, and then subsequently swallowed. Adult hookworms live in the small intestine and feed on human blood. Therefore, chronic iron deficiency anemia (microcytic anemia) is the greatest complication.",
    "zh": "人类钩虫感染是由 *美洲钩虫* 和 *十二指肠钩口线虫* 引起的。这些病原体被称为钩虫，因为虫体头部通常弯曲远离身体，使该生物体呈现“钩状”外观。大多数病例发生在卫生条件较差的热带和亚热带地区。传播发生在含卵的人类粪便被沉积到阴凉、温暖、潮湿的土壤中时，这使得卵孵化成幼虫。当幼虫与人类皮肤直接接触（例如，赤脚行走时）时，传播就会发生。皮肤穿透通常会导致进入部位出现短暂的、瘙痒的、丘疹或蛇形皮疹。然后，幼虫通过血液传播到肺部，在那里它们破裂进入肺泡，随后被咳出并吞下。在小肠中，幼虫成熟为成虫，附着在胃肠道粘膜上，并通过撕裂毛细血管来吸食人血。由于这些生物可以在胃肠道中存活长达 14 年，因此总失血量可能很大。因此，钩虫感染的最大风险是由于慢性失血引起的缺铁性贫血（小细胞性贫血）。\n\n尽管许多钩虫感染患者数月或数年无症状，但一些人在肺部移行期间会出现短暂的肺部症状（例如，咳嗽）或在胃肠道移行期间出现胃肠道症状（例如，恶心、呕吐、腹泻）。通常通过粪便镜检鉴定出光滑、薄壁的钩虫卵来诊断。外周嗜酸性粒细胞增多也是一个重要的诊断线索。\n\n(选项 A) 淋巴丝虫病是一种由线虫（例如，*班氏吴策线虫*）引起的蚊媒疾病。大多数患者在儿童时期被感染，并且保持无症状，但少数人会发生慢性淋巴水肿，这可能导致象皮病。粪便中不存在虫卵；通过血清学检查或通过在淋巴系统中鉴定蠕虫来进行诊断。\n\n(选项 B) 恰加斯病与扩张型心肌病有关，在拉丁美洲最为常见。它是由原生动物 *克氏锥虫* 引起的。传播发生在锥蝽叮咬期间。虽然在急性感染期间可能出现短暂的皮肤和胃肠道症状，但粪便中看不到虫卵；诊断主要通过血清学检查或血液镜检进行。\n\n(选项 C) 弓蛔病是由犬或猫蛔虫感染引起的。移行幼虫引起显着的嗜酸性肉芽肿反应，可导致眼部（眼内炎）和器官损伤。通过血清学检查进行诊断；该生物体不在胃肠道中脱落虫卵。\n\n(选项 E) 裂头蚴病是由鱼绦虫感染引起的，并且传统上与由于维生素 B12 缺乏引起的巨幼细胞性贫血有关。虽然可以在粪便镜检中看到虫卵，但它们通过类似盖子的开口（盖）来区分。此外，短暂的皮疹不是该病的特征。\n\n教学目标：当人类皮肤接触到被人类粪便污染的土壤时，就会传播钩虫。幼虫穿透皮肤，到达肺部，被咳出，然后被吞下。成虫钩虫生活在小肠中，以人血为食。因此，慢性缺铁性贫血（小细胞性贫血）是最大的并发症。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hookworm infection, its transmission, life cycle, and potential complications, specifically microcytic anemia due to chronic blood loss. It also requires differentiating hookworm from other parasitic infections.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's travel history to Brazil, the skin rash from walking barefoot, and the stool microscopy findings of smooth, thin-walled eggs. These findings are highly suggestive of hookworm infection, leading to the most likely complication of microcytic anemia.",
