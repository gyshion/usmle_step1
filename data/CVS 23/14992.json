    "en": "A 38-year-old woman comes to the office due to worsening shortness of breath over the past 4 weeks. She has no chest pain or lightheadedness but has noticed some ankle puffiness. The patient can hardly do chores without having to stop to catch her breath. Medical history is unremarkable. She delivered a healthy child 2 months ago without complications. The patient is a lifetime nonsmoker and does not use alcohol. She has no family history of early heart disease or sudden cardiac death. Blood pressure is 96/60 mm Hg and pulse is 92/min and regular. The apical impulse is palpated along the anterior axillary line, and S3 is heard at the apex. There are no heart murmurs. Which of the following best describes the left ventricular changes in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient with progressive dyspnea and peripheral edema, as well as a laterally displaced point of maximal impulse and S3 on physical examination, likely has heart failure due to peripartum cardiomyopathy. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is relatively uncommon and manifests as a dilated cardiomyopathy that occurs during the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months after delivery. The pathogenesis of the condition is poorly understood, but it may be related to impaired function of angiogenic growth factors (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor) during the peripartum period. In addition, certain individuals may have genetic mutations affecting cardiac structural proteins that predispose to the development of peripartum cardiomyopathy.\n\nIn dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial dysfunction causes an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume, which is compensated for by eccentric hypertrophy to maintain cardiac output. The dilation of the left ventricle allows for increased compliance to accommodate the increase in end-diastolic volume. Eventually, however, overwhelming wall stress leads to left ventricular failure with reduced ejection fraction and symptomatic heart failure. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice B) Normal compliance with decreased ejection fraction may occur in neurogenic shock due to impaired sympathetic stimulation resulting in decreased myocardial contractility.\n\n(Choice C) Decreased compliance with normal (or increased) ejection fraction (diastolic heart failure) is seen with left ventricular hypertrophy due to long-standing hypertension.\n\n(Choice D) Increased compliance with relatively normal ejection fraction occurs during the compensated period of eccentric hypertrophy, before overwhelming wall stress leads to systolic failure.\n\n(Choice E) Normal compliance and ejection fraction describes a heart that is without underlying pathology.\n\nEducational objective:\nPeripartum cardiomyopathy is a relatively uncommon cause of dilated cardiomyopathy that may be related to impaired function of angiogenic growth factors. Dilated cardiomyopathy involves compensatory eccentric hypertrophy, which increases ventricular compliance and also allows for temporary maintenance of cardiac output. Over time, overwhelming wall stress leads to left ventricular failure with reduced ejection fraction and symptomatic heart failure. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者出现进行性呼吸困难和周围性水肿，以及体格检查显示心尖搏动向外移位和S3，很可能患有由于围产期心肌病导致的心力衰竭。围产期心肌病相对少见，表现为扩张型心肌病，发生在妊娠最后一个月或产后5个月内。该病的发病机制尚不清楚，但可能与围产期血管生成生长因子（例如，血管内皮生长因子）功能受损有关。此外，某些个体可能存在影响心脏结构蛋白的基因突变，易患围产期心肌病。\n\n在扩张型心肌病中，心肌功能障碍导致左心室舒张末期容积增加，这通过向心性肥大进行代偿以维持心输出量。左心室的扩张使顺应性增加，以适应舒张末期容积的增加。然而，最终，过度的壁应力会导致左心室衰竭，射血分数降低，并出现症状性心力衰竭。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项B) 顺应性正常但射血分数降低可能发生在神经源性休克中，原因是交感神经刺激受损，导致心肌收缩力降低。\n\n(选项C) 顺应性降低但射血分数正常（或增加）（舒张性心力衰竭）可见于长期高血压引起的左心室肥大。\n\n(选项D) 顺应性增加但射血分数相对正常发生在向心性肥大的代偿期，在过度的壁应力导致收缩期衰竭之前。\n\n(选项E) 顺应性和射血分数正常描述了一个没有潜在病理的心脏。\n\n教育目标：\n围产期心肌病是一种相对少见的扩张型心肌病，可能与血管生成生长因子功能受损有关。扩张型心肌病涉及代偿性向心性肥大，增加心室顺应性，也允许暂时维持心输出量。随着时间的推移，过度的壁应力会导致左心室衰竭，射血分数降低，并出现症状性心力衰竭。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of peripartum cardiomyopathy, specifically the changes in left ventricular ejection fraction and compliance that occur as the disease progresses. It requires understanding the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy and how the heart compensates for increased volume overload.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of heart failure in a postpartum woman. Understand that dilated cardiomyopathy leads to increased compliance initially, followed by decreased ejection fraction as the heart fails. Eliminate options that do not align with this progression.",
