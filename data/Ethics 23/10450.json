    "en": "A physician is approached by a friend who requests a prescription for antidepressant medication. The physician has been friends with this individual since college and is aware that she has been treated for depression in the past. The friend explains that she is only \"a little depressed\" due to work stress and relationship issues and would like to resume sertraline, which she has taken previously. She has a physician but wants to avoid seeing the provider due to difficulty getting an appointment and her own busy schedule.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Physicians are commonly approached by friends and family for informal medical care ranging from prescriptions for antibiotics to treatment of complex medical issues. However, the wish to be helpful must be balanced with ethical considerations related to the risks of compromising objectivity and clinical judgment when treating a friend.\n\nPotential problems that could result in patient harm (maleficence) include failure to perform an adequate assessment of sensitive issues related to depression (eg, suicide risk), the possibility that the patient will not be completely forthcoming due to the friendship, treating conditions that may be outside of the physician's expertise, and lack of appropriate documentation and follow-up. In addition, from a medico-legal perspective, writing a prescription establishes a physician-patient relationship and may be problematic in the event of an adverse outcome.\n\nProfessional medical organizations with published ethics guidelines consistently recommend that treatment of friends and family be limited to emergency situations when no other physician is available. The most appropriate response is for the physician to decline to write the prescription, explaining that the nature of their relationship prevents objective treatment.\n\n(Choice A) Physicians may feel pressured to accommodate requests from friends, but offering a limited supply of medication is not indicated in this nonemergency situation. The physician should encourage the friend to schedule an appointment with her provider.\n\n(Choice B) Describing the friend's psychiatric history as complex may be viewed as judgmental and is not the fundamental reason for declining the request for medication. It is preferable to explain how the nature of their friendship compromises the physician's ability to treat her objectively.\n\n(Choice C) Although it is well intentioned, scheduling a full evaluation to determine whether antidepressants are indicated does not solve the ethical problem of treating a friend in a nonemergency situation.\n\n(Choice E) This option makes the unfounded assumption that another physician would be willing to prescribe medication without reevaluating the patient in person.\n\nEducational objective:\nProviding informal treatment to friends and family is ethically problematic due to lack of objectivity that can negatively impact clinical judgment. It should generally be limited to emergency situations in which no other physician is available.",
    "zh": "医生通常会被朋友和家人要求提供非正式的医疗护理，包括开抗生素处方到治疗复杂的医疗问题。然而，帮助他人的愿望必须与伦理考量相平衡，这些伦理考量与在治疗朋友时，因损害客观性和临床判断力而产生的风险有关。\n\n可能导致患者受损（恶意）的潜在问题包括：未能对与抑郁症相关的敏感问题（例如，自杀风险）进行充分评估，由于友谊，患者可能不会完全坦诚，治疗可能超出医生的专业知识范围的疾病，以及缺乏适当的文档记录和随访。此外，从医疗法律的角度来看，开处方建立了医患关系，并且在出现不良后果时可能存在问题。\n\n具有已发布伦理指南的专业医学组织一致建议，对朋友和家人的治疗应仅限于在没有其他医生可用的紧急情况。最合适的回答是医生拒绝开处方，并解释说他们关系的性质妨碍了客观治疗。\n\n（选项 A）医生可能会感到被迫满足朋友的要求，但在这种非紧急情况下，提供有限的药物供应是不合适的。医生应鼓励朋友预约她的医生。\n\n（选项 B）将朋友的精神病史描述为复杂可能会被视为带有判断性，这并不是拒绝药物要求的根本原因。最好解释他们的友谊如何损害医生客观治疗她的能力。\n\n（选项 C）虽然用意良好，但安排全面的评估以确定是否需要抗抑郁药并不能解决在非紧急情况下治疗朋友的伦理问题。\n\n（选项 E）此选项作出了毫无根据的假设，即另一位医生愿意在没有亲自重新评估患者的情况下开药。\n\n教育目标：\n由于缺乏客观性，对朋友和家人提供非正式治疗在伦理上是有问题的，这会负面影响临床判断。它通常应仅限于没有其他医生可用的紧急情况。"
