    "en": "This elderly patient with new-onset bullae likely has bullous pemphigoid (BP), an autoimmune blistering disease. BP most commonly affects individuals age >60. As in this patient, bullae are typically tense and have erythematous or normal-appearing bases. Lesion distribution can be localized or diffuse, involving the trunk and extremities; mucosal involvement is rare. The pruritus preceding and associated with this condition can be severe.\n\nBP is caused by autoantibodies against hemidesmosomes, structural components which anchor the basal layer of epithelial cells to the basement membrane. These autoantibodies result in a destructive inflammatory cascade that causes the entire epidermis to separate from the dermis, forming subepidermal blisters. In addition to skin biopsy for routine histology and immunofluorescence {{exhibit_2}}, serologic testing for autoantibodies against hemidesmosome proteins (eg, BP180, BP230) is also obtained to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n(Choice A) Connexins are proteins that form gap junctions, which allow small molecules and ions (eg, cyclic AMP, Na+) to pass between cells so that they may function in a coordinated manner (eg, contraction of cardiac myocytes).\n\n(Choice B) Autoantibodies directed at desmosome proteins (eg, desmogleins 1 and 3) cause pemphigus vulgaris, which presents with flaccid bullae that easily rupture and form erosions. Mucosal involvement is almost always present.\n\n(Choice D) Integrins expressed on the cell surface of leukocytes are responsible for diapedesis from the circulation into tissue.\n\n(Choice E) Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is a mucocutaneous blistering disorder caused by genetic mutations of (not autoantibodies against) the proteins forming intermediate filaments (the major intracellular structural component of keratinocytes). This condition typically presents early in life.\n\nEducational objective:\nBullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by tense bullae in patients age >60. Autoantibodies against hemidesmosome components initiate an inflammatory response that results in separation of the epidermis from the dermis, leading to subepidermal blisters. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}",
    "zh": "这位老年患者新发的水疱很可能患有大疱性类天疱疮 (BP)，这是一种自身免疫性水疱病。BP 最常影响 60 岁以上的人群。与该患者一样，水疱通常是紧张的，并且具有红斑或正常外观的基底。病变分布可以是局部的或弥漫性的，涉及躯干和四肢；粘膜受累罕见。先于且与这种情况相关的瘙痒可能很严重。\n\nBP 是由针对半桥粒的自身抗体引起的，半桥粒是连接上皮细胞基底层与基底膜的结构成分。这些自身抗体导致破坏性炎症级联反应，导致整个表皮与真皮分离，形成表皮下水疱。除了用于常规组织学和免疫荧光的皮肤活检 {{exhibit_2}} 外，还进行针对半桥粒蛋白（例如，BP180，BP230）的自身抗体血清学检测以确认诊断。\n\n(选项 A) 连接蛋白是形成间隙连接的蛋白质，间隙连接允许小分子和离子（例如，环磷酸腺苷、Na+）在细胞之间传递，从而使它们能够以协调的方式发挥作用（例如，心肌细胞的收缩）。\n\n(选项 B) 针对桥粒蛋白（例如，桥粒蛋白 1 和 3）的自身抗体会引起寻常型天疱疮，其表现为松弛性水疱，易于破裂并形成糜烂。几乎总是存在粘膜受累。\n\n(选项 D) 在白细胞细胞表面表达的整合素负责从循环系统渗出到组织中。\n\n(选项 E) 单纯性大疱性表皮松解症是一种粘膜皮肤水疱病，由形成中间丝（角质形成细胞的主要细胞内结构成分）的蛋白质的基因突变（而不是针对其的自身抗体）引起。这种情况通常在生命早期出现。\n\n教育目标：\n大疱性类天疱疮 (BP) 是一种自身免疫性水疱病，其特征是 60 岁以上患者出现紧张性水疱。针对半桥粒成分的自身抗体启动炎症反应，导致表皮与真皮分离，导致表皮下水疱。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disease, including its typical presentation in elderly patients and the target of autoantibodies. It also requires differentiating bullous pemphigoid from other blistering disorders based on clinical features and antibody targets.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's age and the presence of tense bullae without mucosal involvement, which are characteristic of bullous pemphigoid.
