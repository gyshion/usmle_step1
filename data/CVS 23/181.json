    "en": "The autopsy findings of this patient's left ventricle (LV) are consistent with concentric hypertrophy most likely due to chronic hypertension.\n\nLV hypertrophy is generally defined as an increase in the left ventricular mass due to increased wall thickness (concentric) or cavity size (eccentric). Concentric hypertrophy is characterized by uniform thickening of the ventricular wall with the outer dimensions of the ventricle remaining almost unchanged, resulting in a narrowed ventricular cavity size. It is due to chronic elevation of ventricular pressures during systole, which is usually caused by long-standing hypertension or aortic stenosis (increased LV afterload). Patients may develop diastolic dysfunction with left atrial enlargement and congestive heart failure due to impaired ventricular compliance and filling.\n\n(Choice A) An atrial septal defect causes a shunting of blood flow from the left to right atrium. This typically results in volume overload of the right ventricle, producing right atrial enlargement and eccentric (dilated) right ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n(Choice C) Mitral insufficiency causes LV volume overload as regurgitant flow through the mitral valve during systole increases the amount of blood returning to the LV during diastole. The net structural consequence of mitral insufficiency is enlargement of the LV cavity and eccentric hypertrophy.\n\n(Choice D) Mitral stenosis leads to left atrial enlargement due to elevated pressure in the left atrium. The LV cavity is typically small/normal in size with normal wall thickness due to restriction of blood flow across the mitral valve.\n\n(Choice E) Aging is associated with a decrease in LV chamber size, predominantly through shortening of the apex-to-base dimension accompanied by a leftward bowing of the lower interventricular (sigmoid) septum. The aortic valve may also become calcified, resulting in aortic stenosis; however, structural cardiac changes due to aging are generally not prominent before age 65.\n\n(Choice F) The ventricular remodeling that occurs after an acute myocardial infarction involves expansion, thinning, and fibrous healing of the infarcted zone of myocardium. Regional dysfunction of the infarcted myocardium causes volume overload for the remaining viable myocardium. The net result is usually eccentric hypertrophy, with enlargement of the LV cavity.\n\n(Choice G) Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome have an accessory pathway that bypasses the atrioventricular node and directly connects the atria and ventricles. This results in ventricular preexcitation and the development of tachyarrhythmias. The LV usually appears grossly normal.\n\nEducational objective:\nConcentric hypertrophy is characterized by uniform thickening of the ventricular wall and narrowing of the ventricular cavity due to increased afterload (eg, chronic hypertension, aortic stenosis). Eccentric hypertrophy is characterized by reduced ventricular wall thickness with an associated increase in chamber size due to volume overload. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该患者左心室 (LV) 的尸检结果与同心性肥大一致，最有可能由于慢性高血压引起。\n\nLV肥大通常定义为由于壁厚增加（向心性）或腔室大小增加（离心性）引起的左心室质量增加。同心性肥大的特征是心室壁均匀增厚，心室外径几乎保持不变，导致心室腔缩小。这是由于收缩期心室压力长期升高所致，这通常由长期高血压或主动脉瓣狭窄（LV后负荷增加）引起。患者可能因心室顺应性受损和充盈而发生舒张功能障碍，伴有左心房扩大和充血性心力衰竭。\n\n（选项A）房间隔缺损导致血液从左心房分流到右心房。这通常导致右心室容量超负荷，产生右心房增大和离心性（扩张性）右心室肥大。\n\n（选项C）二尖瓣关闭不全导致LV容量超负荷，因为收缩期通过二尖瓣的反流增加了舒张期返回LV的血量。二尖瓣关闭不全的净结构后果是LV腔扩大和离心性肥大。\n\n（选项D）二尖瓣狭窄导致左心房压力升高，导致左心房扩大。由于通过二尖瓣的血流受限，LV腔通常较小/正常大小，壁厚正常。\n\n（选项E）衰老与LV腔室大小减小有关，这主要通过缩短尖端到基底的尺寸，并伴有下室间隔（乙状）向左弯曲。主动脉瓣也可能钙化，导致主动脉瓣狭窄；然而，衰老引起的心脏结构变化通常在65岁之前不明显。\n\n（选项F）急性心肌梗死后发生的心室重塑涉及心肌梗死区域的扩张、变薄和纤维愈合。梗死心肌的区域性功能障碍导致剩余存活心肌的容量超负荷。最终结果通常是离心性肥大，伴有LV腔扩大。\n\n（选项G）沃夫-帕金森-怀特综合征患者有一条旁路，绕过房室结并直接连接心房和心室。这会导致心室预激和心动过速的发生。LV通常表现为肉眼正常。\n\n教育目标：\n同心性肥大的特征是心室壁均匀增厚和由于后负荷增加（例如，慢性高血压、主动脉瓣狭窄）导致的心室腔变窄。离心性肥大的特征是心室壁厚度减小，并伴有腔室大小的增加，这是由于容量超负荷所致。 {{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and its association with various cardiac conditions, specifically differentiating between concentric and eccentric hypertrophy. It requires understanding the pathophysiology of LVH in the context of chronic hypertension and other potential causes.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the autopsy findings (enlarged left atrium, increased left ventricular mass and wall thickness) as indicative of concentric LVH. Then, consider the most common causes of concentric LVH, such as chronic hypertension or aortic stenosis, and eliminate options that typically lead to eccentric LVH or other cardiac abnormalities.",
