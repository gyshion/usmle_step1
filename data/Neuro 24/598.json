    "en": "A 61-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being found unresponsive on a sidewalk. Paramedics noted that the patient's breath smelled of alcohol and that he had vomitus in his mouth. The patient also has agonal respirations, and cardiac monitoring shows pulseless electrical activity. Resuscitation efforts are unsuccessful, and he is pronounced dead on arrival. Autopsy shows that the cause of death is airway occlusion by aspirated vomitus. In addition, foci of hemorrhage and necrosis are seen in the mammillary bodies and gray matter surrounding the third and fourth ventricles. {{exhibit_1}} This patient's brain findings are most likely associated with a decrease in which of the following?",

    "en": "This patient's autopsy shows foci of hemorrhage and necrosis in the mammillary bodies and periaqueductal gray matter, findings characteristic of Wernicke encephalopathy. This condition classically presents with the triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion but can lead to coma and death if untreated. Wernicke encephalopathy occurs due to chronic thiamine deficiency, which is common in patients with alcohol use disorder.\n\nThiamine (vitamin B1) participates in glucose metabolism and is a cofactor for the following enzymes:\n\n* Pyruvate dehydrogenase, which converts pyruvate (glycolysis end product) into acetyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle\n* Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the citric acid cycle\n* Branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase, which is essential for the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (eg, leucine, isoleucine, valine)\n* Transketolase, an enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway that helps convert ribulose-5-phosphate (derived from glucose) to glycolysis intermediates (eg, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate)\n\nTherefore, thiamine deficiency impairs glucose utilization, which can have catastrophic effects on the CNS as the brain always requires some glucose.\n\nThiamine deficiency is often diagnosed clinically in patients with a history of heavy alcohol use or malnutrition and signs of Wernicke encephalopathy; the diagnosis can be confirmed with a baseline erythrocyte transketolase activity that is low but increases after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate. Treatment involves thiamine supplementation with glucose; glucose administration alone may precipitate or worsen Wernicke encephalopathy due to rapid thiamine consumption.\n\n(Choice A) Erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is necessary for production of NADPH and proper functioning of the erythrocyte antioxidant system. Decreased G6PD levels cause intermittent hemolytic anemia due to oxidative stress.\n\n(Choices C and E) The metabolism of ethanol to acetyl-CoA consumes NAD+ and increases NADH/NAD+; therefore, NADH would likely be elevated in this patient. In addition, without NAD+, pyruvate dehydrogenase is unable to convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and instead diverts pyruvate to the anaerobic glycolysis pathway, which ultimately increases (not decreases) lactate production.\n\n(Choice D) Methylmalonic acid, a product of fatty acid oxidation, is converted to succinyl-CoA by the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (and uses vitamin B12 as a cofactor). Consequently, methylmalonic acid levels are increased in vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\nEducational objective: Chronic thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency impairs glucose use, particularly in mammillary bodies, as seen in Wernicke encephalopathy. This occurs due to decreased activity of the enzymes that use thiamine as a cofactor (eg, transketolase). Low erythrocyte transketolase activity that increases after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate is diagnostic.",
    "zh": "这位患者的尸检显示，在乳头体和导水管周围灰质中可见出血和坏死的病灶，这些发现是韦尼克脑病（Wernicke encephalopathy）的特征。这种疾病的典型表现为眼肌麻痹、共济失调和意识模糊三联征，但如果未经治疗，可导致昏迷和死亡。韦尼克脑病是由于慢性硫胺素（维生素B1）缺乏引起的，这在患有酒精使用障碍的患者中很常见。\n\n硫胺素（维生素B1）参与葡萄糖代谢，是以下酶的辅助因子：\n\n* 丙酮酸脱氢酶，将丙酮酸（糖酵解的最终产物）转化为乙酰辅酶A，然后进入柠檬酸循环\n* α-酮戊二酸脱氢酶，柠檬酸循环中的一种酶\n* 支链α-酮酸脱氢酶，是支链氨基酸（例如，亮氨酸、异亮氨酸、缬氨酸）分解代谢所必需的\n* 转酮醇酶，磷酸戊糖途径中的一种酶，有助于将核酮糖-5-磷酸（来源于葡萄糖）转化为糖酵解中间体（例如，甘油醛-3-磷酸）\n\n因此，硫胺素缺乏会损害葡萄糖的利用，这可能对中枢神经系统产生灾难性影响，因为大脑始终需要一些葡萄糖。\n\n硫胺素缺乏症通常在有大量饮酒或营养不良病史以及韦尼克脑病体征的患者中进行临床诊断；可以通过基线红细胞转酮醇酶活性低但在添加焦磷酸硫胺素后增加来证实诊断。治疗包括补充硫胺素和葡萄糖；仅补充葡萄糖可能会因硫胺素的快速消耗而诱发或加重韦尼克脑病。\n\n（选项 A）红细胞葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶（G6PD）催化磷酸戊糖途径中的限速步骤，这对于产生 NADPH 和红细胞抗氧化系统的正常功能是必需的。G6PD 水平降低会导致间歇性溶血性贫血，原因是氧化应激。\n\n（选项 C 和 E）乙醇代谢为乙酰辅酶A会消耗 NAD+ 并增加 NADH/NAD+；因此，该患者的 NADH 可能会升高。此外，没有 NAD+，丙酮酸脱氢酶无法将丙酮酸转化为乙酰辅酶A，而是将丙酮酸转移到无氧糖酵解途径，最终增加（而不是减少）乳酸的产生。\n\n（选项 D）甲基丙二酸是脂肪酸氧化的产物，通过酶甲基丙二酰辅酶A变位酶（并使用维生素B12作为辅助因子）转化为琥珀酰辅酶A。因此，在维生素B12缺乏症中，甲基丙二酸水平会升高。\n\n教学目标：慢性硫胺素（维生素B1）缺乏会损害葡萄糖的利用，尤其是在乳头体中，如韦尼克脑病所见。这是由于使用硫胺素作为辅助因子的酶（例如，转酮醇酶）的活性降低所致。红细胞转酮醇酶活性低，在添加焦磷酸硫胺素后增加具有诊断意义。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of Wernicke encephalopathy, its pathophysiology related to thiamine deficiency, and the diagnostic utility of erythrocyte transketolase activity. It assesses the ability to link clinical findings and autopsy results to specific biochemical markers of vitamin deficiency.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the autopsy findings suggestive of Wernicke encephalopathy, recall the role of thiamine in glucose metabolism and its cofactor function in specific enzymes, and recognize that decreased enzyme activity due to thiamine deficiency is reflected in specific biochemical tests. The key is to connect the neurological damage to impaired energy production in the brain due to thiamine deficiency.",
