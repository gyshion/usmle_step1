    "en": "This patient has signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, including tremor, dysphoria, sweating, and tachycardia with palpitations. Hyperthyroidism is associated with upregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors and increased adrenergic tone, which is responsible for many of the associated clinical features.\n\nBeta-adrenergic antagonists (eg, propranolol) are indicated to alleviate the adrenergic symptoms of thyrotoxicosis and are usually prescribed early, while completing the diagnostic evaluation and initiating definitive management (eg, antithyroid medication, radioiodine ablation, thyroidectomy). Some beta-adrenergic antagonists (eg, propranolol) also reduce peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3), although this effect is delayed.\n\n(Choice A) Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to treat anxiety or depression. This patient's anxiety and mood symptoms will likely resolve with treatment of the underlying condition (ie, thyrotoxicosis). Also, SSRIs typically require 2-4 weeks for a noticeable effect.\n\n(Choice B) Thioamides (eg, methimazole, propylthiouracil) reduce the production of thyroid hormone by inhibiting thyroperoxidase, the enzyme responsible for iodination of tyrosine residues in follicular colloid. Although these agents are indicated for the treatment of hyperthyroidism due to overproduction of thyroid hormone (eg, Graves disease), they produce clinical effects only after a few weeks.\n\n(Choice C) Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist. Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors are present on the vasculature and induce vasoconstriction when stimulated. Blockade of these receptors would not alleviate the patient's palpitations and tremor.\n\n(Choice E) Radioactive iodine is used to treat a variety of hyperthyroid disorders, most commonly Graves disease, but it takes several weeks to be effective. In addition, it occasionally causes a paradoxical increase in thyroid hormone production early in treatment (Jod-Basedow effect) and therefore should be administered with beta-adrenergic antagonists.\n\nEducational objective:\nBeta blockers provide rapid relief of the adrenergio-mediated symptoms of thyrotoxicosis and can be given while awaiting diagnostic evaluation and definitive management.",
    "zh": "该患者有甲状腺毒症的体征和症状，包括震颤、烦躁、出汗和伴有心悸的心动过速。甲状腺功能亢进与β-肾上腺素能受体的上调和肾上腺素能张力的增加有关，这是许多相关临床表现的原因。\n\nβ-肾上腺素能拮抗剂（如普萘洛尔）适用于缓解甲状腺毒症的肾上腺素能症状，通常在完成诊断评估和启动明确治疗（如抗甲状腺药物、放射性碘消融、甲状腺切除术）的早期开出处方。一些β-肾上腺素能拮抗剂（如普萘洛尔）还可以减少甲状腺素（T4）向三碘甲状腺原氨酸（T3）的外周转化，尽管这种作用是延迟的。\n\n（选项A）氟西汀是一种用于治疗焦虑或抑郁症的选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（SSRI）。该患者的焦虑和情绪症状可能会随着对潜在疾病（即甲状腺毒症）的治疗而缓解。此外，SSRI通常需要2-4周才能产生明显的效果。\n\n（选项B）硫代酰胺（如甲巯咪唑、丙硫氧嘧啶）通过抑制甲状腺过氧化物酶来减少甲状腺激素的产生，该酶负责在滤泡胶体中对酪氨酸残基进行碘化。尽管这些药物适用于治疗甲状腺激素过度产生的甲状腺功能亢进症（如格雷夫斯病），但它们只有在几周后才能产生临床效果。\n\n（选项C）哌唑嗪是一种α-1肾上腺素能拮抗剂。α-1肾上腺素能受体存在于血管系统上，并在受到刺激时诱导血管收缩。阻断这些受体不会缓解患者的心悸和震颤。\n\n（选项E）放射性碘用于治疗各种甲状腺功能亢进症，最常见的是格雷夫斯病，但需要几周才能见效。此外，它有时会在治疗早期引起甲状腺激素产生的矛盾性增加（约德-巴泽多效应），因此应与β-肾上腺素能拮抗剂一起使用。\n\n教育目标：\nβ受体阻滞剂可快速缓解甲状腺毒症的肾上腺素能介导的症状，并且可以在等待诊断评估和明确治疗的同时给予。"
