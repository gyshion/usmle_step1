    "en": "A 21-day-old boy is brought to the office by his mother because of a palpable bulge in the child's neck. He continues to feed well but appears comfortable only when held with his body sideways under the breast. He is at the 50th percentile for height, weight, and head circumference. The child favors looking toward the right and cries when his head is turned to the left. There is a firm mass on the left side of his neck that does not move when the child swallows. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient presents with clinical findings consistent with CONGENITAL TORTICOLLIS. This condition is characterized by a firm, non-tender mass in the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) of the neck, leading to head tilt and limited range of motion. The most common cause of congenital torticollis is intrauterine malposition, which can lead to injury or fibrosis of the SCM muscle. This can occur due to breech delivery, malposition of the head in utero (eg, due to fetal macrosomia or oligohydramnios), or birth trauma. The mass is typically noted within the first few weeks of life, and the child may prefer to hold their head in a specific position to minimize discomfort from the tight muscle. The explanation provided in the image states that \"Congenital torticollis is typically noted by 2 to 4 weeks of age, after which the child prefers to hold the head tilted to one side. It is most commonly the result of malposition of the head in utero or birth trauma.\" This directly supports intrauterine malposition as the most likely prenatal cause.\n\n(Choice A) Folate deficiency is associated with neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, and is not directly related to congenital torticollis.\n\n(Choice C) Defective fetal collagen synthesis leads to conditions like OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, characterized by brittle bones and increased fracture risk, which is unrelated to the described neck mass and torticollis.\n\n(Choice D) Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME, which is characterized by distinct facial features, growth deficits, and central nervous system abnormalities. It does not typically manifest as congenital torticollis.\n\n(Choice E) While some maternal infections, like rubella, can cause congenital defects (TORCH infections), a general upper respiratory infection in the mother is unlikely to cause congenital torticollis. The explanation specifically mentions rubella as a cause of severe birth defects, but not torticollis.\n\nKey clinical pearls: Congenital torticollis is a common condition in infants, often presenting within the first few weeks of life. The hallmark is a palpable mass in the SCM muscle and characteristic head tilt. The most frequent etiology is intrauterine malposition or birth trauma affecting the SCM.",
    "zh": "该患者表现出的临床表现与先天性斜颈一致。这种情况的特征是颈部胸锁乳突肌 (SCM) 出现坚硬、无压痛的肿块，导致头部倾斜和活动范围受限。先天性斜颈最常见的原因是宫内体位不正，这可能导致 SCM 肌肉损伤或纤维化。这可能是由于臀位分娩、子宫内头部体位不正（例如，由于胎儿巨大儿或羊水过少）或出生创伤引起的。这种肿块通常在出生后的头几周内被注意到，并且孩子可能更喜欢保持特定的头部姿势，以尽量减少来自紧张肌肉的不适。图像中提供的解释指出，“先天性斜颈通常在 2 至 4 周龄时被注意到，此后孩子更喜欢将头部向一侧倾斜。这最常见的是由于子宫内头部体位不正或出生创伤造成的。”这直接支持宫内体位不正作为最可能的产前原因。\n\n（选项 A）叶酸缺乏症与神经管缺陷（例如脊柱裂）相关，与先天性斜颈没有直接关系。\n\n（选项 C）胎儿胶原合成缺陷会导致成骨不全等疾病，其特征是骨脆性和骨折风险增加，这与所描述的颈部肿块和斜颈无关。\n\n（选项 D）孕妇在怀孕期间饮酒会导致胎儿酒精综合征，其特征是面部特征独特、生长缺陷和中枢神经系统异常。它通常不会表现为先天性斜颈。\n\n（选项 E）虽然一些孕妇感染，如风疹，会导致先天性缺陷（TORCH 感染），但孕妇的一般上呼吸道感染不太可能导致先天性斜颈。解释中特别提到了风疹是导致严重出生缺陷的原因，但没有提到斜颈。\n\n关键的临床要点：先天性斜颈是婴儿的常见病，通常在出生后的头几周内出现。标志是在 SCM 肌肉中出现可触及的肿块和特征性的头部倾斜。最常见的病因是宫内体位不正或影响 SCM 的出生创伤。"
