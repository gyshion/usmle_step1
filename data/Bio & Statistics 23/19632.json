    "en": "A research group is studying the correlation between BMI and blood pressure in a random sample of children age 12-16. After collecting data, they conduct a correlation analysis at a 1% significance level. The researchers find that BMI correlates with systolic blood pressure with a coefficient of r = 0.46 (p <0.001) and diastolic blood pressure with a coefficient of r = 0.37 (p <0.001). Which of the following is the most accurate interpretation of these results?",

    "en": "The correlation coefficient (r) measures the direction and strength of a linear relationship (ie, association) between 2 variables (that are usually quantitative).\n\n*   Direction: When r <0, the linear relationship is negative and one variable increases as the other decreases; when r >0, the linear relationship is positive and both variables increase and decrease together.\n*   Strength: When r values are close to -1 or 1, the linear relationship is strong; when r values are close to 0, the linear relationship is weak.\n\nA correlation analysis evaluates whether a linear relationship exists between 2 variables. A p-value less than a given significance level indicates that there is a statistically significant linear relationship between the variables. However, a statistically significant linear relationship result does not imply that the relationship is causal (correlation ≠ causation) because when 2 variables are correlated, it does not necessarily mean that one is directly causing the other to change (Choices A and B).\n\nIn this study, researchers studied the correlation coefficients for BMI and blood pressure in a random sample of children. Study results showed that the correlation coefficients for BMI and systolic/diastolic blood pressure are both positive (r = 0.46 and r = 0.37, respectively, are both >0); therefore, there is a positive linear relationship between BMI and blood pressure (Choice C). Because the p-value for both coefficients (p<0.001) is less than 0.01 (the given significance level of 1%), the linear relationship is statistically significant (Choice E).\n\nEducational objective:\nThe correlation coefficient (r) indicates whether there is a negative (r <0) or positive (r >0) linear relationship between 2 variables. The closer r is to -1 or +1, the stronger the linear relationship. A statistically significant (ie, p-value < significance level) linear relationship between 2 variables does not imply that the relationship is causal. {{exhibit_1}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of correlation coefficients and their interpretation in statistical analysis, specifically regarding the direction and significance of a linear relationship between two variables. It also assesses the ability to differentiate between correlation and causation.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing that a positive correlation coefficient (r > 0) indicates a positive linear relationship, and a p-value less than the significance level indicates statistical significance. It's crucial to remember that correlation does not imply causation.",
