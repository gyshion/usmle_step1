    "en": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother for a 6-month checkup for asthma. Although the patient's asthma is generally well controlled with long-acting agents, he has episodes of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction for which he was prescribed a short-acting beta agonist. His mother became concerned after the physical education teacher called from school saying that her son was refusing to participate in class. When asked about this, the patient said that it was easier to avoid exercising than to use an inhaler at school. Family history is significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in his maternal grandfather, heart disease in his father, and generalized anxiety disorder in his mother. Vital signs and physical examination are within normal limits.",
    "zh": "一位14岁的男孩由母亲带到诊所进行为期6个月的哮喘复查。尽管患者的哮喘通常通过长效药物得到良好控制，但他会出现运动诱发的支气管收缩，为此他被处方了短效β受体激动剂。他的母亲开始担心，因为体育老师从学校打来电话说她的儿子拒绝参加课堂活动。当被问及此事时，患者说避免运动比在学校使用吸入器更容易。家族史对母亲的外祖父的慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD）、父亲的心脏病和母亲的广泛性焦虑症具有重要意义。生命体征和体格检查均在正常范围内。"

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Adolescence involves developmental tasks of separating from parental figures and finding one's own place in society, which includes taking responsibility for one's physical health. This exploration is often accompanied by rebelling, pushing limits, and having a strong need to fit in with a peer group, all factors that may contribute to low treatment adherence rates. In particular, adolescents with chronic conditions may hide their illness due to feeling self-conscious and different from their peers. Factors associated with better treatment adherence rates include close PEERS WITH COMPLEMENTARY BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES, positive family functioning, school involvement, physician empathy, and immediate benefits of treatment.\n\nAnother factor affecting adolescent treatment adherence is that the prefrontal cortex (center of executive function) does not fully develop until the third decade of life. Compared to adults, adolescents are less able to weigh the risks and benefits of their decisions or to anticipate that negative consequences may occur.\n\n(Choices A and D) Although education and written instruction are important in increasing adherence, adolescents struggle to conceive of possibilities outside their immediate experience and do not anticipate negative consequences happening to them. The desire to improve long-term asthma symptoms or to prevent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is unlikely to be a major motivating factor.\n\n(Choice B) Although learning about role models (eg, famous athletes) with asthma might be helpful, similar peer behavior is more likely to decrease this patient's embarrassment about using an inhaler in the school setting.\n\n(Choice C) Physician education about the patient's illness is unlikely to be as strong a factor in adherence as peer acceptance. As adolescents strive to become more independent, they may rebel against authority figures, including physicians.\n\n(Choice F) Although parental attitudes and support are important in helping adolescents maintain adherence, making the patient feel responsible for causing his mother's concern is inappropriate and unlikely to facilitate adherence.\n\nEducational objective: Adolescents have low treatment adherence rates due to issues with autonomy, rebellion against authority, increased self-consciousness, and a lack of understanding of potential risks. Peer behavior has a strong influence on adherence due to adolescents' desire to fit in with their social groups.",
    "zh": "青春期涉及与父母分离并在社会中找到自己位置的发育任务，其中包括对自身健康的责任。这种探索通常伴随着反叛、挑战极限以及强烈地融入同伴群体的需求，这些都是可能导致治疗依从性降低的因素。特别是患有慢性病的青少年可能会因感到自我意识增强，与同伴不同而隐藏他们的疾病。与更好的治疗依从性相关的因素包括具有互补行为实践的亲密的同伴、积极的家庭功能、学校参与、医生的同情心和治疗的直接益处。\n\n影响青少年治疗依从性的另一个因素是前额叶皮层（执行功能中心）直到三十岁才完全发育。与成人相比，青少年不太能够权衡其决定的风险和益处，或者预测可能发生的不良后果。\n\n（选项 A 和 D）虽然教育和书面说明对于提高依从性很重要，但青少年很难理解超出其直接经验的可能性，并且不会预料到可能发生在他们身上的不良后果。改善长期哮喘症状或预防慢性阻塞性肺病的愿望不太可能成为主要的激励因素。\n\n（选项 B）虽然了解患有哮喘的榜样（例如，著名运动员）可能有所帮助，但类似的同伴行为更有可能减少患者在学校使用吸入器的尴尬感。\n\n（选项 C）医生对患者疾病的教育不太可能像同伴接纳那样成为依从性的强大因素。由于青少年努力变得更加独立，他们可能会反抗权威人物，包括医生。\n\n（选项 F）虽然父母的态度和支持对于帮助青少年保持依从性很重要，但让患者觉得自己对导致他母亲的担忧负责是不合适的，也不太可能促进依从性。\n\n教育目标：由于自主性问题、反抗权威、自我意识增强以及缺乏对潜在风险的理解，青少年依从性较低。由于青少年渴望融入他们的社会群体，同伴行为对依从性有很大影响。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of factors influencing treatment adherence in adolescents, specifically focusing on the impact of peer influence and developmental psychology. It assesses the ability to apply knowledge of adolescent behavior and decision-making to a clinical scenario involving asthma management.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the patient's age and developmental stage, identifying the core issue of non-adherence due to social factors, and evaluating each option based on established principles of adolescent psychology and treatment adherence. Prioritizing peer acceptance and social integration over parental or physician directives is key to understanding the most effective motivational strategies for this age group.",
