    "en": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the office due to postprandial abdominal pain and nausea. The patient has no diarrhea, constipation, bloody stools, or vomiting. Medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis. The abdomen is mildly tender to palpation at the epigastrium but without distension or hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory studies reveal anemia. A small gastric ulcer is seen during upper endoscopy, and biopsies are negative for *Helicobacter pylori*. Biopsies of the duodenum reveal numerous intraepithelial lymphocytes, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. Based on these biopsy findings, this patient is at increased risk for developing which of the following conditions later in life?",

    "en": "This patient's presentation (abdominal pain, anemia) and biopsy findings are suggestive of CELIAC DISEASE, an immune-mediated disorder triggered by gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Diarrhea is also common in celiac disease but may be absent.\n\nGliadin, a breakdown product of gluten, is primarily responsible for causing chronic inflammatory changes of the small bowel. Classic histologic findings, which are most prominent in the proximal small bowel (eg, duodenum, proximal jejunum), include intraepithelial lymphocytes, VILLOUS ATROPHY, and crypt hyperplasia.\n\nChronic lymphocytic recruitment and proliferation within the small-bowel mucosa predisposes to monoclonal T-cell expansion, putting these patients at risk for enteropathy-associated T-CELL LYMPHOMA. This small-bowel cancer is usually very aggressive and has a poor prognosis despite chemotherapy.\n\n(Choice A) Angiodysplasias are dilated, tortuous veins that develop in the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly in the small bowel and cecum. Risk factors include advanced age, chronic kidney disease, and aortic stenosis. They have no association with celiac disease.\n\n(Choice B) In addition to small-bowel lymphoma, celiac disease is a risk factor for small-bowel adenocarcinoma. Unlike ulcerative colitis, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Lynch syndrome, celiac disease does not predispose to colon adenocarcinoma.\n\n(Choice C) Portal vein thrombosis can create portal hypertension, predisposing to ascites and varices. This can occur in patients with hypercoagulable conditions such as polycythemia vera, as well as those with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Celiac disease does not predispose to portal vein thrombosis.\n\n(Choice D) Pyloric stenosis is a congenital disorder that results from pyloric smooth muscle hypertrophy and typically presents with profuse vomiting in infants. It is not associated with celiac disease.\n\nEducational objective:\nCeliac disease, an immune-mediated disorder triggered by gluten, causes small intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytosis, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. Monoclonal T-cell expansion can occur in the small-bowel mucosa of patients, leading to enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现（腹痛、贫血）和活检结果提示乳糜泻，这是一种由麸质（存在于小麦、大麦和黑麦中的一种蛋白质）引起的免疫介导性疾病。腹泻在乳糜泻中也很常见，但可能缺失。\n\n麦醇溶蛋白，麸质的分解产物，是导致小肠慢性炎症变化的主要原因。经典的组织学发现，在近端小肠（如十二指肠、近端空肠）中最明显，包括上皮内淋巴细胞、绒毛萎缩和隐窝增生。\n\n小肠粘膜内慢性淋巴细胞募集和增生易于发生单克隆T细胞扩增，使这些患者易患肠病相关T细胞淋巴瘤。这种小肠癌通常具有侵袭性，即使化疗，预后也很差。\n\n(选项 A) 血管发育不良是发生在胃肠道中的扩张、扭曲的静脉，最常见于小肠和盲肠。危险因素包括高龄、慢性肾病和主动脉瓣狭窄。它们与乳糜泻无关。\n\n(选项 B) 除了小肠淋巴瘤外，乳糜泻也是小肠腺癌的危险因素。与溃疡性结肠炎、家族性腺瘤性息肉病和林奇综合征不同，乳糜泻不会导致结肠腺癌。\n\n(选项 C) 门静脉血栓形成可导致门静脉高压，易发生腹水和静脉曲张。这可能发生在患有高凝状态的患者中，如真性红细胞增多症，以及患有肝硬化和肝细胞癌的患者中。乳糜泻不会导致门静脉血栓形成。\n\n(选项 D) 幽门狭窄是一种先天性疾病，由幽门平滑肌肥大引起，通常表现为婴儿的剧烈呕吐。它与乳糜泻无关。\n\n教育目标：\n乳糜泻，一种由麸质引起的免疫介导性疾病，可引起小肠上皮内淋巴细胞增多、绒毛萎缩和隐窝增生。患者的小肠粘膜中可发生单克隆T细胞扩增，导致肠病相关T细胞淋巴瘤。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of celiac disease and its long-term complications, specifically the increased risk of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. The key findings are the duodenal biopsy results showing intraepithelial lymphocytes, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia, which are characteristic of celiac disease. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the biopsy findings as indicative of celiac disease. Then, recall the association between chronic inflammation in celiac disease and the increased risk of developing enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.
