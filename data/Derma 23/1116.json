    "en": "This patient with well-demarcated, scaly, erythematous plaques involving extensor surfaces of the extremities has typical features of psoriasis. Patients with psoriasis frequently develop additional complications, including:\n\n*   Psoriatic arthritis\n*   Nail changes: yellow-brown discoloration, pitting, thickening, or crumbling\n*   Inflammatory disorders of the eye: conjunctivitis, blepharitis, or uveitis\n\n**Psoriatic arthritis** is an inflammatory disorder affecting the synovium and often the insertion of tendons and ligaments (ie, enthesopathy). It typically manifests as asymmetric oligoarthritis or symmetric polyarthritis (resembling rheumatoid arthritis) that often affects the distal interphalangeal joints. In severe cases, patients can develop an aggressive and destructive arthritis mutilans. The risk is increased in patients who are human leukocyte antigen B27–positive.\n\n(Choice A) Chronic glomerulonephritis frequently occurs in systemic lupus erythematosus; an erythematous malar rash and discoid lesions are common cutaneous findings in lupus.\n\n(Choice C) Medullary thyroid cancer is frequently linked to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2.\n\n(Choice D) Skin lesions, renal insufficiency, and peripheral neuropathy (eg, mononeuropathy multiplex) are frequent findings in polyarteritis nodosa, a vasculitis affecting medium-sized arteries.\n\n(Choice E) Pulmonary fibrosis is a common extradermal manifestation of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and rheumatoid arthritis.",
    "zh": "该患者表现为边界清楚的、鳞屑状、红斑性斑块，累及四肢伸侧，具有银屑病的典型特征。银屑病患者经常发生其他并发症，包括：\n\n*   银屑病关节炎\n*   指甲改变：黄褐色变色、点状凹陷、增厚或碎裂\n*   眼部炎症性疾病：结膜炎、睑炎或葡萄膜炎\n\n**银屑病关节炎**是一种影响滑膜，并常影响肌腱和韧带（即肌腱病）附着点的炎症性疾病。它通常表现为不对称的寡关节炎或对称性多关节炎（类似于类风湿性关节炎），通常影响远端指间关节。在严重的情况下，患者可能会发生侵袭性和破坏性关节炎致残。对于人类白细胞抗原B27阳性的患者，风险会增加。\n\n（选项A）慢性肾小球肾炎经常发生在系统性红斑狼疮中；红斑性颧部皮疹和盘状病变是狼疮常见的皮肤表现。\n\n（选项C）甲状腺髓样癌经常与多发性内分泌肿瘤2型相关。\n\n（选项D）皮肤病变、肾功能不全和周围神经病变（例如，多发性单神经病）是结节性多动脉炎（一种影响中型动脉的血管炎）常见的表现。\n\n（选项E）肺纤维化是系统性硬化症（硬皮病）和类风湿性关节炎常见的皮肤外表现。"
