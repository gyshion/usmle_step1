    "en": "A 47-year-old man comes to the office due to worsening muscle weakness and dark urine for the past several days. Two weeks ago, the patient was evaluated for dyspepsia and found to have *Helicobacter pylori* infection; he was started on treatment and has had partial symptom improvement. Medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which he takes amlodipine and simvastatin. Temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 74/min. Physical examination shows diffuse muscle tenderness. Laboratory evaluation reveals elevated blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. Urine microscopy shows no red or white blood cells.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient presents with muscle weakness, dark urine, elevated BUN and creatinine, and diffuse muscle tenderness. The dark urine suggests myoglobinuria, which is indicative of MYOCYTE NECROSIS. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of STATIN MYOPATHY, a condition characterized by muscle damage that can lead to rhabdomyolysis and ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY. Statins, such as simvastatin, are metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme CYP3A4. The patient is taking simvastatin for hyperlipidemia. The patient was also recently started on a multidrug regimen for *H. pylori* infection. Certain medications can inhibit CYP3A4, leading to increased statin drug levels and subsequent statin myopathy. Among the options provided, CLARITHROMYCIN is a macrolide antibiotic that is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Therefore, clarithromycin is the most likely medication to have precipitated the patient's statin myopathy. The table provided lists concurrent medications and statin myopathy, highlighting CYP3A4 inhibitors like erythromycin and clarithromycin as potential culprits. The explanation further elaborates that statins, primarily simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin, are metabolized by CYP3A4, and this enzyme can be inhibited by macrolide antibiotics, leading to increased statin drug levels and subsequent statin myopathy. (Choice A) Amoxicillin is a penicillin antibiotic and does not significantly inhibit CYP3A4 or increase circulating simvastatin levels. Penicillin antibiotics generally have only minor effects on the cytochrome P-450 system. (Choice B) Bismuth subsalicylate can cause black stools due to the formation of bismuth sulfate in the gastrointestinal tract. While excessive intake can cause motor weakness, this is primarily due to neural effects rather than muscle toxicity or myoglobinuria. It does not typically cause statin myopathy. (Choice C) Polyvalent cations, such as calcium, can form insoluble chelate complexes with certain antibiotics (e.g., tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones) and other drugs, leading to decreased drug absorption. Simvastatin does not form chelate complexes, and decreased absorption would lower, not increase, the risk for myopathy. (Choice E) Metronidazole can carry a small risk for peripheral neuropathy, which can cause pain and numbness, but it is not directly associated with statin myopathy or myoglobinuria. While some drug interactions with statins exist, metronidazole is not a significant CYP3A4 inhibitor in the same way as clarithromycin.",
    "zh": "患者表现为肌肉无力、尿色加深、血尿素氮和肌酐升高以及弥漫性肌肉触痛。尿色加深提示肌红蛋白尿，这表明肌细胞坏死。这种临床表现高度提示他汀类药物引起的肌病，这是一种以肌肉损伤为特征的疾病，可导致横纹肌溶解和急性肾损伤。他汀类药物，如辛伐他汀，由细胞色素P-450酶CYP3A4代谢。患者正在服用辛伐他汀治疗高脂血症。患者最近还开始接受多药方案治疗幽门螺杆菌感染。某些药物可以抑制CYP3A4，导致他汀类药物水平升高，进而导致他汀类药物引起的肌病。在提供的选项中，克拉霉素是一种大环内酯类抗生素，是CYP3A4的强效抑制剂。因此，克拉霉素最有可能诱发患者的他汀类药物引起的肌病。提供的表格列出了并发用药和他汀类药物引起的肌病，强调了CYP3A4抑制剂，如红霉素和克拉霉素，是潜在的罪魁祸首。解释进一步阐述说，他汀类药物，主要是辛伐他汀、洛伐他汀和阿托伐他汀，由CYP3A4代谢，而这种酶可以被大环内酯类抗生素抑制，导致他汀类药物水平升高，进而导致他汀类药物引起的肌病。(选项A)阿莫西林是一种青霉素类抗生素，不会显著抑制CYP3A4或增加循环辛伐他汀水平。青霉素类抗生素通常对细胞色素P-450系统只有轻微影响。(选项B)次水杨酸铋可因胃肠道中硫酸铋的形成而导致黑便。虽然过量摄入会导致运动无力，但这主要是由于神经影响，而不是肌肉毒性或肌红蛋白尿。它通常不会引起他汀类药物引起的肌病。(选项C)多价阳离子，如钙，可与某些抗生素（例如，四环素、氟喹诺酮类）和其他药物形成不溶性螯合复合物，导致药物吸收减少。辛伐他汀不形成螯合复合物，吸收减少会降低而不是增加肌病的风险。(选项E)甲硝唑可能存在周围神经病的风险，这可能导致疼痛和麻木，但它与他汀类药物引起的肌病或肌红蛋白尿没有直接关系。虽然他汀类药物存在一些药物相互作用，但甲硝唑不像克拉霉素那样是显著的CYP3A4抑制剂。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of drug-drug interactions that can lead to STATIN MYOPATHY. Specifically, it assesses the knowledge that certain antibiotics, particularly MACROLIDES like clarithromycin, inhibit CYP3A4 metabolism of statins, leading to increased statin levels and increased risk of myotoxicity.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the patient's symptoms as consistent with statin myopathy, recognize that the patient is on simvastatin, and then evaluate the provided medication options for potential CYP3A4 inhibitors that could exacerbate statin toxicity. The key is to link the *H. pylori* treatment regimen to the statin side effect.",
