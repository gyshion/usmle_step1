  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": " The Doppler graph shows the normal pattern of blood flow across the MITRAL VALVE from the left atrium to left ventricle during DIASTOLE. There is an initial phase of rapid transmitral blood flow after the mitral valve opens, which represents early ventricular filling (E wave). This is followed by a period of minimal blood flow (diastasis), which occurs due to equalization in pressure between the left atrium and ventricle. Finally, there is a second peak corresponding to increased transmitral blood flow due to ATRIAL CONTRACTION (A wave). The A wave ends with the first heart sound (S1) caused by mitral (and tricuspid) valve closure.\n\nWhen Present, a THIRD HEART SOUND (S3) occurs during diastole and is best heard with the bell of the stethoscope over the cardiac apex with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. It is due to sudden limitation of ventricular movement during PASSIVE VENTRICULAR FILLING. An S3 may be a normal finding in healthy young adults; however, in patients age >40 it suggests abnormal ventricular cavity enlargement as occurs in chronic severe mitral regurgitation, chronic aortic regurgitation, or dilated cardiomyopathy; occasionally, it may be present in high cardiac output states such as pregnancy or thyrotoxicosis.\n\n(Choice A) A fourth heart sound is a low-frequency, late diastolic sound coinciding with atrial systole. It is caused by a sudden rise in end-diastolic pressure as blood strikes a stiff left ventricular wall, and most commonly suggests concentric left ventricular hypertrophy such as occurs in prolonged hypertension or severe aortic stenosis.\n\n(Choice B) A midsystolic click is associated with mitral valve prolapse. In patients with mitral valve prolapse and mitral regurgitation, there will be blood flow away from an apical Doppler probe during systole.\n\n(Choice C) The second heart sound results from closure of the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonic) at the end of systole.",
    "zh": "多普勒图显示了舒张期血液流经二尖瓣从左心房到左心室的正常模式。二尖瓣开放后，存在一个快速的经二尖瓣血流的初始阶段，代表早期心室充盈（E波）。随后是一个血流最小的时期（舒张期），这是由于左心房和心室之间的压力平衡所致。最后，有一个与心房收缩（A波）相关的经二尖瓣血流增加的第二个峰值。A波以第一心音（S1）结束，该声音是由二尖瓣（和三尖瓣）关闭引起的。\n\n当存在时，第三心音 (S3) 发生在舒张期，并且最好用听诊器的钟形部分在心脏心尖处听诊，患者呈左侧卧位。它是由被动心室充盈期间心室运动的突然受限引起的。S3可能是健康年轻人的正常表现；然而，在年龄>40岁的患者中，它提示心室腔异常增大，如慢性重度二尖瓣反流、慢性主动脉瓣反流或扩张型心肌病；偶尔，它也可能出现在高心输出量状态下，如妊娠或甲状腺毒症。\n\n(选项 A) 第四心音是一种低频、舒张晚期心音，与心房收缩同时发生。它是由血液撞击僵硬的左心室壁时舒张末期压力突然升高引起的，最常提示向心性左心室肥大，如长期高血压或严重主动脉瓣狭窄。\n\n(选项 B) 收缩中期喀喇音与二尖瓣脱垂有关。在二尖瓣脱垂和二尖瓣反流的患者中，在收缩期，血液会远离心尖多普勒探头。\n\n(选项 C) 第二心音是由半月瓣（主动脉瓣和肺动脉瓣）在收缩末期关闭引起的。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of heart sounds and their correlation with the cardiac cycle, specifically focusing on the third heart sound (S3) and its association with rapid ventricular filling. The question requires understanding of Doppler flow patterns across the mitral valve and relating them to auscultation findings.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the phase of the cardiac cycle represented by the arrow on the Doppler flow pattern. Recognize that the third heart sound (S3) occurs during rapid ventricular filling in diastole, which corresponds to the E wave on the Doppler tracing. Eliminate other options based on their timing in the cardiac cycle.",
