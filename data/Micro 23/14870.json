    "en": "A 48-year-old homeless man is brought to the emergency department after being found unresponsive on the sidewalk. Medical history is unknown. Temperature is 38.3 C (101 F), blood pressure is 116/70 mm Hg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 26/min. Oxygen saturation is 88% on 100% oxygen via face mask. The patient is ill-appearing, thin, and disheveled with poor dentition. There are a few white patches on the oral mucosa, but no skin rash is present. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral crackles. There are healed abdominal scars from a previous surgery. The abdomen is soft with no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Chest x-ray reveals bilateral interstitial infiltrates. A silver-stained bronchoalveolar lavage specimen is shown in the image {{exhibit_1}}.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This homeless patient has hypoxia, bilateral interstitial infiltrates, and a positive silver stain indicating likely Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), an atypical fungal infection caused by the opportunistic pathogen P. jirovecii. Inhalation of the organism leads to inoculation of the alveolar space. Healthy individuals rarely develop symptoms as alveolar monocytes and macrophages are stimulated by the cell-mediated immune response to rapidly clear the organism. However, patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity, particularly those with untreated AIDS (CD4 count <200/mm3), often cannot eliminate the pathogen.\n\nPCP typically manifests with slowly worsening pulmonary symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea), hypoxia, and chest x-ray evidence of a diffuse, bilateral interstitial infiltrate. Because P. jirovecii cannot be cultured, diagnosis is made by identifying the organism in respiratory secretions using specialized stains (eg, methenamine silver stain). This patient also has oral pharyngeal candidiasis (white patches on the oral mucosa), an opportunistic infection often seen in those with impaired cell-mediated immunity.\n\n(Choice A) Aspiration pneumonia is common in patients who have impaired levels of consciousness. It usually presents with cough productive of foul-smelling sputum, dyspnea, fever, and a lobar infiltrate on chest x-ray. Most cases are caused by a mixture of anaerobic organisms.\n\n(Choices B and E) Cigarette smoking impairs the ability of the cilia to clear mucus, which can lead to recurrent bacterial pneumonia. Patients with splenectomy are at increased risk for fulminant bacterial infections, particularly with encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. Bacterial pneumonia usually presents with cough productive of sputum, dyspnea, fever, and a lobar infiltrate on chest x-ray. The presence of diffuse interstitial infiltrates and a positive silver stain make PCP more likely.\n\n(Choice C) The humoral antibody response is important for the elimination of pathogenic bacterial and viral infections. Although viral pneumonia can cause bilateral interstitial infiltrates, viruses are not identified on silver stain.\n\nEducational objective:\nPneumocystis pneumonia is an atypical fungal infection seen primarily in those with impaired cell-mediated immunity (eg, advanced AIDS). Manifestations often include slowly worsening pulmonary symptoms, hypoxia, and bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray. The cystic organism can be visualized using silver stain of respiratory secretions. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "这位流浪汉有低氧血症、双侧间质浸润，且银染呈阳性，表明可能患有肺孢子虫肺炎（PCP），这是一种由机会性病原体P. jirovecii引起的非典型真菌感染。吸入该生物会导致肺泡空间接种。健康个体很少出现症状，因为肺泡单核细胞和巨噬细胞受到细胞介导的免疫反应的刺激，可迅速清除该生物。然而，细胞介导免疫功能受损的患者，尤其是未经治疗的艾滋病患者（CD4计数<200/mm3），通常无法清除病原体。\n\nPCP通常表现为缓慢恶化的肺部症状（例如，咳嗽、呼吸困难）、低氧血症和胸部X光片上弥漫性、双侧间质浸润的证据。由于不能培养P. jirovecii，诊断是通过使用特殊染色（例如，甲胺银染色）鉴定呼吸道分泌物中的生物来实现的。该患者还患有口咽念珠菌病（口腔黏膜上的白色斑块），这是一种机会性感染，常在细胞介导免疫功能受损的患者中发现。\n\n（选项A）吸入性肺炎在意识水平受损的患者中很常见。它通常表现为咳嗽，咳出恶臭痰，呼吸困难，发烧和胸部X光片上的叶状浸润。大多数病例是由厌氧生物混合引起的。\n\n（选项B和E）吸烟会损害纤毛清除黏液的能力，这可能导致复发性细菌性肺炎。脾切除术后的患者发生暴发性细菌感染的风险增加，特别是对肺炎链球菌等包膜生物而言。细菌性肺炎通常表现为咳嗽，咳出痰，呼吸困难，发烧和胸部X光片上的叶状浸润。弥漫性间质浸润和银染阳性的存在使PCP更有可能。\n\n（选项C）体液抗体反应对于消除致病性细菌和病毒感染非常重要。虽然病毒性肺炎可引起双侧间质浸润，但银染中未鉴定出病毒。\n\n教育目标：\n肺孢子虫肺炎是一种非典型真菌感染，主要见于细胞介导免疫功能受损的患者（例如，晚期艾滋病）。表现通常包括缓慢恶化的肺部症状、低氧血症和胸部X光片上的双侧间质浸润。可以使用呼吸道分泌物的银染来观察囊性生物。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and its association with impaired cell-mediated immunity, particularly in patients with AIDS. It also assesses the ability to recognize clinical features and diagnostic findings suggestive of PCP.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the risk factors for PCP (homelessness, oral candidiasis, hypoxia, bilateral interstitial infiltrates) and the diagnostic clue of a positive silver stain. Considering the patient's presentation and risk factors, impaired cell-mediated immunity is the most likely predisposing factor.",
