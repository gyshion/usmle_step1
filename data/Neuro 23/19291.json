    "en": "A 62-year-old woman comes to the office for follow-up a month after undergoing left mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection for invasive ductal carcinoma. Today, the patient feels well overall but reports continued burning and aching in her left upper arm, despite physical therapy. Examination of the left chest wall shows a healing incision without erythema and mild but appropriate edema of the left chest wall and axillary soft tissues. Sensation is diminished in the medial upper arm, near the axilla. Shoulder range of motion is normal, and the rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. Injury to which of the following nerves is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient who underwent axillary lymph node dissection has persistent sensory dysfunction (eg, burning, aching, diminished sensation) in her medial upper arm, findings consistent with intercostobrachial nerve injury. The intercostobrachial nerve is a purely sensory nerve that typically originates from the second intercostal nerve's lateral cutaneous branch and then traverses the axilla to innervate the skin of the axilla and medial upper arm.\n\nThe intercostobrachial nerve is the most frequently injured nerve (whether by stretching or transection) during axillary lymph node dissection. However, injuries to other at-risk nerves are often more feared due to the resultant motor deficits:\n\n*   Long thoracic nerve (serratus anterior): Damage results in scapular winging and weakness of arm abduction above the horizontal level.\n*   Thoracodorsal nerve (latissimus dorsi): Damage results in loss of powerful adduction of the arm and weakness while extending and medially rotating the arm (Choice D).\n*   Medial pectoral (pectoralis minor and major) and lateral pectoral (pectoralis major) nerves: Damage results in weakness while adducting and medially rotating the arm. In addition, there may be weakness flexing (clavicular head) or extending (sternocostal head) the humerus. (Choice B)\n\nThis patient has normal shoulder range of motion and an otherwise unremarkable examination (ie, no motor weakness), making injury to these nerves less likely. In addition, because the long thoracic, thoracodorsal, and medial and lateral pectoral nerves are primarily motor nerves and not responsible for any cutaneous sensation, their injury would not explain this patient's sensory deficits.\n\n(Choice C) The suprascapular nerve provides sensation to the shoulder joint (glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints) and motor innervation to the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. It branches off the upper trunk of the brachial plexus and travels posteriorly towards the suprascapular notch of the scapula, where it is prone to injury; it does not travel through the axilla and is not at risk during axillary dissection.\n\nEducational objective:\nMultiple nerves are at risk for injury during axillary lymph node dissection. Intercostobrachial nerve injury results in sensory dysfunction (eg, burning, numbness) to the skin of the axilla and medial upper arm. Injury to the long thoracic (serratus anterior), thoracodorsal (latissimus dorsi), medial pectoral (pectoralis minor and major), or lateral pectoral (pectoralis major) nerves results in motor deficits to corresponding muscles. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "这位接受腋窝淋巴结清扫术的患者，其内侧上臂持续存在感觉功能障碍（如烧灼感、疼痛、感觉减退），这与肋间臂神经损伤一致。肋间臂神经是一条纯感觉神经，通常起源于第二肋间神经的外侧皮支，然后穿过腋窝，支配腋窝和内侧上臂的皮肤。\n\n肋间臂神经是腋窝淋巴结清扫术中最常受损的神经（无论是牵拉还是切断）。然而，由于由此产生的运动功能缺陷，其他高危神经的损伤往往更令人担忧：\n\n*   胸长神经（前锯肌）：损伤导致肩胛骨翼状改变和手臂在水平以上外展无力。\n*   胸背神经（背阔肌）：损伤导致手臂强力内收功能丧失，以及伸展和内旋手臂时无力（选项 D）。\n*   内侧胸神经（胸小肌和胸大肌）和外侧胸神经（胸大肌）：损伤导致手臂内收和内旋时无力。此外，可能出现屈曲（锁骨头）或伸展（胸骨肋骨头）肱骨的无力。（选项 B）\n\n该患者肩关节活动范围正常，且体格检查无其他异常（即无运动无力），这使得这些神经损伤的可能性较小。此外，由于胸长神经、胸背神经和内侧和外侧胸神经主要是运动神经，不负责任何皮肤感觉，因此它们的损伤并不能解释该患者的感觉缺陷。\n\n（选项 C）肩胛上神经为肩关节（肩肱关节和肩锁关节）提供感觉，并为冈上肌和冈下肌提供运动神经支配。它从臂丛神经上干分出，向后行进至肩胛骨的肩胛上切迹，那里容易受伤；它不穿过腋窝，在腋窝清扫术中没有风险。\n\n教育目标：\n腋窝淋巴结清扫术中，多条神经存在损伤风险。肋间臂神经损伤导致腋窝和内侧上臂皮肤感觉功能障碍（如烧灼感、麻木）。胸长神经（前锯肌）、胸背神经（背阔肌）、内侧胸神经（胸小肌和胸大肌）或外侧胸神经（胸大肌）的损伤导致相应肌肉的运动功能缺陷。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the complications of axillary lymph node dissection, specifically intercostobrachial nerve injury. It assesses the ability to correlate the anatomical location of the nerve with the patient's sensory symptoms. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the patient's symptoms are purely sensory and localized to the medial upper arm and axilla. Understanding the anatomical course and function of the nerves at risk during axillary lymph node dissection helps to identify the intercostobrachial nerve as the most likely culprit.",
    "zh": "本题考察了关于腋窝淋巴结清扫术并发症的知识，特别是肋间臂神经损伤。它评估了将神经的解剖位置与患者的感觉症状相关联的能力。\n\n解决此问题的关键是认识到患者的症状纯粹是感觉性的，并且局限于内侧上臂和腋窝。了解腋窝淋巴结清扫术中存在风险的神经的解剖走行和功能，有助于确定肋间臂神经是最有可能的罪魁祸首。"
