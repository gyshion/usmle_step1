    "en": "A 6-year-old boy with no chronic medical conditions is brought to the emergency department due to confusion and intractable vomiting. His symptoms began a few hours ago and have gradually worsened. The patient's mother reports that he contracted a febrile illness from his younger brother 2 days ago. She gave the patient one tablet of an over-the-counter cold medication yesterday, and his fever resolved. While the mother is speaking, the patient lapses into a coma. If a liver biopsy were performed, light microscopy of the specimen would most likely reveal which of the following?",

    "en": "Children with a febrile illness (eg, influenza, varicella) treated with salicylates (eg, aspirin) are at risk for developing Reye syndrome. It is hypothesized that affected children may have an inborn metabolic error that renders them sensitive to the toxic effects of salicylates, particularly in virus-infected cells. Aspirin in these individuals causes mitochondrial dysfunction, which results in impaired fatty acid metabolism and the two components of Reye syndrome:\n\n•\tHepatic dysfunction results from the mitochondrial insult and manifests with hepatomegaly, elevated transaminases, hyperammonemia, and prolonged PT and PTT. Bilirubin is typically normal, and jaundice is rare. Light microscopy of a liver specimen shows microvesicular steatosis (ie, small fat vacuoles in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes) without necrosis or inflammation. Electron microscopy findings include swollen mitochondria.\n\n•\tEncephalopathy is attributed to hepatic dysfunction and the toxic effect of hyperammonemia on the CNS, leading to cerebral edema. Vomiting and confusion from cerebral swelling can rapidly progress to coma and potentially death.\n\nTo avoid the possibility of inducing Reye syndrome, aspirin should not be administered to children except in the management of Kawasaki disease and rheumatologic diseases (eg, juvenile idiopathic arthritis).\n\n(Choices A and E) Apoptosis of hepatocytes and periportal mononuclear inflammatory infiltration are microscopic findings seen in viral hepatitis. In contrast to this patient's presentation, hepatic encephalopathy from viral hepatitis would develop gradually.\n\n(Choice B) Primary biliary cholangitis is characterized by bile duct destruction and periductal granulomatous inflammation. Hepatic encephalopathy may occur as a late finding of chronic cirrhosis but would not present acutely, as Reye syndrome did in this patient.\n\n(Choice C) In congestive heart failure, which would manifest with peripheral edema rather than rapidly progressive encephalopathy, the liver shows centrilobular congestion and, in some cases, centrilobular necrosis. Centrilobular necrosis can also be seen with acetaminophen toxicity, which is unlikely in this patient who received a single antipyretic tablet.\n\nEducational objective:\nReye syndrome is characterized by liver failure and encephalopathy following salicylate (aspirin) administration in children with a febrile illness. Aspirin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction causes impaired fatty acid metabolism and microvesicular steatosis of the liver.",
    "zh": "患有发热性疾病（如流感、水痘）并接受水杨酸盐（如阿司匹林）治疗的儿童有患Reye综合征的风险。推测受影响的儿童可能存在先天性代谢错误，使其对水杨酸盐的毒性作用敏感，尤其是在病毒感染的细胞中。这些个体的阿司匹林会导致线粒体功能障碍，导致脂肪酸代谢受损，并导致Reye综合征的两个组成部分：\n\n•\t肝功能障碍源于线粒体损伤，表现为肝肿大、转氨酶升高、高氨血症以及PT和PTT延长。胆红素通常正常，黄疸罕见。肝脏标本的光学显微镜检查显示微泡性脂肪变性（即，肝细胞胞质中的小脂肪空泡），没有坏死或炎症。电镜检查结果包括线粒体肿胀。\n\n•\t脑病归因于肝功能障碍和高氨血症对中枢神经系统的毒性作用，导致脑水肿。脑肿胀引起的呕吐和意识模糊可迅速进展为昏迷，并可能导致死亡。\n\n为避免诱发Reye综合征的可能性，除用于治疗川崎病和风湿病（如幼年特发性关节炎）外，不应给儿童服用阿司匹林。\n\n（选项 A 和 E）肝细胞凋亡和门管区单核炎症浸润是病毒性肝炎中观察到的显微镜下发现。与该患者的临床表现相比，病毒性肝炎引起的肝性脑病会逐渐发展。\n\n（选项 B）原发性胆汁性胆管炎的特征是胆管破坏和管周肉芽肿性炎症。肝性脑病可能作为慢性肝硬化的晚期表现出现，但不会像该患者的Reye综合征那样急性发病。\n\n（选项 C）在充血性心力衰竭中，其表现为周围性水肿而非快速进展性脑病，肝脏表现为中央小叶淤血，在某些情况下，还会出现中央小叶坏死。中央小叶坏死也可发生于对乙酰氨基酚中毒，但这在该患者中不太可能发生，因为他只服用了一片解热药。\n\n教育目标：\nReye综合征的特征是，在患有发热性疾病的儿童中，服用水杨酸盐（阿司匹林）后出现肝衰竭和脑病。阿司匹林诱导的线粒体功能障碍会导致脂肪酸代谢受损和肝脏微泡性脂肪变性。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Reye syndrome, specifically the characteristic liver biopsy findings of microvesicular steatosis. It also tests the understanding of the pathophysiology involving mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired fatty acid metabolism following salicylate administration in children with a febrile illness. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of acute encephalopathy and liver dysfunction in a child with a recent febrile illness who received over-the-counter medication. Recall that Reye syndrome is associated with aspirin use and leads to microvesicular steatosis on liver biopsy.",
