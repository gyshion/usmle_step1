    "en": "A 62-year-old woman comes to the office due to tingling and numbness in her feet over the last several months. The patient has also noticed a small ulcer on her right foot that “doesn’t seem to be healing.” Medical history is significant for long-term diabetes, hypertension, and gout. Physical examination shows decreased pain sensation over both feet and bilateral absence of ankle reflexes.",

    "en": "This patient with long-standing diabetes has numbness and tingling in her feet and reduced ankle reflexes bilaterally. This presentation suggests DIABETIC NEUROPATHY, a common complication of diabetes mellitus that is associated with poor glycemic control and/or long disease duration. It often manifests as a length-dependent PERIPHERAL POLYNEUROPATHY that primarily affects sensory axons; patients typically develop a STOCKING-AND-GLOVE pattern of pain or paresthesia. Diminished pain sensation coupled with poor wound healing predisposes diabetic patients to develop NONHEALING WOUNDS.\n\nNeuronal injury in diabetes mellitus is multifactorial but largely occurs through the following mechanisms:\n\n*   Nonenzymatic glycosylation of tissue proteins (eg, nerve, vasa nervorum) results in HYALINIZATION of ENDONEURIAL ARTERIOLES, leading to narrowing of the arteriole lumens and ISCHEMIC NERVE DAMAGE.\n*   Additionally, glycosylation end-products are directly toxic to nerve tissue.\n*   Intracellular hyperglycemia occurs in peripheral nerves and results in increased metabolism of glucose into sorbitol by aldose reductase. Sorbitol accumulation increases cell osmolality, facilitates water influx into the cell, and promotes OXIDATIVE STRESS within the nerve.\n\n(Choice B) Endoneurial inflammatory infiltration of the peripheral nerves is characteristic of Guillain-Barré syndrome, which typically causes a rapidly progressive ascending paralysis rather than a slowly progressive paresthesia. Segmental demyelination is another typical pathologic finding.\n\n(Choice C) Myelin protein gene mutations are involved in the pathogenesis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which presents with weakness of foot dorsiflexion due to involvement of the common peroneal nerve; sensory symptoms are typically less prominent.\n\n(Choice D) Entrapment of a nerve within an anatomic compartment leads to compression neuropathy. The most common example is carpal tunnel syndrome, which occurs due to compression of the median nerve at the wrist.\n\n(Choice E) Abnormal signal transmission at the neuromuscular junction is characteristic of myasthenia gravis (MG), which occurs due to antibodies against acetylcholine receptors, and Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES), which occurs due to antibodies against presynaptic calcium channels. MG causes fatigable weakness that is most prominent in the facial and proximal muscles, while LES results in weakness that improves with repetition.\n\nEducational objective:\nDiabetic peripheral neuropathy is characterized by numbness and paresthesia in a stocking-and-glove distribution. It results from nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins, leading to hyalinization of endoneurial arteries and ischemic nerve damage. In addition, accumulation of toxic substances within neurons results in deranged metabolism and increased oxidative stress.",
    "zh": "这位长期患有糖尿病的患者双脚麻木和刺痛，双侧踝反射减弱。这种表现提示糖尿病神经病变，这是糖尿病的常见并发症，与血糖控制不佳和/或病程较长有关。它通常表现为长度依赖性周围多发性神经病，主要影响感觉轴突；患者通常会出现袜套-手套样疼痛或感觉异常。疼痛感减弱加上伤口愈合不良，使糖尿病患者容易发生不愈合的伤口。\n\n糖尿病的神经损伤是多因素的，但主要通过以下机制发生：\n\n*   组织蛋白（如神经、神经滋养血管）的非酶促糖基化导致神经内膜小动脉的玻璃样变性，导致小动脉管腔狭窄和缺血性神经损伤。\n*   此外，糖基化终末产物对神经组织具有直接毒性。\n*   外周神经中发生细胞内高血糖，导致葡萄糖在醛糖还原酶的作用下代谢成山梨醇。山梨醇的积累会增加细胞渗透压，促进水流入细胞，并在神经内产生氧化应激。\n\n（选项B）周围神经的神经内膜炎性浸润是格林-巴利综合征的特征，通常会导致快速进展性上升性麻痹，而不是缓慢进展的感觉异常。节段性脱髓鞘是另一个典型的病理发现。\n\n（选项C）髓磷脂蛋白基因突变参与夏科-马里-牙病的发病机制，该病表现为由于腓总神经受累引起的足背屈无力；感觉症状通常不明显。\n\n（选项D）神经在解剖间隙内受压会导致压迫性神经病。最常见的例子是腕管综合征，这是由于腕部正中神经受压所致。\n\n（选项E）神经肌肉接头的信号传递异常是重症肌无力（MG）的特征，重症肌无力是由于针对乙酰胆碱受体的抗体引起的，也是兰伯特-伊顿综合征（LES）的特征，兰伯特-伊顿综合征是由于针对突触前钙通道的抗体引起的。重症肌无力引起可疲劳性无力，在面部和近端肌肉中最明显，而LES引起无力，并随着重复而改善。\n\n教育目标：\n糖尿病周围神经病变的特征是袜套-手套样分布的麻木和感觉异常。它是由蛋白质的非酶促糖基化引起的，导致神经内膜动脉的玻璃样变性和缺血性神经损伤。此外，神经元内毒性物质的积累导致代谢紊乱和氧化应激增加。"
