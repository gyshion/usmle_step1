    "en": "A 17-year-old girl is brought to the office by her parents for evaluation following the accidental drowning of her younger sister a week ago. The patient, her sister, and 2 friends had gone swimming in the ocean. When the sister became submerged, the patient attempted to rescue her but was overpowered by strong rip currents and was forced to return to shore. The mother is concerned that her daughter seems to be unaware of her sister's death and believes she is \"in denial.\" The patient was unable to answer questions from the police about the drowning and reports she cannot remember any details of what happened that day. Physical examination is unremarkable. On mental status examination, the patient is alert and fully oriented. She becomes upset and confused when the incident is discussed.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's inability to recall an event that cannot be explained as ordinary forgetfulness is consistent with DISSOCIATIVE AMNESIA. This disorder typically consists of localized or selective amnesia for a PARTICULAR EVENT, as in this patient's inability to recall her sister's drowning, but it can also involve more GENERALIZED AMNESIA for personal identity and AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY. Onset is typically sudden and preceded by overwhelming or intolerable events.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis requires ruling out the effects of a substance (eg, alcohol-induced blackouts, illicit substances, medications) or a neurologic condition (eg, brain trauma). Amnesia involving traumatic events can also occur as a feature of acute or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n(Choice A) Adjustment disorder is characterized by psychologic symptoms that occur in response to an identifiable, non-life-threatening psychosocial stressor (eg, relationship conflict, job loss). Adjustment disorder would not explain this patient's sudden amnesia in response to an overwhelming traumatic event.\n\n(Choice B) Although complicated grief reaction may include a sense of disbelief, it is a persistent disorder that lasts at least 6-12 months after the loss. It is characterized by intense yearning for the deceased, ruminative thoughts, and dysfunctional behavior.\n\n(Choice C) Conversion disorder (functional neurologic symptom disorder) is characterized by motor or sensory neurologic symptoms (eg, weakness, abnormal movements, nonepileptic seizures) that are inconsistent with recognized neurologic disease. Although the onset is typically sudden and may include dissociative symptoms, this patient lacks the motor and sensory symptoms necessary for this diagnosis.\n\n(Choice E) Although a history of trauma and amnesia for the traumatic event is also seen in PTSD, this patient lacks other key symptoms of this disorder (eg, hyperarousal, intrusive memories/nightmares/flashbacks, avoidance behaviors). In addition, PTSD is diagnosed only if symptoms last >4 weeks.\n\nEducational objective: Dissociative amnesia involves an isolated inability to recall important autobiographical information that is inconsistent with ordinary forgetfulness. It typically occurs abruptly following an overwhelming, traumatic event.",
    "zh": "该患者无法回忆起无法解释为普通健忘症的事件，这与分离性遗忘症一致。 这种疾病通常包括对特定事件的局限性或选择性遗忘，如该患者无法回忆起她妹妹溺水身亡，但它也可能涉及对个人身份和自传史的更普遍的遗忘。 发病通常是突然的，并且发生在压倒性或无法忍受的事件之前。\n\n明确诊断需要排除物质的影响（例如，酒精引起的停电，非法物质，药物）或神经系统疾病（例如，脑外伤）。 涉及创伤性事件的遗忘症也可能作为急性或创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD) 的特征而发生。\n\n(选项 A) 适应障碍的特点是由于可识别的、非威胁生命的社会心理应激源（例如，人际关系冲突、失业）而发生的心理症状。 适应障碍无法解释该患者对压倒性创伤性事件的突然失忆。\n\n(选项 B) 虽然复杂的悲伤反应可能包括不相信的感觉，但它是一种持续性障碍，在失去后持续至少 6-12 个月。 它的特点是对死者强烈的渴望、反刍的想法和功能失调的行为。\n\n(选项 C) 转换障碍（功能性神经系统症状障碍）的特征是与已知的神经系统疾病不一致的运动或感觉神经系统症状（例如，虚弱、异常运动、非癫痫发作）。 虽然发病通常是突然的，并且可能包括分离症状，但该患者缺乏诊断所需的运动和感觉症状。\n\n(选项 E) 虽然在 PTSD 中也可见创伤史和对创伤性事件的遗忘症，但该患者缺乏该疾病的其他关键症状（例如，过度警觉、侵入性记忆/噩梦/闪回、回避行为）。 此外，只有当症状持续超过 4 周时，才能诊断为 PTSD。\n\n教育目标：分离性遗忘症涉及无法回忆起与普通健忘症不符的重要自传信息。它通常在压倒性的创伤性事件后突然发生。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of dissociative disorders, specifically the presentation and diagnostic criteria for dissociative amnesia in the context of a traumatic event. It requires differentiating dissociative amnesia from other trauma-related and grief-related disorders.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the core symptom of inability to recall a specific traumatic event. Evaluate the provided options, considering the defining features of each disorder and how they align with the patient's presentation, particularly the absence of other PTSD symptoms and the presence of selective amnesia.",
