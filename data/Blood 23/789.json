    "en": "Deficiencies of folic acid and vitamin B12 are the most important causes of megaloblastic anemia. Both of these vitamins are required for DNA synthesis in erythropoiesis. When there is a deficiency of either of these vitamins, cell division is delayed, though the cytoplasm develops normally. Thus, the cells enlarge (megaloblasts) but do not divide. The bone marrow is hypercellular in megaloblastic anemia, but the megaloblastic erythroid precursor cells are rapidly destroyed in the bone marrow and few differentiated large RBCs are released into the circulation. In severe megaloblastic anemia, 90% of erythroid precursors are destroyed without ever entering the circulation.\n\nVitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies cause similar hematological pictures. However, neurological dysfunction is only seen in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency. This is because B12 deficiency also causes axonal demyelination and degeneration. In late disease, the neurological dysfunction may be irreversible. The main sites of neurological involvement include the peripheral nerves, spinal cord (posterior and lateral columns), and the cerebrum. Decreased vibratory and position sense are early signs of vitamin B12 deficiency. Patients experience ataxia and recurrent falls because of compromised proprioception. Importantly, neurologic abnormalities can occur in vitamin B12 deficiency in the absence of frank anemia. Treating megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency with folate alone could worsen the neurological dysfunction.\n\nAn RBC mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of more than 100 fL is suggestive of megaloblastic anemia. However, RBC macrocytosis can also occur in liver disease, hypothyroidism, and alcohol-induced liver disease. MCVs greater than 110 fL are typically seen only with vitamin B12 and folic acid anemias. On peripheral blood smear, there is macrocytosis (large RBCs), hypersegmented neutrophils, and large bizarrely shaped platelets. The presence of even a single neutrophil with more than 6 lobes should raise the suspicion of megaloblastic anemia.\n\nThe medications listed in the other answer choices are not used for the treatment of megaloblastic anemia.",
    "zh": "叶酸和维生素B12缺乏症是巨幼细胞性贫血最重要的原因。这两种维生素都是红细胞生成过程中DNA合成所必需的。当缺乏这两种维生素中的任何一种时，细胞分裂会延迟，但细胞质会正常发育。因此，细胞会增大（巨幼细胞），但不会分裂。巨幼细胞性贫血时骨髓高度增生，但巨幼红细胞前体细胞在骨髓中迅速被破坏，很少有分化的大红细胞释放到循环中。在严重的巨幼细胞性贫血中，90%的红细胞前体在进入循环之前就被破坏。\n\n维生素B12和叶酸缺乏症会导致相似的血液学表现。然而，神经功能障碍仅见于维生素B12缺乏症患者。这是因为B12缺乏症也会导致轴突脱髓鞘和变性。在疾病晚期，神经功能障碍可能是不可逆转的。神经系统受累的主要部位包括周围神经、脊髓（后柱和侧柱）和大脑。振动觉和位置觉减退是维生素B12缺乏症的早期征兆。患者会因本体感觉受损而出现共济失调和反复跌倒。重要的是，神经系统异常可在无明显贫血的情况下发生在维生素B12缺乏症中。单独用叶酸治疗因维生素B12缺乏症引起的巨幼细胞性贫血可能会加重神经功能障碍。\n\nRBC平均红细胞体积（MCV）大于100 fL提示巨幼细胞性贫血。然而，肝病、甲状腺功能减退症和酒精引起的肝病也可能发生红细胞大细胞增多。MCV大于110 fL通常仅见于维生素B12和叶酸性贫血。在外周血涂片上，可见大细胞增多（大红细胞）、核过度分叶的中性粒细胞和形状奇异的大血小板。即使只有一个中性粒细胞有超过6个叶，也应怀疑巨幼细胞性贫血。\n\n其他选项中列出的药物不用于治疗巨幼细胞性贫血。"
