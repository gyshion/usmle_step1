    "en": "Researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a new drug to reduce severe cutaneous reactions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are treated with adalimumab. Of 150 adults with rheumatoid arthritis who are treated with adalimumab, 75 received the new drug in addition to adalimumab, and 75 received a placebo in addition to adalimumab. Results show that 6 patients in the new drug group developed severe cutaneous reactions, compared to 9 in the placebo group. Which of the following represents the relative risk reduction for severe cutaneous reactions among patients in the new drug group?",

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of relative risk reduction (RRR) and its calculation in a clinical trial setting. It requires the ability to differentiate RRR from other measures like absolute risk reduction and relative risk.\n\nTo solve this question, first calculate the risk in the treatment and control groups.
