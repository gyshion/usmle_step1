    "en": "A 9-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician due to poor school performance and difficulty making friends. His parents say he always had \"very high energy,\" but they noticed that this got worse after they moved 8 months ago, which they attributed to a normal adjustment period. Over the past several months, however, the parents have received repeated phone calls from his teachers, reporting that he does not listen in class, has difficulty staying in his seat, turns in assignments late without his name, and frequently disrupts the class by talking out of turn. At home the boy forgets to do his daily chores, regularly loses his books and homework, and delays the family by taking too long getting ready for school in the morning. When his older brother teases him about this, the patient becomes irritable, and on a few occasions has shouted profanities and tried to hit his brother.",

    "en": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common behavioral disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity that interferes with functioning in ≥2 settings (eg, school, home). Diagnosis requires the presence of symptoms before age 12 with ≥6 inattentive and/or hyperactive/impulsive symptoms for ≥6 months. This patient's combination of inattentive symptoms (ie, forgetful, disorganized, loses things) and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms (ie, difficulty staying seated, interrupts others) is characteristic of the combined subtype. ADHD is more common in boys; girls are more likely to have the inattentive subtype.\n\n(Choice A) Adjustment disorders are diagnosed when symptoms develop within 3 months of an identifiable stressor. This child's symptoms predated the family move.\n\n(Choice C) Although this child occasionally tries to hit his sibling when frustrated, he does not exhibit behavior that consistently violates major societal norms or the basic rights of others (eg, repeated aggression, property destruction, theft, deceitfulness, rule violations), which would characterize conduct disorder.\n\n(Choice D) Children with ADHD often experience difficulty with peer relationships due to their impulsive and disruptive behaviors. However, this child does not exhibit the excessive social anxiety and fear of negative peer evaluation that is characteristic of social anxiety disorder.\n\n(Choice E) Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) involves a pattern of angry/irritable mood and argumentative/defiant behavior toward authority figures or vindictiveness. Although ODD may occur as a comorbid diagnosis with ADHD, this child's difficulty completing tasks, inability to sit still, and interrupting others at school are more likely related to his ADHD symptoms than to willfully defiant behavior.",
    "zh": "注意力缺陷多动障碍 (ADHD) 是一种常见的行为障碍，其特征是持续存在注意力不集中和/或多动/冲动，干扰≥2个环境（例如，学校、家庭）中的功能。诊断要求在12岁之前出现症状，并且存在≥6个月的≥6个注意力不集中和/或多动/冲动症状。该患者的注意力不集中症状（即健忘、杂乱、丢东西）和多动/冲动症状（即难以坐着，打断他人）的组合是混合亚型的特征。ADHD在男孩中更常见；女孩更容易出现注意力不集中亚型。\n\n(选项A) 适应障碍的诊断标准为症状在可识别的应激源的3个月内出现。这个孩子的症状早于家庭搬家。\n\n(选项C) 尽管这个孩子偶尔会试图在沮丧时殴打他的兄弟姐妹，但他没有表现出持续违反主要社会规范或他人基本权利的行为（例如，反复攻击、财产破坏、盗窃、欺骗、违反规则），这些是行为障碍的特征。\n\n(选项D) 患有ADHD的儿童通常由于他们的冲动和破坏性行为而难以与同伴建立关系。然而，这个孩子并没有表现出社交焦虑症的特征——过度的社交焦虑和对负面同伴评价的恐惧。\n\n(选项E) 对立违抗障碍 (ODD) 涉及对权威人物的愤怒/易怒情绪和争辩/对抗行为或报复心。尽管ODD可能作为与ADHD共病诊断出现，但该儿童难以完成任务、无法静坐以及在学校打断他人的行为更可能与他的ADHD症状有关，而不是故意反抗行为。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), its diagnostic criteria, and its differentiation from other behavioral disorders in children. It requires the clinician to identify the constellation of inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms that persist across multiple settings and interfere with functioning.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully reviewing the patient's presentation, noting the specific symptoms described in relation to school and home environments. The key is to match these symptoms against the diagnostic criteria for ADHD and then to systematically rule out other potential diagnoses based on the presence or absence of their defining characteristics.",
