    "en": "A 74-year-old man with end-stage renal disease who is receiving hemodialysis is found to have elevated liver transaminase levels. He has had no fever or jaundice. The patient does not drink alcohol and has received a complete vaccine series for hepatitis B. Vital signs are normal. BMI is 24 kg/m². Physical examination shows anicteric sclerae and no hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory results are positive for hepatitis C virus RNA. Six months previously, he tested negative for hepatitis C. Without treatment, which of the following is the most likely outcome in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient has a new infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), presenting with elevated hepatic aminotransferases and confirmed on HCV RNA assay. The risk of HCV infection is elevated in patients on hemodialysis due to their frequent exposure to blood products, and these individuals are regularly screened for HCV.\n\nImmediately after exposure to HCV, some patients develop jaundice, abdominal pain, and elevated aminotransferases (ie, acute hepatitis C), whereas others remain asymptomatic. Although some patients clear the virus spontaneously within 6 months of initial infection, the majority (50%-80%) remain persistently viremic and develop chronic HCV unless they receive treatment with antiviral medication (Choice E). Viral persistence is even more likely in elderly or immunosuppressed individuals (eg, end-stage renal disease, HIV infection).\n\nMost patients with chronic HCV exhibit nonspecific disease manifestations, including fatigue, abdominal pain, and elevations in aminotransferases. Approximately 20% of chronic HCV infections lead to cirrhosis, which takes decades (25-30 years) to develop. Of those with HCV-related cirrhosis, a small minority develop life-threatening hepatic decompensation (eg, esophageal variceal bleeding, ascites) or hepatocellular carcinoma (Choices B and C). Given this patient's age and comorbidities, he is unlikely to survive long enough to develop cirrhosis or carcinoma.\n\n(Choice A) Acute HCV can cause acute (eg, fulminant) liver failure, a life-threatening condition characterized by encephalopathy and impaired hepatic synthetic function (eg, prolonged prothrombin time). However, this is a rare manifestation and is much less common than chronic HCV.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe most common outcome of hepatitis C infection without antiviral treatment is lifelong persistent infection (ie, chronic hepatitis C). Of those with chronic hepatitis C, approximately 20% develop cirrhosis, and only a minority experiences complications (eg, ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatocellular carcinoma).",
    "zh": "该患者新感染了丙型肝炎病毒（HCV），表现为肝转氨酶升高，并经HCV RNA检测证实。由于频繁接触血液制品，血液透析患者感染HCV的风险增加，因此这些人会定期筛查HCV。\n\n在接触HCV后，一些患者会出现黄疸、腹痛和转氨酶升高（即，急性丙型肝炎），而另一些患者则保持无症状。尽管一些患者在初次感染后6个月内自发清除病毒，但大多数（50%-80%）患者持续病毒血症并发展为慢性丙型肝炎，除非他们接受抗病毒药物治疗（选项E）。病毒持续存在在老年人或免疫抑制个体（例如，终末期肾病、HIV感染）中更为常见。\n\n大多数慢性丙型肝炎患者表现出非特异性疾病表现，包括疲劳、腹痛和转氨酶升高。大约20%的慢性丙型肝炎感染会导致肝硬化，这需要数十年（25-30年）才能发展。在那些与HCV相关的肝硬化患者中，只有少数人会发展为危及生命的肝脏失代偿（例如，食管静脉曲张出血、腹水）或肝细胞癌（选项B和C）。考虑到该患者的年龄和合并症，他不太可能活到足以发展为肝硬化或癌。\n\n（选项A）急性HCV可引起急性（例如，暴发性）肝衰竭，这是一种危及生命的疾病，其特征是脑病和肝脏合成功能受损（例如，凝血酶原时间延长）。然而，这是一种罕见的表现，远不如慢性HCV常见。\n\n教育目标：\n未经抗病毒治疗的丙型肝炎感染最常见的结局是终生持续感染（即，慢性丙型肝炎）。在那些患有慢性丙型肝炎的患者中，大约20%会发展为肝硬化，只有少数人会经历并发症（例如，腹水、静脉曲张出血、肝细胞癌）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the natural history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and the likelihood of progression to chronic infection, cirrhosis, or spontaneous clearance. It also assesses understanding of risk factors for HCV infection in hemodialysis patients.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the patient is newly infected with HCV and is undergoing hemodialysis, which increases the risk of chronic infection. Understanding the natural history of HCV and the factors that influence its progression helps determine the most likely outcome without treatment.",
    "zh": "本题考察了丙型肝炎病毒（HCV）感染的自然病程以及进展为慢性感染、肝硬化或自发清除的可能性。它还评估了对血液透析患者HCV感染的风险因素的理解。\n\n解决这个问题的关键是认识到患者新近感染了HCV，并且正在接受血液透析，这增加了慢性感染的风险。了解HCV的自然病程和影响其进展的因素有助于确定未经治疗最有可能的结果。"
