  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient has a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer, suggesting hereditary breast cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes that are commonly mutated in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes. These genes are primarily involved in DNA repair, specifically the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 lead to impaired DNA repair, genomic instability, and an increased risk of developing cancer. Therefore, the patient most likely inherited a mutation in a gene responsible for DNA repair.\n\n(Choice A) Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels, which is essential for tumor growth and metastasis. While it is a critical process in cancer, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are not primarily associated with defects in angiogenesis.\n\n(Choice B) Apoptosis suppression refers to the evasion of programmed cell death. While cancer cells often exhibit suppressed apoptosis, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are not directly linked to this process as their primary function. The proto-oncogene BCL2 is involved in apoptosis suppression.\n\n(Choice D) Intercellular adhesion is important for maintaining tissue structure and preventing metastasis. Defects in adhesion molecules can contribute to cancer progression, but BRCA1 and BRCA2 are not primarily involved in intercellular adhesion.\n\n(Choice E) Signal transduction pathways are involved in cell communication and growth regulation. Aberrant signaling, such as HER2 overexpression, is associated with certain types of breast cancer. However, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are not directly related to signal transduction defects; their main role is in DNA repair.\n\nKey clinical pearls:\nHEREDITARY BREAST CANCER is strongly suggested by early onset of cancer, multiple affected relatives, and bilateral or multifocal disease. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are the most common cause of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. These genes are crucial for DOUBLE-STRANDED DNA BREAK REPAIR. Loss of function of these tumor suppressor genes follows a TWO-HIT hypothesis, where an inherited mutation (first hit) is followed by a somatic mutation (second hit) leading to cancer development. Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern is typical for BRCA mutations.",
    "zh": "该患者有强烈的乳腺癌和卵巢癌家族史，提示遗传性乳腺癌。BRCA1和BRCA2是抑癌基因，在遗传性乳腺癌和卵巢癌综合征中常发生突变。这些基因主要参与DNA修复，特别是双链DNA断裂的修复。BRCA1和BRCA2的突变导致DNA修复受损、基因组不稳定以及癌症发生的风险增加。因此，该患者最有可能遗传了负责DNA修复的基因的突变。\n\n(选项A) 血管生成是新血管的形成，这对肿瘤生长和转移至关重要。虽然这是癌症的一个关键过程，但BRCA1和BRCA2的突变主要与血管生成的缺陷无关。\n\n(选项B) 细胞凋亡抑制是指逃避程序性细胞死亡。虽然癌细胞通常表现出细胞凋亡受到抑制，但BRCA1和BRCA2突变与其主要功能没有直接关系。原癌基因BCL2参与细胞凋亡抑制。\n\n(选项D) 细胞间粘附对于维持组织结构和防止转移非常重要。粘附分子的缺陷可能导致癌症进展，但BRCA1和BRCA2主要不参与细胞间粘附。\n\n(选项E) 信号转导途径参与细胞通讯和生长调节。异常信号传导，如HER2过度表达，与某些类型的乳腺癌有关。然而，BRCA1和BRCA2突变与信号转导缺陷没有直接关系；它们的主要作用是DNA修复。\n\n临床要点：\n遗传性乳腺癌强烈提示以下情况：癌症发病年龄早，有多名受影响的亲属，以及双侧或多灶性疾病。BRCA1和BRCA2突变是遗传性乳腺癌和卵巢癌最常见的原因。这些基因对双链DNA断裂修复至关重要。这些抑癌基因的功能丧失遵循两击假说，即遗传突变（第一击）后是体细胞突变（第二击），从而导致癌症的发展。BRCA突变通常表现为常染色体显性遗传模式。"

It assesses the knowledge of the specific cellular processes these genes are involved in and how their mutations contribute to cancer development.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the clinical indicators of hereditary cancer, recall the genes commonly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (BRCA1/2), and understand the primary function of these genes, which is DNA repair. Evaluating the options based on the known functions of BRCA genes is crucial for selecting the correct answer.",
