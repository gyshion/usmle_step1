    "en": " A healthy 34-year-old coal mine worker is trapped underground following partial collapse of an access shaft. Rescue efforts are directed toward clearing the obstructed tunnel, but it takes 2 days to reach him. While being taken to the surface, the miner tells rescuers that he feels dizzy and weak. He had an emergency supply of water but has not eaten anything for over 30 hours. Fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 78 mg/dL. Which of the following biochemical reactions {{exhibit_1}} is most likely responsible for maintaining this patient's current blood glucose levels?",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "After 12-18 hours of fasting, gluconeogenesis becomes the principal source of blood glucose. Gluconeogenesis uses many glycolytic enzymes, but hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase need to be bypassed as they are unidirectional. The initial steps of gluconeogenesis involve the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate and oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate by pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, respectively.",
    "zh": "禁食12-18小时后，糖异生成为血糖的主要来源。糖异生使用许多糖酵解酶，但己糖激酶、磷酸果糖激酶和丙酮酸激酶需要被绕过，因为它们是单向的。糖异生的初始步骤包括通过丙酮酸羧化酶和磷酸烯醇式丙酮酸羧激酶将丙酮酸转化为草酰乙酸，并将草酰乙酸转化为磷酸烯醇式丙酮酸。"
