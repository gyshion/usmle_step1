  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's chest x-ray after lung biopsy shows a right pneumothorax, which is recognized by the continuous line in the right lung field with no visible lung markings peripheral to it. This line is the outer edge of the collapsed right lung; the dark space peripheral to the lung represents air in the chest cavity.\n\nThe following characteristic physical examination findings are expected with pneumothorax:\n\n- Tactile fremitus represents airway vibrations generated by vocalized sound (eg, saying \"ninety-nine\") and is measured by the examiner placing hands on the patient's back. Because air in the chest cavity insulates and dampens airway vibrations before they reach the patient's back, decreased tactile fremitus is expected (Choice C).\n\n- Breath sounds are caused by air movement within the airways, and the intensity varies by lung location. Vesicular breath sounds are normal over the periphery; bronchial breath sounds are higher-intensity sounds that are normal over the hilum but indicate pathology (eg, lobar consolidation) over the periphery. Because the lung is partially collapsed, leading to less air movement, and sounds from the airways are insulated by air in the chest cavity, decreased breath sound intensity is expected (Choices D and F).\n\n- Resonance refers to the frequency of sound generated by percussion, and it varies with density. Because air alone is less dense than a composite of lung parenchyma and air (ie, normal lung), higher-than-normal sound frequency to percussion (ie, hyperresonance) is expected. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) Like pneumothorax, fluid in the chest cavity (ie, pleural effusion) insulates airway vibrations and sounds, causing decreased tactile fremitus and breath sound intensity. However, because fluid is more dense than normal lung, dullness to percussion is expected. Atelectasis generates findings similar to those of pleural effusion; the collapsed lung reduces air movement and vibration within the airways, and the airless lung parenchyma is more dense than normal, air-filled lung.\n\n(Choice B) Consolidated, fluid-filled lung (eg, lobar pneumonia) is more dense than normal lung. This leads to increased transmission of vibration and sound (ie, increased tactile fremitus and breath sound intensity) and dullness to percussion.\n\n(Choice G) Normal lung demonstrates resonance to percussion, baseline tactile fremitus, and vesicular (normal-intensity) breath sounds.\n\nEducational objective:\nPneumothorax is recognized on chest x-ray by a continuous line without lung markings peripheral to it. Decreased tactile fremitus, decreased breath sound intensity, and hyperresonance to percussion are expected on physical examination.",
    "zh": "该患者的肺活检后胸片显示右侧气胸，其特征是在右肺野中有一条连续的线，其外围没有可见的肺纹理。这条线是塌陷的右肺的外缘；肺外围的暗区代表胸腔内的空气。\n\n气胸的以下特征性体格检查结果是预期的：\n\n- 触觉语颤代表由发声产生的气道振动（例如，说“九十九”），并通过检查者将手放在患者背部来测量。由于胸腔中的空气在到达患者背部之前就隔绝和减弱了气道振动，因此预计触觉语颤会减弱（选项C）。\n\n- 呼吸音是由气道内的空气运动引起的，其强度因肺部位置而异。肺泡呼吸音在周围正常；支气管呼吸音是强度较高的声音，在肺门处正常，但在周围表明有病理（例如，肺叶实变）。由于肺部分塌陷，导致空气运动减少，并且气道的声音被胸腔中的空气隔绝，因此预计呼吸音强度会减弱（选项D和F）。\n\n- 共鸣是指通过叩诊产生的声音的频率，它随密度而变化。由于单独的空气比肺实质和空气的组合（即，正常肺）密度低，因此预计叩诊的频率高于正常水平（即，过清音）。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n(选项A) 与气胸一样，胸腔内的液体（即，胸腔积液）会隔绝气道振动和声音，导致触觉语颤减弱和呼吸音强度减弱。但是，由于液体比正常肺密度更大，因此预计叩诊呈浊音。肺不张产生的结果与胸腔积液相似；塌陷的肺会减少气道内的空气运动和振动，并且无空气的肺实质比正常的充气肺密度更大。\n\n(选项B) 实变的、充满液体的肺（例如，大叶性肺炎）比正常肺密度更大。这会导致振动和声音的传递增加（即，触觉语颤增强和呼吸音强度增强），叩诊呈浊音。\n\n(选项G) 正常肺在叩诊时显示共鸣，基线触觉语颤和肺泡（正常强度）呼吸音。\n\n教育目标：\n气胸通过胸片识别，胸片上有一条连续的线，其外围没有肺纹理。在体格检查中，预计触觉语颤减弱、呼吸音强度减弱和叩诊呈过清音。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize the physical exam findings associated with a pneumothorax, including hyperresonance to percussion, decreased tactile fremitus, and decreased breath sounds. It requires knowledge of how air in the pleural space affects sound transmission and lung mechanics.\n\nTo solve this question, first identify the pneumothorax on the chest x-ray. Then, recall the expected physical exam findings: hyperresonance due to increased air, and decreased tactile fremitus and breath sounds due to air insulating the lung.",
