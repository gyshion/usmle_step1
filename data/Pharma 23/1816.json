    "en": "A 56-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to 3 days of frequent urination, suprapubic pain, dysuria, and progressive hematuria. She has had no fevers or chills. The patient has a history of lymph-node-positive breast cancer that was diagnosed following a routine mammogram. A month ago, she began treatment with systemic chemotherapy. Temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F). Suprapubic tenderness is present on abdominal examination. Hemoglobin is 9.8 g/dL. Urinalysis shows numerous red blood cells but no leukocyte esterase or bacteria.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient who recently received systemic chemotherapy for breast cancer and now has progressive hematuria and suprapubic tenderness most likely has HEMORRHAGIC CYSTITIS caused by a nitrogen mustard-based chemotherapeutic agent, such as CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE or one of its analogs (eg, ifosfamide). These agents are metabolized by the kidneys into ACROLEIN, which is then excreted in the urine. Acrolein is toxic to uroepithelial cells and can cause cell death and necrosis if allowed to be in contact with these cells for a prolonged period.\nHemorrhagic cystitis associated with nitrogen mustard-based chemotherapy can be PREVENTED by aggressive hydration and the coadministration of MESNA (2-mercaptoethanesulfonate), a sulfhydryl compound that binds and inactivates the toxic metabolites of the chemotherapeutic agents in the urine.\n(Choice A) Dexrazoxane is an iron-chelating agent that can help prevent anthracycline-induced (eg, doxorubicin) cardiotoxicity.\n(Choice B) Filgrastim is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) analog used to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of granulocytes in patients with neutropenia, as can occur after chemotherapy. This patient is afebrile, and her urinalysis is not suggestive of a urinary tract infection.\n(Choice C) Leucovorin, or folinic acid, is a drug used in the treatment of methotrexate overdose. It also enhances the cytotoxic action of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and is used in combination with 5-FU in some cases of colorectal cancer.\n(Choice E) Ondansetron inhibits serotonin 5-HT3 receptors and is used primarily to treat nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy.\nEducational objective:\nHemorrhagic cystitis during therapy with cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide is caused by the urinary excretion of the toxic metabolite acrolein. It can be prevented by aggressive hydration, bladder irrigation, and administration of mesna, a sulfhydryl compound that binds acrolein in the urine.",
    "zh": "该患者近期接受了乳腺癌全身化疗，目前出现进行性血尿和耻骨上压痛，很可能患有出血性膀胱炎，其病因是氮芥类化疗药物，如环磷酰胺或其类似物（如异环磷酰胺）。这些药物在肾脏中代谢成丙烯醛，然后经尿液排出。丙烯醛对尿路上皮细胞有毒性，如果长时间接触这些细胞，会导致细胞死亡和坏死。\n与氮芥类化疗相关的出血性膀胱炎可以通过积极补液和联合使用美司钠（2-巯基乙磺酸钠）来预防，美司钠是一种硫氢基化合物，可与尿液中化疗药物的毒性代谢物结合并使其失活。\n（选项A）地拉罗沙星是一种铁螯合剂，有助于预防蒽环类药物（如多柔比星）引起的心脏毒性。\n（选项B）非格司亭是一种粒细胞集落刺激因子（G-CSF）类似物，用于刺激中性粒细胞增殖和分化，这种反应可见于化疗后出现的中性粒细胞减少症。该患者没有发烧，并且她的尿液分析结果不支持尿路感染。\n（选项C）亚叶酸用于治疗甲氨蝶呤过量。它还可以增强5-氟尿嘧啶（5-FU）的细胞毒作用，并在某些结直肠癌病例中与5-FU联合使用。\n（选项E）昂丹司琼抑制5-HT3受体，主要用于治疗化疗后的恶心和呕吐。\n教学目标：\n在环磷酰胺或异环磷酰胺治疗期间发生的出血性膀胱炎是由有毒代谢物丙烯醛的尿排泄引起的。可以通过积极补液、膀胱冲洗和给予美司钠来预防，美司钠是一种硫氢基化合物，可与尿液中的丙烯醛结合。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of chemotherapy-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, its pathophysiology, and its prevention. It requires knowledge of specific chemotherapeutic agents that cause this toxicity and the role of uroprotective agents.\nTo solve this question, identify the likely cause of the patient's symptoms based on her history of chemotherapy. Recognize that hemorrhagic cystitis is a known side effect of certain chemotherapy agents and recall the mechanism of acrolein toxicity. Then, identify the agent used to prevent this specific complication.",
