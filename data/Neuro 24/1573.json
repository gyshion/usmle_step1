He has no history of seizures but has had headaches for the past several weeks. The patient works in construction. He lives in the United States and has not traveled recently. The patient has never had pets. He smokes a pack of cigarettes daily and drinks 3 or 4 cans of beer every evening. Physical examination is notable for a postictal state, oral thrush, and several enlarged cervical and inguinal lymph nodes. MRI of the brain with contrast is shown in the image below. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "The patient presents with a new-onset seizure, headaches, and physical examination findings suggestive of immunosuppression (oral thrush, lymphadenopathy). The MRI of the brain shows multiple ring-enhancing lesions, which are a common finding in opportunistic CNS infections in patients with HIV/AIDS. Given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, TOXOPLASMIC ENCEPHALITIS is the most likely diagnosis. Toxoplasmosis is the most common CNS infection in patients with AIDS. Although exposure often occurs due to accidental ingestion of oocytes following handling of feline feces (eg, litter box cleaning, cat handling), many cases arise following ingestion of undercooked meat from an intermediate host (eg, pig, sheep). Therefore, pet exposure is not a prerequisite. Toxoplasmic encephalitis usually presents with slowly progressive headaches, seizures, focal neurologic findings, and/or personality changes. Brain imaging with contrast frequently reveals MULTIPLE RING-ENHANCING LESIONS with surrounding edema. Diagnosis is supported by the presence of positive toxoplasma serology.\n\n(Choice A) Aspergillus fumigatus is not a common opportunistic pathogen in patients with AIDS, possibly because phagocytic function is relatively preserved despite T-cell dysfunction. A. fumigatus typically affects the lungs; however, it can cause brain abscesses in patients who are immunocompromised due to neutropenia or transplant.\n\n(Choice B) Although CNS glioblastomas are ring-enhancing, they are typically solitary and often have a characteristic butterfly appearance.\n\n(Choice C) Neurocysticercosis (due to Taenia solium [pork tapeworm] ingestion) can cause multiple brain lesions, but neuroimaging typically shows lesions at variable stages of degeneration, including cysts, calcifications, and enhancement.\n\n(Choice D) Nocardiosis is more common in patients with defects in cell-mediated immunity (eg, AIDS). Although it can cause headache and seizure, brain imaging would show evidence of abscess (eg, loculation, fluid-filled cavities).\n\nEducational objective: Patients with HIV are often unaware of infection and come to clinical attention due to an AIDS-defining illness. The presence of multiple ring-enhancing lesions in a patient with AIDS most likely indicates toxoplasmosis.",
    "zh": "患者表现为新发癫痫、头痛和体格检查结果提示免疫抑制（口腔念珠菌病、淋巴结病）。脑部MRI显示多个环形增强病灶，这在HIV/AIDS患者的机会性中枢神经系统感染中很常见。考虑到患者的症状和影像学表现，弓形虫脑炎是最可能的诊断。弓形虫病是艾滋病患者中最常见的中枢神经系统感染。虽然暴露通常是由于意外摄入猫粪便（例如，清理猫砂盆、处理猫）后卵母细胞而发生，但许多病例是由于摄入来自中间宿主（例如，猪、羊）的未煮熟的肉而引起的。因此，接触宠物并非先决条件。弓形虫脑炎通常表现为缓慢进展的头痛、癫痫、局灶性神经系统发现和/或人格改变。对比增强的脑部影像学检查经常显示多个环形增强病灶，伴有周围水肿。诊断得到弓形虫血清学阳性的支持。\n\n（选项A）烟曲霉不是艾滋病患者中常见的机会性病原体，这可能是因为尽管T细胞功能障碍，吞噬功能相对保留。烟曲霉通常影响肺部；然而，它可能在因中性粒细胞减少或移植而免疫功能低下的患者中引起脑脓肿。\n\n（选项B）尽管中枢神经系统胶质母细胞瘤呈环形增强，但它们通常是孤立的，并且通常具有特征性的蝴蝶外观。\n\n（选项C）神经囊尾蚴病（由于摄入猪肉绦虫）可引起多个脑部病灶，但神经影像学通常显示不同退变阶段的病灶，包括囊肿、钙化和增强。\n\n（选项D）诺卡菌病在细胞介导免疫缺陷（例如，艾滋病）的患者中更为常见。虽然它可以引起头痛和癫痫发作，但脑部影像学检查会显示脓肿的证据（例如，分隔、充满液体的空腔）。\n\n教育目标：HIV患者通常不知道感染，并且由于艾滋病相关疾病而引起临床关注。艾滋病患者出现多个环形增强病灶最有可能表明弓形虫病。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to diagnose opportunistic central nervous system infections in an immunocompromised patient, specifically focusing on the interpretation of brain MRI findings in the context of clinical presentation. It assesses knowledge of the differential diagnosis of ring-enhancing brain lesions in the setting of potential HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves correlating the patient's symptoms (seizure, headache), physical exam findings (oral thrush, lymphadenopathy suggesting immunosuppression), and imaging findings (multiple ring-enhancing lesions on MRI) with the most likely opportunistic infection. Consideration of the patient's risk factors and the typical presentations of the differential diagnoses is crucial.",
