    "en": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of nasal congestion. He has used a topical decongestant every few hours since his symptoms began. He experienced relief for almost 1 week, but then his nasal congestion returned. The patient has a history of allergic rhinitis and has had episodes of rhinorrhea in the past, but none of them lasted longer than a few days. He denies fever, throat pain, headaches, cough, and lymph node enlargement. Aside from his allergic rhinitis, the patient has no other medical problems. Physical examination shows nasal mucosa that appears edematous and red with a few areas of punctate bleeding. The remainder of the examination reveals no abnormalities.",

    "en": "Vasoconstriction by α-adrenergic agonists is prominent in the vessels of the nasal mucosa, making these medications effective decongestants. Phenylephrine, xylometazoline, and oxymetazoline are used as topical preparations for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and common cold associated congestion and rhinitis.\n\nThese medications, however, are characterized by rapidly declining effect after a few days of use. This phenomenon is called tachyphylaxis. It occurs because of decreased production of endogenous norepinephrine from the nerve terminals due to a negative feedback mechanism, resulting in relative vasodilation (ie, removal of normal vasoconstrictive tone) and subsequent edema and congestion. This leads to exacerbation of the nasal congestion symptoms. Rebound rhinorrhea (ie, rhinitis medicamentosa) is described as nasal congestion without cough, sneezing, or postnasal drip. Rhinorrhea may or may not be present (note the paradox in naming).\n\nRebound rhinorrhea is associated with the use of topical decongestants for ≥ 3 days. The use of adrenergic agonists should be stopped to allow the restoration of normal norepinephrine feedback pathways.\n\nAnother medication associated with the phenomenon of tachyphylaxis is nitroglycerine. The decrease in its effect is explained by the diminished release of NO from the target cells. Drug-free intervals of 8–10 hours should be maintained during the use of nitroglycerine to prevent tachyphylaxis.\n\n(Choice B) Ephedrine is an indirect-acting adrenergic agonist used as a decongestant. Like the other adrenergic medications, it causes tachyphylaxis after a few days of treatment. A switch to ephedrine would not improve this patient's rebound rhinorrhea.\n\n(Choice C) This patient has been excessively using a decongestant; if he discontinues it and experiences excessive withdrawal symptoms, a short-term course of topical corticosteroids can be considered for symptom control. However, oral corticosteroids would not be indicated.\n\n(Choice D) Antihistamines are used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, but they are not effective in treating rebound rhinorrhea.\n\n(Choice E) Antibiotics are effective in the treatment of certain bacterial infections. They are not used in the treatment of rebound rhinorrhea.\n\nEducational objective:\nTopical preparations of α-adrenergic agonists cause vasoconstriction of nasal mucosa vessels and are used as decongestants. Overuse of these drugs causes negative feedback, resulting in decreased norepinephrine synthesis and release from nerve endings, which diminish their effect (ie, tachyphylaxis).",
    "zh": "α-肾上腺素能受体激动剂通过收缩血管在鼻粘膜血管中起主要作用，使这些药物成为有效的减充血剂。苯肾上腺素、赛洛唑啉和羟甲唑啉被用作局部制剂，用于治疗与变应性鼻炎和普通感冒相关的充血和鼻炎。\n\n然而，这些药物的特点是使用几天后效果迅速下降。这种现象被称为快速耐受。其发生的原因是由于负反馈机制导致神经末梢内源性去甲肾上腺素的产生减少，导致相对血管舒张（即，消除正常的血管收缩张力）和随后的水肿和充血。这会导致鼻塞症状加重。反弹性鼻溢（即，药物性鼻炎）被描述为没有咳嗽、打喷嚏或鼻后滴漏的鼻塞。可能存在或不存在鼻溢（注意命名的悖论）。\n\n反弹性鼻溢与使用局部减充血剂≥3天有关。应停止使用肾上腺素能受体激动剂，以恢复正常的去甲肾上腺素反馈通路。\n\n另一种与快速耐受现象相关的药物是硝酸甘油。其作用的降低可以通过靶细胞中NO的释放减少来解释。在使用硝酸甘油期间，应保持8-10小时的无药间隔，以防止快速耐受。\n\n(选项B) 麻黄碱是一种间接作用的肾上腺素能受体激动剂，用作减充血剂。与其他肾上腺素能药物一样，它在治疗几天后会导致快速耐受。改用麻黄碱无法改善患者的反弹性鼻溢。\n\n(选项C) 该患者过度使用减充血剂；如果他停用减充血剂并出现过度的戒断症状，可以考虑短期使用局部皮质类固醇控制症状。然而，口服皮质类固醇不适用。\n\n(选项D) 抗组胺药用于治疗变应性鼻炎，但对治疗反弹性鼻溢无效。\n\n(选项E) 抗生素可有效治疗某些细菌感染。它们不用于治疗反弹性鼻溢。\n\n教学目标：\nα-肾上腺素能受体激动剂的局部制剂可引起鼻粘膜血管收缩，并被用作减充血剂。过度使用这些药物会导致负反馈，导致神经末梢去甲肾上腺素的合成和释放减少，从而降低其作用（即，快速耐受）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound rhinorrhea) caused by overuse of topical decongestants and the appropriate management. The key is to recognize the history of prolonged decongestant use leading to worsening congestion. \n\nThe best approach is to identify the most likely cause of the patient's current symptoms based on the history of present illness. Then, select the management option that addresses the underlying pathophysiology of rebound rhinorrhea, which is stopping the decongestant.",
