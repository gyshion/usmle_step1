    "en": "A 65-year-old man is evaluated for right lower extremity weakness and difficulty walking. The patient has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. During physical examination, the lateral border of his right sole is stroked using the blunt tip of a reflex hammer. The maneuver, starting near the heel and proceeding to the base of the fifth toe, elicits extension of the great toe and fanning out of the other toes. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be observed in this patient's right lower extremity? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "The plantar reflex (Babinski sign) is assessed by firmly stroking the plantar surface of the lateral foot from the heel to the ball. Plantar flexion of the toes is normal; dorsiflexion with or without fanning of the toes is considered abnormal and indicates an UPPER MOTOR NEURON LESION. Children age <12 months also exhibit a positive response, which is considered normal and reflects incomplete myelination of the corticospinal tract. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nUpper motor neurons (UMNs) originate in the cerebral cortex and are responsible for the initiation of voluntary movement. UMN fibers travel through the brainstem and spinal cord to reach lower motor neurons (eg, cranial nerves, spinal nerves), which then innervate muscle fibers. UMN injury can occur anywhere proximal to the anterior horn; common etiologies include stroke (which likely occurred in this patient with multiple risk factors), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord transection.\n\nOther signs of UMN injury include HYPERREFLEXIA, spastic paralysis, increased muscle tone, clasp-knife rigidity (increased muscle tension with sudden release on passive flexion), and PYRAMIDAL WEAKNESS (weakness is more pronounced in lower extremity flexors and upper extremity extensors). Upper extremity supination is also typically weaker than pronation, resulting in pronator drift.\n\n(Choices A and E) Lower motor nerve lesions are most commonly due to trauma involving the peripheral nerves. Manifestations include muscle weakness/paralysis with hypotonia, suppressed or absent deep tendon reflexes, and muscle atrophy. Fasciculations (brief, spontaneous contractions of small groups of muscle fibers) also occur due to denervation of the affected muscles. However, the plantar reflex in lower motor lesions will be downgoing or indifferent (ie. no response).\n\n(Choice C) Cogwheel rigidity (increased muscle rigidity with rhythmic interruptions noted on passive limb movement) is seen with lesions in the extrapyramidal tracts, which modulate motor neuron activity. This sign is classically seen in Parkinson disease.\n\n(Choice D) In upper motor neuron lesions, lower extremity weakness is typically more pronounced in the flexors than the extensors.\n\nEducational objective:\nUpper motor neuron signs include abnormal plantar flexion (Babinski sign), spastic paralysis, increased muscle tone, clasp-knife rigidity, hyperreflexia, pronator drift, and pyramidal weakness (weakness more pronounced in lower extremity flexors and upper extremity extensors). Lower motor neuron signs include flaccid paralysis, weakness with hypotonia and muscle atrophy, fasciculations, and suppressed or absent reflexes.",
    "zh": "足底反射（Babinski 征）是通过从足跟到足底外侧缘划过足底表面来评估的。脚趾跖屈是正常的；伴或不伴有脚趾扇形展开的背屈被认为是不正常的，表明存在上运动神经元损伤。年龄小于12个月的儿童也会表现出阳性反应，这被认为是正常的，反映了皮质脊髓束髓鞘形成不完全。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n上运动神经元（UMN）起源于大脑皮层，负责启动随意运动。 UMN 纤维穿过脑干和脊髓到达下运动神经元（例如，脑神经，脊神经），然后支配肌纤维。 UMN 损伤可发生在脊髓前角近端的任何位置；常见病因包括卒中（该患者可能因多种危险因素而发生）、多发性硬化症或脊髓横断。\n\nUMN 损伤的其他体征包括反射亢进、痉挛性瘫痪、肌张力增高、折刀样强直（被动屈曲时肌张力增加伴突然释放）和锥体束无力（下肢屈肌和上肢伸肌无力更明显）。 上肢旋后也通常弱于旋前，导致旋前漂移。\n\n（选项 A 和 E）下运动神经损伤最常见的原因是累及周围神经的创伤。表现包括肌力下降/瘫痪伴肌张力减退、深腱反射抑制或缺失以及肌肉萎缩。肌束颤动（小群肌纤维的短暂、自发收缩）也发生于受累肌肉的去神经支配。然而，下运动神经损伤中的足底反射将向下或无反应（即无反应）。\n\n（选项 C）齿轮样强直（被动肢体运动时出现的肌肉僵硬度增加伴节律性中断）见于锥体外束病变，锥体外束调节运动神经元活动。 这种体征在帕金森病中很常见。\n\n（选项 D）在上运动神经元损伤中，下肢屈肌的无力通常比伸肌更明显。\n\n教育目标：\n上运动神经元体征包括异常的跖屈（Babinski 征）、痉挛性瘫痪、肌张力增高、折刀样强直、反射亢进、旋前漂移和锥体束无力（下肢屈肌和上肢伸肌无力更明显）。 下运动神经元体征包括弛缓性麻痹、肌张力减退和肌肉萎缩引起的无力、肌束颤动以及反射抑制或缺失。"

It requires understanding the pathophysiology of upper motor neuron damage and its impact on muscle tone, reflexes, and strength.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the Babinski sign indicates an upper motor neuron lesion. Recall the other common findings associated with such lesions, including hyperreflexia, spasticity, and weakness.
