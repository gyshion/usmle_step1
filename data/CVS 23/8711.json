    "en": "Evolution of a myocardial infarct occurs in several stages. The final stage of the healing process begins approximately 2 weeks after infarction and involves increased deposition of TYPE I COLLAGEN. Fibrosis continues until about 2 months after infarction, resulting in a dense collagenous scar composed primarily of type I collagen. The scar can be identified grossly as a firm, gray-white lesion or microscopically as collagenous tissue replacing myocardium (as in this patient). {{exhibit_3}}\n\nIn addition to its role in wound healing, type I collagen (the most abundant type) provides STRENGTH and support for a variety of cellular tissues and organs (eg, tendons, ligaments, skin). It is also the major organic component in BONES and significantly contributes to overall bone strength. Defects in type I collagen can occur in osteogenesis imperfecta, an autosomal dominant disorder that may present with fragile bones and ligament laxity.\n\n(Choices A, C, and D) Basement membrane contains type IV collagen; hyaline cartilage (eg, articular surfaces) and nucleus pulposus contain type II collagen.\n\n(Choice B) Granulation tissue is a capillary-rich fibroblastic proliferation composed primarily of type III collagen. Although granulation tissue is seen approximately 7 days after an acute myocardial infarction, it is eventually replaced by type I collagen as the infarct heals. Type III collagen is involved in the structural maintenance of extensible connective tissues and is often found alongside type I collagen.\n\nEducational objective:\nType I collagen is the primary collagen in mature scars (eg, remote myocardial infarction). It is the most prevalent type of collagen and provides strength and support throughout the human body, particularly in bones, tendons, ligaments, and skin.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of collagen types and their distribution in various tissues, specifically focusing on the type of collagen found in scar tissue after a myocardial infarction.
