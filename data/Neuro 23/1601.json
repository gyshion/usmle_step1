    "en": "This patient with progressive lower extremity weakness, depressed deep tendon reflexes, and paresthesias has Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS represents a group of immune-mediated demyelinating polyneuropathies that are thought to be caused by molecular mimicry. An antecedent event (typically an infection) provokes an immune response that cross-reacts with the Schwann cells and myelin sheath of the peripheral nerves. The myelin sheath is stripped from the axon, leading to loss of neuronal conductivity and axonal degeneration. Up to one-third of GBS cases are preceded by Campylobacter jejuni infection, a common cause of acute (sometimes bloody) diarrhea. Less common antecedent infections include upper respiratory viral illnesses, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, Zika virus, and HIV.\n\nPatients with GBS experience SYMMETRIC, ASCENDING WEAKNESS that typically begins in the legs and progresses to flaccid paralysis and respiratory failure. Decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, paresthesias, pain (often of the back), and dysautonomia are common.\n\n(Choices B, C, D, and E) Rotavirus, Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, and Shigella are all important causes of diarrhea but are not associated with GBS. Both Shiga toxin-producing E coli and Shigella can cause bloody diarrhea and are associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome. Salmonella typically causes nonbloody diarrhea and may lead to bacteremia, particularly in an asplenic patient. Rotavirus, most commonly seen in children, causes nonbloody diarrhea and can lead to gastrointestinal obstruction due to small bowel intussusception.\n\n(Choice F) Zika virus is associated with GBS; however, patients with Zika virus typically present with a pruritic maculopapular rash, low-grade fever, arthralgias, and conjunctivitis rather than diarrhea.\n\nEducational objective:\nGuillain-Barré syndrome represents a group of immune-mediated polyneuropathies that are thought to be caused by molecular mimicry, leading to demyelination of the peripheral nerves. Up to one-third of GBS cases are preceded by Campylobacter jejuni infection, which is a common cause of acute diarrheal illness.",
    "zh": "这位出现进行性下肢无力、深腱反射减弱和感觉异常的患者患有格林-巴利综合征 (GBS)。GBS 代表一组免疫介导的脱髓鞘性多发性神经病，被认为是由分子模拟引起的。先前的事件（通常是感染）引发免疫反应，该免疫反应与周围神经的许旺细胞和髓鞘发生交叉反应。髓鞘从轴突中剥离，导致神经元传导丧失和轴突变性。高达三分之一的 GBS 病例之前有空肠弯曲菌感染，这是急性（有时是血性）腹泻的常见原因。不太常见的先行感染包括上呼吸道病毒性疾病、EB 病毒、巨细胞病毒、寨卡病毒和 HIV。\n\nGBS 患者会经历对称性、上升性无力，通常从腿部开始，进展为弛缓性麻痹和呼吸衰竭。深腱反射减弱或消失、感觉异常、疼痛（通常是背部疼痛）和自主神经功能障碍很常见。\n\n（选项 B、C、D 和 E）轮状病毒、沙门氏菌、产志贺毒素大肠杆菌和志贺氏菌都是腹泻的重要原因，但与 GBS 无关。产志贺毒素大肠杆菌和志贺氏菌均可引起血性腹泻，并与溶血性尿毒症综合征相关。沙门氏菌通常引起非血性腹泻，并可能导致菌血症，尤其是在无脾患者中。轮状病毒最常见于儿童，可引起非血性腹泻，并可能因小肠内套叠导致胃肠道梗阻。\n\n（选项 F）寨卡病毒与 GBS 相关；然而，寨卡病毒患者通常表现为瘙痒性斑丘疹、低烧、关节痛和结膜炎，而不是腹泻。\n\n教育目标：\n格林-巴利综合征代表一组免疫介导的多发性神经病，被认为是由分子模拟引起的，导致周围神经脱髓鞘。高达三分之一的 GBS 病例之前有空肠弯曲菌感染，这是急性腹泻的常见原因。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), its common preceding infections, and typical clinical presentation. GBS is an immune-mediated polyneuropathy often triggered by infections like Campylobacter jejuni, leading to ascending weakness and sensory disturbances.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical features of GBS (ascending weakness, areflexia, paresthesias) and associate it with the most common preceding infection, Campylobacter jejuni. Rule out other causes of diarrhea that are not typically linked to GBS.",
