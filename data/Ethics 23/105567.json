  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's weight for her height (ie, body mass index [BMI]) has increased and is now ≥95th percentile, which is consistent with pediatric obesity. This increasingly common condition is associated with serious, long-term comorbidities (eg, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) but must be approached with sensitivity and support, particularly in children.\n\nRather than focusing on an \"ideal weight\"—which may be unrealistic and, in children, often changing due to continued growth—counseling should focus on sustainable behavioral modifications with an approach that is nonjudgmental and collaborative (Choice E).\n\n•\tNonjudgmental: Because patients (particularly adolescents) may be self-conscious of their weight, it is best to avoid potentially offensive terms such as \"obesity\" and instead focus on achieving a healthy weight through a well-balanced lifestyle (Choices B and C). In addition, it is important to avoid placing blame on the child or family and to instead acknowledge that some people gain weight more easily than others.\n\n•\tCollaborative: Open-ended language should be used to understand the areas that are challenging and unique to the patient, such as consumption of sugary beverages in this case. Efforts should be made to set specific and realistic goals to improve health (eg, limiting sweetened beverages). In addition, the child should be involved in decision-making when possible; in this case, the patient's apprehension about competitive sports can be a motivating factor to make effective change and improve her functional abilities (ie, strength, speed).\n\nThis approach allows for discussion about long-term healthy habits instead of short-term weight loss. Regular follow-up is necessary to ensure accountability and reevaluate the patient's goals, achievements, and weight.\n\n(Choice A) Discussion of potential long-term comorbidities associated with obesity is reasonable, but emphasizing diabetes prevention as a primary goal in children is often perceived as a scare tactic and is unlikely to generate sustainable behavioral change.\n\nEducational objective:\nCounseling on pediatric obesity (body mass index ≥95th percentile) should focus on achieving a healthy weight and improving functional status (eg, stronger, faster) without placing blame or using offensive terms (eg, obesity). In addition, making specific and realistic goals is more likely to result in behavior change than trying to attain an \"ideal weight.\"",
    "zh": "该患者的身高体重比（即，身体质量指数 [BMI]）有所增加，现在 ≥95 百分位，这与儿童肥胖症一致。 这种日益常见的疾病与严重的、长期的合并症（例如，糖尿病、心血管疾病）有关，但必须以敏感和支持的方式处理，尤其是在儿童中。\n\n与其关注“理想体重”——这可能是不现实的，而且在儿童中，由于持续生长，体重经常变化——咨询应侧重于可持续的行为改变，并采用不带评判性和合作的方式（选项 E）。\n\n•\t不带评判性：由于患者（尤其是青少年）可能对自己的体重感到害羞，最好避免使用“肥胖”等潜在的冒犯性术语，而是侧重于通过均衡的生活方式实现健康的体重（选项 B 和 C）。此外，避免将责任归咎于孩子或家庭也很重要，而是承认有些人比其他人更容易发胖。\n\n•\t合作性：应使用开放式语言来了解对患者具有挑战性和独特性的领域，例如在本例中饮用含糖饮料。应努力设定具体而现实的目标以改善健康（例如，限制含糖饮料）。此外，应尽可能让孩子参与决策；在这种情况下，患者对竞技运动的担忧可以成为进行有效改变并改善其功能能力（即力量、速度）的驱动因素。\n\n这种方法允许讨论长期的健康习惯，而不是短期的减肥。 定期随访对于确保问责制和重新评估患者的目标、成就和体重是必要的。\n\n（选项 A）讨论与肥胖相关的潜在长期合并症是合理的，但强调预防糖尿病作为儿童的主要目标通常被视为恐吓手段，不太可能产生可持续的行为改变。\n\n教育目标：\n关于儿童肥胖症（身体质量指数 ≥95 百分位）的咨询应侧重于实现健康的体重和改善功能状态（例如，更强壮、更快），而不要责备或使用冒犯性术语（例如，肥胖）。此外，制定具体和现实的目标比试图达到“理想体重”更有可能导致行为改变。"
