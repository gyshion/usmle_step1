    "en": "A newborn is transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit 4 hours after delivery due to cyanosis. The infant was born via a spontaneous vaginal delivery at 41 weeks gestation to a 22-year-old gravida 2 para 2 woman. The pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. Three hours after delivery, circumoral cyanosis was noted after the infant was breastfed. Pulse oximetry readings were 98% in the right hand and 83% in the left foot. On physical examination, the patient has subcostal retractions and grunting. Cardiac examination reveals a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Femoral pulses are strong bilaterally. {{exhibit_1}} Which of the following is the most likely cause of this infant's cyanosis?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This infant has central cyanosis, a condition characterized by blue discoloration of the mucous membranes and/or skin (not confined to the distal extremities). Central cyanosis is caused by circulation of deoxygenated hemoglobin because of a pulmonary, cardiac, or hematologic condition.\n\nIn this case, the neonate also has a postductal (left foot) oxygen saturation level that is significantly lower than the preductal saturation (right hand) measurement. This differential cyanosis (or differential hypoxemia) suggests that some deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary artery is flowing to the aorta and mixing with oxygenated blood from the left ventricle. In other words, this patient has an extracardiac right-to-left shunt across a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), a condition typically associated with PERSISTENT PULMONARY HYPERTENSION of the newborn (PPHN) or congenital heart diseases with left-sided outflow tract obstruction (eg, severe aortic coarctation).\n\nPPHN results from failure of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) to decline following birth, and is more likely given this patient's strong femoral pulses (as opposed to the diminished pulses seen in left-sided outflow tract obstruction). In PPHN, suprasystemic pulmonary arterial pressure drives deoxygenated blood through the PDA to the aorta. Tricuspid regurgitation, which can occur in PPHN due to elevated PVR leading to tricuspid valve insufficiency, is the likely cause of this neonate's murmur. Patients also typically have respiratory distress (eg, grunting, retractions) within hours of birth due to an underlying pulmonary pathology (eg, pulmonary hypoplasia, meconium aspiration). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}\n\n(Choices A, B, and C) Left-to-right shunts through septal defects and PDAs are characterized by oxygenated blood crossing back into the right-sided circulation. Therefore, cyanosis does not occur.\n\n(Choices D and F) Examples of intracardiac right-to-left shunts include a patent foramen ovale in PPHN and a ventricular septal defect in tetralogy of Fallot. Because the mixing of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood occurs within the heart in these cases, preductal and postductal saturations would be equally low.\n\nEducational objective:\nDifferential cyanosis (ie, postductal < preductal oxygen saturation) in a neonate suggests right-to-left shunting across a patent ductus arteriosus, such as in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Patients with PPHN typically have an underlying pulmonary disorder with respiratory distress and strong femoral pulses.",
    "zh": "该婴儿患有中心性发绀，其特征是黏膜和/或皮肤呈蓝色变色（不局限于肢端）。中心性发绀是由于肺部、心脏或血液系统疾病导致脱氧血红蛋白循环所致。\n\n在这种情况下，新生儿的导管后（左脚）血氧饱和度明显低于导管前（右手）血氧饱和度。这种差异性发绀（或差异性低氧血症）提示来自肺动脉的一些脱氧血流流向主动脉，并与来自左心室的含氧血混合。换句话说，该患者患有通过动脉导管未闭（PDA）的体外右向左分流，这种情况通常与新生儿持续性肺动脉高压 (PPHN) 或伴有左侧流出道梗阻的先天性心脏病（如重度主动脉缩窄）相关。\n\nPPHN 是由于出生后肺血管阻力 (PVR) 未能下降所致，考虑到该患者股动脉搏动强（与左侧流出道梗阻所见的脉搏减弱相反），更有可能发生 PPHN。在 PPHN 中，超体循环肺动脉压迫使脱氧血流通过 PDA 流向主动脉。三尖瓣反流，可在 PPHN 中发生，由于 PVR 升高导致三尖瓣功能不全，这可能是该新生儿杂音的可能原因。由于潜在的肺部病理（如肺发育不全、胎粪吸入），患者通常也会在出生后数小时内出现呼吸窘迫（如呻吟、凹陷）。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}\n\n（选项 A、B 和 C）通过间隔缺损和 PDA 的左向右分流的特征是含氧血流回流到右侧循环。因此，不会发生发绀。\n\n（选项 D 和 F）心内右向左分流的例子包括 PPHN 中的卵圆孔未闭和法洛四联症中的室间隔缺损。由于在这些情况下，脱氧血和含氧血的混合发生在心脏内，导管前和导管后饱和度将同样低。\n\n教育目标：\n新生儿的差异性发绀（即，导管后 < 导管前血氧饱和度）提示通过动脉导管未闭的右向左分流，例如新生儿持续性肺动脉高压 (PPHN)。患有 PPHN 的患者通常有潜在的肺部疾病，伴有呼吸窘迫和强劲的股动脉搏动。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of differential cyanosis in newborns, specifically the presentation and underlying pathophysiology of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). It also assesses the ability to differentiate between preductal and postductal oxygen saturation and their implications for diagnosing right-to-left shunts. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the differential cyanosis (lower postductal saturation) and the presence of strong femoral pulses, which points towards an extracardiac right-to-left shunt, most commonly due to PPHN with shunting across a patent ductus arteriosus. Understanding the pathophysiology of PPHN and its effect on pulmonary vascular resistance is crucial.",
