Ultrasound shows a complex cystic lesion overlying the lumbosacral spine, ventriculomegaly, and hindbrain herniation.

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has an elevated alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level and ultrasound findings consistent with an OPEN NEURAL TUBE DEFECT (NTD), a condition caused by FAILURE OF PRIMARY NEURULATION. Primary neurulation begins with formation of the neural plate. During the third week of fetal development, the lateral ends of the neural plate elevate to become neural folds that fuse in the midline to form the neural tube. Fusion starts in the cervical region and extends rostrally and caudally to the anterior and posterior neuropores, respectively.\n\nFailure of either neuropore to close leads to open NTDs, in which a portion of the developing CNS remains connected to the amniotic cavity. Maternal serum AFP is ELEVATED due to direct leakage from the open neural tube into the amniotic fluid.\n\nFailure of POSTERIOR (caudal) NEUROPORE closure specifically results in a NTD referred to as an open spinal dysraphism, and most commonly causes a MYELOMENINGOCELE in which portions of the spinal cord within the meningeal sac protrude through a vertebral arch defect. Prenatal ultrasound may show a COMPLEX CYSTIC MASS along the lower spine, as in this case. Myelomeningoceles are also commonly associated with downward displacement of the hindbrain (CHIARI II MALFORMATION) that can obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (causing VENTRICULOMEGALY).\n\n(Choice A) The primitive streak establishes the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo; it normally completely disappears by the end of the 4th week of gestation. Rarely, remnants can persist in the sacrococcygeal region and give rise to a sacral teratoma. The brain would not be affected.\n\n(Choice B) Dandy-Walker syndrome results from underdevelopment of the cerebellar vermis. Ultrasound would demonstrate cystic enlargement of the posterior fossa and hypoplasia of the vermis, and elevated AFP would not be expected.\n\n(Choice C) Neural crest cells are the progenitors for the peripheral (not central) nervous system; Hirschsprung disease (congenital aganglionic megacolon) is a disorder of neural crest cell migration. NTDs are not related to neural crest cell abnormalities.\n\n(Choice D) Neuronal migration disorders (eg, lissencephaly, or loss of sulci) are caused by the abnormal migration of nascent neurons within the brain. A spinal mass would not be seen.\n\nEducational objective:\nDefects in primary neurulation result in open neural tube defects, such as a myelomeningocele, in which the spinal cord and meninges protrude through a vertebral arch defect. Findings typically include an elevated maternal alpha fetoprotein and a complex cystic mass overlying the lower spine.",
    "zh": "该患者的甲胎蛋白 (AFP) 水平升高，超声检查结果与开放性神经管缺陷 (NTD) 相符，这是一种由原发性神经管形成失败引起的疾病。原发性神经管形成始于神经板的形成。在胎儿发育的第三周，神经板的侧端向上抬起成为神经褶，并在中线融合形成神经管。融合始于颈部区域，并分别向颅端和尾端延伸至前、后神经孔。\n\n任一神经孔闭合失败都会导致开放性 NTD，其中一部分发育中的 CNS 与羊膜腔保持连接。母体血清 AFP 升高是由于开放性神经管直接渗漏到羊水中。\n\n后（尾部）神经孔闭合失败特别会导致一种 NTD，称为开放性脊柱裂，最常见的原因是脊髓脊膜膨出，其中硬脊膜囊内的部分脊髓通过椎弓缺陷突出。产前超声检查可能会显示腰椎下方有复杂囊性肿块，如本例所示。脊髓脊膜膨出也常伴有后脑下移 (Chiari II 畸形)，这会阻塞脑脊液的流动（导致脑室扩大）。\n\n(选项 A) 原条建立胚胎的前后轴；它通常在妊娠第 4 周结束时完全消失。很少情况下，残留物会持续存在于骶尾部区域并引起骶尾畸胎瘤。大脑不会受到影响。\n\n(选项 B) Dandy-Walker 综合征是由于小脑蚓部发育不全所致。超声检查会显示后窝囊性增大和小脑蚓部发育不全，并且不应预期 AFP 升高。\n\n(选项 C) 神经嵴细胞是周围（而非中枢）神经系统的祖细胞；Hirschsprung 病（先天性无神经节巨结肠）是一种神经嵴细胞迁移障碍。NTD 与神经嵴细胞异常无关。\n\n(选项 D) 神经元迁移障碍（例如，脑回缺失，或脑沟消失）是由新生神经元在大脑内异常迁移引起的。不会看到脊柱肿块。\n\n教育目标：\n原发性神经管缺陷会导致开放性神经管缺陷，例如脊髓脊膜膨出，其中脊髓和脑膜通过椎弓缺陷突出。典型发现包括母体甲胎蛋白升高和腰椎上方的复杂囊性肿块。"
