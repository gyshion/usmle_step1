    "en": "A 57-year-old man comes to the office accompanied by his wife for follow-up of Parkinson disease. The patient reports no change in motor symptoms, and the disease has been well controlled with anti-Parkinson medication. However, his wife is very concerned about a change in behavior, reporting that he recently started gambling and has lost a significant amount of their savings. The patient drives several hours multiple times a week to gamble at a casino in a neighboring state. His only other medical condition is major depressive disorder for which he takes sertraline. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a mild resting hand tremor and minimal rigidity.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Parkinson disease (PD) is caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia, resulting in symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity. Dopaminergic medications used to treat PD have been associated with the abrupt onset of impulse control disorders, including pathological gambling, compulsive buying, and compulsive sexual behavior. Dopamine agonists (eg, pramipexole) as a class are most frequently associated with this adverse effect. These drugs act by binding to central dopamine receptors and stimulating dopamine activity in the ventral striatum (includes the nucleus accumbens), which is involved in motivation and reward pathways) and substantia nigra.\n\nPatients on dopamine agonist therapy should be monitored for dysfunctional impulse control. Gradual taper of the offending agent results in improvement in most cases.\n\n(Choice A) Decreased peripheral conversion of levodopa is the mechanism of action of carbidopa, a drug used in combination with levodopa (a dopamine precursor) to increase the availability of levodopa in the central nervous system. Compared to dopamine agonists, carbidopa-levodopa is much less likely to precipitate impulse control disorders.\n\n(Choice B) Increasing norepinephrine levels in the synaptic cleft is the mechanism of action of atomoxetine, a nonstimulant medication used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\n(Choice C) Increasing serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft is the mechanism of action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, sertraline). These medications are not associated with the onset of impulse control disorders and have actually been shown to decrease impulsivity.\n\n(Choice E) Upregulation of brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is a neuroadaptive response to the receptor desensitization that occurs with chronic repeated exposure to high levels of nicotine.\n\nEducational objective: Dopamine agonist medications used to treat Parkinson disease have been associated with the abrupt onset of impulse control disorders, including pathological gambling, compulsive buying, and compulsive sexual behavior. The behavior is thought to be mediated by stimulation of central dopamine receptors.",
    "zh": "帕金森病（PD）是由基底神经节中多巴胺能神经元丧失引起的，导致运动迟缓、震颤和僵硬等症状。用于治疗 PD 的多巴胺能药物与冲动控制障碍的突然发作有关，包括病理性赌博、强迫性购物和强迫性性行为。多巴胺激动剂（例如，普拉克索）作为一类药物，与这种不良反应最为相关。这些药物通过与中枢多巴胺受体结合并在腹侧纹状体（包括伏隔核，涉及动机和奖励通路）和黑质中刺激多巴胺活性来发挥作用。\n\n接受多巴胺激动剂治疗的患者应监测是否存在功能失调的冲动控制。在大多数情况下，逐渐减少致病药物的剂量可改善病情。\n\n(选项A) 左旋多巴的周围转化减少是卡比多巴的作用机制，卡比多巴与左旋多巴（一种多巴胺前体）联合使用，以增加中枢神经系统中左旋多巴的利用率。与多巴胺激动剂相比，卡比多巴-左旋多巴不太可能诱发冲动控制障碍。\n\n(选项B) 突触间隙中去甲肾上腺素水平升高是托莫西汀的作用机制，托莫西汀是一种用于治疗注意力缺陷多动障碍的非兴奋剂药物。\n\n(选项C) 突触间隙中血清素水平升高是选择性血清素再摄取抑制剂（例如，舍曲林）的作用机制。这些药物与冲动控制障碍的发生无关，实际上已被证明可以降低冲动性。\n\n(选项E) 脑内烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体上调是对长期反复暴露于高水平尼古丁所发生的受体脱敏的神经适应性反应。\n\n教育目标：用于治疗帕金森病的多巴胺激动剂药物与冲动控制障碍的突然发作有关，包括病理性赌博、强迫性购物和强迫性性行为。这种行为被认为是由中枢多巴胺受体的刺激介导的。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the adverse effects of dopaminergic medications used in Parkinson disease, specifically the association between dopamine agonists and impulse control disorders like pathological gambling.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing that the patient's new gambling behavior is a potential side effect of his Parkinson disease treatment. Linking this behavior to the known side effects of dopamine agonists and their mechanism of action on central dopamine receptors is key to identifying the correct answer.",
    "zh": "本题考察对用于治疗帕金森病的多巴胺能药物不良反应的理解，特别是多巴胺激动剂与冲动控制障碍（如病理性赌博）之间的关联。\n\n解决此问题的关键在于认识到患者新的赌博行为是其帕金森病治疗的潜在副作用。将这种行为与多巴胺激动剂的已知副作用及其在中枢多巴胺受体上的作用机制联系起来，是确定正确答案的关键。"
