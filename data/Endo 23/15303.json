    "en": "A 29-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the office due to a 2-month history of worsening bilateral nipple discharge that stains her bra. The patient has felt no breast mass and has had no breast pain, headaches, or vision changes. Her last menstrual period was 3 months ago, and home pregnancy tests have been negative. Previously, she had regular menstrual cycles at 28-day intervals. The patient has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, visual fields are intact by confrontation. A whitish fluid can be expressed bilaterally on nipple compression. There are no breast masses or lymphadenopathy. Pelvic examination reveals no abnormalities. Serum beta-hCG testing is negative. Brain imaging shows a 0.6-cm pituitary mass. Pharmacotherapeutic treatment is begun, and on a follow-up visit the patient reports that her symptoms are improving. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of action of this medication? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Galactorrhea is abnormal secretion of breast milk not associated with pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is most commonly due to excess prolactin, which directly stimulates milk secretion in the breasts. Pituitary lactotroph adenomas (prolactinomas) can cause very high prolactin levels and are a common cause of galactorrhea.\n\nUnlike most pituitary hormones, which are under positive regulation by releasing hormones from the hypothalamus, prolactin is primarily under negative regulation by hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons via the pituitary stalk. Because of the tonic inhibitory effect of dopamine on prolactin secretion, dopamine agonists (eg, cabergoline, bromocriptine) can be used to treat hyperprolactinemia. Dopamine agonist therapy reduces adenoma size, suppresses prolactin production, and, in patients with small (<1 cm, as in this patient) prolactinomas and no mass-effect symptoms (eg, headache, visual field defects), can often induce a prolonged clinical response.\n\n(Choices A and C) Estrogen stimulates prolactin gene transcription and secretion. Strongly estrogenic medications (eg, birth control pills) can potentially worsen rather than alleviate galactorrhea. Dopamine antagonists (eg, antipsychotics) directly increase prolactin secretion and also can worsen galactorrhea.\n\n(Choice B) Hyperprolactinemia causes amenorrhea in women due to the inhibitory effect of prolactin on hypothalamic GnRH release. Dopaminergic medications suppress prolactin secretion and can restore normal GnRH secretion.\n\n(Choice E) Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulates secretion of prolactin by lactotrophs, although its role in regulating prolactin release is secondary to the inhibition of prolactin secretion by dopamine. Factors that increase TRH release would worsen hyperprolactinemia.\n\nEducational objective:\nGalactorrhea is abnormal secretion of breast milk not associated with pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is most commonly due to excess prolactin, as seen in prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas. Prolactin is under negative regulation by hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons, and dopamine agonists can be used to treat hyperprolactinemia.",
    "zh": "溢乳症是指与妊娠或母乳喂养无关的乳汁异常分泌。它最常见的原因是泌乳素过多，泌乳素直接刺激乳房中的乳汁分泌。垂体催乳素腺瘤（催乳素瘤）可引起非常高的泌乳素水平，是溢乳症的常见原因。\n\n与大多数受下丘脑释放激素正向调节的垂体激素不同，泌乳素主要受下丘脑多巴胺能神经元通过垂体柄的负向调节。由于多巴胺对泌乳素分泌具有持续的抑制作用，多巴胺激动剂（如卡麦角林、溴隐亭）可用于治疗高泌乳素血症。多巴胺激动剂治疗可缩小腺瘤大小，抑制泌乳素的产生，并且在患有小型（<1 cm，如本例患者）催乳素瘤且无占位效应症状（如头痛、视野缺损）的患者中，通常可以诱导长期的临床反应。\n\n（选项 A 和 C）雌激素刺激泌乳素基因转录和分泌。具有强烈雌激素作用的药物（如避孕药）可能会使溢乳症恶化，而不是缓解。多巴胺拮抗剂（如抗精神病药）会直接增加泌乳素分泌，也可能使溢乳症恶化。\n\n（选项 B）高泌乳素血症导致女性闭经，这是由于泌乳素对下丘脑 GnRH 释放的抑制作用。多巴胺能药物抑制泌乳素分泌，并可以恢复正常的 GnRH 分泌。\n\n（选项 E）促甲状腺激素释放激素 (TRH) 刺激催乳素细胞分泌泌乳素，尽管其在调节泌乳素释放中的作用是次要的，因为多巴胺抑制泌乳素的分泌。增加 TRH 释放的因素会使高泌乳素血症恶化。\n\n教育目标：\n溢乳症是指与妊娠或母乳喂养无关的乳汁异常分泌。它最常见的原因是泌乳素过多，如在分泌催乳素的垂体腺瘤中所见。泌乳素受下丘脑多巴胺能神经元的负向调节，多巴胺激动剂可用于治疗高泌乳素血症。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hyperprolactinemia, its causes (specifically prolactinomas), and the mechanism of action of dopamine agonists in treating this condition. It requires understanding the negative regulation of prolactin secretion by dopamine. \n\nThe best approach is to recognize the clinical presentation of galactorrhea and the finding of a pituitary mass, leading to the diagnosis of a prolactinoma. Then, recall that dopamine agonists are the first-line treatment and that they work by stimulating dopamine receptors, thereby inhibiting prolactin secretion.",
