The patient has brushed her teeth twice a day for as long as she can remember and has not experienced these symptoms before. Physical examination shows swollen gingiva that bleed on probing. Her skin findings are shown in the image below. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nFurther questioning reveals that the patient lives alone and that her diet consists primarily of tea and toast.",

    "en": "{{exhibit_2}}\nThis patient likely has VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY (scurvy). In the United States, vitamin C deficiency is seen primarily among malnourished populations, including patients with alcohol use disorder and the elderly. The symptoms of scurvy reflect impaired formation of collagen and include gingival swelling/bleeding, petechiae, ecchymoses, and poor wound healing. Perifollicular hemorrhages and coiled (corkscrew) hairs are also commonly seen.\n\nCollagen synthesis is a complex process that begins with the transcription of collagen genes in the nucleus (Choice E). Collagen α-chains are then synthesized by rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)-bound ribosomes and directed into the cisternae of the RER. Within the RER, specific proline and lysine residues are post-translationally hydroxylated to hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine by prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase, respectively. VITAMIN C IS A REQUIRED COFACTOR for this post-translational modification. Defective hydroxylation of these residues severely diminishes the amount of collagen secreted by fibroblasts and impairs triple helix stability and covalent crosslink formation.\n\n(Choices A and B) After formation of the triple helix, procollagen molecules are secreted from the cell via the Golgi apparatus. Propeptides at the N- and C-terminals are cleaved by extracellular procollagen peptidase to form insoluble tropocollagen molecules. These monomers then self-assemble into collagen fibrils that are subsequently crosslinked via lysyl oxidase.\n\n(Choices C and D) Lysosomes and mitochondria are not directly involved in the synthesis of collagen.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen helps it attain its maximum tensile strength. This process occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and requires vitamin C as a cofactor. Impaired collagen synthesis resulting from vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) can lead to fragile vessels, predisposing to gingival bleeding, ecchymosis, and petechiae.",
    "zh": "{{exhibit_2}}\n该患者可能患有维生素C缺乏症（坏血病）。在美国，维生素C缺乏症主要见于营养不良的人群，包括患有酒精使用障碍的患者和老年人。坏血病的症状反映了胶原蛋白形成的受损，包括牙龈肿胀/出血、瘀点、瘀斑和伤口愈合不良。毛囊周围出血和卷曲（螺旋状）的毛发也很常见。\n\n胶原蛋白合成是一个复杂的过程，从细胞核中胶原蛋白基因的转录开始（选项E）。然后，胶原蛋白α链由结合在粗面内质网（RER）上的核糖体合成，并被引导进入RER的池内。在RER内，特定的脯氨酸和赖氨酸残基通过脯氨酸羟化酶和赖氨酸羟化酶分别进行翻译后羟化为羟脯氨酸和羟赖氨酸。维生素C是这种翻译后修饰所需的辅助因子。这些残基的羟化缺陷会严重减少成纤维细胞分泌的胶原蛋白量，并损害三螺旋稳定性以及共价交联的形成。\n\n（选项A和B）三螺旋形成后，前胶原分子通过高尔基体从细胞中分泌出来。N端和C端的肽段被细胞外前胶原蛋白酶裂解，形成不溶性的原胶原蛋白分子。然后，这些单体自组装成胶原纤维，随后通过赖氨酰氧化酶交联。\n\n（选项C和D）溶酶体和线粒体不直接参与胶原蛋白的合成。\n\n教育目标：\n胶原蛋白中脯氨酸和赖氨酸残基的羟化有助于其获得最大的抗张强度。此过程发生在粗面内质网中，并需要维生素C作为辅助因子。维生素C缺乏症（坏血病）导致的胶原蛋白合成受损可导致血管脆弱，易发生牙龈出血、瘀斑和瘀点。"
