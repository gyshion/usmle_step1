  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's 2-week history of hearing voices and paranoid delusions is consistent with BRIEF PSYCHOTIC DISORDER. Onset is typically sudden in response to an overwhelming stressor. Diagnosis requires ≥1 PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS (ie, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior) lasting >1 DAY and <1 MONTH with eventual return to premorbid functioning. The diagnosis requires ruling out psychosis secondary to a mood disorder and psychosis due to substances or a medical condition.\n\nSymptom duration is a key feature in differentiating brief psychotic disorder from other psychotic disorders. If this patient's symptoms were to continue for >1 month but <6 months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder would be indicated (Choice G). If the symptoms were to continue for ≥6 months, the accurate diagnosis would be schizophrenia (Choice F).\n\n(Choice A) Acute stress disorder is characterized by symptoms of intrusion (eg, flashbacks), negative mood, dissociation, avoidance, and arousal that occur in the initial month after exposure to a life-threatening traumatic event.\n\n(Choice B) Bipolar disorder can present with psychotic features; however, this patient lacks other characteristic manic symptoms (eg, elated mood, increased energy, pressured speech, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity).\n\n(Choice D) Delusional disorder is characterized by ≥1 delusions lasting ≥1 months and would not explain this patient's prominent hallucinations.\n\n(Choices E and H) Personality disorders are characterized by enduring patterns of behavior. Patients with paranoid personality disorder are generally suspicious and distrustful. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by odd thinking and eccentric behavior, but not frank psychosis. Neither would explain this patient's acute onset of delusions and hallucinations.\n\nEducational objective:\nBrief psychotic disorder is characterized by ≥1 psychotic symptoms lasting >1 day and <1 month with full return to previous levels of functioning. Onset is typically sudden and associated with a stressor.",
    "zh": "该患者2周的听到幻听和偏执妄想病史与短暂精神病性障碍相符。起病通常是突然的，是对压倒性应激源的反应。诊断需要 ≥1 个精神病性症状（即，妄想、幻觉、思维紊乱、严重紊乱或紧张症行为）持续 >1 天且 <1 个月，最终恢复到病前功能。 诊断需要排除继发于心境障碍的精神病和由于物质或医学状况引起精神病。\n\n症状持续时间是区分短暂精神病性障碍与其他精神病性障碍的关键特征。如果该患者的症状持续 >1 个月但 <6 个月，则应诊断为分裂样精神病性障碍（选项 G）。如果症状持续 ≥6 个月，则准确的诊断将是精神分裂症（选项 F）。\n\n（选项 A） 急性应激障碍的特征是侵入性症状（例如，闪回）、负面情绪、解离、回避和唤醒，这些症状发生在暴露于危及生命的创伤事件后的第一个月。\n\n（选项 B）双相情感障碍可表现为精神病性症状；但是，该患者缺乏其他特征性的躁狂症状（例如，心境高涨、精力充沛、语速加快、睡眠需求减少、夸大）。\n\n（选项 D）妄想障碍的特征是 ≥1 个妄想持续 ≥1 个月，无法解释该患者突出的幻觉。\n\n（选项 E 和 H）人格障碍的特征是持久的行为模式。 偏执型人格障碍患者通常多疑和不信任。 分裂型人格障碍的特征是奇特的思维和古怪的行为，但不是明显的精神病。 这两种情况都无法解释该患者突然出现的妄想和幻觉。\n\n教育目标：\n短暂精神病性障碍的特征是 ≥1 个精神病性症状持续 >1 天且 <1 个月，完全恢复到以前的功能水平。起病通常是突然的，并与应激源相关。"
