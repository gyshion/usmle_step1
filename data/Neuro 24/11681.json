    "en": "A 25-year-old man comes to the office due to right arm weakness. The patient injured his right shoulder several months ago in a motor vehicle collision and has had difficulty raising his arm since. On examination, there is diminished pinprick and temperature sensation over a small area in the right upper lateral arm and prominent atrophy of the right deltoid with 3/5 strength on right shoulder abduction. Reflexes and handgrip strength are normal in the upper extremities bilaterally. This patient most likely injured which of the following nerves?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The axillary nerve originates from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus and carries fibers from C5 and C6. It courses deep in the axilla below the shoulder joint then runs through the quadrangular space (bounded superiorly by the teres minor, laterally by the humerus, medially by the long head of the triceps, and inferiorly by the teres major) and along the surgical neck of the posterior humerus. At this point, it gives rise to motor branches that supply the deltoid and teres minor muscles and a sensory branch that innervates the skin over the lateral shoulder.\n\nAxillary nerve injury most commonly occurs in the setting of shoulder trauma such as anterior shoulder dislocation or fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus. Patients often have sensory loss over the upper lateral arm and weakness on shoulder abduction due to denervation of the deltoid muscle.\n\n(Choice B) The dorsal scapular nerve provides motor innervation to the rhomboids (which retract the scapula) and levator scapulae muscles (which elevate the scapula).\n\n(Choices C and G) Injury to the long thoracic nerve or thoracodorsal nerve can occur during axillary lymph node dissection. Long thoracic nerve injury results in paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle, leading to winging of the scapula. Thoracodorsal nerve injury results in paralysis of the latissimus dorsi muscle, leading to weakness of arm adduction, extension, and internal rotation at the shoulder.\n\n(Choice D) Proximal injury to the median nerve (eg, due to supracondylar humerus fracture) may result in palmar sensory loss over the first 3 digits and impairment of thumb flexion/opposition/abduction, flexion of the second/third digits, and wrist flexion/abduction.\n\n(Choice E) Injury to the musculocutaneous nerve can cause sensory loss over the lateral forearm and weakened elbow flexion due to denervation of the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles.\n\n(Choice F) Injury to the radial nerve at the axilla (eg, crutch palsy) typically causes weakness of the forearm, hand, and finger extensor muscles (eg, wrist drop, absent triceps reflex) with sensory loss over the posterior arm and forearm and dorsolateral hand.\n\n(Choice H) Ulnar nerve injury most commonly occurs at the elbow, resulting in sensory loss over the medial 1½ digits of the hand and weakness on wrist flexion/adduction, finger abduction/adduction, and flexion of the fourth/fifth digits.\n\nEducational objective:\nInjury to the axillary nerve most commonly occurs in the setting of shoulder trauma (eg, anterior shoulder dislocation, surgical neck of the humerus fracture). It presents with sensory loss over the lateral shoulder and weakness on shoulder abduction (due to denervation of the deltoid muscle).",
    "zh": "腋神经起自臂丛神经的后束，携带来自C5和C6的纤维。它在肩关节下方的腋窝深处走行，然后穿过四边孔（上界为小圆肌，外侧为肱骨，内侧为肱三头肌长头，下界为大圆肌）并沿肱骨后方的外科颈走行。此时，它发出运动分支，支配三角肌和小圆肌，以及支配肩部外侧皮肤的感觉分支。\n\n腋神经损伤最常发生在肩部外伤的情况下，如肩关节前脱位或肱骨外科颈骨折。患者通常会出现上臂外侧感觉丧失，并因三角肌去神经支配而导致肩外展无力。\n\n(选项B) 肩胛背神经为菱形肌（使肩胛骨回缩）和提肩胛肌（使肩胛骨抬高）提供运动神经支配。\n\n(选项C和G) 胸长神经或胸背神经的损伤可能发生在腋窝淋巴结清扫术中。胸长神经损伤导致前锯肌麻痹，导致肩胛骨翼状改变。胸背神经损伤导致背阔肌麻痹，导致肩关节的内收、伸展和内旋无力。\n\n(选项D) 正中神经的近端损伤（例如，由于髁上肱骨骨折）可能导致前3个指头的掌侧感觉丧失，并损害拇指屈曲/对掌/外展、第二/第三指的屈曲以及腕部屈曲/外展。\n\n(选项E) 肌皮神经损伤可导致前臂外侧感觉丧失，以及因肱二头肌和肱肌去神经支配而导致的肘屈曲无力。\n\n(选项F) 腋窝处桡神经损伤（例如，拐杖麻痹）通常会导致前臂、手和手指伸肌无力（例如，腕下垂，肱三头肌反射消失），并伴有上臂后侧和前臂后侧以及手背外侧感觉丧失。\n\n(选项H) 尺神经损伤最常发生在肘部，导致手内侧1½个指头的感觉丧失，以及腕部屈曲/内收、手指外展/内收和第四/第五指屈曲无力。\n\n教育目标：\n腋神经损伤最常发生在肩部外伤的情况下（例如，肩关节前脱位、肱骨外科颈骨折）。表现为肩部外侧感觉丧失和肩外展无力（由于三角肌去神经支配）。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of peripheral nerve injuries in the upper extremity, specifically focusing on the clinical presentation of axillary nerve damage. It requires correlating physical examination findings such as muscle atrophy, weakness in specific movements, and sensory deficits with the anatomical distribution of nerve innervation.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the key clinical findings: weakness in shoulder abduction, atrophy of the deltoid muscle, and sensory loss over the lateral aspect of the arm. These findings are characteristic of axillary nerve injury. The other options represent injuries to different nerves with distinct clinical manifestations.",
