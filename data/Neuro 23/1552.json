  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a crusted vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution consistent with shingles (herpes zoster). Shingles is caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a double-stranded DNA virus of the herpesvirus family. Primary VZV infection occurs most commonly in childhood. Inoculation in the nasopharyngeal mucosa is followed by migration of the virus to the regional lymphatics. Subsequent dermatotropic migration produces a diffuse vesicular rash associated with fever, malaise, and pharyngitis (chickenpox). Then, the virus migrates via sensory nerves to cranial nerve and dorsal ganglia, where it lies dormant for decades.\nMost patients who have had primary chickenpox do not develop recurrent diffuse disease. Over time, however, waning cell-mediated immune function allows reactivation of the virus, which typically spreads down a single spinal nerve to cause a painful, erythematous, vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution. The primary risk factor for reactivation is increasing age; other factors can include malignancy, autoimmune disease, and immune-suppressing therapy.\nThe varicella vaccine is recommended for prevention of primary disease in children, women of childbearing age, adults with sustained risk of exposure, and household contacts of immunocompromised hosts. Zoster vaccine is recommended for adults age ≥50 and reduces the risk of reactivation.\n(Choice A) Colonization of the skin by transient flora (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida species, gram-negative bacilli) occasionally leads to clinical disease, especially following antibiotic exposure (eg, vaginal candidiasis). However, VZV does not remain on the surface of the skin for prolonged periods.\n(Choices B and C) Primary VZV infection (ie, chickenpox) can be acquired by direct contact or airborne aerosol from patients with active chickenpox or zoster lesions. However, primary VZV infection causes diffuse lesions; lesions in a dermatomal distribution are seen only with reactivation from sensory ganglia.\n(Choice E) Declining VZV-specific immunity increases the risk of reactivation. However, the immune response to VZV is primarily based on cell-mediated, rather than humoral (ie, antibodies), factors.",
    "zh": "该患者出现结痂性水疱性皮疹，呈皮节分布，与带状疱疹（herpes zoster）一致。带状疱疹由水痘-带状疱疹病毒（VZV）再激活引起，VZV是一种属于疱疹病毒科的双链DNA病毒。原发性VZV感染最常发生在儿童时期。接种于鼻咽黏膜后，病毒迁移至区域淋巴系统。随后，嗜皮肤性迁移产生弥漫性水疱性皮疹，伴有发热、不适和咽炎（水痘）。然后，病毒通过感觉神经迁移至颅神经和背根神经节，在那里潜伏数十年。\n大多数患有原发性水痘的患者不会发展为复发性弥漫性疾病。然而，随着时间的推移，细胞介导的免疫功能减弱，导致病毒再激活，病毒通常沿单一脊神经扩散，导致呈皮节分布的疼痛性红斑性水疱性皮疹。再激活的主要危险因素是年龄增长；其他因素可包括恶性肿瘤、自身免疫性疾病和免疫抑制治疗。\n建议为儿童、育龄妇女、持续暴露风险的成年人和免疫功能低下宿主的家庭接触者接种水痘疫苗，以预防原发性疾病。建议年龄≥50岁的成年人接种带状疱疹疫苗，以降低再激活的风险。\n（选项A）短暂菌群（例如，金黄色葡萄球菌、念珠菌属、革兰阴性杆菌）在皮肤上的定植偶尔会导致临床疾病，尤其是在暴露于抗生素之后（例如，阴道念珠菌病）。然而，VZV不会长时间停留在皮肤表面。\n（选项B和C）原发性VZV感染（即水痘）可通过直接接触或来自活动性水痘或带状疱疹病灶患者的空气传播气溶胶获得。然而，原发性VZV感染会导致弥漫性病变；仅当从感觉神经节再激活时，才会出现呈皮节分布的病变。\n（选项E）针对VZV的特异性免疫力下降会增加再激活的风险。然而，对VZV的免疫反应主要基于细胞介导因素，而不是体液（即抗体）因素。"
