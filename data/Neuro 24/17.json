    "en": "A 65-year-old woman is evaluated for worsening urinary urgency and incontinence. The patient has had no abdominal pain, dysuria, or changes in urinary frequency. On several occasions, she has urinated involuntarily, which she attributes to an inability to walk quickly to the bathroom. The patient feels unsteady while ambulating and walks slowly with small steps. Her family also reports that she has become forgetful and has difficulty planning and executing various activities that she used to perform regularly. Medical history is notable for hypertension. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary, abdominal, and genitourinary examinations show no abnormalities. Neurological examination shows impaired attention and short-term memory. MRI of the brain reveals chronic white matter changes with no infarction, hemorrhage, or mass lesions. There is diffuse ventriculomegaly with no sulcal enlargement. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's urinary incontinence?",
    "zh": "一位65岁女性因尿频和尿失禁加重而接受评估。患者无腹痛、排尿困难或尿频变化。她曾多次出现不由自主的排尿，她将其归因于无法快速走到卫生间。患者在行走时感到不稳，步履缓慢，步幅小。她的家人还报告说，她变得健忘，并且难以计划和执行她过去经常进行的各种活动。病史值得关注高血压。患者不吸烟、不饮酒或不使用违禁药物。生命体征在正常范围内。心肺、腹部和泌尿生殖系统检查未见异常。神经系统检查显示注意力不集中和短期记忆力减退。脑部 MRI 显示慢性白质改变，无梗死、出血或占位病变。存在弥漫性脑室扩大，无脑沟增宽。以下哪项最可能是该患者尿失禁的根本原因？"

    "en": "This patient presents with the classic triad of NORMAL PRESSURE HYDROCEPHALUS (NPH): dementia (impaired attention and short-term memory, difficulty planning), gait disturbance (unsteady while ambulating, walks slowly with small steps), and urinary incontinence (urinary urgency, involuntary urination). The MRI findings of diffuse ventriculomegaly with no sulcal enlargement are also characteristic of NPH. NPH occurs due to decreased absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by the arachnoid granulations (e.g., fibrosis from previous cerebral inflammation or bleeding) with gradual accumulation of CSF in the ventricular system. The lateral ventricles expand, resulting in normal intracranial pressure and STRETCHING OF DESCENDING CORTICAL FIBERS (corona radiata). Interruption of these pathways, along with impairment of cortical and subcortical function, leads to the classic triad of NPH symptoms (dementia, gait disturbance, urinary incontinence). The cerebral cortex (through the pontine micturition center) regulates the micturition reflex, which is an autonomic spinal reflex mediated by the neurons in the sacral spinal cord. In NPH, the LACK OF CORTICAL INHIBITION results in detrusor muscle hyperactivity. This leads to urinary urgency, which can be worsened by gait abnormalities that limit a patient's ability to quickly get to a bathroom (URGE INCONTINENCE). Progressive frontal lobe impairment leads to the inability to recognize urinary urge, uncontrolled urination, and a lack of concern as the disease progresses.\n(Choice A) Cerebellar dysfunction can cause an ataxic gait, dysarthria, and intention tremors. Memory dysfunction and urinary incontinence are more indicative of cerebral impairment. NPH typically spares cerebellar function.\n(Choice B) Compression of the reticular formation can occur with brainstem herniation, leading to loss of consciousness and coma.\n(Choice C) Impaired basal ganglia signaling is characteristic of Parkinson disease, which can result in ataxia with a slow gait. However, cogwheel rigidity and resting tremor would be prominent and dementia and urinary incontinence would not be expected until later in the disease course.\n(Choice D) Spinal cord damage is a common cause of incontinence with gait impairment. However, spinal cord injury also frequently causes lower extremity weakness and is not associated with cognitive impairment.\nEducational objective:\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus occurs due to decreased cerebrospinal fluid absorption, resulting in ventriculomegaly with normal intracranial pressure. This causes stretching of the descending cortical fibers (corona radiata) from the frontal lobe and contributes to the classic triad of symptoms (ie, dementia, gait abnormalities, urinary incontinence). Loss of cortical inhibition of the sacral micturition center leads to urge incontinence.",
    "zh": "该患者表现出正常压力脑积水 (NPH) 的典型三联征：痴呆（注意力不集中和短期记忆力减退，难以计划）、步态障碍（行走不稳，步幅小）和尿失禁（尿急，不由自主的排尿）。MRI 表现为弥漫性脑室扩大，无脑沟增宽，这也是 NPH 的特征。NPH 是由于脑脊液 (CSF) 通过蛛网膜颗粒吸收减少（例如，既往脑部炎症或出血引起的纤维化），导致脑脊液在脑室系统中逐渐积聚。侧脑室扩张，导致颅内压正常，并牵拉下行皮质纤维（辐射冠）。这些通路的阻断，以及皮质和皮质下功能的损害，导致了 NPH 的典型三联征症状（痴呆、步态障碍、尿失禁）。大脑皮质（通过脑桥排尿中枢）调节排尿反射，排尿反射是由骶髓神经元介导的自主脊髓反射。在 NPH 中，皮质抑制的缺失导致逼尿肌过度活动。这导致尿急，这种尿急可能会因步态异常而加重，从而限制患者快速到达卫生间的能力（急迫性尿失禁）。进行性额叶损伤导致无法识别尿意、尿失禁和对疾病进展缺乏关注。\n(选项 A) 小脑功能障碍可引起共济失调性步态、构音障碍和意向性震颤。记忆功能障碍和尿失禁更表明存在脑部损伤。NPH 通常保留小脑功能。\n(选项 B) 网状结构受压可发生在脑干疝形成时，导致意识丧失和昏迷。\n(选项 C) 基底节信号传导受损是帕金森病的特征，可导致步态缓慢的共济失调。然而，齿轮状强直和静止性震颤会很明显，并且在疾病进程后期才出现痴呆和尿失禁。\n(选项 D) 脊髓损伤是导致步态障碍性尿失禁的常见原因。然而，脊髓损伤也常引起下肢无力，并且与认知障碍无关。\n教育目标：\n正常压力脑积水是由于脑脊液吸收减少，导致脑室扩大，颅内压正常。这会导致从额叶伸出的下行皮质纤维（辐射冠）被牵拉，并导致典型的三联征症状（即，痴呆、步态异常、尿失禁）。骶排尿中枢的皮质抑制丧失导致急迫性尿失禁。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), its characteristic clinical triad (dementia, gait disturbance, urinary incontinence), and the underlying pathophysiology involving ventriculomegaly and stretching of descending cortical fibers leading to detrusor hyperactivity.\nTo solve this question, identify the classic triad of NPH symptoms in the clinical vignette. Correlate these symptoms with the provided MRI findings of ventriculomegaly without sulcal enlargement. Understand that the stretching of descending cortical fibers is the direct consequence of ventricular expansion that disrupts the inhibitory control over the micturition reflex, leading to urge incontinence.",
