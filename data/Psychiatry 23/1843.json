    "en": "A 21-year-old woman comes to the office due to constipation and vague abdominal pain. She says, \"For the last few months I have felt bloated and my stomach doesn't feel right.\" Review of systems is notable for irregular menses and occasional fatigue. Medical history is significant for a broken femur at age 6 but is otherwise noncontributory. Family history is significant for Graves disease in her father and primary myelofibrosis in her paternal grandmother. The patient smokes a pack of cigarettes daily and drinks wine when relaxing with friends. She does not use illicit drugs. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, pulse is 118/min, and respirations are 16/min. BMI is 25.6 kg/m^2. Physical examination shows eroded enamel of the teeth.\nLaboratory results are as follows:\n\nSerum chemistry\nSodium 134 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.2 mEq/L\nChloride 92 mEq/L\nBicarbonate 30 mEq/L\n\nLiver function studies\nAspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) 20 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (SGPT) 24 U/L\nAmylase 161 U/L\nLipase 32 U/L (normal: 12-61)",

    "en": "This patient's presentation of hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis (elevated bicarbonate), and hyperamylasemia, in conjunction with dental enamel erosion, strongly suggests self-induced vomiting, which is characteristic of BULIMIA NERVOSA (BN). The eroded enamel is a direct result of gastric acid exposure to the teeth. The hypokalemia is due to potassium loss in vomitus, and the metabolic alkalosis is due to loss of hydrochloric acid from the stomach. The elevated amylase is a common finding in BN, likely due to increased salivary amylase production in anticipation of vomiting, although pancreatic amylase can also be elevated. Chronic vomiting can also lead to parotid gland swelling and calluses on the dorsal hands (Russell sign) from self-induced vomiting.\n\n(Choice A) Acute pancreatitis typically presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. While amylase and lipase are elevated in pancreatitis, lipase is usually significantly elevated, and the clinical picture here is more consistent with BN. The patient's primary complaints are constipation and vague abdominal pain, not acute severe pain.\n\n(Choice B) Alcohol use disorder can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and electrolyte abnormalities, but the dental erosion and the specific pattern of electrolyte disturbance (hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis) are not typical. While the patient drinks wine, the amount is described as social, and there are no other signs of alcohol dependence.\n\n(Choice D) Hypothyroidism is characterized by symptoms such as fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, and weight gain. This patient's symptoms of bloating, abdominal pain, and irregular menses, along with tachycardia and low blood pressure, are not consistent with hypothyroidism. Furthermore, hypothyroidism does not explain the dental erosion or electrolyte abnormalities.\n\n(Choice E) Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits. While the patient has some of these symptoms, IBS does not explain the dental erosion, hypokalemia, or metabolic alkalosis. IBS is often a diagnosis of exclusion.\n\n(Choice F) Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects exocrine glands, leading to dry eyes and dry mouth. While it can cause dental issues due to reduced saliva, it does not typically cause hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis or the pattern of vomiting-related symptoms seen here. The patient's primary complaint is not dryness of the mouth or eyes.\n\nKey pearls: DENTAL EROSION + HYPOKALEMIA + METABOLIC ALKALOSIS = SELF-INDUCED VOMITING (BULIMIA NERVOSA). Elevated amylase can also be seen.",
    "zh": "该患者出现低钾血症、代谢性碱中毒（碳酸氢盐升高）和高淀粉酶血症，并伴有牙齿珐琅质侵蚀，强烈提示为自我诱导呕吐，这是神经性贪食症（BN）的特征。珐琅质侵蚀是胃酸暴露于牙齿的直接结果。低钾血症是由于呕吐物中钾的丢失，代谢性碱中毒是由于胃中盐酸的丢失。淀粉酶升高是BN的常见发现，这可能是由于在呕吐前唾液淀粉酶产量增加，尽管胰腺淀粉酶也可能升高。慢性呕吐也可能导致腮腺肿胀和手背出现老茧（罗素征），这是由于自我诱导呕吐所致。\n\n（选项 A）急性胰腺炎通常表现为剧烈腹痛、恶心和呕吐。虽然胰腺炎患者的淀粉酶和脂肪酶升高，但脂肪酶通常显著升高，并且这里的临床表现更符合BN。患者的主要主诉是便秘和模糊的腹痛，而不是急性剧烈疼痛。\n\n（选项 B）酒精使用障碍可导致胃肠道症状和电解质异常，但牙齿侵蚀和特定的电解质紊乱模式（低钾性代谢性碱中毒）不典型。虽然患者饮用葡萄酒，但描述的量是社交性的，并且没有其他酒精依赖的迹象。\n\n（选项 D）甲状腺功能减退症的特征是疲劳、畏寒、便秘和体重增加等症状。该患者的腹胀、腹痛、月经不规律以及心动过速和低血压等症状与甲状腺功能减退症不符。此外，甲状腺功能减退症无法解释牙齿侵蚀或电解质异常。\n\n（选项 E）肠易激综合征（IBS）是一种功能性胃肠道疾病，其特征是腹痛、腹胀和排便习惯改变。虽然患者有一些这些症状，但IBS无法解释牙齿侵蚀、低钾血症或代谢性碱中毒。IBS通常是一种排除性诊断。\n\n（选项 F）干燥综合征是一种主要影响外分泌腺的自身免疫性疾病，导致眼干和口干。虽然它会导致牙齿问题，因为唾液减少，但它通常不会导致低钾血症性代谢性碱中毒或这里所见的呕吐相关症状。患者的主要主诉不是口干或眼干。\n\n关键要点：牙齿侵蚀 + 低钾血症 + 代谢性碱中毒 = 自我诱导呕吐（神经性贪食症）。也可以看到淀粉酶升高。"

    "en": "This question tests the recognition of the clinical features and laboratory findings associated with bulimia nervosa, particularly the consequences of self-induced vomiting. It requires differentiating bulimia nervosa from other conditions that can cause gastrointestinal distress and electrolyte imbalances.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully evaluate the patient's chief complaint, review of systems, physical examination findings (especially dental erosion), and laboratory results (electrolytes, amylase). Correlate these findings with the typical presentations of the given differential diagnoses to identify the most fitting condition.",
