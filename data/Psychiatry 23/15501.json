    "en": "A 20-year-old college student comes to the office due to fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance. She says, \"I used to run 5 miles every day, but for the past month I get out of breath after running 3 miles. I need to keep running so I don't get any fatter than I already am.\" The patient also reports difficulty concentrating in class, depressed mood, constipation, and abdominal bloating. Her appetite is normal, but she admits to occasionally forcing herself to vomit to prevent weight gain. Physical examination is significant for dry skin, painless bilateral parotid swelling, pharyngeal erythema, and hypoactive bowel sounds. Temperature is 36.2 C (97.2 F), blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, pulse is 62/min, and respirations are 16/min. BMI is 17.5 kg/m^2. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "zh": "一名20岁的大学生因疲劳和运动耐受力下降前来就诊。她说：“我过去每天跑5英里，但过去一个月跑3英里就气喘吁吁。我需要继续跑步，这样我就不会比现在更胖了。”患者还报告在课堂上难以集中注意力、情绪低落、便秘和腹胀。她的食欲正常，但她承认偶尔强迫自己呕吐以防止体重增加。体格检查显示皮肤干燥、无痛性双侧腮腺肿胀、咽部红斑和肠蠕动音减弱。体温36.2摄氏度（97.2华氏度），血压100/60毫米汞柱，脉搏62次/分钟，呼吸16次/分钟。BMI为17.5 kg/m^2。以下哪项是最可能的诊断？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's low body weight, distorted body perception, and findings consistent with self-induced vomiting (pharyngeal erythema, parotid hypertrophy) are suggestive of ANOREXIA NERVOSA. SIGNIFICANTLY LOW BODY WEIGHT (BMI ≤ 18.5 kg/m^2 in adults) is a core feature of anorexia nervosa and is accompanied by a DISTORTED BODY IMAGE and FEAR OF WEIGHT GAIN. There are two subtypes of anorexia: In the restricting subtype, patients fast and exercise excessively but do not purge. In the binge eating/purging subtype, patients engage in vomiting and/or use substances (laxatives, enemas, or diuretics) to avoid weight gain.\n\nFindings on physical examination in AN include emaciation, bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, hair loss, dry skin, lanugo (fine, downy body hair), and abdominal distension. In the purging subtype, hypokalemia and alkalosis are often present due to repetitive vomiting.\n\n(Choice B) In body dysmorphic disorder, patients display a preoccupation with a perceived or slight bodily defect. Dysmorphic disorder is not diagnosed when body distortion is accompanied by symptoms of an eating disorder (eg, low body weight, fear of weight gain).\n\n(Choice C) Discrete periods of uncontrollable eating, with subsequent compensatory behavior (laxatives, diuretics, vomiting, excessive exercise), occur in bulimia nervosa. However, patients with this condition have a normal or increased body weight (in comparison with AN in which weight is significantly decreased).\n\n(Choice D) Although constipation (hypoactive bowel sounds) and fatigue can also be seen in hypothyroidism, this patient's low weight, fear of gaining weight, distorted body image, and purging make anorexia nervosa more likely.\n\n(Choice E) Irritable bowel syndrome presents with chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, or mixed-type). Patients often have abdominal bloating. This diagnosis would not explain signs of purging, distorted body image, and significantly low weight.\n\n(Choice F) This patient does not meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. Her depressed mood, fatigue, and poor concentration are consistent with the effects of malnutrition.\n\nEducational objective:\nAnorexia nervosa is characterized by a distorted body image and fear of weight gain despite significantly low body weight. Patients may restrict their food intake and/or binge and purge. The key in distinguishing anorexia from bulimia nervosa is abnormally low body weight.",
    "zh": "该患者的体重偏低、对身体的扭曲认知，以及与自我诱导呕吐相符的发现（咽部红斑、腮腺肥大）提示为神经性厌食症。体重显著偏低（成人BMI≤18.5 kg/m^2）是神经性厌食症的核心特征，并伴有扭曲的身体意象和对体重增加的恐惧。神经性厌食症有两种亚型：限制亚型患者禁食和过度运动，但不进行清除。暴食/清除亚型患者进行呕吐和/或使用物质（泻药、灌肠剂或利尿剂）来避免体重增加。\n\n神经性厌食症的体格检查结果包括消瘦、心动过缓、低血压、体温过低、脱发、皮肤干燥、毳毛（细而柔软的体毛）和腹胀。在清除亚型中，由于反复呕吐，常出现低钾血症和碱中毒。\n\n（选项B）在躯体变形障碍中，患者会过度关注对身体缺陷的感知或轻微的缺陷。当身体变形伴有进食障碍的症状（例如，体重偏低，害怕体重增加）时，不诊断为躯体变形障碍。\n\n（选项C）在神经性贪食症中，会出现不可控制的进食时期，随后出现代偿行为（泻药、利尿剂、呕吐、过度运动）。然而，患有这种疾病的患者体重正常或增加（与神经性厌食症相比，后者的体重显著降低）。\n\n（选项D）虽然便秘（肠蠕动音减弱）和疲劳也可见于甲状腺功能减退症，但该患者的体重偏低、害怕体重增加、扭曲的身体意象和清除行为，使得神经性厌食症更有可能。\n\n（选项E）肠易激综合征表现为慢性腹痛和排便习惯改变（腹泻、便秘或混合型）。患者常有腹胀。此诊断无法解释清除的体征、扭曲的身体意象和体重显著偏低。\n\n（选项F）该患者不符合重度抑郁障碍的诊断标准。她的情绪低落、疲劳和注意力不集中与营养不良的影响一致。\n\n教育目标：神经性厌食症的特征是对身体的扭曲认知和害怕体重增加，尽管体重显著偏低。患者可能会限制食物摄入和/或暴食和清除。将神经性厌食症与神经性贪食症区分开来的关键在于体重异常偏低。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the diagnostic criteria for eating disorders, specifically differentiating between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, as well as other related psychiatric and endocrine conditions. It requires integrating patient history, physical examination findings, and BMI to arrive at the most likely diagnosis.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully evaluate the patient's reported behaviors (vomiting to prevent weight gain), subjective feelings (fear of gaining weight, distorted body image), and objective findings (low BMI, physical signs of purging). Compare these findings against the diagnostic criteria for each of the provided options, paying close attention to the defining features of each disorder.",
