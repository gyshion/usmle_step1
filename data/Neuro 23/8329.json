    "en": "A 51-year-old woman comes to the office because it feels like the right side of her face has been getting heavier for the past 12 hours. Medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Physical examination reveals asymmetry of her face when she smiles, puffs out her cheeks, raises her eyebrows, and tries to close her eyes tightly. There is also effacement of the right nasolabial fold, and her lips are drawn toward the left side. The remainder of the neurologic examination is normal.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's acute hemifacial weakness is consistent with Bell palsy, an idiopathic mononeuropathy affecting the facial nerve (CN VII). CN VII is a mixed nerve, consisting of the following:\n\n• Motor output to the muscles controlling movement of the face (including eye closure)\n• Somatic sensation afferents from portions of the pinna and external auditory canal\n• Special sensation afferents for taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue\n• Parasympathetic innervation of the submandibular and lacrimal glands\n• Motor innervation of the stapedius muscle, which causes sound dampening\n\nPatients with Bell palsy typically have a sudden onset (within hours) of unilateral facial paralysis. Specific findings include impaired eye closure; eyebrow sagging; inability to smile, frown, or purse lips on the affected side; disappearance of the nasolabial fold; and lips drawn to the nonaffected side. Patients with Bell palsy may also have decreased tear production, hyperacusis, and/or loss of taste sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.\n\n(Choice A) Trigeminal nerve (CN V) somatic afferents are responsible for providing general sensation over the face; the motor branch of CN V (V3) innervates the muscles of mastication and the tensor tympani (sound dampening).\n\n(Choice C) The levator veli palatini elevates the soft palate during swallowing (and when saying \"ah\"). Palate elevation is mediated by the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve (CN X).\n\n(Choice D) Horner syndrome occurs due to interruption of sympathetic innervation and classically presents with hemifacial ptosis, miosis, anhydrosis, and enophthalmos. Postsynaptic sympathetic axons travel in the perivascular plexus along the carotid arteries to reach and innervate the face.\n\n(Choice E) Taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue is provided by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX).\n\nEducational objective:\nBecause of the diverse functions of the facial nerve (CN VII), patients with Bell palsy may experience decreased tear production, hyperacusis, and/or loss of taste sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, in addition to unilateral facial weakness.",
    "zh": "该患者的急性面部偏瘫与贝尔氏麻痹相符，贝尔氏麻痹是一种影响面神经（CN VII）的特发性单神经病。CN VII是混合神经，包括以下内容：\n\n• 对控制面部运动的肌肉（包括闭眼）的运动输出\n• 来自耳廓和外耳道部分的躯体感觉传入\n• 来自舌前三分之二的味觉特殊感觉传入\n• 对下颌下腺和泪腺的副交感神经支配\n• 对镫骨肌的运动神经支配，引起声音减弱\n\n贝尔氏麻痹患者通常在数小时内突然出现单侧面部瘫痪。具体发现包括眼睑闭合障碍；眉毛下垂；受影响一侧无法微笑、皱眉或撅嘴；鼻唇沟消失；嘴唇向未受影响的一侧歪斜。贝尔氏麻痹患者还可能出现泪液分泌减少、听觉过敏和/或舌前三分之二的味觉丧失。\n\n(选项 A) 三叉神经 (CN V) 的躯体传入神经负责提供面部的总体感觉；CN V (V3) 的运动分支支配咀嚼肌和鼓膜张肌（声音减弱）。\n\n(选项 C) 腭帆提肌在吞咽时（以及说“啊”时）抬高软腭。腭抬高由迷走神经（CN X）的咽支介导。\n\n(选项 D) 霍纳综合征是由于交感神经支配中断引起的，通常表现为半侧面部下垂、瞳孔缩小、无汗和眼球内陷。突触后交感神经轴突沿颈动脉周围血管丛走行，到达并支配面部。\n\n(选项 E) 舌后三分之一的味觉由舌咽神经（CN IX）提供。\n\n教育目标：\n由于面神经 (CN VII) 的多种功能，贝尔氏麻痹患者除了单侧面部无力外，还可能出现泪液分泌减少、听觉过敏和/或舌前三分之二的味觉丧失。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation and associated symptoms of Bell palsy, which is caused by idiopathic inflammation of the facial nerve (CN VII). It requires knowledge of the specific functions mediated by CN VII, including motor control of facial muscles, taste sensation, and parasympathetic innervation of lacrimal and salivary glands.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the signs and symptoms described as indicative of unilateral facial nerve palsy. Then, by recalling the functions of CN VII, the most likely associated finding among the options provided can be identified. This involves differentiating the functions of CN VII from those of other cranial nerves involved in facial sensation and motor control.",
