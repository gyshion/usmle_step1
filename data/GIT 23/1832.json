    "en": "A 65-year-old man is evaluated in the clinic due to several months of abdominal pain and vomiting. The pain starts 2 to 3 hours after meals, is characterized as crampy, and is often associated with bilious vomiting. Lately, the patient has been tolerating only liquids and has consequently lost 12 lbs in the past 4 months. On physical examination, he has mild epigastric tenderness on deep palpation. Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen shows an irregular mass in the third portion of the duodenum that is infiltrating beyond the gut wall. If this mass continues to enlarge, which of the following structures is most likely to be compromised in this patient?",
    "zh": "一名65岁男性因腹痛和呕吐数月就诊。 疼痛始于餐后2至3小时，呈痉挛性，常伴有胆汁性呕吐。 近期，患者只能耐受液体，因此在过去4个月内体重下降了12磅。 体格检查显示深部触诊时上腹部轻度压痛。 腹部增强CT扫描显示十二指肠第三部分出现不规则肿块，并已侵入肠壁之外。 如果该肿块持续增大，以下哪个结构最有可能受到该患者的损害？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The first part of the duodenum emerges from the pylorus of the stomach and is horizontally oriented over the first lumbar vertebra. It is the only part of the duodenum that is not retroperitoneal. The second part of the duodenum courses inferiorly from the level of L1 to L3. This part of the duodenum is in close relation to the head of the pancreas and contains the ampulla of Vater, the site where pancreatic and common bile duct secretions are released.\n\nThe third part of the duodenum courses horizontally over L3, the abdominal aorta, and the inferior vena cava. It is in close association with the uncinate process of the pancreas and the superior mesenteric artery and vein. Small bowel malignancies are rare; if they occur in the third part of the duodenum, anterior tumor invasion could compromise the superior mesenteric vessels. The fourth part of the duodenum courses superiorly and to the left of the L2 and L3 vertebrae and becomes the jejunum past the ligament of Treitz.\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) The common bile duct is formed when the common hepatic duct and cystic duct join in the porta hepatis region of the hepatoduodenal ligament. The common bile duct courses inferiorly, posterior to the first part of the duodenum and within the head of the pancreas, to drain into the second part of the duodenum.\n\n(Choice B) The gastroduodenal artery arises from the common hepatic artery and courses inferiorly, posterior to the first part of the duodenum, where it then splits into the anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and the right gastroepiploic artery. Peptic ulcers involving the posterior duodenal bulb can erode into the gastroduodenal artery and cause bleeding.\n\n(Choice C) The portal vein is formed by the union of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins in the retroperitoneum. It is located posterior to the pancreas at the level of the first lumbar vertebra and makes no contact with the duodenum.\n\n(Choice E) The left ureter has no relation to the duodenum. The right ureter courses retroperitoneally, posterior to the second part of the duodenum, for a short length.",
    "zh": "十二指肠的第一部分从胃的幽门发出，水平走向第一腰椎。 它是唯一不是腹膜后的十二指肠部分。 十二指肠的第二部分从L1水平向下延伸至L3。 十二指肠的这部分与胰腺头关系密切，并包含Vater壶腹，胰腺和胆总管分泌物在此处释放。\n\n十二指肠的第三部分水平走行于L3、腹主动脉和下腔静脉。 它与胰腺钩突以及肠系膜上动脉和静脉密切相关。 小肠恶性肿瘤罕见； 如果它们发生在十二指肠的第三部分，前部肿瘤浸润可能会损害肠系膜上血管。 十二指肠的第四部分向上并向左走行于L2和L3椎骨，并越过Treitz韧带成为空肠。\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项A）胆总管由肝总管和胆囊管在肝十二指肠韧带的肝门区域汇合而成。 胆总管向下走行，位于十二指肠第一部分之后，并在胰腺头内，流入十二指肠的第二部分。\n\n（选项B）胃十二指肠动脉源自肝总动脉，向下走行，位于十二指肠第一部分之后，然后分为前胰十二指肠上动脉和右胃网膜动脉。 涉及十二指肠球后部的消化性溃疡可侵蚀到胃十二指肠动脉并引起出血。\n\n（选项C）门静脉由肠系膜上静脉和脾静脉在腹膜后汇合而成。 它位于胰腺后方，在第一腰椎水平，与十二指肠没有接触。\n\n（选项E）左侧输尿管与十二指肠无关。 右侧输尿管在腹膜后走行，位于十二指肠第二部分之后，距离较短。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the anatomical relationships of the duodenum, particularly the third portion, and the structures that are in close proximity to it. It requires understanding which major vessels are most vulnerable to compression or invasion by a mass in that location.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the anatomical course of the duodenum and the structures surrounding each part. Focus on the third portion and its relationship to the superior mesenteric artery and vein, which are most likely to be affected by an enlarging mass.",
    "zh": "此题考查对十二指肠，特别是第三部分的解剖关系的了解，以及与其邻近的结构。 它需要理解哪个主要血管最容易受到该位置肿块的压迫或侵袭。\n\n要解决这个问题，请回忆十二指肠的解剖走行及其周围的结构。 重点关注第三部分及其与肠系膜上动脉和静脉的关系，这些血管最有可能受到增大肿块的影响。"
