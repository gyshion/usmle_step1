    "en": "A 34-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of sharp chest pain that radiates to the left shoulder. The pain increases with inspiration and is partially relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. Review of her outpatient medical records shows that she was seen for a facial rash 6 months ago. She is also being evaluated for proteinuria that was identified during her last clinic appointment.",

    "en": "This patient's chest pain is characteristic of ACUTE PERICARDITIS, which along with her facial rash and proteinuria is suggestive of underlying SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE). SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women age 20-40 that causes CONSTITUTIONAL and MULTISYSTEMIC symptoms. SEROSAL INFLAMMATION is common in SLE and most often manifests as pleuritis or pericarditis.\n\nPericarditis presents with severe and constant middle or left chest pain that may radiate to the neck and shoulders (particularly the trapezius ridge). The pain increases on INSPIRATION (pleuritic) and is relieved by SITTING UP AND LEANING FORWARD (postural). Auscultation of the chest reveals a scratchy sound called a PERICARDIAL FRICTION RUB that is best heard when the patient is leaning forward or lying prone. Additional cardiovascular manifestations in SLE include pericardial effusion, verrucous (Libman-Sacks) endocarditis, and increased risk of coronary artery disease.\n\n(Choice A) Aortic dissection occurs in patients with long-standing hypertension and those with Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (the 2 latter conditions cause cystic medial necrosis of the aortic wall). It presents with abrupt-onset, severe, tearing chest pain that radiates to the back.\n\n(Choice B) Cardiac tamponade is caused by accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space that prevents the heart from filling properly in diastole. It presents with dyspnea and tachycardia. Physical examination shows distended neck veins, hypotension, diminished heart sounds, and pulsus paradoxus (drop in systolic blood pressure ≥10 mm Hg on inspiration).\n\n(Choice C) Intimal hyperplasia of the pulmonary arteries is characteristic of both primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension. It presents with dyspnea, malaise, and findings associated with right ventricular failure (eg, jugular venous distention, pedal edema, hepatomegaly). Severe symptomatic pulmonary hypertension is a rare complication of SLE.\n\n(Choice D) Non-bacterial endocarditis (verrucous or Libman-Sacks endocarditis) refers to small, wart-like fibrinous lesions and generalized thickening that can affect the heart valves of patients with SLE. These are typically asymptomatic but may lead to valvular insufficiency or embolism.\n\nEducational objective:\nPericarditis is the most common cardiovascular manifestation associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. It presents with sharp pleuritic chest pain that is relieved by sitting up and leaning forward.",
    "zh": "该患者的胸痛是急性心包炎的特征，结合她的面部皮疹和蛋白尿，提示潜在的系统性红斑狼疮（SLE）。SLE是一种慢性自身免疫性疾病，主要影响20-40岁的女性，引起全身性和多系统症状。浆膜炎症在SLE中很常见，最常表现为胸膜炎或心包炎。\n\n心包炎表现为严重且持续的胸部中部或左侧疼痛，可放射至颈部和肩部（特别是斜方肌嵴）。疼痛随吸气（胸膜性）加重，坐起和向前倾斜（体位性）可缓解。胸部听诊可听到称为心包摩擦音的刮擦声，当患者向前倾斜或俯卧时最易听到。SLE的其他心血管表现包括心包积液、疣状（Libman-Sacks）心内膜炎和冠状动脉疾病风险增加。\n\n（选项 A）主动脉夹层发生在患有长期高血压以及马凡综合征和埃勒斯-当洛斯综合征（后两种情况导致主动脉壁囊性中层坏死）的患者中。表现为突发、剧烈、撕裂性胸痛，放射至背部。\n\n（选项 B）心脏压塞是由心包腔内液体积聚引起的，阻止心脏在舒张期充分充盈。表现为呼吸困难和心动过速。体格检查显示颈静脉扩张、低血压、心音减弱和奇脉（吸气时收缩压下降≥10 mmHg）。\n\n（选项 C）肺动脉内膜增生是原发性和继发性肺动脉高压的特征。表现为呼吸困难、不适和与右心衰竭相关的表现（例如，颈静脉怒张、足部水肿、肝肿大）。重症有症状性肺动脉高压是SLE的罕见并发症。\n\n（选项 D）非细菌性心内膜炎（疣状或Libman-Sacks心内膜炎）是指小而疣状的纤维蛋白病灶和普遍增厚，可影响SLE患者的心脏瓣膜。这些通常无症状，但可能导致瓣膜功能不全或栓塞。\n\n教育目标：\n心包炎是与系统性红斑狼疮相关的最常见的心血管表现。表现为剧烈胸膜性胸痛，坐起和向前倾斜可缓解。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pericarditis as a manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It requires recognizing the characteristic chest pain presentation and associating it with other clinical findings suggestive of SLE.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key features of the chest pain (pleuritic, relieved by sitting up) and consider the patient's history (facial rash, proteinuria). This should lead to considering autoimmune etiologies, particularly SLE, and its common cardiac manifestation of pericarditis.",
