He is a second-year college student pursuing a degree in biochemistry. His grades are excellent, but he is concerned about the effect his poor vision has had on his classes this semester. The patient is also an avid swimmer. He weighs 71 kg (156.5 lb) and is 195 cm (6 ft 5 in) tall. Physical examination shows the findings seen in the exhibits {{exhibit_1}}. This patient is most likely to die from which of the following conditions?",

    "en": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is one of the most common inherited connective tissue disorders. This condition is caused by a genetic defect in the glycoprotein fibrillin-1 and results in abnormalities in the skeleton (eg, long extremities, scoliosis, pectus excavatum), eyes (eg, ectopia lentis), and cardiovascular system (eg, aortic root disease). {{exhibit_2}}\n\nThe 2 most common cardiac abnormalities seen in MFS patients are mitral valve prolapse and cystic medial degeneration of the aorta. In more than 75% of MFS patients, cystic medial degeneration of the aorta results in aneurysmal dilation. If untreated, this can cause AORTIC DISSECTION, the most common cause of death in MFS patients. The second most common cause of death is cardiac failure secondary to mitral valve prolapse and/or aortic regurgitation. For these reasons, MFS patients should be followed regularly by a cardiologist.\n\n(Choices B, D, and E) With careful cardiovascular management, patients with MFS can have a normal life expectancy. MFS patients are not at increased risk for any of these other conditions.\n\n(Choice C) Although homocystinuria is also associated with a marfanoid body habitus, distinguishing features of homocystinuria include intellectual disability and increased risk of thrombotic events (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke). However, this patient has no intellectual dysfunction.\n\nEducational objective:\nCardiovascular lesions are the most life-threatening complications associated with Marfan syndrome. Early-onset cystic medial degeneration of the aorta predisposes to aortic dissection, the most common cause of death in these patients.",
    "zh": "马凡综合征（MFS）是最常见的遗传性结缔组织疾病之一。该病是由糖蛋白原纤维蛋白-1的基因缺陷引起的，导致骨骼（例如，四肢过长、脊柱侧弯、漏斗胸）、眼睛（例如，晶状体异位）和心血管系统（例如，主动脉根部疾病）的异常。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n在MFS患者中，最常见的两种心脏异常是二尖瓣脱垂和主动脉囊性中层变性。在超过75%的MFS患者中，主动脉囊性中层变性会导致动脉瘤扩张。如果未经治疗，这可能导致主动脉夹层，这是MFS患者最常见的死亡原因。第二常见的死亡原因是继发于二尖瓣脱垂和/或主动脉瓣反流的心力衰竭。由于这些原因，MFS患者应定期接受心脏病专家的随访。\n\n（选项B、D和E）通过仔细的心血管管理，MFS患者可以拥有正常的预期寿命。MFS患者罹患这些其他疾病的风险不会增加。\n\n（选项C）尽管高半胱氨酸尿症也与马凡样体质有关，但高半胱氨酸尿症的鉴别特征包括智力障碍和血栓形成事件（例如，心肌梗死、中风）的风险增加。然而，该患者没有智力功能障碍。\n\n教育目标：\n心血管病变是与马凡综合征相关 most 威胁生命最常见的并发症。早期发病的主动脉囊性中层变性易导致主动脉夹层，这是这些患者最常见的死亡原因。"

It requires recognizing the characteristic features of Marfan syndrome and understanding the underlying pathophysiology. \n\nTo solve this question, identify the key features of Marfan syndrome in the patient's presentation, such as tall stature, vision problems (lens dislocation), and marfanoid habitus. Recognize that aortic dissection is the most common cause of death in untreated Marfan syndrome patients.",
