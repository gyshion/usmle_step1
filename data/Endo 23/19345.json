  "explanation": {
    "en": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation (eg, ΔF508) in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. CFTR normally regulates the transport of chloride ions across secretory epithelial cells; a defect in this protein leads to the accumulation of thick, inspissated secretions in ducts throughout the body (eg, lungs, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, vas deferens). {{exhibit_2}}\n\nIn the pancreas, dehydrated, viscous secretions block the lumen of the pancreatic ducts, causing both exocrine (ie, malabsorption) and endocrine dysfunction. Endocrine dysfunction is due to pancreatic fibrosis and fat infiltration, which cause progressive encroachment, disruption, and destruction of pancreatic islet cells. This injury results in decreased insulin production and CF-related diabetes (CFRD). In the initial stages, glucose is typically normal when fasting (ie, able to produce some insulin) but elevated after a glycemic load, as seen in this patient. As the disease progresses, there is fasting hyperglycemia and increasing hemoglobin A1c levels.\n\nBecause early diagnosis and treatment with insulin are associated with improved pulmonary status and overall survival, all CF patients should undergo regular screening with oral glucose tolerance tests.\n\n(Choice B) Decreased insulin production due to pancreatic islet cell autoantibodies describes the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Islet cell destruction in CFRD is not an autoimmune process.\n\n(Choice C) Although glucagon increases in response to starvation, chronic malnutrition is likely to result in glucagon resistance. In addition, glucagon-producing alpha islet cells are damaged along with beta cells in patients with CF, resulting in decreased glucagon secretion.\n\n(Choices D and E) Stress-induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance can occur in times of acutely increased metabolic demand (eg, trauma, burn, sepsis) due to the release of cortisol, epinephrine, and glucagon. Patients with late-stage CFRD may have a component of insulin resistance during times of acute stress and inflammation (eg, pulmonary exacerbation); however, this is not the primary mechanism of CFRD.\n\nEducational objective:\nCystic fibrosis (CF) causes the accumulation of thick, viscous secretions in ducts throughout the body. CF-related diabetes occurs after the progressive destruction of pancreatic islet cells leads to decreased insulin production. {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "囊性纤维化 (CF) 是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，由编码 CF 跨膜电导调节器 (CFTR) 蛋白的基因突变（例如，ΔF508）引起。CFTR 正常情况下调节氯离子穿过分泌上皮细胞的转运；该蛋白的缺陷会导致整个身体（例如，肺、胰腺、胃肠道、输精管）的导管中积聚厚而浓稠的分泌物。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n在胰腺中，脱水、粘稠的分泌物阻塞胰管管腔，导致外分泌功能障碍（即，吸收不良）和内分泌功能障碍。内分泌功能障碍是由于胰腺纤维化和脂肪浸润，导致胰岛细胞进行性侵蚀、破坏和破坏。这种损伤导致胰岛素生成减少和 CF 相关糖尿病 (CFRD)。在初始阶段，空腹血糖通常正常（即，能够产生一些胰岛素），但在血糖负荷后升高，如该患者所见。随着疾病的进展，会出现空腹高血糖和血红蛋白A1c水平升高。\n\n由于早期诊断和胰岛素治疗与改善肺部状况和总生存期相关，所有 CF 患者都应定期接受口服葡萄糖耐量试验筛查。\n\n（选项 B）由于胰岛细胞自身抗体导致胰岛素生成减少描述了 1 型糖尿病的病理生理学。CFRD 中的胰岛细胞破坏不是自身免疫过程。\n\n（选项 C）虽然胰高血糖素会因饥饿而增加，但慢性营养不良很可能导致胰高血糖素抵抗。此外，产生胰高血糖素的 α 胰岛细胞与 CF 患者的 β 细胞一起受损，导致胰高血糖素分泌减少。\n\n（选项 D 和 E）应激诱导的高血糖和胰岛素抵抗可能发生在代谢需求急性增加的时期（例如，创伤、烧伤、败血症），这是由于皮质醇、肾上腺素和胰高血糖素的释放。晚期 CFRD 患者在急性应激和炎症（例如，肺部加重）期间可能存在一定程度的胰岛素抵抗；然而，这并不是 CFRD 的主要机制。\n\n教育目标：\n囊性纤维化 (CF) 会导致整个身体的导管中积聚厚而粘稠的分泌物。CF 相关糖尿病发生在胰岛细胞进行性破坏导致胰岛素生成减少之后。{{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of CF-related diabetes (CFRD), specifically the mechanism of endocrine dysfunction leading to decreased insulin production. It requires understanding the impact of inspissated secretions on the pancreatic ducts and islet cells. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the link between cystic fibrosis, pancreatic duct obstruction, and subsequent islet cell destruction. Eliminate options related to autoimmune processes or stress-induced hyperglycemia, focusing on the direct impact of CF on the pancreas.",
