The patient has had frequent involuntary contractions of the jaw, neck, and trunk muscles, which are triggered by sensory stimuli. He has a history of injection drug use and has had several injection site infections. Physical examination shows neck stiffness and decreased opening of the jaw.",

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with painful muscle spasms and neck/jaw contraction likely has tetanus, which is caused by the spore-forming anaerobic bacterium Clostridium tetani. C tetani spores are found in soil worldwide and are typically transmitted to humans during a puncture injury (eg, dirty needle use, splinter). The low oxygen tension of a puncture wound allows spores to germinate into vegetative rod-shaped bacteria that proliferate locally and produce tetanospasmin (tetanus toxin) {{exhibit_1}}.\n\nAlthough the pathogen is noninvasive (it stays localized to the wound site), the toxin enters the presynaptic terminals of the lower motor neurons and travels by retrograde axonal transport to the CNS. In the spinal cord, at the level of the anterior horn cells, the toxin blocks the release of neurotransmitters from inhibitory interneurons, leading to spasmodic muscle contraction.\n\nClassic findings include jaw stiffness due to masseter muscle spasm (trismus/lockjaw) and sustained contraction of the facial muscles, producing a bizarre \"smiling\" appearance (risus sardonicus). Spasmodic contraction of the back and neck can cause opisthotonos. Intermittent muscle spasms are frequently triggered by sensory stimuli (eg, loud noises, light, touch). Respiratory muscle involvement can lead to respiratory failure.\n\n(Choice A) Rabies virus is transmitted via the saliva of an infected animal during a bite wound. The virus spreads by retrograde axonal transport through peripheral nerves and enters the spinal cord/CNS. Patients with rabies usually develop painful pharyngeal spasms, hydrophobia, fever, and hyperactivity. However, this patient has no history of an animal bite; he likely developed tetanus due to a puncture wound with a contaminated needle.\n\n(Choice B) Food-borne botulism is marked by the ingestion of preformed botulism toxin with subsequent spread through the systemic circulation. The toxin blocks cholinergic presynaptic nerve terminals, which results in symmetric, descending weakness.\n\n(Choice C) Bacteria (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) from a wound can spread through the bloodstream to the brain leading to brain abscess. Symptoms vary but the most common manifestation is unilateral headache.\n\n(Choice D) Diphtheria is associated with the formation of a pseudomembranous pharyngeal exudate and the elaboration of diphtheria toxin into the systemic circulation. The toxin causes cardiac (myocarditis) and neurologic toxicity.\n\n(Choice E) Herpes simplex virus type 1 causes orolabial lesions and is the most frequent cause of sporadic encephalitis, which occurs when the virus spreads via the trigeminal nerve or olfactory tract to the temporal lobe. Patients usually present with confusion, fever, focal neurologic deficits, and seizures.\n\nEducational objective:\nTetanus is caused by infection with toxigenic strains of the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium tetani. Transmission typically occurs when spores are inoculated into the skin via a puncture wound. The bacteria germinate, replicate locally, and elaborate tetanospasmin (tetanus toxoid). The toxin spreads in a retrograde fashion through the lower motor neurons to the spinal cord, where it blocks inhibitory interneurons and causes spasmodic muscle contraction (eg, trismus, risus sardonicus).",
    "zh": "这位出现痛苦的肌肉痉挛和颈/下颌收缩的患者很可能患有破伤风，破伤风是由形成孢子的厌氧细菌破伤风梭菌引起的。破伤风梭菌孢子存在于世界各地的土壤中，通常在穿刺损伤（例如，使用脏针、碎片）期间传播给人类。穿刺伤口的低氧分压允许孢子发芽成营养型杆状细菌，这些细菌在局部增殖并产生破伤风痉挛毒素（破伤风毒素） {{exhibit_1}}。\n\n尽管病原体是非侵入性的（它停留在伤口部位），但毒素进入下运动神经元的突触前末梢，并通过逆行轴突转运到中枢神经系统。在脊髓中，在前角细胞水平，毒素阻断了抑制性中间神经元释放神经递质，导致痉挛性肌肉收缩。\n\n典型发现包括由于咬肌痉挛引起的下颌僵硬（牙关紧闭/锁颌）和面部肌肉的持续收缩，产生怪异的“微笑”外观（角弓反张）。背部和颈部的痉挛性收缩可引起角弓反张。间歇性肌肉痉挛经常由感觉刺激触发（例如，大声噪音、光线、触摸）。呼吸肌受累可导致呼吸衰竭。\n\n(选项A) 狂犬病病毒通过被感染动物的唾液在咬伤伤口期间传播。该病毒通过周围神经逆行轴突转运传播，并进入脊髓/中枢神经系统。狂犬病患者通常会发展为痛苦的咽痉挛、恐水症、发热和过度活跃。然而，这位患者没有动物咬伤的病史；他很可能由于被污染的针头造成的穿刺伤而患上破伤风。\n\n(选项B) 食源性肉毒中毒的特征是摄入预先形成的肉毒杆菌毒素，随后通过体循环传播。毒素阻断胆碱能突触前神经末梢，导致对称性下降性无力。\n\n(选项C) 来自伤口的细菌（例如，金黄色葡萄球菌）可以通过血液传播到大脑，导致脑脓肿。症状各异，但最常见的表现是单侧头痛。\n\n(选项D) 白喉与假膜性咽部渗出物的形成以及白喉毒素向体循环的释放有关。毒素会导致心脏（心肌炎）和神经毒性。\n\n(选项E) 1型单纯疱疹病毒引起口周病变，是最常见的散发性脑炎病因，当病毒通过三叉神经或嗅束传播到颞叶时发生。患者通常表现为意识模糊、发热、局灶性神经功能缺损和癫痫发作。\n\n教育目标：\n破伤风是由厌氧细菌破伤风梭菌的产毒菌株感染引起的。传播通常发生在孢子通过穿刺伤口接种到皮肤中时。细菌发芽，在局部复制，并产生破伤风痉挛毒素（破伤风类毒素）。毒素以逆行方式通过下运动神经元传播到脊髓，在那里它阻断抑制性中间神经元并引起痉挛性肌肉收缩（例如，牙关紧闭、角弓反张）。"
