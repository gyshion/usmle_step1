    "en": "A 13-year-old boy is evaluated for abnormal growth. His mother says that he has grown rapidly over the past 10 months and is much taller than his older brother and other children his age. During this time, she has had a hard time finding clothes that fit him and has had to buy new shoes for him each month due to increasing foot size. The patient says that he feels well except for excessive sweating. He has no history of major medical illness and takes no medications. Both parents are of average height and have normally proportioned limbs. The patient is above the 99th percentile for height and at the 90th percentile for weight. On physical examination, he has long extremities with large hands and feet; the lower jaw is protruding. Heart sounds are normal. Sexual development is Tanner stage 4. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?",
    "zh": "一名13岁的男孩因生长异常而接受评估。他的母亲说，在过去的10个月里，他生长迅速，比他年长的哥哥和其他同龄的孩子高得多。在这段时间里，她很难找到适合他的衣服，并且由于脚的尺寸增加，不得不每个月给他买新鞋。患者说他感觉良好，除了出汗过多。他没有重大疾病史，也没有服用药物。父母的身高都属于平均水平，四肢比例正常。患者的身高超过第99百分位数，体重在第90百分位数。体格检查显示，他四肢较长，手和脚较大；下颌突出。心音正常。性发育为Tanner 4期。以下哪项最可能是该患者病情的根本原因？"

    "en": "This patient most likely has GIGANTISM, a condition caused by hypersecretion of growth hormone (GH) during childhood. GH is a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary that acts as both a growth promoter and stress hormone (increasing glucose and free fatty acids). Although GH has direct effects on target tissue (eg, chondrogenesis, myocyte protein synthesis), its growth-promoting effects are primarily mediated by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is released from the liver following stimulation of hepatic GH receptors. IGF-1 binds to a specific receptor tyrosine kinase and stimulates cell growth and proliferation in bone, cartilage, skeletal muscle, and other soft tissues.\n\nGigantism occurs in children and adolescents before fusion of the epiphyseal growth plates, resulting in rapid linear growth along with large hands and feet, thickening of the calvarium, protrusion of the jaw (prognathism), excessive sweating, and oily skin. The adult variant, acromegaly, has no effect on stature because the epiphyseal growth plates have already fused.\n\n(Choices A and B) Klinefelter syndrome is caused by a nondisjunction of sex chromosomes (47,XXY). Patients are phenotypically male with hypogonadism and infertility. Marfan syndrome is caused by a defect in fibrillin-1 and presents with joint hypermobility, increased limb length, and arachnodactyly. These disorders are associated with tall stature but do not exhibit prognathism or bony enlargement of the hands and feet.\n\n(Choice C) Defects in the GH receptor cause Laron dwarfism, characterized by decreased linear growth, high serum GH concentrations, and low levels of circulating IGF-1.\n\n(Choice E) Excessive thyroxine production (ie, hyperthyroidism) presents with weight loss, heat intolerance, and tremor. Sweating is common, but hyperthyroidism in children causes short stature, not accelerated growth.\n\n(Choice F) Circulating levels of IGF-1 are produced primarily in the liver. Although IGF-1 is also produced locally in the hypothalamus to regulate central nervous system activity, this source does not contribute significantly to bone and soft-tissue growth.\n\n(Choice G) Increased pituitary gonadotropin release causes central precocious puberty. This patient has appropriate sexual development for age. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有巨人症，这是一种由儿童时期生长激素（GH）过度分泌引起的疾病。GH是一种由垂体前叶分泌的肽类激素，既能促进生长，又能作为应激激素（增加葡萄糖和游离脂肪酸）。虽然GH对靶组织有直接作用（如软骨形成、肌细胞蛋白合成），但其促进生长的作用主要是由胰岛素样生长因子-1（IGF-1）介导的，IGF-1是在肝脏受到肝脏GH受体刺激后释放的。IGF-1与特异性的受体酪氨酸激酶结合，刺激骨骼、软骨、骨骼肌和其他软组织的细胞生长和增殖。\n\n巨人症发生在儿童和青少年骨骺生长板融合之前，导致快速的线性生长，伴有手脚增大、颅骨增厚、下颌突出（前颌症）、出汗过多和皮肤油腻。成人变异型肢端肥大症对身材没有影响，因为骨骺生长板已经融合。\n\n（选项A和B）Klinefelter综合征是由性染色体不分离（47,XXY）引起的。患者表现为男性，伴有性腺功能减退和不育。马凡综合征是由原纤蛋白-1缺陷引起的，表现为关节过度活动、肢体长度增加和蜘蛛指。这些疾病与身材高大有关，但没有表现出前颌症或手脚骨骼增大。\n\n（选项C）GH受体缺陷会导致Laron侏儒症，其特征是线性生长减少、血清GH浓度高和循环IGF-1水平低。\n\n（选项E）甲状腺素过度产生（即甲状腺功能亢进）表现为体重减轻、不耐热和震颤。出汗很常见，但儿童甲状腺功能亢进会导致身材矮小，而不是加速生长。\n\n（选项F）循环中的IGF-1主要在肝脏中产生。虽然IGF-1也会在下丘脑局部产生以调节中枢神经系统活动，但这种来源对骨骼和软组织生长没有显着贡献。\n\n（选项G）垂体促性腺激素释放增加会导致中枢性性早熟。该患者的性发育与年龄相符。{{exhibit_1}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of gigantism, specifically the role of growth hormone and IGF-1 in stimulating linear growth before epiphyseal closure. It also requires differentiating gigantism from other conditions causing tall stature or precocious puberty.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical features of gigantism (accelerated growth, large extremities, prognathism) and link them to excessive growth hormone and IGF-1 production. Rule out other conditions based on their distinct clinical presentations and underlying mechanisms.",
