    "en": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after police officers found him agitated and confused. During transport to the hospital, he is started on intravenous fluids with dextrose. On arrival, the patient is disoriented but cooperative. Physical examination shows bruises on the forehead, forearms, and shins. Extracocular findings include bilateral horizontal nystagmus and impaired lateral eye movements; however, the ambulance personnel state that the patient's extraocular movements were normal when they arrived on the scene. The patient also has an unsteady gait with widely spaced legs and short steps. Review of the medical record shows that he has been admitted to the hospital with alcohol intoxication several times before. This patient's neurologic findings are most likely related to deficiency of a cofactor required for which of the following reactions? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient's multiple previous hospitalizations for alcohol intoxication and easy bruising are indicative of CHRONIC ALCOHOL USE. Patients with this condition are frequently deficient in THIAMINE, a necessary cofactor for several enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, including PYRUVATE DEHYDROGENASE, ALPHA-KETOGLUTARATE DEHYDROGENASE, and transketolase (Choices A, B, E, F, and G).\n\nThe administration of glucose to thiamine-deficient patients can rapidly deplete the small amount of circulating thiamine. This can result in neuronal injury within highly metabolic brain regions, leading to the classic triad of ACUTE WERNICKE ENCEPHALOPATHY seen in this patient:\n\n*   Encephalopathy (eg, confusion)\n*   Oculomotor dysfunction (eg, horizontal nystagmus)\n*   Ataxia (eg, unsteady gait)\n\n(Choices C and H) The metabolism of ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase consumes NAD+ and increases the NADH/NAD+ ratio. This skewed ratio inhibits enzymatic pathways requiring NAD+ (eg, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase), and as a result, the entire citric acid cycle is typically impaired in intoxicated patients. However, this patient has the classic findings of Wernicke encephalopathy, which is caused by thiamine (not NAD+) depletion; the only thiamine-dependent enzyme in the citric acid cycle is alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.\n\nEducational objective:\nSeveral enzymes involved in glucose metabolism (eg, pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) require thiamine as a cofactor. The administration of glucose to thiamine-deficient patients (eg, chronic alcohol use) can precipitate WERNICKE ENCEPHALOPATHY (eg, acute confusion, ophthalmoplegia, ataxia) due to rapid thiamine consumption.",
    "zh": "该患者多次因酒精中毒住院和易瘀伤表明存在慢性酒精使用。患有这种情况的患者经常缺乏硫胺素，硫胺素是参与葡萄糖代谢的几种酶的必需辅助因子，包括丙酮酸脱氢酶、α-酮戊二酸脱氢酶和转酮醇酶（选项 A、B、E、F 和 G）。\n\n向硫胺素缺乏的患者给予葡萄糖会迅速耗尽少量循环硫胺素。这可能导致高度代谢性脑区内的神经元损伤，导致该患者出现的急性韦尼克脑病经典三联征：\n\n*   脑病（如意识模糊）\n*   动眼神经功能障碍（如水平眼震）\n*   共济失调（如步态不稳）\n\n（选项 C 和 H）乙醇通过醇脱氢酶和乙醛脱氢酶代谢会消耗 NAD+ 并增加 NADH/NAD+ 比率。这种失衡的比率抑制需要 NAD+ 的酶促途径（例如，α-酮戊二酸脱氢酶、异柠檬酸脱氢酶、苹果酸脱氢酶），因此，整个柠檬酸循环通常在中毒患者中受损。但是，该患者具有韦尼克脑病的典型发现，韦尼克脑病是由硫胺素（而非 NAD+）耗竭引起的；柠檬酸循环中唯一依赖硫胺素的酶是 α-酮戊二酸脱氢酶。\n\n教育目标：\n几种参与葡萄糖代谢的酶（例如，丙酮酸脱氢酶、α-酮戊二酸脱氢酶）需要硫胺素作为辅助因子。向硫胺素缺乏的患者（例如，慢性酒精使用）给予葡萄糖，由于硫胺素快速消耗，可能诱发韦尼克脑病（例如，急性意识模糊、眼肌麻痹、共济失调）。"
