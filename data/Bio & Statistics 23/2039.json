    "en": "A 58-year-old man comes to the office with a persistent dry cough. He also has involuntarily lost 10 kg (22 lb) over the past 3 months. The patient drinks 2 or 3 beers daily and has a 40-pack-year smoking history. Physical examination shows dullness to percussion over the right lower lung base. CT scan of the chest reveals a right-sided pleural effusion and a mass in the lower lobe of the right lung. Microscopic examination of the mass demonstrates malignant cells with large nuclei that contain prominent, round, basophilic bodies, as shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}:",

    "en": "This patient's biopsy demonstrates malignant cells with prominent nucleoli, which appear as round, dense, basophilic (ie, dark blue to purple) intranuclear bodies on hematoxylin and eosin staining. The NUCLEOLUS is the primary site of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription. Copies of the 45S pre-rRNA gene are arranged in clusters (nucleolar organizing regions) on multiple chromosomes; these regions come together in the nucleus to form the nucleolus. RNA polymerase I functions exclusively within the nucleolus to transcribe the 45S pre-rRNA gene into a single transcript that is subsequently processed into mature 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs.\n\nIn addition to rRNA transcription, the nucleolus is involved in the maturation and assembly of ribosomal subunits. Ribosomal proteins, which are synthesized in the cytoplasm, are transported into the nucleolus, where they combine with rRNA to form immature 40S and 60S subunits. These subunits are then shuttled via nuclear pores to the cytoplasm, where they ultimately participate in protein synthesis.\n\nThe regulation of ribosomal synthesis occurs in part by controlling the number of active rRNA genes. Generally, as cells become more differentiated, growth slows and the cells require fewer ribosomes for protein production. In contrast, malignant cells with high metabolic activity usually have a large number of active rRNA genes and prominent nucleoli.\n\n(Choice A) Peptidyltransferase catalyzes peptide bond formation during protein synthesis, which occurs in mature ribosomes found in the cytoplasm.\n\n(Choice C) RNA polymerase II synthesizes messenger RNA (mRNA), small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and microRNA (miRNA) in the nucleus. It is the most highly regulated of the 3 RNA polymerases, with its function determined by multiple transcription factors and epigenetic processes.\n\n(Choice D) Ubiquitin ligase attaches ubiquitin molecules to proteins in the cytoplasm, tagging them for degradation in the cell's proteasome complex. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is important for the degradation of short-lived, senescent, or abnormal (eg, denatured, misfolded) proteins.",
    "zh": "该患者的活检显示恶性细胞具有突出的核仁，在苏木精和伊红染色下，核仁表现为圆形、致密、嗜碱性（即深蓝色到紫色）的核内小体。核仁是核糖体RNA (rRNA) 转录的主要场所。45S前体rRNA基因的拷贝以簇（核仁组织区）的形式排列在多条染色体上；这些区域在细胞核中聚集在一起形成核仁。RNA聚合酶I仅在核仁内起作用，将45S前体rRNA基因转录成单个转录本，随后该转录本被加工成成熟的18S、5.8S和28S rRNA。\n\n除了rRNA转录外，核仁还参与核糖体亚基的成熟和组装。在细胞质中合成的核糖体蛋白被转运到核仁中，在那里它们与rRNA结合形成不成熟的40S和60S亚基。然后这些亚基通过核孔转运到细胞质，最终参与蛋白质合成。\n\n核糖体合成的调节部分是通过控制活性rRNA基因的数量来实现的。通常，当细胞变得更加分化时，生长会减慢，细胞需要更少的核糖体用于蛋白质产生。相比之下，具有高代谢活性的恶性细胞通常具有大量活性rRNA基因和突出的核仁。\n\n（选项A）肽酰基转移酶催化蛋白质合成期间的肽键形成，该过程发生在细胞质中成熟的核糖体中。\n\n（选项C）RNA聚合酶II在细胞核中合成信使RNA (mRNA)、小核RNA (snRNA) 和 microRNA (miRNA)。它是3种RNA聚合酶中调节最严格的，其功能由多个转录因子和表观遗传过程决定。\n\n（选项D）泛素连接酶将泛素分子连接到细胞质中的蛋白质上，标记它们，以便在细胞的蛋白酶体复合物中降解。泛素-蛋白酶体途径对于降解寿命短、衰老或异常（例如，变性、错误折叠）的蛋白质很重要。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the function of RNA polymerase I and its specific location within the cell, the nucleolus, where it transcribes ribosomal RNA. It also requires understanding of the role of the nucleolus in ribosome biogenesis and its prominence in malignant cells.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key finding of prominent nucleoli in malignant cells. Recall that the nucleolus is the site of rRNA transcription and that RNA polymerase I is the enzyme responsible for this process.",
