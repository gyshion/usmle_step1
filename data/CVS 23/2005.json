    "en": "A 71-year-old woman comes to the office for follow-up. She has a history of systolic heart failure and was hospitalized 2 weeks ago for an exacerbation, which was treated with intravenous diuretics. Since discharge the patient has been taking oral diuretics and says her shortness of breath has improved, but she is now experiencing muscle weakness and cramping. Blood pressure is 128/72 mm Hg and pulse is 80/min. Physical examination shows mildly decreased muscle strength in the lower extremities. Laboratory evaluation reveals a serum potassium level of 2.2 mEq/L. The patient receives potassium supplements, which improve the weakness. Another diuretic is added to her medical regimen to help prevent this adverse effect {{exhibit_1}} in the future.",

    "en": "This patient has symptomatic hypokalemia, likely due to treatment with loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) used to reduce the symptoms of heart failure (eg, dyspnea, edema). The physician most likely added a POTASSIUM-SPARING DIURETIC to this patient's treatment regimen to minimize potassium loss caused by loop diuretic use. All diuretics except for the potassium-sparing class cause potassium loss by increasing sodium delivery to the LATE DISTAL TUBULE and CORTICAL COLLECTING DUCT, where aldosterone-induced sodium reabsorption occurs at the expense of potassium. Potassium-sparing diuretics act primarily by antagonizing this effect of aldosterone.\n\nSome potassium-sparing diuretics, such as amiloride and triamterene, function by directly blocking the epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in the apical membrane of principal cells. Others, including spironolactone and eplerenone, competitively inhibit the aldosterone receptor, causing downregulation of both the apical ENaCs and basolateral Na+/K+ pumps. Spironolactone and eplerenone (a more specific receptor antagonist than spironolactone with fewer side effects) are preferred in patients with heart failure because they can also prevent the deleterious effects of ALDOSTERONE-INDUCED CARDIAC REMODELING.\n\n(Choice A) Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (eg, acetazolamide, dorzolamide) block sodium and bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule. These weak diuretics are typically used to treat altitude sickness or glaucoma.\n\n(Choices B and C) Osmotic diuretics (eg, mannitol) function by preventing sodium and water reabsorption, mainly in the proximal tubule and the descending limb of the loop of Henle. These are typically used for cerebral edema with increased intracranial pressure.\n\n(Choice D) Loop diuretics (eg, furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide) inhibit the Na-K-2Cl symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This patient is likely already receiving this medication for symptomatic treatment of her heart failure; further dosage increase would worsen hypokalemia.\n\n(Choice E) Thiazide diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone) act in the early distal convoluted tubule. These drugs are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension and are sometimes added to loop diuretics in patients with refractory edema, but they would likely worsen hypokalemia.\n\nEducational objective:\nAll diuretics except for the potassium-sparing class cause potassium loss by increasing sodium delivery to the late distal tubule and cortical collecting duct, where aldosterone-induced sodium reabsorption occurs at the expense of potassium. Potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, amiloride) act on the late distal tubule and cortical collecting duct to antagonize the effects of aldosterone. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者有症状性低钾血症，可能由于使用环利尿剂（如呋塞米）治疗心力衰竭的症状（如呼吸困难、水肿）所致。医生很可能在该患者的治疗方案中加入了一种保钾利尿剂，以最大限度地减少环利尿剂引起钾的流失。除了保钾利尿剂之外的所有利尿剂都会通过增加钠向晚期远曲小管和皮质集合管的输送而导致钾的流失，在这些部位，醛固酮诱导的钠重吸收是以钾为代价发生的。保钾利尿剂主要通过拮抗醛固酮的这种作用而发挥作用。\n\n一些保钾利尿剂，如阿米洛利和氨苯蝶啶，通过直接阻断主细胞顶端膜中的上皮钠通道 (ENaCs) 发挥作用。另一些，包括螺内酯和依普利酮，通过竞争性抑制醛固酮受体，导致顶端 ENaCs 和基底外侧 Na+/K+ 泵的下调。螺内酯和依普利酮（一种比螺内酯更特异的受体拮抗剂，副作用更少）是心力衰竭患者的首选药物，因为它们还可以防止醛固酮诱导的心脏重构的不利影响。\n\n(选项 A) 碳酸酐酶抑制剂（如乙酰唑胺、多佐胺）阻断近曲小管中的钠和碳酸氢盐重吸收。这些弱效利尿剂通常用于治疗高原反应或青光眼。\n\n(选项 B 和 C) 渗透性利尿剂（如甘露醇）通过阻止钠和水的重吸收发挥作用，主要是在近曲小管和亨利袢的降支。这些药物通常用于治疗颅内压增高的脑水肿。\n\n(选项 D) 环利尿剂（如呋塞米、布美他尼、托塞米）抑制亨利袢粗段升支中的 Na-K-2Cl 共转运蛋白。该患者可能已经在接受这种药物治疗心力衰竭的症状；进一步增加剂量会使低钾血症恶化。\n\n(选项 E) 噻嗪类利尿剂（如氢氯噻嗪、氯噻酮）作用于远曲小管早期。这些药物常用于治疗高血压，有时也可添加到对水肿难治的患者的环利尿剂中，但它们可能会使低钾血症恶化。\n\n教学目标：\n除了保钾利尿剂之外的所有利尿剂都会通过增加钠向晚期远曲小管和皮质集合管的输送而导致钾的流失，在这些部位，醛固酮诱导的钠重吸收是以钾为代价发生的。保钾利尿剂（如螺内酯、阿米洛利）作用于晚期远曲小管和皮质集合管，以拮抗醛固酮的作用。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of diuretic mechanisms of action and their effects on electrolyte balance, specifically focusing on the nephron segments where different diuretics exert their primary effects. It also assesses the ability to recognize and manage hypokalemia induced by loop diuretics in a patient with heart failure.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the patient's electrolyte imbalance (hypokalemia) and the likely cause (loop diuretic). Recognize that a potassium-sparing diuretic is needed to counteract the potassium loss.
