    "en": "A 19-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with pelvic pain, fever, and chills that began last night. The patient's last menstrual period was 12 weeks ago, and she had a surgical pregnancy termination at a clinic 2 days ago. Temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F), blood pressure is 92/60 mm Hg, and pulse is 102/min. Physical examination shows diffuse lower abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding. Speculum examination reveals an open cervical os and malodorous tissue in the vaginal canal. Bimanual examination shows moderate uterine tenderness and no adnexal masses.",

    "en": "This patient with fever, abdominal pain, uterine tenderness, and a malodorous cervical discharge most likely has a SEPTIC ABORTION. With surgical pregnancy termination, the cervix is dilated, and the products of conception (POCs) are removed via suction and sharp curettage. During this procedure, vaginal flora and other bacteria can enter the uterine cavity; complete removal of the POCs, including placental and fetal tissue, does not usually promote bacterial growth. However, when incomplete evacuation occurs, the RETAINED POCs in the uterus can become INFECTED and result in a septic abortion.\n\nThe most common organisms that cause septic abortions include ANAEROBES (eg, Enterobacteriaceae), group A Streptococcus, and STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS. Once introduced into the uterus, bacteria can access the intervillous space of the retained placenta, which leads to uterine infection and bacteremia. Bacterial toxins can cause tissue necrosis, widespread endothelial damage, multiorgan failure, and even death.\n\nIn addition to BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS, patients require URGENT SURGICAL UTERINE EVACUATION to remove the necrotic nidus of infection, where the antibiotics are less effective. Long-term complications include synechiae (adhesions) in the uterine cavity that can lead to secondary amenorrhea and infertility (Asherman syndrome).\n\n(Choice A) Actinomyces species normally colonize the mouth and digestive and genital tracts. They can cause clinically significant pelvic infections in women using intrauterine devices, but they are not typically involved in septic abortions.\n\n(Choice B) Chlamydia trachomatis can cause cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease characterized by pelvic pain with fever and cervical motion tenderness. This pathogen is not typically involved in septic abortion because it is not a vaginal colonizer.\n\n(Choice C) Lactobacillus is found within the vaginal microbiota and prevents the overgrowth of pathogens (anaerobes) through the production of hydrogen peroxide. In immunocompetent hosts, lactobacilli do not lead to invasive infection.\n\n(Choice D) Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that is especially virulent in immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women. It causes spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal infection, and/or neonatal sepsis through transplacental transmission.",
    "zh": "该患者出现发热、腹痛、子宫压痛和有异味的宫颈分泌物，最有可能患有 感染性流产。手术妊娠终止时，宫颈扩张，通过抽吸和锐刮术移除妊娠物（POCs）。在此过程中，阴道菌群和其他细菌可进入子宫腔；完全清除POCs，包括胎盘和胎儿组织，通常不会促进细菌生长。然而，当不完全清除时，子宫内残留的POCs可能被感染并导致感染性流产。\n\n引起感染性流产的最常见病原体包括厌氧菌（如肠杆菌科）、A组链球菌和金黄色葡萄球菌。一旦进入子宫，细菌就可以进入残留胎盘的绒毛间隙，从而导致子宫感染和菌血症。细菌毒素可引起组织坏死、广泛的内皮损伤、多器官衰竭，甚至死亡。\n\n除了广谱抗生素外，患者还需要紧急手术子宫清除术以移除感染的坏死病灶，抗生素在此处的疗效较差。长期并发症包括子宫腔内的粘连（粘连），可导致继发性闭经和不孕（Asherman综合征）。\n\n（选项A）放线菌属通常定植于口腔、消化道和生殖道。它们可引起使用宫内节育器的女性的临床相关性盆腔感染，但通常不参与感染性流产。\n\n（选项B）沙眼衣原体可引起宫颈炎和盆腔炎，其特征为盆腔疼痛伴发热和宫颈活动压痛。这种病原体通常不参与感染性流产，因为它不是阴道定植菌。\n\n（选项C）乳杆菌存在于阴道微生物群中，通过产生过氧化氢来防止病原体（厌氧菌）的过度生长。在免疫功能正常的宿主中，乳杆菌不会导致侵袭性感染。\n\n（选项D）单核细胞增生李斯特菌是一种食源性病原体，对免疫功能低下的人和孕妇尤其具有毒力。它通过胎盘传播引起自然流产、宫内胎儿感染和/或新生儿败血症。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of septic abortion, including its risk factors, common causative microorganisms, clinical presentation, and management. It requires differentiating septic abortion from other gynecological infections based on the patient's history and physical examination findings.\n\nTo solve this question, identify key clinical features suggestive of infection following a recent pregnancy termination, such as fever, pelvic pain, and malodorous vaginal discharge. Consider the common pathogens associated with septic abortion and evaluate the provided options in the context of the patient's presentation and risk factors.",
