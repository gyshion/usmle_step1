    "en": "A study was conducted to determine the utility of adjunctive therapy in bacterial meningitis. Patients with acute bacterial meningitis whose cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed gram-positive diplococci were divided into 2 groups. The first (control) group was given systemic antibiotics only, and the second (experimental) group was given dexamethasone followed by systemic antibiotics. Compared to the control group, patients in the experimental group developed fewer neurologic sequelae and had a lower risk of death.",

    "en": "Acute bacterial meningitis is characterized by a massive inflammatory response in the central nervous system. The inflammation is driven by bacterial subcapsular components, particularly macromolecules of the bacterial cell wall such as teichoic acid and peptidoglycan. These components trigger the release of inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin 12), leading to loosening of the tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier, vasogenic edema, elevation of intracranial pressure, and recruitment of leukocytes.\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, a gram-positive diplococcus, is the leading cause of acute bacterial meningitis in adults. Initial antibiotic therapy against S pneumoniae lyses the bacteria and releases cell wall components that increase cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory cytokines. Studies have shown that pretreatment with dexamethasone reduces the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the CSF and limits risk of inflammation-induced morbidity (eg, seizures, focal neurologic deficits) and death. Other forms of bacterial meningitis, such as those due to Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae, do not benefit from glucocorticoid pretreatment, possibly because these gram-negative organisms have thinner cell walls (less peptidoglycan and no teichoic acid), resulting in less inflammatory cytokine release.\n\n(Choice A) Therapeutic hypothermia (32-34 C [89.6-93.2 F]) can be used after hypoxic/ischemic brain injury due to cardiac arrest. It reduces cerebral metabolic activity and limits metabolic strain within damaged neurologic tissue. This has been shown to improve neurologic recovery and long-term outcomes.\n\n(Choice C) The inflammatory response to bacterial components in the CSF loosens the tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier, which aids antibiotic penetration into the central nervous system. Dexamethasone reduces the inflammatory response and would be expected to decrease permeability of the blood-brain barrier.\n\n(Choice D) Glucocorticoids promote the release of granulocytes from the bone marrow and the movement of neutrophils off the endothelial wall into the systemic circulation. This often leads to an increase in the circulating white blood cell count with delayed migration into infected tissues.\n\n(Choice E) Glucocorticoids can cause a dose-dependent increase in fasting serum glucose levels due to stimulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibition of glucose uptake in adipose tissue. Although this increases the delivery of glucose to the brain, the primary reason glucocorticoids are protective in those with S pneumoniae meningitis is a reduction in brain inflammation.\n\nEducational objective:\nPneumococcal meningitis is associated with massive cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory cytokine release in response to bacterial cell wall components. Treatment with dexamethasone prior to antibiotic therapy has been shown to reduce inflammation and decrease the risk of adverse outcomes (eg, seizures, focal neurologic deficits) and death. Other forms of bacterial meningitis do not seem to benefit from glucocorticoid treatment.",
    "zh": "急性细菌性脑膜炎的特征是中枢神经系统出现大规模炎症反应。炎症由细菌亚荚膜成分驱动，特别是细菌细胞壁的大分子，如磷壁酸和肽聚糖。这些成分触发炎症细胞因子（如肿瘤坏死因子-α、干扰素-γ、白细胞介素 12）的释放，导致血脑屏障的紧密连接松弛、血管源性水肿、颅内压升高以及白细胞募集。\n\n肺炎链球菌（革兰氏阳性双球菌）是成人急性细菌性脑膜炎的主要病因。针对肺炎链球菌的初始抗生素治疗会溶解细菌，并释放细胞壁成分，从而增加脑脊液 (CSF) 炎症细胞因子。研究表明，用地塞米松预处理可降低脑脊液中炎症细胞因子的水平，并限制炎症引起的发病率（如癫痫发作、局灶性神经功能缺损）和死亡风险。其他形式的细菌性脑膜炎，如脑膜炎奈瑟菌和流感嗜血杆菌引起的脑膜炎，无法从糖皮质激素预处理中获益，这可能是因为这些革兰氏阴性生物体具有更薄的细胞壁（较少的肽聚糖和没有磷壁酸），导致炎症细胞因子释放减少。\n\n(选项 A) 治疗性低温（32-34 摄氏度 [89.6-93.2 华氏度]）可用于心脏骤停引起的缺氧/缺血性脑损伤后。它降低了脑代谢活动，并限制了受损神经组织内的代谢应激。这已被证明可改善神经系统恢复和长期预后。\n\n(选项 C) 对脑脊液中细菌成分的炎症反应会使血脑屏障的紧密连接松弛，从而有助于抗生素渗透到中枢神经系统。地塞米松可减轻炎症反应，并有望降低血脑屏障的通透性。\n\n(选项 D) 糖皮质激素促进粒细胞从骨髓中释放，以及中性粒细胞从内皮壁向全身循环的移动。这通常会导致循环白细胞计数增加，并延迟迁移到受感染组织中。\n\n(选项 E) 糖皮质激素可因刺激肝脏糖异生和抑制脂肪组织对葡萄糖的摄取而导致空腹血清葡萄糖水平呈剂量依赖性增加。虽然这增加了大脑对葡萄糖的供应，但糖皮质激素对患有肺炎链球菌性脑膜炎的患者具有保护作用的主要原因是减轻了脑炎症。\n\n教学目标：\n肺炎球菌性脑膜炎与对细菌细胞壁成分的反应中脑脊液中炎症细胞因子的大量释放有关。已证明在抗生素治疗前用地塞米松治疗可减轻炎症，并降低不良后果（如癫痫发作、局灶性神经功能缺损）和死亡的风险。其他形式的细菌性脑膜炎似乎无法从糖皮质激素治疗中获益。"
