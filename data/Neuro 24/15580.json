    "en": "The patient's presentation of headache, vomiting, confusion, seizure, papilledema, and neck rigidity, followed by progressive neurological decline and death, is highly suggestive of meningoencephalitis. The autopsy findings of a round/oval yeast surrounded by a thick polysaccharide capsule {{exhibit_2}} are characteristic of Cryptococcus neoformans. Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast that commonly causes meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with advanced AIDS. The yeast is found in soil contaminated by bird droppings and is transmitted via inhalation. Healthy individuals can usually clear the infection, but those with compromised immunity are susceptible. C neoformans can cause infection and hematologic dissemination to the brain, leading to cryptococcal meningitis. Replication of C neoformans in the brain clogs the arachnoid villi with yeast antigens and capsular proteins, leading to obstructed cerebrospinal fluid outflow. This elevates intracranial pressure and causes the symptoms described: progressive headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, neck rigidity, and papilledema. Seizures and brain herniation can subsequently occur. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by detection of cryptococcal antigens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or visualization of encapsulated, budding yeasts in CSF using specialized stains (e.g., India ink, methenamine silver). These special stains are needed because the yeasts are surrounded by clear CSF (unlike in tissue sections). Patients who develop cryptococcal meningitis often are unaware of underlying HIV infection (as is likely in this case); it is considered an AIDS-defining illness.\n\n(Choice A) Mycolic acid is the primary component of the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although pulmonary infection is most common, M tuberculosis can spread to the brain and cause subacute meningitis or a focal parenchymal infection called a tuberculoma. Histopathology would show granulomas with giant cells and acid-fast bacteria.\n\n(Choice B) Prions, infectious proteins that lack nucleic acid, can cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Most cases are marked by rapidly progressive dementia and startle myoclonus. Histopathology typically reveals brain atrophy, spongiform vacuoles, and the accumulation of prions in neuronal tissue.\n\n(Choice C) Herpes simplex virus is a neurotrophic, double-stranded DNA virus that can spread through the olfactory tract to the olfactory cortex in the temporal lobe of the brain. Patients usually develop acute fever, headache, confusion, and focal neurologic issues. Histopathology typically reveals hemorrhagic inflammation with an infiltration of mononuclear cells.\n\n(Choice D) Toxoplasma gondii is a feline parasite that can cause encephalitis in patients with untreated AIDS. Manifestations include headache, confusion, fever, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits. However, histopathology would reveal T gondii cysts, not encapsulated yeasts.\n\nEducational objective: Cryptococcus neoformans is a round/oval yeast with a thick polysaccharide capsule. It is a common cause of meningoencephalitis (eg, headache, vomiting, confusion, seizure) in patients with untreated AIDS. The yeast can frequently be visualized in the cerebrospinal fluid by India ink or silver stain. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",

    "en": "This question tests the recognition of Cryptococcus neoformans as a cause of meningoencephalitis in an immunocompromised patient, based on clinical presentation and histopathological findings. It assesses knowledge of the characteristic morphology of the yeast and its association with AIDS.\n\nTo solve this question, one must correlate the patient's symptoms (headache, vomiting, confusion, seizure, papilledema, neck rigidity) with the autopsy findings (yeast with a thick capsule). This pattern strongly suggests a fungal infection, specifically Cryptococcus, in an immunocompromised host. The options provided require differentiating between various pathogens based on their cellular components and typical clinical presentations.",
