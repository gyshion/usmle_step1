    "en": "This patient in diabetic ketoacidosis is experiencing increased triglyceride breakdown in adipose tissue due to her insulin deficiency. Triglycerides stored in adipose tissue are metabolized to free fatty acids and glycerol by hormone-sensitive lipase in response to low insulin and high catecholamine levels. Adipocytes are unable to metabolize glycerol, so it is secreted into the circulation and transported to the liver, where it is phosphorylated to glycerol-3-phosphate by glycerol kinase. Glycerol-3-phosphate is subsequently converted by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which can be used to produce glucose through gluconeogenesis.\n(Choice A) Acetyl CoA carboxylase is a biotin-dependent enzyme present in both liver and adipose tissues. It catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid synthesis, the conversion of acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA.\n(Choice B) Fatty acids must first be activated by acyl CoA synthetase in the cytoplasm in order to undergo beta-oxidation in mitochondria. Although beta-oxidation of fatty acids is increased in diabetic ketoacidosis, the resulting acetyl-CoA is used for energy and ketone body formation (not glucose production).\n(Choice C) In contrast to fatty acid oxidation, which occurs in mitochondria, fatty acid synthesis occurs in the cytosol. Acetyl CoA generated in mitochondria during glycolysis is transferred to the cytosol as citrate. In the cytoplasm, ATP citrate lyase converts citrate back into acetyl CoA that can be used for fatty acid chain elongation.\n(Choice D) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is the first enzyme of the hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt. The HMP shunt produces pentose sugars for nucleotide synthesis and NADPH, which is necessary for cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis.",
    "zh": "这名糖尿病酮症酸中毒患者由于胰岛素缺乏，脂肪组织中甘油三酯的分解增加。储存在脂肪组织中的甘油三酯被激素敏感性脂肪酶代谢为游离脂肪酸和甘油，以响应低胰岛素和高儿茶酚胺水平。脂肪细胞无法代谢甘油，因此它被分泌到循环中并转运到肝脏，在那里甘油激酶将其磷酸化为甘油-3-磷酸。甘油-3-磷酸随后被甘油-3-磷酸脱氢酶转化为二羟基丙酮磷酸 (DHAP)，后者可用于通过糖异生生成葡萄糖。\n(选项 A) 乙酰辅酶 A 羧化酶是一种存在于肝脏和脂肪组织中的生物素依赖性酶。它催化脂肪酸合成的第一个定向步骤，即乙酰辅酶 A 转化为丙二酰辅酶 A。\n(选项 B) 脂肪酸必须首先被酰基辅酶 A 合成酶在细胞质中激活，才能在 mitocondria 中进行β-氧化。虽然糖尿病酮症酸中毒时脂肪酸的 β-氧化增加，但产生的乙酰辅酶 A 用于能量和酮体形成（而不是葡萄糖产生）。\n(选项 C) 与发生在线粒体中的脂肪酸氧化相反，脂肪酸合成发生在胞质溶胶中。在糖酵解过程中在线粒体中产生的乙酰辅酶 A 被转移到胞质溶胶中作为柠檬酸盐。在细胞质中，ATP 柠檬酸裂解酶将柠檬酸盐转化为乙酰辅酶 A，后者可用于脂肪酸链的延伸。\n(选项 D) 葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶是己糖单磷酸 (HMP) 分流途径的第一个酶。HMP 分流途径产生用于核苷酸合成的戊糖和 NADPH，NADPH 是胆固醇和脂肪酸生物合成所必需的。"
