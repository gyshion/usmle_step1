    "en": "A 68-year-old man comes to the office due to exertional shortness of breath and fatigue, which have progressed over the past year. The patient has a history of hypertension, but medical history is otherwise unremarkable. He is a lifetime nonsmoker. His father died of a \"heart attack\" at age 70. Blood pressure is 144/74 mm Hg, and pulse is 72/min and regular. Cardiac auscultation reveals a 3/6 ejection-type, late-peaking systolic murmur and a barely audible S2. The murmur diminishes in intensity during the straining phase of the Valsalva maneuver. Which of the following processes underlies this patient's current condition? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient's soft S2 and late-peaking systolic ejection murmur that decreases in intensity with maneuvers that decrease left ventricular blood volume (eg, abrupt standing, Valsalva straining phase) are consistent with aortic stenosis, which most commonly occurs due to age-related calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). The early pathogenesis of CAVD is analogous to that of arterial atherosclerosis. The endothelium lining the aortic side of the aortic valve cusps is exposed to the same high pressure and turbulent blood flow as the aortic vascular endothelium. As occurs with atheroma development in the vascular endothelium, these mechanical forces (along with smoking, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia) over time cause damage to the aortic valve cusp endothelium, triggering endothelial dysfunction and the onset of a similar atherosclerotic process. There is subendothelial lipid deposition and infiltration of inflammatory cells (ie, macrophages, T lymphocytes) followed by the release of inflammatory mediators (eg, interleukin-1-beta, transforming growth factor beta-1). Subsequently, there is increased production of proteins involved in tissue calcification (eg, osteopontin). Fibroblasts differentiate into osteoblast-like cells, leading to aberrant bone matrix deposition with progressive valvular calcification and stenosis. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and disarray with asymmetric septal thickening occurs in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As with aortic stenosis, patients have a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur; however, the murmur increases (rather than decreases) in intensity with maneuvers that reduce left ventricular blood volume.\n\n(Choice C) Myxomatous valve thickening and elastin fragmentation is typically seen in mitral valve prolapse. Patients have a nonejection systolic click and a mid-to-late systolic murmur that occurs earlier in systole with decreases in left ventricular blood volume.\n\n(Choice D) Subendocardial granulomatous lesions with fibrinoid necrosis and subsequent fibrosis are seen in patients with rheumatic heart disease. Patients with rheumatic aortic stenosis typically have mitral valve involvement as well, which would be evidenced by a murmur of mitral stenosis or regurgitation.\n\n(Choice E) Inflammation of valvular endothelium with deposition of sterile platelet thrombi is seen in nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (also known as marantic, verrucous, or Libman-Sacks endocarditis). The mitral or aortic valve is typically involved, usually leading to regurgitation rather than stenosis. {{exhibit_3}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis, specifically the process of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) and its similarity to atherosclerosis. It requires understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in valve calcification and stenosis.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the clinical presentation of aortic stenosis (ejection murmur, soft S2) and then focus on the underlying pathological processes. Eliminate options that describe other valvular or cardiac conditions. Focus on the mechanism of CAVD involving endothelial dysfunction, lipid deposition, inflammation, and osteoblast-like cell differentiation.",
