    "en": "A 15-year-old boy is brought to the clinic due to poor exercise endurance. He recently began weight lifting with friends but has had difficulty performing the exercises. The patient states that his arms \"feel like jelly after just a few repetitions.\" He also has severe muscle cramping and has noticed occasional urine discoloration after training sessions. Further evaluation reveals that the patient's exercise tolerance can be greatly improved by drinking an oral glucose solution before beginning a strenuous activity. Vital signs are normal, and examination is unremarkable. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient most likely has McArdle disease (GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE TYPE V). This condition is caused by a deficiency of MYOPHOSPHORYLASE, an isoenzyme of glycogen phosphorylase present in muscle tissue. This enzyme catalyzes conversion A: the breakdown of MUSCLE GLYCOGEN to GLUCOSE-1-PHOSPHATE, the initial step in glycogenolysis. \n\nDeficiency leads to decreased breakdown of glycogen during exercise, as muscle cells cannot access their primary stored energy source. This results in POOR EXERCISE TOLERANCE, severe muscle cramps, and RHABDOMYOLYSIS (muscle breakdown), which causes myoglobinuria (eg, red urine due to myoglobin in the urine). The patient's symptoms (difficulty lifting, 'jelly' arms, muscle cramping, and urine discoloration after training) are classic for McArdle disease. The improvement in exercise tolerance after consuming oral glucose solution before exercise provides a readily available energy source (blood glucose) that bypasses the defective glycogenolysis pathway, further confirming the diagnosis.\n\n(Choice B) Glucose-1-phosphate is converted to glucose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase. Phosphoglucomutase deficiency is extremely rare and presents with generalized muscle weakness and fasting hypoglycemia, a different clinical picture than exercise intolerance and rhabdomyolysis.\n\n(Choice C) Glucose-6-phosphate is converted to 6-phosphogluconate through a series of reactions in the PENTOSE PHOSPHATE PATHWAY, catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconolactonase. A deficiency in this pathway, such as GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE (G6PD) DEFICIENCY, leads to inadequate levels of reduced glutathione, which is critical for protecting red blood cells from oxidative injury, resulting in chronic HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, not exercise-induced muscle symptoms.\n\n(Choice D) Glucose-6-phosphate is converted to fructose-6-phosphate by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase during glycolysis. A deficiency here would severely disrupt GLYCOLYSIS, affecting all cells that rely on it as their energy source (eg, red blood cells). Patients would typically have chronic HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA and other systemic metabolic issues, not isolated exercise intolerance.\n\n(Choice E) Within the liver and kidney, glucose-6-phosphatase converts glucose-6-phosphate to glucose. A deficiency in this enzyme leads to GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE TYPE I (von Gierke disease), presenting with severe FASTING HYPOGLYCEMIA, hepatomegaly, lactic acidosis, and hyperuricemia typically in infancy, which is distinct from the patient's presentation.\n\nEducational objective: Myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease, or glycogen storage disease type V) causes failure of muscle glycogenolysis, resulting in decreased exercise tolerance, muscle pain, cramping, and MYOGLOBINURIA shortly after initiating physical activity. The condition is often ameliorated by consuming simple sugars before physical activity.",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有麦卡德尔病（糖原贮积病V型）。这种病症是由肌磷酸化酶缺乏引起的，肌磷酸化酶是存在于肌肉组织中的糖原磷酸化酶的同工酶。该酶催化转化A：将肌肉糖原分解成葡萄糖-1-磷酸，这是糖原分解的初始步骤。\n\n缺乏会导致运动期间糖原分解减少，因为肌细胞无法获得其主要的储存能量来源。这导致运动耐力差、严重的肌肉痉挛和横纹肌溶解（肌肉分解），引起肌红蛋白尿（例如，由于尿中肌红蛋白导致的尿液变红）。患者的症状（举重困难，手臂“像果冻”，肌肉痉挛和训练后尿液变色）是麦卡德尔病的典型表现。在运动前摄入口服葡萄糖溶液后运动耐力的改善提供了容易获得的能量来源（血糖），绕过了有缺陷的糖原分解途径，进一步证实了诊断。\n\n(选项B) 磷酸葡萄糖变位酶将葡萄糖-1-磷酸转化为葡萄糖-6-磷酸。磷酸葡萄糖变位酶缺乏症极为罕见，表现为全身无力和空腹低血糖，这与运动不耐受和横纹肌溶解的临床表现不同。\n\n(选项C) 葡萄糖-6-磷酸通过磷酸戊糖途径中的一系列反应转化为6-磷酸葡萄糖酸内酯，该途径由葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶和6-磷酸葡萄糖酸内酯酶催化。该途径的缺陷，如葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶（G6PD）缺乏症，会导致还原型谷胱甘肽水平不足，而还原型谷胱甘肽对于保护红细胞免受氧化损伤至关重要，导致慢性溶血性贫血，而不是运动引起的肌肉症状。\n\n(选项D) 在糖酵解过程中，葡萄糖-6-磷酸通过葡萄糖-6-磷酸异构酶转化为果糖-6-磷酸。这里的缺乏会严重破坏糖酵解，影响所有依赖其作为能量来源的细胞（例如红细胞）。患者通常会患有慢性溶血性贫血和其他全身性代谢问题，而不是孤立的运动不耐受。\n\n(选项E) 在肝脏和肾脏中，葡萄糖-6-磷酸酶将葡萄糖-6-磷酸转化为葡萄糖。这种酶的缺乏会导致糖原贮积病I型（von Gierke病），表现为严重的空腹低血糖、肝肿大、乳酸酸中毒和高尿酸血症，通常发生在婴儿期，这与患者的临床表现不同。\n\n教育目标：肌磷酸化酶缺乏症（麦卡德尔病，或糖原贮积病V型）导致肌肉糖原分解失败，导致运动耐力下降、肌肉疼痛、痉挛和肌红蛋白尿，这些症状在开始体力活动后不久出现。在体力活动前摄入单糖通常可以改善病情。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of glycogen storage diseases, specifically McArdle disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type V), and its associated enzyme deficiency, myophosphorylase. It assesses the ability to link a classic clinical presentation of exercise intolerance, muscle cramps, and rhabdomyolysis to a specific defect in muscle glycogenolysis.\nTo solve this, first identify the key clinical features: exercise-induced muscle pain and weakness, with myoglobinuria, and improvement with oral glucose. Then, use the provided biochemical pathway diagram to pinpoint the enzyme deficiency responsible for the inability to break down muscle glycogen for energy during physical activity.",
