    "en": "This child with a solid posterior fossa mass has biopsy findings consistent with medulloblastoma. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nMedulloblastoma is one of the most common pediatric brain tumors and arises in the cerebellum from primitive neuroectodermal tissue. Patients often present with CEREBELLAR dysfunction (eg, loss of balance, incoordination) and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (eg, early morning headache, vomiting); given the proximity to the fourth ventricle, medulloblastoma can also cause obstructive hydrocephalus.\n\nHistopathologic examination reveals an embryonal tumor composed of sheets of small cells with round, hyperchromatic basophilic (ie, blue) nuclei and minimal cytoplasm. The cells may be arranged around a central core of neuronal processes (ie, neuropil), forming Homer-Wright rosettes. Numerous mitotic figures are often present. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}}\n\n(Choice A) Adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas are benign, suprasellar epithelial tumors that emerge from remnants of the Rathke pouch (ie, embryonic anterior pituitary gland). Microscopic examination reveals cords or nests of palisading (ie, showing parallel alignment) squamous epithelium with wet-appearing keratin.\n\n(Choice B) Ependymomas arise from the ependymal lining of the ventricles and typically grow into the ventricular system. Histopathologic findings in ependymomas, in contrast to medulloblastomas, often include ependymal cells arranged around a central blood vessel, forming a perivascular pseudorosette.\n\n(Choice C) Glioblastomas are the most common primary adult brain tumor and typically occur in the cerebral hemispheres. Histopathologic examination often shows hypercellular areas of atypical astrocytes bordering regions of necrosis (ie, pseudopalisading). Microvascular proliferation is also commonly present.\n\n(Choice E) Meningiomas are extraaxial tumors that arise from the dura. Histopathologic examination often shows tumor cells forming a whorled pattern, which can calcify into round lamellar structures (ie. psammoma bodies).\n\n(Choice F) Oligodendrogliomas are often located in the frontal lobe and are composed of uniform cells with round nuclei and clear perinuclear halos (\"fried egg\" appearance). Anastomosing capillaries arranged in a chicken-wire pattern may surround these cells.\n\n(Choice G) Pilocytic astrocytomas also develop in the cerebellum but typically have a cystic appearance. Microscopic examination reveals bipolar cells with hair-like projections, and eosinophilic fibers with a corkscrew appearance (ie, Rosenthal fibers) are typically present.\n\nEducational objective:\nMedulloblastoma is one of the most common primary pediatric brain tumors and arises within the cerebellum. Histopathologic examination typically shows sheets of small, round, blue tumor cells along with numerous mitotic figures and Homer-Wright rosettes.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pediatric brain tumors, specifically medulloblastoma, including its clinical presentation, location, and characteristic histopathological findings. It requires differentiating medulloblastoma from other common pediatric brain tumors based on clinical and pathological features.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the combination of a posterior fossa mass in a child, cerebellar dysfunction, and the presence of small blue cells with Homer-Wright rosettes on biopsy. This combination is highly suggestive of medulloblastoma. Ruling out other tumors based on location, age group, and histological features is also crucial.",
