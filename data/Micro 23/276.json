    "en": "A phase II trial is being conducted at an academic medical center to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel antifungal medication that has yielded promising results in preclinical studies. The medication is known to inhibit fungal colony growth by changing the composition of the fungal cell membrane. Phase 0 and phase I trials on healthy volunteers have been uneventful. The current phase II trial includes 175 subjects. In 168 subjects, the new antifungal agent is found to inhibit liver cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism of several drugs. Based on these data, the new antifungal agent is most similar to which of the following?",

    "en": "Azoles are antifungal medications that inhibit the demethylation of lanosterol into ergosterol in fungal cells. They exert their antifungal effects by suppressing synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane. However, azoles also inhibit the activity of the human P450 cytochrome oxidase system. This property leads to multiple drug-drug interactions.\n\nAll azoles (eg, ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole) increase the serum concentrations of drugs metabolized by liver P450 enzymes. This means that, when used concomitantly with azoles, drugs metabolized by the liver P450 system may have increased toxicity. For this reason, medications such as warfarin, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and oral hypoglycemics should be avoided (or have their use carefully monitored) in patients who are receiving azole therapy.\n\nCytochrome oxidase inducers (eg, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) increase azole metabolism, thereby lowering azole concentration in serum.\n\n(Choice A) Amphotericin B is a polyene antifungal that binds ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, leading to pore formation and cell lysis.\n\n(Choice B) 1,3-beta-D-glucan is a major polysaccharide component of the fungal cell wall. Caspofungin and the other echinocandin antifungals block glucan synthesis.\n\n(Choice C) Flucytosine inhibits the synthesis of both DNA (replication) and RNA (protein synthesis) in fungal cells. It is mainly used as a synergistic agent with amphotericin B. This drug combination is particularly important in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis.\n\n(Choice D) Griseofulvin, a P450 inducer, enters fungal cells and binds microtubules, inhibiting mitosis.\n\nEducational objective:\nAzoles inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol by the fungal cytochrome P450 enzymes. They also suppress the human P450 system, resulting in many drug-drug interactions.",
    "zh": "唑类药物是抗真菌药物，可抑制真菌细胞中羊毛甾醇脱甲基化为麦角甾醇。它们通过抑制麦角甾醇（真菌细胞膜的重要组成部分）的合成来发挥抗真菌作用。然而，唑类药物也会抑制人类P450细胞色素氧化酶系统的活性。此特性导致多种药物相互作用。\n\n所有唑类药物（如酮康唑、氟康唑、伊曲康唑、伏立康唑）都会增加肝脏P450酶代谢的药物的血清浓度。这意味着，当与唑类药物同时使用时，被肝脏P450系统代谢的药物可能会增加毒性。因此，在接受唑类药物治疗的患者中，应避免使用（或仔细监测）华法林、环孢素、他克莫司和口服降血糖药等药物。\n\n细胞色素氧化酶诱导剂（如利福平、苯妥英、卡马西平、苯巴比妥）会增加唑类药物的代谢，从而降低血清中唑类药物的浓度。\n\n(选项A) 两性霉素B是一种多烯类抗真菌药，可与真菌细胞膜中的麦角甾醇结合，导致孔形成和细胞溶解。\n\n(选项B) 1,3-β-D-葡聚糖是真菌细胞壁的主要多糖成分。卡泊芬净和其他棘白菌素类抗真菌药可阻断葡聚糖的合成。\n\n(选项C) 氟胞嘧啶抑制真菌细胞中DNA（复制）和RNA（蛋白质合成）的合成。它主要用作两性霉素B的协同剂。这种药物组合在治疗隐球菌性脑膜炎中尤为重要。\n\n(选项D) 灰黄霉素是一种P450诱导剂，进入真菌细胞并与微管结合，抑制有丝分裂。\n\n教育目标：\n唑类药物抑制真菌细胞色素P450酶对麦角甾醇的合成。它们还会抑制人类P450系统，从而导致许多药物相互作用。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of antifungal medications and their mechanisms of action, specifically focusing on the drug interactions associated with azole antifungals due to their inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the clinical vignette describes a drug that inhibits liver cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism. Recall that azole antifungals are known for this property, leading to significant drug interactions.",
    "zh": "此题考察对抗菌药物及其作用机制的了解，特别是侧重于唑类抗真菌药相关的药物相互作用，因为它们会抑制细胞色素P450酶系统。\n\n要解决此题，需要认识到临床病例文本描述了一种抑制肝细胞色素P450依赖性代谢的药物。回想一下，唑类抗真菌药以这种特性而闻名，从而导致显著的药物相互作用。"
