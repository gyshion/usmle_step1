    "en": "This patient's euphoric mood, decreased need for sleep, hyperactivity, grandiosity, and pressured speech lasting more than a week are characteristic of an acute manic episode of BIPOLAR DISORDER. Bipolar disorder is a highly recurrent illness requiring MAINTENANCE TREATMENT with MOOD-STABILIZING MEDICATIONS to decrease the risk of recurrent mood episodes. Preferred medications for bipolar maintenance treatment include lithium, the anticonvulsants VALPROATE and lamotrigine, and the second-generation antipsychotic quetiapine.\n\n(Choices A and E) Bupropion, a norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, are antidepressants that have the potential to precipitate manic episodes. Antidepressant monotherapy should be avoided in bipolar maintenance treatment due to the risk of mood destabilization.\n\n(Choices B and C) Chlorpromazine and haloperidol are first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) used in the treatment of schizophrenia. FGAs may be used in combination with lithium or valproate for treatment of severe mania, but are not used as monotherapy for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.\n\n(Choice D) Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be used as an adjunct to mood stabilizers in the treatment of acute mania; it is not recommended for maintenance treatment.\n\nEducational objective: The anticonvulsant valproate has mood-stabilizing properties and is an effective maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder. Other maintenance options for bipolar disorder include lithium, lamotrigine, and quetiapine.",
    "zh": "该患者的欣快情绪、睡眠需求减少、活动过度、夸大妄想和语速过快持续超过一周，是双相情感障碍急性躁狂发作的特征。双相情感障碍是一种高度复发的疾病，需要使用情绪稳定药物进行维持治疗以降低复发性情绪发作的风险。双相情感障碍维持治疗的首选药物包括锂盐、抗惊厥药丙戊酸盐和拉莫三嗪，以及第二代抗精神病药喹硫平。\n\n（选项 A 和 E）安非他酮（去甲肾上腺素多巴胺再摄取抑制剂）和帕罗西汀（选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂）是抗抑郁药，有可能诱发躁狂发作。由于存在情绪不稳定的风险，在双相情感障碍维持治疗中应避免单独使用抗抑郁药。\n\n（选项 B 和 C）氯丙嗪和氟哌啶醇是用于治疗精神分裂症的第一代抗精神病药（FGAs）。FGAs 可与锂盐或丙戊酸盐联合用于治疗严重躁狂，但不能作为单药用于双相情感障碍的维持治疗。\n\n（选项 D）劳拉西泮是一种苯二氮卓类药物，可用作情绪稳定剂的辅助药物，用于治疗急性躁狂；不建议用于维持治疗。\n\n教育目标：抗惊厥药丙戊酸盐具有情绪稳定特性，是治疗双相情感障碍的有效维持治疗方法。双相情感障碍的其他维持治疗选择包括锂盐、拉莫三嗪和喹硫平。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pharmacological management of bipolar disorder, specifically the long-term maintenance treatment for manic episodes. It requires differentiating between acute manic symptoms and the need for mood stabilization versus treatments for depression or psychosis.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the classic signs and symptoms of a manic episode, understanding that bipolar disorder requires long-term mood stabilization, and then evaluating the provided medication options based on their indications and contraindications in the context of bipolar maintenance therapy.",
