    "en": "This patient with ST elevations in leads I and aVL most likely has an acute lateral myocardial infarction (MI) due to occlusion of the left circumflex artery. ECGs are useful in the diagnosis of MI and may help localize the area of infarction. ST elevations typically represent acute MI, whereas prominent Q waves are suggestive of old MI.\n\nLeads I and aVL correspond to the lateral limb leads on ECG; therefore, ST elevation or Q waves in these leads are indicative of infarction involving the lateral aspect of the left ventricle. Because the chest leads V5-V6 are also laterally placed, they may also show ST elevation during a lateral infarction. The lateral aspect of the left ventricle is supplied by the left circumflex artery, which originates from the left main coronary artery. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choices A and D) The left anterior descending artery (LAD) primarily supplies the anterior aspect of the left ventricle and interventricular septum (septal branches), which corresponds to the anterior chest leads (V1-V4). Proximal occlusion of the LAD may involve all of these leads; however, distal LAD occlusion typically spares the septal leads (V1-V2).\n\n(Choice C) The left main coronary artery gives rise to the LAD and left circumflex arteries. Therefore, left main coronary artery occlusion typically results in anterolateral infarction, which corresponds to ST elevation in the anterior (eg, V1-V4) and lateral (V5-V6, I, and aVL) leads.\n\n(Choice E) The right coronary artery typically supplies the right ventricle and inferior aspect of the left ventricle. Occlusion of this vessel therefore results in inferior MI, which corresponds to ST elevation in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF). {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者在导联I和aVL中出现ST段抬高，最有可能由于左旋支动脉闭塞而导致急性侧壁心肌梗死（MI）。心电图在MI的诊断中很有用，并且可能有助于定位梗死区域。ST段抬高通常代表急性MI，而明显的Q波提示陈旧性MI。\n\n导联I和aVL对应于心电图上的侧肢导联；因此，这些导联中的ST段抬高或Q波表明涉及左心室侧壁的梗死。由于胸前导联V5-V6也位于侧壁，它们在侧壁梗死期间也可能显示ST段抬高。左心室的侧壁由左旋支动脉供应，左旋支动脉起源于左主冠状动脉。 {{exhibit_2}}\n\n（选项A和D）左前降支动脉（LAD）主要供应左心室前壁和室间隔（间隔支），这对应于前胸导联（V1-V4）。LAD近端闭塞可能涉及所有这些导联；然而，LAD远端闭塞通常会保留间隔导联（V1-V2）。\n\n（选项C）左主冠状动脉产生LAD和左旋支动脉。因此，左主冠状动脉闭塞通常导致前外侧梗死，这对应于前壁（例如，V1-V4）和侧壁（V5-V6、I和aVL）导联中的ST段抬高。\n\n（选项E）右冠状动脉通常供应右心室和左心室下壁。因此，该血管的闭塞导致下壁MI，这对应于下壁导联（II、III和aVF）中的ST段抬高。 {{exhibit_3}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of ECG interpretation in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, specifically identifying the culprit artery based on ST elevation in specific leads. The key is to recognize the correlation between ECG leads and the corresponding cardiac anatomy supplied by different coronary arteries.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the leads with ST elevation (I and aVL), recognize that these are lateral leads, and recall that the lateral aspect of the left ventricle is supplied by the left circumflex artery. Rule out other options based on their corresponding ECG lead territories.",
