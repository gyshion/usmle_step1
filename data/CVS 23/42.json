    "en": "The major early biochemical consequence of total myocardial ischemia is cessation of aerobic glycolysis and initiation of anaerobic glycolysis. This transition occurs within seconds and results in inadequate production of high-energy phosphates (eg, ATP and creatine phosphate) and the accumulation of deleterious metabolites, including lactate. Although total ATP levels remain relatively normal during the first few minutes of ischemia, ATP is rapidly depleted from areas of the cell with high metabolic demand, such as the cytosol surrounding the contraction fibers and electrolyte transport pumps. The depletion of ATP in critical cellular areas and the accumulation of toxins result in loss of contractility within about 60 seconds of total myocardial ischemia (Choice A).\n\nAs ischemia persists, ATP levels within the affected cardiac myocytes continue to fall while lactate levels continue to rise. When ischemia lasts less than 30 minutes, loss of contractile function is reversible. However, on restoration of blood flow, full myocardial contractility is not immediately restored. Instead, there is prolonged dysfunction of the myocardium (myocardial stunning), with contractility gradually returning to normal over the next several hours to days. Increasing durations of ischemia prolong the time that the myocardium remains stunned.\n\nUnder hypoxic conditions, ATP within cardiomyocytes is degraded to ADP, AMP, and eventually adenosine. Adenosine is able to cross the cell membrane and function as a vasodilator when coronary blood flow is insufficient to meet myocardial demand. However, persistent ischemia can lead to depletion of massive amounts of adenosine. After 30 minutes of total myocardial ischemia, about half of the cellular adenine stores are lost. At this point, failure of cellular homeostasis is inevitable and ischemic injury becomes irreversible (Choice E).\n\nEducational objective:\nLoss of cardiomyocyte contractility occurs within 60 seconds after the onset of total ischemia. When ischemia lasts less than 30 minutes, restoration of blood flow leads to reversible contractile dysfunction (myocardial stunning), with contractility gradually returning to normal over the next several hours to days. However, after about 30 minutes of total ischemia, ischemic injury becomes irreversible. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "完全心肌缺血的主要早期生化后果是需氧糖酵解停止，无氧糖酵解开始。这种转变在几秒钟内发生，导致高能磷酸盐（例如，ATP 和磷酸肌酸）的产生不足，以及有害代谢物（包括乳酸）的积累。尽管在缺血的最初几分钟内，总 ATP 水平保持相对正常，但 ATP 会迅速从细胞中代谢需求高的区域耗尽，例如围绕收缩纤维和电解质转运泵的胞质溶胶。ATP 在关键细胞区域的耗竭和毒素的积累导致在完全心肌缺血的约 60 秒内丧失收缩力（选项 A）。\n\n随着缺血的持续，受影响的心肌细胞内的 ATP 水平持续下降，而乳酸水平持续上升。当缺血持续时间少于 30 分钟时，收缩功能丧失是可逆的。然而，在恢复血流后，心肌的完全收缩力并不能立即恢复。相反，心肌会出现长时间的功能障碍（心肌顿抑），收缩力在接下来的几个小时到几天内逐渐恢复正常。缺血时间的增加延长了心肌保持顿抑的时间。\n\n在缺氧条件下，心肌细胞内的 ATP 会降解为 ADP、AMP，最终变为腺苷。当冠状动脉血流不足以满足心肌需求时，腺苷能够穿过细胞膜并充当血管扩张剂。然而，持续的缺血会导致大量腺苷的耗竭。在完全心肌缺血 30 分钟后，大约一半的细胞腺嘌呤储存会丢失。此时，细胞内稳态的失败是不可避免的，缺血性损伤变得不可逆转（选项 E）。\n\n教育目标：\n心肌细胞收缩力丧失发生在完全缺血开始后的 60 秒内。当缺血持续时间少于 30 分钟时，恢复血流会导致可逆的收缩功能障碍（心肌顿抑），收缩力在接下来的几个小时到几天内逐渐恢复正常。然而，在完全缺血约 30 分钟后，缺血性损伤变得不可逆转。 {{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the biochemical changes that occur in cardiomyocytes during ischemia, specifically the rapid depletion of ATP and its effect on contractility. It also touches on the concepts of myocardial stunning and irreversible ischemic injury.\n\nTo answer this question, one must recall that loss of contractility occurs rapidly (within 60 seconds) after the onset of total ischemia due to ATP depletion. Therefore, the correct answer corresponds to the point on the graph closest to the beginning of the ATP decline.",
