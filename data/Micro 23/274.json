    "en": "A 54-year-old man comes to the hospital due to 4 days of progressive nasal congestion, facial pain, swelling, and fever. The patient has taken over-the-counter decongestants, which provided no relief. He has a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus due to dietary and medication noncompliance. The patient's temperature is 38.3 C (101 F). Examination shows right facial swelling and purulent nasal discharge with necrotic destruction of the nasal mucosa and turbinates. The diagnosis of invasive mucormycosis is made, and surgical debridement is performed. He is started on an antifungal agent that binds to ergosterol and alters cell membrane permeability. Considering the adverse effects of this medication, which of the following should be routinely monitored in this patient?",

    "en": "Mucormycosis should generally be treated with antifungal therapy and surgical debridement. Amphotericin B is the initial drug of choice. It binds ergosterol in fungal cell membranes to form holes. Resultant changes in membrane permeability lead to cell death. Renal toxicity is the most notorious side effect of amphotericin B. The drug causes renal vasoconstriction and a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate. It may also act as a direct toxin on renal epithelial cells, leading to acute tubular necrosis, renal tubular acidosis, and electrolyte disturbances. Severe hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia (likely reflecting increased distal tubular membrane permeability) can occur, with most patients requiring supplementation. Renal injury may also lead to decreased erythropoietin production and produce a normochromic normocytic anemia.\n\nPatients with mucormycosis who respond to initial amphotericin therapy may be switched to posaconazole. Liver function test monitoring is recommended in patients taking azoles.\n\n(Choice A) Examples of drugs that can cause isolated thrombocytopenia include heparin. beta-lactam antibiotics, and vancomycin.\n\n(Choice B) Bisphosphonates (used for osteoporosis) affect bone metabolism and can cause hypocalcemia. Foscarnet (used for treating ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus infections) also causes hypocalcemia.\n\n(Choice C) Daptomycin can induce rhabdomyolysis, leading to elevated creatine phosphokinase.\n\n(Choice E) TSH monitoring is recommended for patients taking amiodarone (used for treating arrhythmias) or lithium (used for treating bipolar disorder).\n\nEducational objective:\nAmphotericin B is a polyene antifungal drug notorious for its renal toxicity. Severe hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia are commonly seen during therapy and often require daily supplementation.",
    "zh": "毛霉菌病通常应采用抗真菌治疗和外科清创术。两性霉素B是首选药物。它结合真菌细胞膜中的麦角固醇形成孔洞。由此导致的膜通透性变化导致细胞死亡。肾毒性是两性霉素B最恶名昭著的副作用。该药物引起肾血管收缩和肾小球滤过率降低。它也可能直接作用于肾小管上皮细胞，导致急性肾小管坏死、肾小管酸中毒和电解质紊乱。可能发生严重的低钾血症和低镁血症（可能反映远端肾小管膜通透性增加），大多数患者需要补充。肾损伤还可能导致促红细胞生成素生成减少，并产生正色素性正细胞性贫血。\n\n对初始两性霉素治疗有反应的毛霉菌病患者可以换用泊沙康唑。建议服用唑类药物的患者监测肝功能。\n\n(选项A) 可引起血小板减少症的药物包括肝素、β-内酰胺类抗生素和万古霉素。\n\n(选项B) 双膦酸盐（用于骨质疏松症）会影响骨代谢并可能导致低钙血症。福司卡奈（用于治疗对更昔洛韦耐药的巨细胞病毒感染）也会导致低钙血症。\n\n(选项C) 达托霉素可诱发横纹肌溶解症，导致磷酸肌酸激酶升高。\n\n(选项E) 建议服用胺碘酮（用于治疗心律失常）或锂（用于治疗双相情感障碍）的患者进行TSH监测。\n\n教育目标：\n两性霉素B是一种以肾毒性著称的聚烯类抗真菌药物。在治疗期间常可见严重的低钾血症和低镁血症，并且通常需要每日补充。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the adverse effects of amphotericin B, a common antifungal medication used to treat serious infections like mucormycosis. Specifically, it focuses on the electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, that can occur due to its renal toxicity.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that amphotericin B is known for causing renal toxicity, which can lead to electrolyte disturbances. Remember that hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia are common side effects that require monitoring and supplementation during amphotericin B therapy.",
