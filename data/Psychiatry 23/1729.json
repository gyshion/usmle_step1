    "en": "A 25-year-old graduate student with a history of recurrent ear infections as a child feels anxious and sweats when she is in the examination room with her primary care physician. She recently got a roommate, a nursing student, who leaves her stethoscope on the coffee table after returning from class. The patient sweats and feels her heart start to race whenever she sees the stethoscope. This patient's response to her roommate's stethoscope is an example of which of the following phenomena?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's response to her roommate's stethoscope is an example of CLASSICAL CONDITIONING. Childhood encounters with her primary care physician for ear infections (UNCONDITIONED STIMULUS) caused ANXIETY (an automatic reaction called an UNCONDITIONED RESPONSE), resulting in subsequent health care visits. The encounters with her physician are most likely associated with the presence of a STETHOSCOPE (the CONDITIONED STIMULUS). Repeated pairing of the unconditioned stimulus (eg, physician encounter) with the conditioned stimulus (eg, stethoscope) allows the conditioned stimulus alone to elicit a learned, CONDITIONED RESPONSE (eg, sweating).\n\nClassical conditioning provides one explanation for \"white coat hypertension,\" a condition in which a physician's white coat or examination room acts as a conditioned stimulus, causing anxiety and transient blood pressure elevation during health care visits.\n\n(Choices B, C, and D) In OPERANT CONDITIONING, rewards and punishments are used to reinforce behavior. Negative punishment is the removal of a reward to decrease a behavior (eg, a teenager's driving privileges are taken away after returning home past curfew). With negative reinforcement, desired behavior is strengthened through the removal of a negative outcome (eg, suffering a bad sunburn promotes application of sunscreen to prevent future sunburns).\n\n(Choice E) Reaction formation is the unconscious transformation of an unacceptable impulse or emotion into its opposite (eg, if this patient tells her physician she enjoys clinic visits and acts extremely relaxed during the examination to defend against underlying anxiety).\n\n(Choice F) Regression is a defense mechanism that involves unconsciously reverting to a less mature way of coping with difficulties (eg, if this patient starts sleeping with a stuffed animal to manage anxiety about an upcoming appointment).\n\nEducational objective:\nClassical conditioning involves a neutral stimulus being repeatedly paired with a non-neutral stimulus that elicits a reflexive, unconditioned response. Over time, the formerly neutral stimulus is able to evoke a conditioned response by itself in absence of the non-neutral stimulus.",
    "zh": "该患者对她室友的听诊器的反应是经典条件反射的一个例子。童年时期因耳部感染去看初级保健医生（非条件刺激）引起焦虑（一种被称为非条件反应的自动反应），导致了随后的医疗保健就诊。与医生的会面很可能与听诊器（条件刺激）的存在有关。非条件刺激（例如，与医生的会面）与条件刺激（例如，听诊器）的重复配对，使单独的条件刺激能够引起习得的条件反应（例如，出汗）。\n\n经典条件反射为“白大褂高血压”提供了一种解释，在这种情况下，医生的白大褂或检查室充当条件刺激，在医疗保健就诊期间引起焦虑和短暂的血压升高。\n\n（选项 B、C 和 D）在操作性条件反射中，使用奖励和惩罚来强化行为。负性惩罚是移除奖励以减少行为（例如，一个青少年在超过宵禁时间回家后被剥夺了驾驶特权）。通过负性强化，通过消除负面结果来加强期望的行为（例如，遭受严重的晒伤促使涂抹防晒霜以防止未来的晒伤）。\n\n（选项 E）反向形成是将不可接受的冲动或情绪无意识地转化为其对立面（例如，如果该患者告诉她的医生她喜欢就诊，并在检查期间表现得非常放松以对抗潜在的焦虑）。\n\n（选项 F）退行是一种防御机制，涉及无意识地恢复到一种不太成熟的方式来应对困难（例如，如果该患者开始抱着毛绒动物睡觉以管理对即将到来的预约的焦虑）。\n\n教育目标：\n经典条件反射涉及将一个中性刺激与一个引起反射性非条件反应的非中性刺激重复配对。随着时间的推移，先前中性的刺激能够仅凭自身诱发条件反应，而没有非中性刺激。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of classical conditioning and its application to phobias and anxiety related to medical settings. It requires differentiating classical conditioning from other forms of behavioral conditioning and defense mechanisms.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the unconditioned stimulus, unconditioned response, conditioned stimulus, and conditioned response. Analyze how the neutral stimulus (stethoscope) became associated with the anxiety-provoking experience (physician visits) to elicit a conditioned response.",
