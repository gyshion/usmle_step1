    "en": "An infant born to a 26-year-old woman is evaluated shortly after delivery. Birth weight and length are at the 10th and 15th percentiles, respectively. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows a protruding tongue, excessive skin at the nape of the neck, and upslanting palpebral fissures. The startle reflex is symmetric and weak. Cardiac auscultation reveals a harsh, III/VI systolic murmur heard best over the lower left sternal border. The patient has normal external female genitalia. Review of maternal medical records shows a past history of 2 spontaneous abortions in the last 3 years. Echocardiography confirms the presence of a ventricular septal defect. Which of the following karyotypes is most likely to be found in this infant?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The infant presents with several dysmorphic features suggestive of Down syndrome, including a protruding tongue, excessive skin at the nape of the neck, upslanting palpebral fissures, and a weak startle reflex. Additionally, the infant has a ventricular septal defect, a common cardiac anomaly in Down syndrome. The maternal history of recurrent spontaneous abortions is also a clue, as balanced translocation carriers have an increased risk of producing chromosomally unbalanced offspring. \n\nDown syndrome is most commonly caused by trisomy 21 (47,XX,+21), which results from nondisjunction during meiosis. However, a minority of Down syndrome cases are caused by unbalanced translocations. Robertsonian translocations, which involve the fusion of two acrocentric chromosomes, are the most common type of translocation associated with Down syndrome. In this case, the karyotype 46,XX, t(14;21) represents an unbalanced Robertsonian translocation where the long arms of chromosomes 14 and 21 have fused, resulting in three copies of chromosome 21 material. This leads to the Down syndrome phenotype. The mother is likely a balanced translocation carrier (e.g., 45,XX, t(14;21)), which explains her history of spontaneous abortions. \n\n(Choice A) Turner syndrome (45,XO) presents with features such as low-set ears, webbed neck, and widely spaced nipples, and is not associated with the dysmorphic features described or the maternal history. \n\n(Choice B) DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion) is associated with cardiac defects (e.g., interrupted aortic arch), palatal abnormalities, and immune deficiency, but not the classic features of Down syndrome. \n\n(Choice C) The Philadelphia chromosome, t(9;22), is associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia and is not related to Down syndrome. \n\n(Choice E) Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) presents with severe intellectual disability, characteristic facial features (e.g., micrognathia, low-set ears), and multiple congenital anomalies, but the specific dysmorphic features and karyotype are distinct from Down syndrome. \n\nKey clinical pearls: Suspect translocation Down syndrome in infants with Down syndrome features and a maternal history of recurrent miscarriages. Karyotyping is essential for diagnosis and genetic counseling.",
    "zh": "婴儿表现出多种提示唐氏综合征的畸形特征，包括舌头突出、颈后皮肤过多、眼睑向上倾斜以及惊吓反射弱。此外，婴儿患有室间隔缺损，这是唐氏综合征常见的先天性心脏异常。母亲反复自然流产的病史也是一个线索，因为平衡易位携带者有产生染色体不平衡后代的风险增加。\n\n唐氏综合征最常见的原因是21三体综合征（47,XX,+21），这是由于减数分裂期间的无分离所致。 然而，少数唐氏综合征病例是由不平衡易位引起的。罗伯逊易位，涉及两个着丝粒端染色体的融合，是与唐氏综合征相关的最常见的易位类型。在这种情况下，核型46,XX, t(14;21)代表不平衡的罗伯逊易位，其中14号和21号染色体的长臂融合，导致21号染色体物质的三个拷贝。这导致了唐氏综合征表型。母亲很可能是一个平衡易位携带者（例如，45,XX, t(14;21)），这解释了她的自然流产史。\n\n(选项A) 特纳综合征 (45,XO) 表现为低位耳、蹼颈和乳头间距过大等特征，并且与所描述的畸形特征或母亲病史无关。\n\n(选项B) DiGeorge综合征 (22q11.2 缺失) 与心脏缺陷（例如，主动脉弓中断）、腭异常和免疫缺陷有关，但与唐氏综合征的典型特征无关。\n\n(选项C) 费城染色体, t(9;22), 与慢性髓性白血病相关，与唐氏综合征无关。\n\n(选项E) 18三体综合征 (爱德华兹综合征) 表现为严重的智力障碍、特征性面部特征（例如，小下颌、低位耳）和多种先天性异常，但具体的畸形特征和核型与唐氏综合征不同。\n\n关键临床要点：在具有唐氏综合征特征和母亲反复流产史的婴儿中，怀疑易位性唐氏综合征。 核型分析对于诊断和遗传咨询至关重要。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the genetic basis of Down syndrome, specifically differentiating between trisomy 21 and translocation Down syndrome. It also assesses the ability to correlate clinical features and maternal history with specific chromosomal abnormalities.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the constellation of clinical findings suggestive of Down syndrome. Considering the maternal history of recurrent abortions, one should then evaluate the provided karyotypes for those that could result in Down syndrome due to a translocation, particularly a Robertsonian translocation.",
