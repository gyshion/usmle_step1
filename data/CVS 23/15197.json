    "en": "A 45-year-old man comes to clinic due to frequent episodes of palpitations accompanied by dizziness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Prolonged ECG monitoring identifies episodes of atrial fibrillation associated with a rapid ventricular response rate. A radiofrequency ablation procedure is planned. The access site is the right femoral vein. The ablation catheter is advanced to the left atrium where radiofrequency energy is used to eliminate an ectopic focus of abnormal electrical activity. During the procedure, the catheter most likely passes through which of the following structures? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "A venous catheter traveling from the femoral vein to the heart passes through the iliac vein and inferior vena cava to reach the right atrium. Once in the right atrium, structures within the right side of the heart and the pulmonary arteries are readily accessible. However, because the pulmonary capillaries are far too small to pass through, the left side of the heart must be accessed by traversing the interatrial septum. The interatrial septum is traversed at the site of the foramen ovale, which in adults is typically covered by a thin membrane of fibrous tissue that can be easily punctured. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nEntry into the left atrium allows for direct measurement of left atrial pressure (rather than an estimate via pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) and for access to arrhythmogenic foci that may be located on the left atrial myocardium or the pulmonary veins. Following the procedure, the small atrial septal defect created by the catheter typically closes spontaneously.\n\n(Choice A) Arterial catheterization of the left side of the heart typically starts in the femoral or radial artery and proceeds to ascending aorta where pressure can be measured or dye can be placed into the coronary arteries to visualize atherosclerotic obstruction (ie, coronary angiography). In addition, the aortic valve may be crossed to measure left ventricular pressure. However, retrograde crossing of the structurally complex mitral valve is highly difficult, and the left atrium is not accessed via this route.\n\n(Choice C) The interventricular septum is not traversed during heart catheterization because the myocardium is thick and difficult to puncture, and high left ventricular pressure would likely prevent spontaneous closure of the ventricular septal defect that is created.\n\n(Choices D and E) The tricuspid valve is crossed during venous catheterization to access the right ventricle, and the pulmonic valve is subsequently crossed to access the pulmonary arteries. However, because the catheter cannot pass through the pulmonary capillaries, the left atrium cannot be accessed via this route. {{exhibit_3}}\n\nEducational objective:\nTo access the left side of the heart, cardiac venous catheters must cross the interatrial septum at the site of the foramen ovale. Entry into the left atrium allows for direct measurement of left atrial pressure and for access to arrhythmogenic foci on the left atrial myocardium or pulmonary veins.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cardiac catheterization and the anatomical structures traversed during a radiofrequency ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation. Specifically, it assesses the pathway of a catheter from the femoral vein to the left atrium. \n\nThe key to solving this question is understanding that to reach the left atrium from the right atrium via venous access, the catheter must pass through the interatrial septum at the foramen ovale. Recognizing the anatomical route is crucial for selecting the correct answer.",
