  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Patient-centered care requires communication skills that engage the patient in discussing his or her perspective of the illness, which helps build rapport and aids in acquiring a more complete history. In this scenario, the wife begins the conversation by expressing her concern about the patient's medication adherence. Although acquiring collateral information can be important, the best approach is to redirect the conversation back to the patient to first elicit his perspective and concerns. It is better to explore medication adherence once rapport has already been established.\n\nMedical interviewing is best initiated with an open-ended question. This invites the patient to describe their condition in their own words and gives the physician insight into the patient's major concerns, which can be addressed with more specific questions later in the interview. Examples of open-ended questions include: \"What brings you in today?\" and \"What is that like for you?\" In contrast, a closed-ended question requires only a yes/no response and does not encourage conversation/exploration.\n\n(Choices A, B, and E) Although the wife has alerted the physician to a potentially important issue (possible medication nonadherence), it would be inappropriate to begin a medical interview with questions that assume (without asking) that the patient is, in fact, not taking his medication and focus on the wife's concerns rather than the patient's. This may put the patient on the defensive, leading to a deterioration of the physician-patient relationship. In addition, asking the patient if he is having trouble with remembering his medications is an example of a yes/no, closed-ended question.\n\n(Choice C) Although patients should be given the opportunity to speak to the physician alone, this question suggests the wife should leave. It is preferable to ask the patient if he would like her to stay or leave.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatient-centered medical interviewing should focus on the patient's perspective of the illness. Interviews are best initiated with an open-ended question that elicits the patient's major concerns in the patient's own words.",
    "zh": "以患者为中心的护理需要沟通技巧，让患者参与讨论他对疾病的看法，这有助于建立融洽关系并有助于获得更完整的病史。在这种情况下，妻子开始谈话时表达了她对患者用药依从性的担忧。尽管获取辅助信息可能很重要，但最好的方法是将谈话转回给患者，首先了解他的观点和担忧。最好在已经建立融洽关系之后再探讨用药依从性。\n\n病史询问最好以开放式问题开始。这邀请患者用自己的语言描述他们的病情，并让医生了解患者的主要担忧，这些担忧可以在稍后的访谈中使用更具体的问题来解决。开放式问题的例子包括：“您今天来这里做什么？” 和“您感觉如何？” 相比之下，封闭式问题只需要是/否的回答，并且不会鼓励对话/探索。\n\n（选项 A、B 和 E）虽然妻子提醒医生注意一个潜在的重要问题（可能存在用药依从性问题），但以假设（未经询问）患者实际上没有服药并侧重于妻子的担忧而不是患者的担忧的问题开始病史询问是不合适的。这可能会让患者处于防御状态，导致医患关系恶化。此外，询问患者他是否难以记住他的药物是是/否、封闭式问题的一个例子。\n\n（选项 C）虽然应该给患者单独与医生交谈的机会，但这个问题暗示妻子应该离开。最好询问患者是否希望她留下或离开。\n\n教育目标：\n以患者为中心的医学访谈应侧重于患者对疾病的看法。访谈最好以开放式问题开始，以患者自己的话语引出患者的主要担忧。"
