  "explanation": {
    "en": "Clear communication between health care team members is an essential component of high-quality patient care. Errors can occur frequently when communication is unclear or vague, and communication errors are one of the most common factors involved in malpractice claims for medical errors.\n\nClosed-loop communication is a form of effective communication used in health care settings and other high-risk fields. This technique lowers the risk of misunderstandings by ensuring clear communication. It enhances the team's ability to exchange clear, concise information; acknowledges receipt of the information; and confirms its understanding. Closed-loop communication typically involves an individual (the sender) transmitting a message to another individual (the receiver), who then repeats the message back to the sender. The sender typically will confirm the message by saying \"yes\".\n\nIn this situation, the nurse must repeat the order in an accurate and concise manner to convey that the physician's message has been received. The physician should confirm by saying \"yes\" following the nurse's statement to convey that this is correct.\n\n(Choice B) Although this response conveys that the nurse has comprehended that the patient needs diphenhydramine immediately, it does not convey the nurse's understanding of the correct route of administration.\n\n(Choices C, D, and E) Responses such as these are vague and do not convey whether the nurse has fully and accurately understood the order.\n\nEducational objective:\nHealth care providers working on a team should employ closed-loop communication, in which team members repeat back the information received to ensure that the correct information has been conveyed. This highly effective form of communication reduces the risk of medical errors in the health care setting.",
    "zh": "医疗团队成员之间的清晰沟通是高质量患者护理的重要组成部分。当沟通不清晰或模糊时，错误会经常发生，而沟通错误是医疗事故索赔中最常见的因素之一。\n\n闭环沟通是一种在医疗保健环境和其他高风险领域中使用的有效沟通形式。该技术通过确保清晰的沟通来降低误解的风险。它增强了团队交流清晰、简洁信息的能力；确认收到信息；并确认其理解。闭环沟通通常涉及一个人（发送者）将消息传递给另一个人（接收者），然后接收者将消息重复给发送者。发送者通常会通过说“是”来确认消息。\n\n在这种情况下，护士必须以准确和简洁的方式重复医嘱，以传达医生已收到消息。医生应在护士陈述后通过说“是”来确认这是正确的。\n\n（选项 B）虽然此回应传达了护士已理解患者需要立即使用苯海拉明，但它没有传达护士对正确给药途径的理解。\n\n（选项 C、D 和 E）此类回应含糊不清，并未传达护士是否已完全准确地理解医嘱。\n\n教育目标：\n在团队中工作的医疗保健提供者应采用闭环沟通，团队成员重复收到的信息以确保已传达正确的信息。这种高效的沟通形式降低了医疗保健环境中发生医疗错误的风险。"

    "en": "This question tests the application of closed-loop communication principles in a healthcare setting to minimize medical errors. It assesses the ability to identify a response that confirms understanding of an order by repeating it back accurately.\n\nThe best approach is to look for the response that most clearly and completely acknowledges the order, including the medication, dosage, and route of administration. Vague or incomplete responses are less likely to ensure accurate communication and should be avoided.",
