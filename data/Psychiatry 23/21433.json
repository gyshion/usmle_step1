  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This adolescent girl has recently adopted a vegetarian diet, which is causing concern for her parents. Such changes in eating habits are common in adolescents and are often due to benign reasons (eg, wanting to eat \"healthy\" or improve athletic performance, concerns about animals, desire to identify with a role model or peer group). However, an EATING DISORDER (eg, ANOREXIA NERVOSA) should also be considered, especially in a patient with a LOW or LOW-NORMAL BMI (or involvement in an activity that emphasizes leanness).\n\nThe next step in evaluating this patient is to directly but nonjudgmentally inquire about her motivations for vegetarianism. As when discussing any sensitive topic with adolescents, she may best be interviewed alone, without her parents present. If no worrisome features (eg, preoccupation with weight, abnormal body image) are found or new complications (eg, amenorrhea) develop, she can be followed clinically without additional specific intervention.\n\n(Choice A) Patients on a vegetarian diet should be advised to consume a variety of foods; intake of nonmeat animal-derived foods (eg, eggs, dairy) can often facilitate adequate intake of protein and micronutrients. However, additional supplements are not usually necessary unless specific deficiencies (eg, iron deficiency) develop.\n\n(Choices C and D) If no signs of an eating disorder are found on detailed discussion with the patient, her parents may be reassured about the nutritional adequacy of a varied, balanced vegetarian diet, although healthy meal planning may be helpful. However, optimal family counseling first requires a better understanding of this patient's motivations.\n\n(Choice E) This patient appears to have normal growth, development, and physical examination findings. However, additional information about the patient's attitudes toward eating, weight, and body image is needed before ruling out an eating disorder and reassuring the parents.",
    "zh": "这位青春期女孩最近开始素食，这引起了她父母的担忧。这种饮食习惯的改变在青少年中很常见，通常是由于良性原因（例如，想吃“健康”的食物或提高运动表现、对动物的担忧、希望认同榜样或同伴群体）。然而，也应考虑进食障碍（例如，神经性厌食症），尤其是在BMI偏低或低正常范围（或参与强调瘦弱的活动）的患者中。\n\n评估该患者的下一步是直接但非评判性地询问她素食的原因。正如与青少年讨论任何敏感话题一样，最好单独采访她，不要有父母在场。如果没有发现令人担忧的特征（例如，过度关注体重、异常的身体形象）或出现新的并发症（例如，闭经），可以在没有其他特定干预的情况下进行临床随访。\n\n（选项A）素食者应被建议食用各种食物；摄入非肉类动物来源的食物（例如，鸡蛋、乳制品）通常可以促进蛋白质和微量营养素的充足摄入。然而，除非出现特定的缺乏症（例如，铁缺乏症），否则通常不需要额外的补充剂。\n\n（选项C和D）如果在与患者的详细讨论中未发现进食障碍的迹象，可以向她的父母保证多样化、均衡的素食饮食的营养充足性，尽管健康的膳食计划可能有所帮助。然而，最佳的家庭咨询首先需要更好地了解该患者的动机。\n\n（选项E）该患者似乎有正常的生长发育和体格检查结果。然而，在排除进食障碍并向父母保证之前，需要更多关于患者对饮食、体重和身体形象的态度的信息。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of how to approach an adolescent patient presenting with a new restrictive diet, particularly when there are parental concerns and a low BMI, which could indicate an eating disorder. It emphasizes the importance of a nonjudgmental, direct inquiry into the patient's motivations.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to recognize the potential red flags for an eating disorder in an adolescent, such as a new restrictive diet and a low BMI, especially in the context of a sport that emphasizes leanness. The most appropriate next step is to gather more information directly from the patient in a private setting.",
