    "en": "A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by a friend due to severe shortness of breath. He is agitated and gasping for air and is unable to provide history. His friend says the patient has a history of chronic alcohol use and attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He is unaware of any other medical history. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 32/min. Due to worsening respiratory distress, immediate endotracheal intubation is performed and mechanical ventilation is begun. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit and, despite appropriate therapy, dies several hours later. Autopsy examination is performed, and histopathology of the lungs reveals engorged pulmonary capillaries and abundant intraalveolar, acellular, pink material that is more prominent at the bases. {{exhibit_1}} This patient most likely had which of the following conditions?",

    "en": "This patient's histopathologic findings of engorged alveolar capillaries (reflecting increased pulmonary venous pressure) and pink, acellular material within the alveoli (transuded plasma across the alveolar-capillary membrane) are most consistent with ACUTE PULMONARY EDEMA. Given the patient's history of CHRONIC ALCOHOL USE, he likely had underlying DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY. Subsequent decompensation then led to increased alveolar capillary hydrostatic pressure, causing pulmonary congestion and acute respiratory failure.\n\n(Choice A) Aspiration pneumonia may be chemical (eg, aspiration of gastric contents) or bacterial (eg, aspiration of oral flora). Histopathology of acute pneumonia shows neutrophil-rich, inflammatory exudates within the bronchioles and alveolar spaces.\n\n(Choice B) Centriacinar emphysema most commonly results from heavy smoking. Enlarged airspaces with macrophage-predominant infiltrates are expected.\n\n(Choice C) Hypersensitivity pneumonitis results from exposure to an environmental irritant (eg, mold). Histopathology shows lymphocyte-predominant, interstitial inflammation, often accompanied by non-necrotizing granulomas.\n\n(Choice D) Histopathology in pulmonary arterial hypertens on typically shows hypertrophy of the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle.\n\n(Choice F) Pulmonary infarction yields hemorrhagic, ischemic necrosis of the lung parenchyma. Histopathology shows a well-demarcated area of alveolar and vascular wall necrosis with cells that lack nuclei, and the alveolar spaces may contain red blood cells. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nEducational objective:\nAcute cardiogenic pulmonary edema results from increased pulmonary venous pressure. The alveolar capillaries become engorged with blood and there is a transudation of fluid plasma across the alveolar-capillary membrane, appearing as pink, acellular material within the alveoli. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者的组织病理学发现，肺泡毛细血管充血（反映肺静脉压升高）以及肺泡内粉红色、无细胞物质（血浆通过肺泡-毛细血管膜渗出），与急性肺水肿最为一致。鉴于患者有长期饮酒史，他可能患有潜在的扩张型心肌病。随后的代偿失调导致肺泡毛细血管静水压升高，引起肺充血和急性呼吸衰竭。\n\n（选项A）吸入性肺炎可能是化学性的（例如，吸入胃内容物）或细菌性的（例如，吸入口腔菌群）。急性肺炎的组织病理学显示细支气管和肺泡腔内富含中性粒细胞的炎性渗出物。\n\n（选项B）中心小叶型肺气肿最常见于重度吸烟者。预计会出现肺泡腔增大，并以巨噬细胞为主的浸润物。\n\n（选项C）过敏性肺炎是由于接触环境刺激物（例如霉菌）引起的。组织病理学显示以淋巴细胞为主的间质性炎症，通常伴有非坏死性肉芽肿。\n\n（选项D）肺动脉高压的组织病理学通常显示肺血管平滑肌肥大。\n\n（选项F）肺梗死导致肺实质的出血性缺血性坏死。组织病理学显示肺泡和血管壁坏死，界限分明，细胞无核，肺泡腔内可能含有红细胞。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n教育目标：\n急性心源性肺水肿是由于肺静脉压升高引起的。肺泡毛细血管充血，血浆液体通过肺泡-毛细血管膜渗出，表现为肺泡内粉红色、无细胞物质。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology and histopathological findings associated with acute pulmonary edema, particularly in the context of chronic alcohol use leading to dilated cardiomyopathy. It requires recognizing the characteristic features of pulmonary edema on autopsy and differentiating it from other pulmonary conditions.\n\nThe best approach is to correlate the patient's history of chronic alcohol use with the autopsy findings. Recognize that chronic alcohol use can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy, which can then result in acute pulmonary edema. Eliminate answer choices based on their distinct histopathological features and etiologies.",
