    "en": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to recurrent, generalized tonic-clonic seizures over the past 24 hours. The patient has been having high fever and flulike symptoms for the past 3 days. He has a past medical history of febrile seizures at age 6 months. He takes no medications and has no family history of epilepsy. The patient's temperature is 39.4 C (103 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 112/min, and respirations are 10/min. He appears lethargic and does not follow simple commands consistently. His neck is supple. During the examination, the patient suddenly develops sustained, generalized tonic-clonic convulsions without fully regaining consciousness between episodes.",

    "en": "This patient has STATUS EPILEPTICUS, possibly due to complex febrile seizures or infectious meningitis/encephalitis. Regardless of etiology, the initial drug of choice for treating status epilepticus is an INTRAVENOUS BENZODIAZEPINE (eg, lorazepam), due to its efficacy and rapid onset of action.\n\nBenzodiazepines enhance the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA-A receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel. Allosteric attachment of benzodiazepines to the GABA-A receptor causes increased influx of negatively charged chloride ions in response to GABA binding. This leads to hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic neuron and suppression of action potential firing (anticonvulsant effect).\n\n(Choice A) Presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels mediate the influx of calcium into the axon terminal, promoting vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release into the synaptic cleft. Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant that works by blocking voltage-gated calcium channels, thereby attenuating excitatory neurotransmitter release.\n\n(Choice B) Presynaptic voltage-gated sodium channels open when the cell becomes sufficiently depolarized, triggering an action potential that propagates down the axon. Phenytoin blocks presynaptic voltage-gated sodium channels and can be used to prevent recurrence of status epilepticus due to its long duration of action. However, it has a slow onset of action, and patients in status epilepticus should be given a rapid-acting benzodiazepine first.\n\n(Choice D) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are examples of medications that prevent presynaptic neurotransmitter reuptake. They are typically used to treat depression and anxiety disorders.\n\nEducational objective:\nIntravenous benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam) are the initial drug of choice for status epilepticus. They work by enhancing the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA-A receptor, leading to increased chloride influx and suppression of action potential firing.",
    "zh": "该患者患有癫痫持续状态，这可能是由于复杂性热性惊厥或感染性脑膜炎/脑炎所致。无论病因如何，治疗癫痫持续状态的首选药物是静脉注射苯二氮卓类药物（例如，劳拉西泮），因为其有效且起效迅速。\n\n苯二氮卓类药物通过增强抑制性神经递质γ-氨基丁酸（GABA）在GABA-A受体（一种配体门控离子通道）上的作用而发挥作用。苯二氮卓类药物与GABA-A受体的变构结合会导致对GABA结合反应的负电荷氯离子内流增加。这导致突触后神经元的超极化和动作电位放电的抑制（抗惊厥作用）。\n\n（选项A）突触前电压门控钙通道介导钙离子流入轴突末梢，促进囊泡融合和神经递质释放到突触间隙。加巴喷丁是一种抗惊厥药，通过阻断电压门控钙通道而起作用，从而减弱兴奋性神经递质的释放。\n\n（选项B）当细胞充分去极化时，突触前电压门控钠通道开放，触发动作电位沿轴突传播。苯妥英阻断突触前电压门控钠通道，并可用于预防癫痫持续状态的复发，因为它作用时间长。然而，它起效缓慢，癫痫持续状态的患者应首先给予快速起效的苯二氮卓类药物。\n\n（选项D）选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（SSRIs）和5-羟色胺-去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂（SNRIs）是阻止突触前神经递质再摄取的药物的例子。它们通常用于治疗抑郁症和焦虑症。\n\n教育目标：\n静脉注射苯二氮卓类药物（例如，劳拉西泮）是癫痫持续状态的初始首选药物。它们通过增强γ-氨基丁酸（GABA）在GABA-A受体上的作用而起作用，从而导致氯离子内流增加和动作电位放电的抑制。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the initial management of status epilepticus, specifically the mechanism of action of the first-line treatment. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of status epilepticus and recalling the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the diagnosis of status epilepticus based on the prolonged seizure activity. Subsequently, the most appropriate initial therapy, which is an intravenous benzodiazepine, must be recalled. Finally, the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines, which involves enhancing GABAergic inhibition through chloride influx, needs to be applied to select the correct option.",
