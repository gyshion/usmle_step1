  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "To initiate swallowing, the contents of the oral cavity are collected on the tongue and propelled into the pharynx, where contraction of the pharyngeal muscles pushes the material into the esophagus. The cricopharyngeus muscle contracts behind the food bolus, initiating a peristaltic wave to propel the bolus downward. When the food bolus reaches the lower esophagus, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxes to allow the material to enter the stomach.\n\nAchalasia is a motility disorder caused by reduced numbers of inhibitory ganglion cells in the esophageal wall, which creates an imbalance favoring excitatory ganglion cells. This patient's esophageal manometry shows typical findings in achalasia, including normal contraction of the upper esophageal sphincter, decreased amplitude of peristalsis in the mid esophagus, and increased tone and incomplete relaxation at the LES. Patients experience dysphagia, regurgitation, and retrosternal chest pain. Barium esophagram typically shows dilation of the esophagus with distal narrowing.\n\n(Choice B) Cricopharyngeal dysfunction results from failure of the cricopharyngeus to relax during swallowing and causes a choking or \"food-sticking\" sensation on swallowing. Manometry findings are variable and can show decreased pharyngeal tone or incomplete relaxation at the upper esophageal sphincter.\n\n(Choice C) Diffuse esophageal spasm presents with severe, retrosternal chest pain. It is characterized by uncoordinated contractions of the esophageal body. Esophageal manometry shows intermittent peristalsis and multiple simultaneous contractions on tracings from the mid and lower esophagus {{exhibit_2}}.\n\n(Choice D) Esophageal stricture presents with progressive solid food dysphagia. It is diagnosed with contrast imaging (eg, barium swallow) rather than manometry. However, most patients will have a long history of gastroesophageal reflux with decreased tone at the LES.\n\n(Choice E) Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) can affect the esophagus, leading to impaired motility, incompetence of the LES, and gastroesophageal reflux. Manometry will show decreased peristalsis with decreased tone at the LES. {{exhibit_3}}\n\nEducational objective:\nAchalasia is caused by reduced numbers of inhibitory ganglion cells in the esophageal wall. Esophageal manometry in achalasia shows decreased amplitude of peristalsis in the mid esophagus, with increased tone and incomplete relaxation at the lower esophageal sphincter.",
    "zh": "为了启动吞咽，口腔内容物聚集在舌头上并被推入咽部，咽肌的收缩将物质推入食管。环咽肌在食团后方收缩，启动蠕动波，将食团向下推进。当食团到达食管下端时，食管下括约肌（LES）舒张，使物质进入胃。\n\n贲门失弛缓症是一种动力障碍，由食管壁中抑制性神经节细胞数量减少引起，这造成有利于兴奋性神经节细胞的不平衡。该患者的食管测压显示了贲门失弛缓症的典型表现，包括食管上括约肌正常收缩、食管中部蠕动波幅度降低以及LES张力增高和不完全松弛。患者出现吞咽困难、反流和胸骨后疼痛。钡餐食管造影通常显示食管扩张伴远端狭窄。\n\n（选项B）环咽肌功能障碍是由于环咽肌在吞咽时未能松弛而引起的，导致吞咽时出现窒息或“食物卡住”的感觉。测压结果各异，可以显示咽张力降低或食管上括约肌不完全松弛。\n\n（选项C）弥漫性食管痉挛表现为严重的胸骨后疼痛。其特征是食管体部的不协调收缩。食管测压显示间歇性蠕动和食管中部和下部描记图谱上的多重同步收缩{{exhibit_2}}。\n\n（选项D）食管狭窄表现为进行性固体食物吞咽困难。它通过对比成像（例如，钡吞咽）而不是测压进行诊断。然而，大多数患者将有胃食管反流的长期病史，伴有LES张力降低。\n\n（选项E）系统性硬化症（硬皮病）可影响食管，导致动力受损、LES功能不全和胃食管反流。测压将显示蠕动波减弱，伴有LES张力降低。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n教育目标：\n贲门失弛缓症是由食管壁中抑制性神经节细胞数量减少引起的。贲门失弛缓症的食管测压显示食管中部蠕动波幅度降低，伴有LES张力增高和不完全松弛。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of esophageal motility disorders, specifically achalasia, and its characteristic findings on esophageal manometry. It requires recognizing the manometric pattern of decreased peristalsis in the mid-esophagus and incomplete LES relaxation.\n\nThe best approach is to correlate the patient's symptoms (dysphagia, retrosternal discomfort) with the manometry findings. Rule out other esophageal disorders based on their distinct manometric patterns and clinical presentations.",
