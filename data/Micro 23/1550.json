    "en": "A 24-year-old man comes to the physician with painful blisters on the shaft of his penis. The lesions erupted 2 days ago. The patient has had 5 lifetime sexual partners and is currently sexually active with one female partner; he uses condoms inconsistently. Examination shows multiple vesicular lesions on the penis, and Tzanck smear is positive for multinucleated giant cells. HIV testing is negative. The patient has had several similar episodes every year for the past 2 years but had been too embarrassed to seek treatment until now.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's recurrent vesicular lesions and positive Tzanck smear are consistent with recurrent genital herpes simplex virus (HSV), generally due to reactivation of latent HSV-2 infection within the S2, S3, and S4 dorsal root (sensory) ganglia. Recurrence of genital HSV can be suppressed or minimized with daily oral valacyclovir (preferred as it is dosed once daily and has good bioavailability), acyclovir, or famciclovir. Although the antiviral agents may not be active against latent virus forms, they can suppress further multiplication as soon as reactivation occurs. Suppressive therapy would likely have been offered to this patient with multiple yearly episodes of recurrence; it is generally continued for years with periodic re-evaluation.\n\n(Choice B) Immunoglobulin therapy can be used for varicella postexposure prophylaxis (eg, in neonates or pregnant women) but is not commonly used for genital HSV infections.\n\n(Choice C) Lamivudine is a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor with activity against HIV and hepatitis B virus. It is not known to be effective against HSV-2.\n\n(Choice D) Although condom use may prevent sexual transmission of HSV-2 (and therefore might have prevented this patient from acquiring his primary genital HSV-2 infection), it does not reduce the frequency of recurrence of genital herpes.\n\n(Choice E) A short (7-10 days) course of treatment with oral acyclovir during primary genital HSV infection usually reduces the duration of viral shedding, time for lesional healing, and local pain; however, it does not appear to alter recurrence rates.\n\nEducational objective:\nA new-onset genital vesicular rash with a positive Tzanck smear in a previously asymptomatic patient is suggestive of primary genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection due to HSV-2. Recurrences of genital herpes can be reduced through daily treatment with oral valacyclovir, acyclovir, or famciclovir. Condom use can help prevent a primary genital HSV infection but does not prevent reactivation of latent infection.",
    "zh": "该患者复发性水疱性皮损和Tzanck涂片阳性与复发性生殖器单纯疱疹病毒（HSV）感染相符，通常是由于潜伏性HSV-2感染在S2、S3和S4背根（感觉神经）神经节内复发。每日口服伐昔洛韦（首选，因为它每天只需给药一次，且具有良好的生物利用度）、阿昔洛韦或泛昔洛韦，可以抑制或减少生殖器HSV的复发。尽管抗病毒药物可能对潜伏型病毒无效，但它们可以在再次激活后立即抑制进一步的繁殖。对于该患者，每年多次复发，很可能会提供抑制治疗；通常会持续数年，并定期重新评估。\n\n（选项B）免疫球蛋白治疗可用于水痘暴露后预防（例如，在新生儿或孕妇中），但通常不用于生殖器HSV感染。\n\n（选项C）拉米夫定是一种核苷类似物逆转录酶抑制剂，对HIV和乙型肝炎病毒具有活性。已知它对HSV-2无效。\n\n（选项D）虽然使用避孕套可以预防HSV-2的性传播（因此可能已经阻止了该患者获得原发性生殖器HSV-2感染），但它不会降低生殖器疱疹的复发频率。\n\n（选项E）在原发性生殖器HSV感染期间进行短期（7-10天）的口服阿昔洛韦治疗，通常会缩短病毒脱落的持续时间、皮损愈合时间和局部疼痛；但是，它似乎并不能改变复发率。\n\n教育目标：\n既往无症状患者出现新发性生殖器水疱疹和Tzanck涂片阳性，提示原发性生殖器单纯疱疹病毒（HSV）感染，由HSV-2引起。通过每日使用口服伐昔洛韦、阿昔洛韦或泛昔洛韦治疗，可以减少生殖器疱疹的复发。使用避孕套可以帮助预防原发性生殖器HSV感染，但不能预防潜伏感染的再激活。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the management of recurrent genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, specifically the use of antiviral suppressive therapy to reduce recurrence rates.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the clinical presentation of recurrent genital herpes and understanding that continuous antiviral therapy is the most effective way to prevent recurrences, as opposed to episodic treatment or preventative measures for initial infection.",
