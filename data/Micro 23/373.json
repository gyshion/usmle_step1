    "en": "This asymptomatic patient with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against hepatitis A virus (HAV) likely had a prior infection with HAV. In children age <6, HAV infection is most often (>80%) silent or subclinical (\"anicteric,\" with no jaundice observed). Less frequently, it can present as an acute, self-limited illness characterized by jaundice, malaise, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and right upper-quadrant pain. Clinical disease is typically more severe (70% of symptomatic patients with jaundice) in adults (some of whom develop an aversion to smoking, for unclear reasons), although in the United States most adults with anti-HAV IgG antibodies have never experienced an icteric illness. Liver failure and death due to HAV are extremely rare (<0.5% of cases) (Choice E).\n\n(Choices B, C, and F) Unlike hepatitis B or C, HAV infection is a self-limiting disease that is not associated with an asymptomatic viral carrier state and does not progress to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n(Choice D) Immunity against hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection would be signaled by anti-HDV IgG antibodies, not anti-HAV IgG antibodies.\n\n(Choice G) Reinfection with HAV would be associated with the presence of anti-HAV IgM antibodies. Individuals who have persistent anti-HAV IgG antibodies typically enjoy immunity to repeat HAV infection.\n\n(Choice H) Acute hepatitis B infection is sometimes associated with a window period where hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is no longer present but anti-HBsAg is not yet detectable in serum.\n\nEducational objective:\nHepatitis A virus infection is most commonly silent or subclinical (\"anicteric\") in young children but can also present as an acute, self-limited illness characterized by jaundice, malaise, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, right upper-quadrant pain, or an aversion to smoking.",
    "zh": "这位无症状患者体内存在针对甲型肝炎病毒（HAV）的免疫球蛋白G（IgG）抗体，很可能既往感染过HAV。在6岁以下的儿童中，HAV感染通常（>80%）是无症状或亚临床的（“无黄疸”，未观察到黄疸）。较少见的情况是，它可能表现为急性、自限性疾病，其特征是黄疸、不适、疲劳、食欲不振、恶心、呕吐和右上象限疼痛。临床疾病在成人中通常更严重（70%的出现黄疸的症状患者）（其中一些人会因为不明原因而厌恶吸烟），尽管在美国，大多数anti-HAV IgG抗体阳性的成年人从未经历过黄疸性疾病。由于HAV引起的肝衰竭和死亡极为罕见（<0.5%的病例）（选项E）。\n\n（选项B、C和F）与乙型或丙型肝炎不同，HAV感染是一种自限性疾病，不与无症状病毒携带状态相关，也不会进展为慢性肝炎、肝硬化或肝细胞癌。\n\n（选项D）对丁型肝炎病毒（HDV）感染的免疫力将通过anti-HDV IgG抗体而不是anti-HAV IgG抗体来提示。\n\n（选项G）再次感染HAV将与anti-HAV IgM抗体的存在相关。具有持续性anti-HAV IgG抗体的个体通常享有对HAV再次感染的免疫力。\n\n（选项H）急性乙型肝炎感染有时与窗口期相关，即乙型肝炎表面抗原（HBsAg）不再存在，但anti-HBsAg尚未在血清中检测到。\n\n教育目标：\n甲型肝炎病毒感染在年幼儿童中最常见的是无症状或亚临床的（“无黄疸”），但也可能表现为急性、自限性疾病，其特征是黄疸、不适、疲劳、食欲不振、恶心、呕吐、右上象限疼痛或厌恶吸烟。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the interpretation of hepatitis A serology, specifically the meaning of positive IgG antibodies in an asymptomatic individual. It requires understanding the natural history of hepatitis A infection and the significance of different antibody types.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that positive IgG antibodies indicate prior exposure and immunity to hepatitis A. Since the patient is asymptomatic and has no IgM antibodies, the most likely explanation is a past, subclinical infection, common in childhood.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对甲型肝炎血清学结果的解读，特别是对无症状个体中IgG抗体阳性的含义。它要求理解甲型肝炎感染的自然病程以及不同抗体类型的意义。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要认识到IgG抗体阳性表明既往接触过甲型肝炎并对其具有免疫力。由于患者无症状且没有IgM抗体，最可能的解释是既往亚临床感染，这在儿童时期很常见。"
