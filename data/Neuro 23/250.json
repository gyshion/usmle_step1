    "en": "A 6-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother due to difficulty with his behavior in school. She says that his teacher is concerned that he does not pay attention in class and his grades are dropping to the point he may need medication to help him focus. The patient's mother has noticed that at home he seems to stare into space for several seconds, multiple times throughout the day. This occurs even when he is watching his favorite television show, and he seems to ignore her when she calls his name. The patient has no previous medical problems and takes no medications. He has an older brother with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and an aunt with epilepsy.",

    "en": "Absence seizures, a type of generalized epilepsy, present in children age 4-10 as brief staring spells with a momentary lapse in consciousness. Automatisms, such as rhythmic blinking or repetitive lip smacking, may occur. Most absence seizures last approximately 10 seconds, and behavior and awareness typically return immediately to normal following an attack. The patient experiences no postictal period and usually has no recollection that a seizure has occurred. Absence seizures are characteristically provoked by hyperventilation, and electroencephalogram will show generalized 3-Hz spike-wave complexes.\n\nTreatment of absence seizures is typically with ETHOSUXIMIDE, which inhibits T-type calcium channels in thalamic neurons. Valproate can also be used if first-line therapy is not tolerated or ineffective. Childhood absence epilepsy is typically benign, and seizures often resolve before puberty.\n\n(Choices A and E) Narrow-spectrum anticonvulsants (eg, carbamazepine, gabapentin, phenobarbital, phenytoin) are generally favored for focal-onset seizures. Carbamazepine can worsen absence seizures and phenobarbital is ineffective in these patients.\n\n(Choice C) Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that is used as a first-line anticonvulsant in a patient with STATUS EPILEPTICUS.\n\n(Choice D) Methylphenidate is an indirect-acting sympathomimetic used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although ADHD may present similarly with \"inattention,\" staring episodes consistent with absence seizures do not occur out of boredom or lack of focus and cannot be interrupted by verbal/tactile stimuli.\n\nEducational objective:\nAbsence seizures are a type of generalized epilepsy characterized by brief staring spells with momentary loss of awareness followed by an abrupt return to full consciousness. A classic 3-Hz spike-wave is seen on electroencephalogram: the treatment is ethosuximide.",
    "zh": "失神发作，一种全面性癫痫，在4-10岁的儿童中表现为短暂的凝视发作，伴有短暂的意识丧失。可能会出现自动症，例如有节奏的眨眼或重复的咂嘴。大多数失神发作持续约10秒，并且在发作后行为和意识通常立即恢复正常。患者没有发作后状态，通常不记得发生过癫痫发作。失神发作的特征是由于过度通气而诱发，脑电图将显示普遍的3-Hz尖峰-慢波复合波。\n\n失神发作的治疗通常采用乙琥胺，它抑制丘脑神经元中的T型钙通道。如果一线治疗无法耐受或无效，也可以使用丙戊酸盐。儿童失神性癫痫通常是良性的，并且发作通常在青春期前消失。\n\n（选项A和E）窄谱抗惊厥药（例如，卡马西平、加巴喷丁、苯巴比妥、苯妥英钠）通常用于局灶性发作。卡马西平会使失神发作恶化，而苯巴比妥对这些患者无效。\n\n（选项C）劳拉西泮是一种苯二氮卓类药物，用作患者癫痫持续状态的一线抗惊厥药。\n\n（选项D）哌甲酯是一种间接作用的拟交感神经药，用于治疗注意力缺陷多动障碍（ADHD）。尽管ADHD可能以“注意力不集中”的形式类似地呈现，但与失神发作一致的凝视发作并不会由于无聊或缺乏专注而发生，并且无法被言语/触觉刺激中断。\n\n教育目标：\n失神发作是一种全面性癫痫，其特征是短暂的凝视发作，伴有短暂的意识丧失，然后突然恢复完全的意识。在脑电图上可见经典的3-Hz尖峰-慢波：治疗方法是乙琥胺。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of absence seizures, their clinical presentation, and appropriate first-line pharmacotherapy. It requires differentiating absence seizures from other conditions like ADHD and understanding the mechanism of action of ethosuximide.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the staring spells as potential absence seizures. Rule out ADHD based on the lack of response to stimuli during episodes. Recall that ethosuximide is the first-line treatment for absence seizures.",
