The infant was born at term and had been healthy until the onset of these symptoms. All of his vaccinations are up-to-date. He had been breast-fed exclusively until 1 week ago, when cereals and fruit juices were introduced into his diet. Further evaluation reveals hepatomegaly and abnormal liver function tests.",

    "en": "The metabolic pathways of glucose and fructose are illustrated in {{exhibit_1}}.\n\nThe patient's clinical presentation of vomiting, irritability, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and abnormal liver function tests, developing *after* the introduction of cereals and fruit juices into his diet, is highly characteristic of **HEREDITARY FRUCTOSE INTOLERANCE (HFI)**, an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of **ALDOLASE B**.\n\nAldolase B is crucial for the metabolism of fructose-1-phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde. In HFI, the deficiency of Aldolase B leads to an intracellular accumulation of **FRUCTOSE-1-PHOSPHATE** in the liver, kidneys, and small intestine. This accumulation is toxic and depletes intracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi), thereby inhibiting **GLYCOGENOLYSIS** (breakdown of glycogen) and **GLUCONEOGENESIS** (synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources). The resultant impaired glucose production leads to severe **HYPOGLYCEMIA** following fructose ingestion. The accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate also directly damages hepatocytes, causing liver dysfunction, jaundice, and hepatomegaly, as seen in this patient. Failure to thrive and renal tubulopathy are other common manifestations. The symptoms typically become apparent upon introduction of fructose-containing foods (e.g., fruit, juices, sucrose-sweetened formula, cereals) into the infant's diet. Elimination of dietary fructose is the mainstay of treatment and results in symptom improvement with a good long-term prognosis.\n\n**Incorrect Choices and Differential Diagnosis:**\n\n**Choices A and D (Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency and Galactokinase deficiency):** **CLASSIC GALACTOSEMIA**, caused by a deficiency in **GALACTOSE-1-PHOSPHATE URIDYL TRANSFERASE (GALT)** (Choice A), is an autosomal recessive disorder presenting with vomiting, feeding intolerance, neonatal jaundice, hepatomegaly, and sepsis-like symptoms. Symptoms typically begin much earlier, shortly after the initiation of **BREASTFEEDING** or formula feeding (which contain lactose, a disaccharide of glucose and galactose). Since this infant was breastfed exclusively for 5.5 months without symptoms, classic galactosemia is less likely. **GALACTOKINASE DEFICIENCY** (Choice D) is a more benign form of galactosemia, primarily causing **CATARACTS** due to galactitol accumulation, but generally does not lead to the severe liver disease or hypoglycemia seen here.\n\n**Choice C (Fructokinase deficiency):** **FRUCTOKINASE DEFICIENCY** (Choice C) causes **ESSENTIAL FRUCTOSURIA**, a benign autosomal recessive disorder. Fructokinase is the enzyme responsible for phosphorylating fructose to fructose-1-phosphate. Its deficiency leads to the accumulation of fructose in the blood and its excretion in the urine. This condition is typically **ASYMPTOMATIC** and does not cause hepatomegaly, jaundice, or hypoglycemia, as fructose can still be metabolized by other pathways or excreted without significant clinical impact.\n\n**Choice E (Acid α-glucosidase deficiency):** **ACID α-GLUCOSIDASE DEFICIENCY** (Choice E), also known as **POMPE DISEASE** (Glycogen storage disease type II), is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes throughout the body. The infantile form typically presents with severe **CARDIOMYOPATHY**, hypotonia (floppy baby syndrome), and often failure to thrive. While hepatomegaly can occur due to glycogen accumulation, it is not typically associated with hypoglycemia or jaundice as seen in this patient, and the primary organ affected is the heart.\n\n**EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVE:** Aldolase B deficiency causes hereditary fructose intolerance. This disease manifests after introduction of fructose into the diet with vomiting and hypoglycemia about 20-30 minutes after fructose ingestion. These infants can present with failure to thrive, jaundice, and hepatomegaly.",
    "zh": "葡萄糖和果糖的代谢途径在 {{exhibit_1}} 中有说明。\n\n该患者的临床表现包括呕吐、易怒、黄疸、肝肿大和肝功能检查异常，这些症状在饮食中加入谷物和果汁*后*出现，高度符合**遗传性果糖不耐受症 (HFI)**，这是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，由**醛缩酶 B** 缺乏引起。\n\n醛缩酶 B 对于将果糖-1-磷酸代谢成二羟基丙酮磷酸 (DHAP) 和甘油醛至关重要。在 HFI 中，醛缩酶 B 缺乏导致**果糖-1-磷酸**在肝脏、肾脏和小肠内的细胞内积聚。这种积聚具有毒性，并消耗细胞内无机磷酸盐 (Pi)，从而抑制**糖原分解**（糖原分解）和**糖异生**（从非碳水化合物来源合成葡萄糖）。由此产生的葡萄糖生成受损导致摄入果糖后出现严重的**低血糖症**。果糖-1-磷酸的积聚也会直接损害肝细胞，导致肝功能障碍、黄疸和肝肿大，如该患者所见。生长迟缓和肾小管病是其他常见表现。这些症状通常在将含果糖的食物（例如，水果、果汁、蔗糖增甜的配方奶、谷物）引入婴儿的饮食后变得明显。消除饮食中的果糖是主要的治疗方法，并能改善症状，预后良好。\n\n**错误选项和鉴别诊断：**\n\n**选项 A 和 D（半乳糖-1-磷酸尿苷酰转移酶缺乏症和半乳糖激酶缺乏症）：** **经典型半乳糖血症**，由**半乳糖-1-磷酸尿苷酰转移酶 (GALT)**（选项 A）缺乏引起，是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，表现为呕吐、喂养不耐受、新生儿黄疸、肝肿大和败血症样症状。症状通常开始得更早，在**母乳喂养**或配方奶喂养（其中含有乳糖，一种葡萄糖和半乳糖的二糖）开始后不久。由于该婴儿纯母乳喂养 5.5 个月而无症状，因此经典型半乳糖血症的可能性较小。**半乳糖激酶缺乏症**（选项 D）是半乳糖血症的一种较良性的形式，主要引起**白内障**，是由于半乳糖醇积聚，但通常不会导致此处所见的严重肝病或低血糖症。\n\n**选项 C（果糖激酶缺乏症）：** **果糖激酶缺乏症**（选项 C）导致**特发性果糖尿症**，一种良性的常染色体隐性遗传病。果糖激酶是将果糖磷酸化为果糖-1-磷酸的酶。它的缺乏导致血液中果糖的积聚及其在尿液中的排泄。这种情况通常是**无症状的**，并且不会引起肝肿大、黄疸或低血糖症，因为果糖仍然可以通过其他途径代谢或排泄而不会产生显着的临床影响。\n\n**选项 E（酸性 α-葡萄糖苷酶缺乏症）：** **酸性 α-葡萄糖苷酶缺乏症**（选项 E），也称为**庞贝病**（糖原贮积病 II 型），是一种溶酶体贮积病，其特征是糖原在全身的溶酶体中积聚。婴儿型通常表现为严重的**心肌病**、肌张力减退（婴儿瘫软综合征），并且通常生长迟缓。虽然肝肿大可能因糖原积聚而发生，但通常不与该患者所见的低血糖症或黄疸相关，并且主要受影响的器官是心脏。\n\n**教育目标：** 醛缩酶 B 缺乏会导致遗传性果糖不耐受症。这种疾病在饮食中引入果糖后出现，摄入果糖后约 20-30 分钟出现呕吐和低血糖。这些婴儿可能表现为生长迟缓、黄疸和肝肿大。"
