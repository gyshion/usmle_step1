Her parents say that she was not feeling well that morning, but she has otherwise been in good health. Temperature is 39.7 C (103.5 F), blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg, and pulse is 130/min and thready. There is a diffuse petechial and ecchymotic skin rash. Laboratory testing reveals leukocytosis with left shift and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiorgan failure. Despite aggressive interventions, the patient dies several hours after admission. Autopsy reveals hemorrhagic necrosis of many internal organs, including the bilateral adrenal glands. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "The patient presents with a fulminant course of sepsis, characterized by fever, hypotension, petechial rash, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), multiorgan failure, and hemorrhagic necrosis of the adrenal glands (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome). This clinical picture is highly suggestive of meningococcal sepsis caused by Neisseria meningitidis. \n\nNeisseria meningitidis is a common cause of rapid-onset sepsis and circulatory collapse in otherwise healthy young individuals. Infections usually start suddenly with myalgias, high fever, headache, and altered level of consciousness and quickly progress to hypotension, organ failure, and death. Many patients also develop a petechial/ecchymotic rash due to underlying disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); adrenal hemorrhage/infarction leading to adrenal (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome) can also occur, potentiating the circulatory collapse.\n\nN meningitidis has an outer membrane virulence factor called lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS), which is primarily responsible for the severity of meningococcal disease. LOS, and its close analogue lipopolysaccharide (found in gram-negative enteric rods), are endotoxins that cause toxicity when released into the plasma via shedding of the outer membrane (\"blebbing\") or bacterial lysis. Endotoxins bind to Toll-like receptor 4 on monocytic and dendritic cells and trigger the release of inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha), which leads to endothelial damage, capillary leakage, and hemorrhagic necrosis.\n\n(Choices A and B) The capsular polysaccharide of N meningitidis is an important virulence factor that helps the bacteria resist phagocytosis and complement activation. N meningitidis also releases IgA protease, which helps in nasopharyngeal epithelial colonization. However, these virulence factors are not the direct cause of meningococcal inflammation and septic shock.\n\n(Choice D) Lipoteichoic acid is a major component of the cell wall of most gram-positive bacteria and plays a role in bacterial adhesion and cell division. Although lipoteichoic acid can also act as an endotoxin and contribute to sepsis, meningococcal disease is particularly associated with rapidly developing severe septic shock (LOS is shed in copious amounts by N meningitidis).\n\n(Choice E) Toxic shock syndrome is due to Staphylococcus aureus superantigen exotoxins, which result in widespread activation of T-cells with massive release of inflammatory cytokines. Patients usually present with circulatory collapse, organ failure, and erythroderma (a diffuse macular rash that looks like a sunburn). Petechiae and ecchymosis would be atypical.\n\nEducational objective: Neisseria meningitidis can cause sepsis and rapid circulatory collapse in previously healthy young individuals. Lipooligosaccharide, a virulence factor in the pathogen's outer membrane, is the major underlying cause of disease severity.",
    "zh": "该患者表现为暴发性脓毒症，其特征为发热、低血压、瘀点皮疹、弥散性血管内凝血（DIC）、多器官衰竭和肾上腺出血性坏死（Waterhouse-Friderichsen综合征）。这种临床表现高度提示脑膜炎奈瑟菌引起的脑膜炎球菌性脓毒症。\n\n脑膜炎奈瑟菌是通常在原本健康的年轻人中引起快速起病的脓毒症和循环衰竭的常见原因。感染通常突然开始，伴有肌痛、高热、头痛和意识水平改变，并迅速进展为低血压、器官衰竭和死亡。许多患者还会因潜在的弥散性血管内凝血（DIC）而出现瘀点/瘀斑皮疹；肾上腺出血/梗死可导致肾上腺（Waterhouse-Friderichsen综合征），也可加剧循环衰竭。\n\n脑膜炎奈瑟菌有一种外膜毒力因子，称为脂寡糖（LOS），它主要负责脑膜炎球菌病的严重程度。LOS及其近亲脂多糖（存在于革兰氏阴性肠杆菌中）是内毒素，当通过外膜脱落（“起泡”）或细菌裂解释放到血浆中时会引起毒性。内毒素与单核细胞和树突状细胞上的Toll样受体4结合，触发炎症细胞因子（例如，IL-1、IL-6、TNF-alpha）的释放，从而导致内皮损伤、毛细血管渗漏和出血性坏死。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）脑膜炎奈瑟菌的荚膜多糖是一种重要的毒力因子，有助于细菌抵抗吞噬作用和补体激活。脑膜炎奈瑟菌还会释放 IgA 蛋白酶，有助于鼻咽上皮定植。然而，这些毒力因子不是脑膜炎球菌炎症和感染性休克的直接原因。\n\n（选项 D）脂磷壁酸是大多数革兰氏阳性细菌细胞壁的主要成分，并在细菌粘附和细胞分裂中起作用。虽然脂磷壁酸也可以作为内毒素并有助于脓毒症，但脑膜炎球菌病特别与快速发展的严重感染性休克相关（LOS 由脑膜炎奈瑟菌大量脱落）。\n\n（选项 E）中毒性休克综合征是由于金黄色葡萄球菌超抗原外毒素引起的，导致 T 细胞广泛激活，并大量释放炎症细胞因子。患者通常表现为循环衰竭、器官衰竭和红皮病（看起来像晒伤的弥漫性斑丘疹）。瘀点和瘀斑是不典型的。\n\n教育目标：脑膜炎奈瑟菌可导致先前健康的年轻人发生脓毒症和快速循环衰竭。脂寡糖是病原体外膜中的一种毒力因子，是疾病严重程度的主要潜在原因。"
