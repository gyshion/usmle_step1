    "en": "A 22-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to fatigue and sore throat for the past few days. The throat discomfort has caused her to be unable to eat or drink without significant pain. Acetaminophen improves the pain slightly, but her oral intake has been poor. The patient recently started taking antithyroid medication for Graves disease. She has no other medical conditions and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Weight is 67 kg (148 lb), decreased from 68.5 kg (151 lb) a week ago. Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 102/68 mm Hg, and pulse is 130/min. Physical examination shows an erythematous pharynx with shallow mucosal ulcerations and a normal-sized thyroid. Mucous membranes appear dry. The abdomen is soft and nontender. No tremor is seen with outstretching of the hands.",

    "en": "This patient has a sore throat, fever, and pharyngeal ulcers. Although this constellation of symptoms often occurs as a consequence of viral upper respiratory tract infection, the recent initiation of antithyroid medication for GRAVES disease should raise strong suspicion for drug-induced neutropenia.\n\nPatients with Graves disease are often treated initially with thionamide medications such as methimazole or propylthiouracil (PTU) to achieve a euthyroid state prior to radioiodine therapy or surgery. However, these medications cause severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <500/mm³) in approximately 1 in 200 individuals. This side effect of therapy is thought to occur due to the interaction of the thionamide with reactive oxidative products (eg, myeloperoxidase, hydrogen peroxide), leading to generation of drug metabolites (eg, propyl thioester, sulfonic acid) that covalently attach to the neutrophil surface. Antibodies then form against these new antigens (haptens), resulting in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.\n\nDrug-induced neutropenia most often presents with oropharyngeal ulcers and fever (ie, mucus membrane infection). Laboratory evaluation usually shows isolated leukopenia (eg, no anemia or thrombocytopenia). Because patients with drug-induced neutropenia are at risk for severe infections, the offending drug should be immediately discontinued. This usually resolves the neutropenia within 1-3 weeks.\n\n(Choice A) Patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (eg, Graves disease) are at risk for other autoimmune endocrinopathies, including adrenal insufficiency. However, acute adrenal insufficiency typically presents with refractory hypotension, vomiting, abdominal pain, and weakness. Pharyngitis would be atypical.\n\n(Choice C) Excessive suppression of thyroid function by antithyroid drugs can lead to a hypothyroid state, which can present with fatigue. However, patients with hypothyroidism demonstrate weight gain, not weight loss; other symptoms (eg, cold intolerance, hair and skin changes) are also usually present.\n\n(Choice D) Undertreatment of this patient's hyperthyroidism could result in a residual hyperthyroid state (ie, thyroid hormone-induced severe hypermetabolism), which can present with fever, tachycardia, and dehydration. However, hypertension and tremor would likely be present; pharyngeal infection is unexpected.\n\n(Choice E) Several viral infections (eg, HIV) can cause virus-induced lymphocyte destruction. Although the loss of lymphocytes from viral infection can lead to pharyngeal infection, the presence of fever and pharyngitis shortly after initiation of antithyroid medication is more suggestive of drug-induced neutropenia.\n\nEducational objective:\nDrug-induced neutropenia is the major side effect of the first-line medications used to treat Graves disease. Initial manifestations usually include fever or oropharyngeal ulcers.",
    "zh": "该患者出现咽喉痛、发烧和咽部溃疡。 尽管这种症状组合通常是病毒性上呼吸道感染的结果，但最近开始使用抗甲状腺药物治疗格雷夫斯病应该高度怀疑药物引起的中性粒细胞减少症。\n\n格雷夫斯病患者通常最初使用硫酰胺类药物（如甲巯咪唑或丙硫氧嘧啶，PTU）进行治疗，以在放射性碘治疗或手术前达到甲状腺功能正常状态。 然而，这些药物会导致大约 200 人中有 1 人发生严重的中性粒细胞减少症（绝对中性粒细胞计数 <500/mm³）。 这种治疗的副作用被认为是由硫酰胺与活性氧化产物（例如，髓过氧化物酶，过氧化氢）相互作用引起的，导致产生与中性粒细胞表面共价结合的药物代谢物（例如，丙硫酯，磺酸）。 然后，针对这些新抗原（半抗原）形成抗体，导致抗体依赖性细胞毒性。\n\n药物引起的中性粒细胞减少症最常表现为口咽溃疡和发烧（即，黏膜感染）。 实验室评估通常显示孤立的白细胞减少症（例如，无贫血或血小板减少症）。 由于药物引起的中性粒细胞减少症患者有发生严重感染的风险，应立即停用致病药物。 这通常会在 1-3 周内解决中性粒细胞减少症。\n\n(选项 A) 患有自身免疫性甲状腺疾病（例如，格雷夫斯病）的患者有发生其他自身免疫性内分泌病的风险，包括肾上腺皮质功能不全。 然而，急性肾上腺皮质功能不全通常表现为顽固性低血压、呕吐、腹痛和乏力。 咽炎是不典型的。\n\n(选项 C) 抗甲状腺药物过度抑制甲状腺功能会导致甲状腺功能减退状态，可能出现疲劳。 然而，甲状腺功能减退症患者表现为体重增加，而不是体重减轻； 其他症状（例如，畏寒、毛发和皮肤变化）也通常存在。\n\n(选项 D) 对该患者的甲状腺功能亢进症治疗不足可能导致残留的甲状腺功能亢进状态（即，甲状腺激素引起的严重代谢亢进），可能表现为发烧、心动过速和脱水。 然而，高血压和震颤很可能存在； 咽部感染是意料之外的。\n\n(选项 E) 几种病毒感染（例如，HIV）可导致病毒引起的淋巴细胞破坏。 尽管病毒感染导致的淋巴细胞丢失可导致咽部感染，但在开始抗甲状腺药物治疗后不久出现发烧和咽炎更提示药物引起的中性粒细胞减少症。\n\n教育目标：\n药物引起的中性粒细胞减少症是用于治疗格雷夫斯病的一线药物的主要副作用。 最初的表现通常包括发烧或口咽溃疡。"
