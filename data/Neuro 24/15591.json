    "en": "Neoplastic cord compression most commonly results from local extension of vertebral metastases (neoplastic cells) into the epidural space. The tumors can encase the thecal sac and cause venous obstruction, leading to vasogenic edema, cord ischemia, and infarction. Presenting symptoms depend on the level of cord involvement but typically include severe back pain (often worse at night) that progresses to include motor weakness and/or sensory deficits. Urinary and fecal retention or incontinence are common late-stage findings. MRI is diagnostic. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Intramedullary metastases (malignant cells within the intramedullary spinal cord) are very rare and usually associated with lung cancer. Because of the tumor location within the spinal cord, as opposed to an adjacent structure, Brown-Séquard syndrome (i.e., ipsilateral hemiplegia, contralateral sensory loss) is a common presentation.\n\n(Choice B) Compression fractures are common in elderly patients, particularly those with osteoporosis, and can cause severe back pain. Although pathologic fractures can occur due to vertebral metastases, subsequent cord compression due to retropulsed bone fragments occurs only rarely and is a less common cause of cord compression than direct epidural invasion by the tumor mass.\n\n(Choice D) Intervertebral disc herniation can cause back pain and spinal cord compression but more commonly causes focal radiculopathy due to nerve root compression (eg, sciatica). In addition, this patient's weight loss and abnormal prostate examination are more suggestive of neoplastic cord compression.\n\n(Choice E) Spondylosis (age-related degeneration of the spinal column) can cause spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal) with cord compression, typically due to osteophyte formation or thickening of the ligamentum flavum. However, symptoms are typically slowly progressive rather than of rapid onset, as seen in this patient.\n\nEducational objective:\nNeoplastic spinal cord compression most commonly results from local extension of vertebral metastases into the epidural space. Presenting symptoms typically include severe back pain (often worse at night), motor weakness, and/or sensory deficits. Urinary and fecal retention or incontinence are common late-stage findings. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "肿瘤性脊髓压迫最常见的原因是椎体转移瘤（肿瘤细胞）局部延伸至硬膜外腔。肿瘤可以包绕硬膜囊并导致静脉阻塞，进而导致血管源性水肿、脊髓缺血和梗死。出现的症状取决于脊髓受累的水平，但通常包括严重的背痛（常在夜间加重），并进展为运动无力和/或感觉缺失。尿潴留和粪便失禁是常见的晚期表现。MRI有助于诊断。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项 A) 髓内转移瘤（脊髓内的恶性细胞）非常罕见，通常与肺癌有关。由于肿瘤位于脊髓内，而不是邻近结构，Brown-Séquard综合征（即同侧偏瘫、对侧感觉缺失）是一种常见表现。\n\n(选项 B) 压缩性骨折在老年患者中很常见，尤其是在患有骨质疏松症的患者中，并可引起严重的背痛。尽管椎体转移瘤可引起病理性骨折，但继发的由于骨碎片后突导致的脊髓压迫仅发生于极少数情况，且不及肿瘤肿块直接侵入硬膜外腔引起的脊髓压迫常见。\n\n(选项 D) 椎间盘突出可引起背痛和脊髓压迫，但更常见的是由于神经根压迫（例如坐骨神经痛）引起局部神经根病。此外，该患者的体重下降和前列腺异常检查更提示肿瘤性脊髓压迫。\n\n(选项 E) 脊椎病（脊柱的年龄相关性退变）可引起脊髓狭窄（脊髓管狭窄）伴脊髓压迫，通常是由于骨赘形成或黄韧带增厚所致。然而，症状通常是缓慢进展的，而不是像该患者那样快速发病。\n\n教学目标：\n肿瘤性脊髓压迫最常见的原因是椎体转移瘤局部延伸至硬膜外腔。出现的症状通常包括严重的背痛（常在夜间加重）、运动无力和/或感觉缺失。尿潴留和粪便失禁是常见的晚期表现。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of neoplastic spinal cord compression, its common causes, and clinical presentation. It also requires differentiating it from other causes of back pain and neurological deficits in elderly patients.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the red flags for malignancy (weight loss, prostate nodule) and the typical presentation of spinal cord compression (severe back pain, motor weakness, sensory deficits). Rule out other common causes like compression fractures, disc herniation, and spondylosis based on the clinical context and typical progression.",
