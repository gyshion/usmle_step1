  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient presents with a white pupillary reflex (leukocoria), which is a sign of retinoblastoma. The family history of a father diagnosed with a retinal neoplasm during childhood and enucleation of his eye strongly suggests a hereditary form of retinoblastoma. Hereditary retinoblastoma is caused by a germline mutation in the Rb tumor suppressor gene. Individuals with hereditary retinoblastoma have an increased risk of developing secondary tumors, particularly osteosarcoma, later in life, due to the \"two-hit hypothesis\" where the remaining functional Rb allele is inactivated. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "患者出现瞳孔反射发白（白瞳症），这是视网膜母细胞瘤的征兆。 父亲在儿童时期被诊断患有视网膜肿瘤并摘除眼球的家族史强烈提示遗传性视网膜母细胞瘤。 遗传性视网膜母细胞瘤是由 Rb 抑癌基因的种系突变引起的。 由于“双击学说”，携带遗传性视网膜母细胞瘤的个体在以后的生活中发生继发性肿瘤（尤其是骨肉瘤）的风险增加，因为剩余的功能性 Rb 等位基因失活。 {{exhibit_2}}"
