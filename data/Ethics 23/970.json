    "en": "A medical intern is working on the inpatient wards at a busy community hospital. During rounds, the team evaluates a new patient admitted for worsening congestive heart failure. The patient's past medical history includes atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and pulmonary hypertension. Current medications include metformin, aspirin, and enalapril. On previous admissions, the patient admitted to using cocaine recreationally with friends and admits to the intern that his last use was today. The attending physician asks the intern to start the patient on propranolol for his heart condition; he will be expected to continue this medication following hospital discharge. After rounds, the intern recalls that during medical school she learned that beta adrenergic antagonists can interact poorly with cocaine.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Interns on a medical team should not blindly follow the orders of attending physicians or physicians who have more seniority. As part of the educational process, it is essential to UNDERSTAND the clinical reasoning behind team members' decisions. It is in the best interest of both the intern and the patient to resolve potential problems before proceeding. This concept applies to the relationship between residents and attending physicians, physicians working in parallel (eg, anesthesiologist and surgeon), and medical students and other medical staff. The best approach is to respectfully discuss the issue directly with the attending physician and inquire why the decision was made. In this case, the attending physician may feel that the cardioprotective benefit of a beta-adrenergic antagonist outweighs the potential risk of an interaction with cocaine.\n\n(Choice A) It is unethical to blindly follow an order from an attending physician when there is concern about safety and patient care. The best course of action is to discuss the issue with the other physician and reach a consensus.\n\n(Choice B) Although seasoned nurses will have acquired a considerable amount of medical knowledge, it is not their job to decide between the differing opinions of 2 physicians. In addition, administering a medication that could have an adverse reaction is problematic, even if vital signs are being monitored.\n\n(Choice C) It is appropriate to explain the risks and benefits of the medication to the patient, who ultimately decides whether to take it. However, it is unprofessional to involve the patient before clarifying the rationale for the attending's recommendation.\n\n(Choice D) It is unprofessional to refuse to follow the suggestions of an attending physician without first consulting him or her (if the attending is directly responsible for care of the patient, as in this case).\n\nEducational objective:\nPhysicians are ethically obligated to question orders that raise concern about potential harm to patients. Issues should initially be discussed directly with the physician who made the order and not involve ancillary staff.",
    "zh": "医疗团队中的实习医生不应盲目服从主治医师或资深医师的医嘱。作为教育过程的一部分，理解团队成员决策背后的临床推理至关重要。在采取行动之前解决潜在问题，这符合实习医生和患者的最大利益。这一概念适用于住院医师与主治医师、并行工作的医师（例如，麻醉师和外科医生）以及医学生和其他医务人员之间的关系。最好的方法是尊重地直接与主治医师讨论这个问题，并询问做出决定的原因。在这种情况下，主治医师可能认为β-肾上腺素能拮抗剂的心脏保护作用大于与可卡因相互作用的潜在风险。\n\n（选项 A）当对安全和患者护理有顾虑时，盲目服从主治医师的医嘱是不道德的。最佳的行动方案是与其他医师讨论这个问题并达成共识。\n\n（选项 B）尽管经验丰富的护士将获得大量的医学知识，但她们的工作不是在两位医师的不同意见之间做出决定。此外，即使正在监测生命体征，给药可能产生不良反应也是有问题的。\n\n（选项 C）向患者解释药物的风险和益处是合适的，患者最终决定是否服用。然而，在阐明主治医师建议的理由之前让患者参与是不专业的。\n\n（选项 D）在没有首先咨询主治医师的情况下拒绝听从主治医师的建议是不专业的（如果主治医师在此情况下直接负责患者的护理）。\n\n教育目标：\n医师有伦理义务质疑引起对患者潜在危害担忧的医嘱。问题应首先直接与下达医嘱的医师讨论，不应涉及辅助人员。"

    "en": "This question tests the ethical and professional responsibility of an intern when faced with a potentially harmful medication order from an attending physician, especially considering a known drug interaction. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the reasoning behind medical decisions and advocating for patient safety.\n\nThe best approach is to first identify the potential harm (drug interaction), then consider the appropriate steps to address the concern. This involves direct communication with the attending physician to understand their rationale and collaboratively find a safer solution, rather than blindly following orders or involving other staff prematurely.",
