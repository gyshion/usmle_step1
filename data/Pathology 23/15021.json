  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Patients with FAP usually develop innumerable colonic polyps in the second or third decade of life. The lifetime risk that ≥1 of these polyps will transform to invasive colon cancer is nearly 100%. Therefore, prophylactic colectomy is usually advised.\nFAP is caused by a germline mutation in the tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Although it is an autosomal dominant disorder, a spontaneous mutation to the other (wild-type) APC gene is required for expression (which usually occurs in the patient's teens or twenties). APC encodes for a protein that degrades beta-catenin. Loss of function of the APC protein increases cellular concentrations of beta-catenin, which activates transcriptional proteins that lead to intestinal crypt hyperproliferation; accumulation of subsequent mutations leads to development of polyps.\nAPC plays a crucial role in generation of both hereditary and spontaneous forms of colon cancer. Nearly 80% of spontaneous colon cancer has spontaneous mutations to both sets of APC genes; the remainder typically has activating mutations to downstream products of the APC pathway.\n(Choice A) RAS oncogene mutations lead to constitutively active growth signal transduction. RAS mutations (particularly KRAS) are present in approximately 50% of sporadic colon cancers. However, FAP is not caused by an initial mutation in RAS.\n(Choice B) TP53 acts as a transcriptional activator of genes that inhibit cellular growth. TP53 mutations are the most common genetic abnormality seen in all cancers, and they are present in approximately 75% of colorectal cancers. Germline mutation to TP53 is associated with Li Fraumeni syndrome; these patients have increased risk of many tumor types but, for unclear reasons, are not at particularly increased risk for colorectal cancer.\n(Choice C) Lynch syndrome is associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer due to germline mutation to one of the DNA mismatch repair genes (eg, MSH2/6, MLH1). These patients do not have extensive polyposis in the colon but are very likely to develop colon cancer (from dysplasia in flat colonic mucosa).\n(Choice D) Telomerase prevents the shortening of telomeres during cellular division, which extends the life of the cell. Telomerase activity is increased in many cancer types but is not especially linked to colorectal cancer. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "家族性腺瘤性息肉病 (FAP)。FAP 患者通常在第二或第三个十年中发生无数结肠息肉。这些息肉中 ≥1 个转化为浸润性结肠癌的终生风险接近 100%。因此，通常建议预防性结肠切除术。\nFAP 由肿瘤抑制基因腺瘤性息肉病 (APC) 的生殖细胞突变引起。虽然这是一种常染色体显性遗传病，但需要对另一个（野生型）APC 基因进行自发突变才能表达（通常发生在患者的青少年或二十多岁时）。APC 编码降解 β-连环蛋白的蛋白质。APC 蛋白的功能丧失会增加细胞内 β-连环蛋白的浓度，从而激活导致肠隐窝过度增殖的转录蛋白；随后的突变积累导致息肉的发生。\nAPC 在产生遗传性和自发性结肠癌中起关键作用。大约 80% 的自发性结肠癌对两组 APC 基因都有自发突变；其余的通常对 APC 通路下游产物有激活突变。\n(选项 A) RAS 癌基因突变导致组成性激活的生长信号转导。大约 50% 的散发性结肠癌存在 RAS 突变（特别是 KRAS）。但是，FAP 并非由 RAS 的初始突变引起。\n(选项 B) TP53 充当抑制细胞生长的基因的转录激活剂。TP53 突变是所有癌症中最常见的基因异常，大约 75% 的结直肠癌存在这种突变。TP53 的生殖细胞突变与 Li Fraumeni 综合征相关；这些患者患多种肿瘤类型的风险增加，但由于不明原因，患结直肠癌的风险并未特别增加。\n(选项 C) Lynch 综合征与遗传性非息肉病性结直肠癌相关，这是由于一个 DNA 错配修复基因（例如，MSH2/6、MLH1）的生殖细胞突变所致。这些患者的结肠中没有广泛的息肉病，但很可能发生结肠癌（来自扁平结肠粘膜的异型增生）。\n(选项 D) 端粒酶可防止细胞分裂过程中端粒缩短，从而延长细胞寿命。许多癌症类型中端粒酶活性增加，但与结直肠癌没有特别的联系。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "The question asks about the most likely effect of a germline mutation in a patient with findings suggestive of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).
