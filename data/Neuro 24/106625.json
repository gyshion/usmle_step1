    "en": "A 60-year-old woman is enrolled in a longitudinal research study for individuals with a family history of Parkinson disease. The patient's mother died from complications of idiopathic Parkinson disease 2 years ago. The study consists of symptom questionnaires, serial neurologic examinations, and brain imaging. Review of systems is notable for chronic constipation, which is progressively worsening. The patient also recently began having difficulty double-clicking her mouse. Vital signs show orthostatic hypotension. Neurologic examination reveals normal muscle bulk, tone, and strength with no abnormal movements. Postural stability is maintained. Gait speed and stride length are normal. Advanced brain imaging reveals 50% loss of nigrostriatal volume. Compared to an age-matched healthy individual, which of the following is most likely present in this patient's remaining nigrostriatal neurons?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a family history of Parkinson disease (PD) and is exhibiting prodromal symptoms (chronic constipation, difficulty with fine motor tasks like double-clicking, orthostatic hypotension) and neuroimaging findings (50% loss of nigrostriatal volume) consistent with early or preclinical Parkinson disease. The question asks about the state of the remaining nigrostriatal neurons. In the prodromal phase of PD, there is significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). However, compensatory mechanisms are activated to maintain dopamine signaling. One such mechanism is the UPREGULATION of postsynaptic dopamine receptors (particularly D2R) in the striatum. This upregulation helps to amplify the signal from the remaining dopamine released into the synapse. As nigrostriatal dopamine depletion worsens, these compensatory mechanisms are eventually overwhelmed, leading to the onset of motor symptoms.\n\n(A) Blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors is not characteristic of PD. It is seen in conditions like drug-induced parkinsonism where dopamine antagonists are used.\n(B) Decreased tyrosine hydroxylase activity would lead to decreased dopamine synthesis, which is a consequence of neuronal loss, not a compensatory mechanism in the remaining neurons.\n(C) Increased presynaptic dopamine reuptake would decrease synaptic dopamine levels, which is counterproductive to compensating for dopamine deficiency.\n(D) Increased synaptic dopamine concentration is the opposite of what is occurring due to neuronal loss. While compensatory mechanisms aim to maximize the effect of available dopamine, the overall concentration is reduced.\n\nKey clinical pearls: Prodromal symptoms of PD can precede motor symptoms by years. Nonmotor symptoms like constipation, REM sleep behavior disorder, and autonomic dysfunction are common. Compensatory mechanisms, such as receptor upregulation, can mask the underlying pathology until significant neuronal loss occurs.",
    "zh": "该患者有帕金森病 (PD) 家族史，并表现出前驱症状（慢性便秘、难以进行精细运动任务，如双击、体位性低血压）和神经影像学表现（黑质纹状体体积减少50%），与早期或临床前期帕金森病一致。 题目询问剩余的黑质纹状体神经元的状态。 在PD的前驱期，黑质致密部 (SNpc) 的多巴胺能神经元会大量丢失。 然而，会激活代偿机制以维持多巴胺信号传导。 其中一种机制是突触后多巴胺受体（特别是D2R）在纹状体中的上调。 这种上调有助于放大来自释放到突触中的剩余多巴胺的信号。 随着黑质纹状体多巴胺耗竭的恶化，这些代偿机制最终会被淹没，导致运动症状的出现。\n\n(A) 突触后多巴胺受体阻滞并非PD的特征。 它见于药物引起的帕金森病等情况，其中使用多巴胺拮抗剂。\n(B) 酪氨酸羟化酶活性降低会导致多巴胺合成减少，这是神经元丢失的结果，而不是剩余神经元的代偿机制。\n(C) 突触前多巴胺再摄取增加会降低突触多巴胺水平，这不利于补偿多巴胺缺乏。\n(D) 突触多巴胺浓度增加与由于神经元丢失而发生的情况相反。 虽然代偿机制旨在最大限度地发挥可用多巴胺的作用，但总浓度会降低。\n\n关键临床要点：PD的前驱症状可能在运动症状出现前数年。 便秘、REM睡眠行为障碍和自主神经功能障碍等非运动症状很常见。 代偿机制（如受体上调）可以掩盖潜在的病理学，直到发生明显的神经元丢失。"
