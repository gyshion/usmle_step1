    "en": "A 65-year-old immigrant from Eastern Europe comes to the physician because of a four-week history of low-grade fever, multiple joint pains, and a well-demarcated erythematous rash on his face and trunk. The patient denies hair loss, mucosal ulceration, or photosensitivity. His serum test is positive for the presence of anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) in very high titers. The patient reports a past medical history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and \"cardiac rhythm abnormalities.\" This patient should be specifically questioned about the intake of which of the following medications?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) should be considered in patients presenting with signs and symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Both hydralazine and procainamide are categorized as high-risk drugs for the development of DILE. Procainamide is metabolized via hepatic acetylation. Individuals who are \"slow acetylators\" are at greatest risk for DILE, while individuals who metabolize the drug more rapidly are less likely to experience this adverse effect. Drug-induced lupus erythematosus occurs in up to 20% of patients taking procainamide.\n\nThe presence of autoantibodies can be used to help differentiate DILE from SLE. Although anti-histone antibodies are very common in DILE, they are seen in only 50% of SLE patients. Likewise, anti-dsDNA antibodies are present in 80% of SLE patients, but are rarely seen in DILE. Anti-nuclear antibodies are frequently positive in both diseases.\n\n(Choice A) The most notable side effects of amiodarone include thyroid dysfunction, lung fibrosis, and liver toxicity, as well as a blue or grey discoloration of the skin.\n\n(Choice B) The most frequently encountered adverse effects of nonselective beta-blockers are negative inotropy and bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma or COPD.\n\n(Choice C) The adverse effects of lidocaine are characteristically nonfocal neurologic signs such as tremor, drowsiness, and change in mental status, although lidocaine can also lead to generalized seizures.\n\n(Choice E) Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker and class 4 antiarrhythmic. The most frequently noted adverse reactions include negative inotropy, constipation, and gingival hyperplasia.\n\n(Choice F) Adenosine is used as a vasodilator in cardiac stress tests and as a fast acting antiarrhythmic for stopping acute supraventricular tachycardias. Adenosine has an extremely short half-life, and its immediate adverse effects include chest burning, flushing, and transient hypotension.\n\nEducational objective:\nProcainamide and hydralazine have the highest risk of causing drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE), which is characterized by the development of lupus-like symptoms in addition to positive ANA and anti-histone antibodies. Unlike with SLE, anti-dsDNA antibodies are rarely seen.",
    "zh": "对于出现系统性红斑狼疮 (SLE) 体征和症状的患者，应考虑药物诱发的红斑狼疮 (DILE)。肼屈嗪和普鲁卡因酰胺都被归类为发展为 DILE 的高风险药物。普鲁卡因酰胺通过肝乙酰化代谢。作为“慢乙酰化者”的个体患 DILE 的风险最高，而药物代谢更快的个体不太可能出现这种不良反应。药物诱发的红斑狼疮发生在高达 20% 的服用普鲁卡因酰胺的患者中。\n\n自身抗体的存在可用于帮助区分 DILE 和 SLE。尽管抗组蛋白抗体在 DILE 中非常常见，但在 SLE 患者中仅观察到 50%。同样，抗 dsDNA 抗体存在于 80% 的 SLE 患者中，但在 DILE 中很少见。抗核抗体在两种疾病中均呈阳性。\n\n(选项 A) 胺碘酮最显着的副作用包括甲状腺功能障碍、肺纤维化和肝毒性，以及皮肤呈蓝色或灰色变色。\n\n(选项 B) 非选择性 β 受体阻滞剂最常遇到的不良反应是负性肌力和哮喘或 COPD 患者的支气管收缩。\n\n(选项 C) 利多卡因的不良反应通常是非局灶性神经系统体征，如震颤、嗜睡和精神状态改变，尽管利多卡因也可能导致全身性癫痫发作。\n\n(选项 E) 维拉帕米是一种钙通道阻滞剂和 4 类抗心律失常药。最常观察到的不良反应包括负性肌力、便秘和牙龈增生。\n\n(选项 F) 腺苷在心脏负荷试验中用作血管扩张剂，并用作快速起效的抗心律失常药，以阻止急性室上性心动过速。腺苷的半衰期极短，其直接不良反应包括胸部烧灼感、潮红和短暂性低血压。\n\n教育目标：\n普鲁卡因酰胺和肼屈嗪导致药物诱发性红斑狼疮 (DILE) 的风险最高，其特征是在 ANA 和抗组蛋白抗体呈阳性的基础上出现类似狼疮的症状。与 SLE 不同的是，抗 dsDNA 抗体很少见。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE), specifically which medications are most commonly associated with its development. It also tests the ability to differentiate DILE from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) based on antibody profiles. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the signs and symptoms of lupus (joint pain, rash, fever) in the context of a patient with cardiac history. Recall the medications known to cause DILE, particularly procainamide and hydralazine, and select the most likely culprit based on the provided options.",
