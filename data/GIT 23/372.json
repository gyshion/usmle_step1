    "en": "A 34-year-old woman comes to the office with recent onset of malaise. The patient reports feeling \"run down and under the weather\" but otherwise has no symptoms. She is an avid cyclist and is concerned about her ability to participate in a charity race in 3 days. The patient works as a nurse at a local hospital and lives at home with her husband and 2-year-old son. She occasionally smokes when she goes out, but since she began feeling ill, she no longer has the desire to smoke. Physical examination is notable for hepatomegaly. Laboratory results are as follows:\n\nAnti-HAV IgM positive\nAnti-HAV IgG negative\nHBsAg negative\nHBeAg negative\nAnti-HBs positive\nAnti-HBc negative\nAnti-HBe negative\nAnti-HCV negative",

    "en": "Hepatitis A infection is caused by an RNA picornavirus with an average incubation period of 30 days. Transmission occurs through the fecal-oral route and is common in areas with overcrowding and poor sanitation. Outbreaks frequently result from contaminated water or food, with raw or steamed shellfish being the typical (and classically tested) culprit in the United States. Onset is acute, and symptoms can include malaise, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, mild abdominal pain, and an aversion to smoking (for unclear reasons). Hepatomegaly is commonly seen. Serum aminotransferases spike early in the illness, followed by increases in bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Anti-HAV IgM is positive and is a marker of active disease. Hepatitis A infection is a self-limiting disease and does not progress to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment is largely supportive, with complete recovery expected in 3-6 weeks. People considered at high risk (eg, those living in or traveling to endemic areas, those with chronic liver disease or clotting factor disorders, men who have sex with men) should be given the hepatitis A vaccine as prophylaxis. Unvaccinated close contacts of individuals with hepatitis A should receive the vaccine or immune globulin.\n\n(Choices A, B, and E) Unsanitary tattooing (eg, with contaminated needles), accidental needlesticks, and unprotected sexual intercourse are important risk factors for hepatitis B and C. This patient is positive for HBsAb, which confirms that she has antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen and, given the negative anti-HBc, suggests that she has been vaccinated and is now immune.\n\n(Choice C) The consumption of boiled eggs is not commonly associated with hepatitis A infection. If the boiled eggs were insufficiently cooked, Salmonella infection would be more likely.",
    "zh": "甲型肝炎感染是由RNA小核糖核酸病毒引起的，平均潜伏期为30天。传播途径为粪-口途径，在人口拥挤和卫生条件差的地区很常见。暴发通常由受污染的水或食物引起，在美国，生食或蒸煮的贝类是典型的（也是经典考点）罪魁祸首。起病急骤，症状可包括乏力、疲劳、食欲不振、恶心、呕吐、轻度腹痛以及对吸烟的厌恶（原因不明）。常可见肝肿大。血清转氨酶在疾病早期升高，随后胆红素和碱性磷酸酶也会升高。抗-HAV IgM阳性，是活动性疾病的标志。甲型肝炎感染是一种自限性疾病，不会进展为慢性肝炎、肝硬化或肝细胞癌。治疗主要以支持性治疗为主，预计在3-6周内完全康复。对于被认为高危的人群（例如，居住或旅行到流行地区的人、患有慢性肝病或凝血因子疾病的人、男男性行为者），应接种甲型肝炎疫苗作为预防。未接种疫苗的甲型肝炎患者的密切接触者应接种疫苗或免疫球蛋白。\n\n（选项 A、B 和 E）不卫生的纹身（例如，使用受污染的针头）、意外的针刺以及无保护的性行为是乙型和丙型肝炎的重要危险因素。该患者HBsAb阳性，证实其对乙型肝炎表面抗原具有抗体，并且考虑到抗-HBc阴性，表明她已接种疫苗并已获得免疫。\n\n（选项 C）食用煮鸡蛋通常与甲型肝炎感染无关。如果煮鸡蛋没有煮熟，则更有可能发生沙门氏菌感染。"
