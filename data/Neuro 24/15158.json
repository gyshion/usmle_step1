  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is C. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVTs) are arrhythmias that occur intermittently and have abrupt onset and offset. They arise from regions of abnormal electrical activity that occur in the atrioventricular node, an accessory pathway, or the atria. Radiofrequency ablation can be used to destroy the inciting cardiomyocytes and cure the arrhythmia.\n\nThe crista terminalis, located in the right atrium, is a common site of origination for atrial PSVT. The right phrenic nerve, which innervates the right hemidiaphragm, courses along the pericardium that overlies the right atrium and is at risk of injury during procedures that target structures in or near the right atrium (eg, crista terminalis, cavotricuspid isthmus, right-sided pulmonary veins). Such injury is typically recognized by elevation of the right hemidiaphragm on chest x-ray.\n\n(Choice A) The spinal root of the accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI) courses superiorly from the upper spinal cord through the foramen magnum to join with the cranial root. The combined roots then exit the cranium through the jugular foramen to provide motor innervation to the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. There is risk of injury during biopsy or lymph node dissection in the neck, but not during procedures involving the right atrium.\n\n(Choice B) The long thoracic nerve arises from the lower cervical spinal cord and courses laterally and inferiorly to provide motor innervation to the serratus anterior muscle. Injury can occur during breast surgery or chest-tube placement (resulting in a \"winged\" scapula); however, due to its lateral location, the nerve is not at risk of injury during procedures involving the right atrium.\n\n(Choice D) The recurrent laryngeal nerve is a branch of the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) that courses underneath the aortic arch on the left and the brachiocephalic trunk on the right to provide motor, sensory, and parasympathetic innervation to the upper esophagus, trachea, and portions of the larynx. It is at risk of injury during thyroid surgery but not during procedures involving the right atrium.\n\n(Choice E) The sympathetic trunk parallels the length of the spinal column on both sides and provides sympathetic innervation throughout the body. Injury leads to Horner syndrome (ie, miosis, ptosis, anhydrosis) and can occur during spinal surgery, but not during procedures involving the right atrium.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe right phrenic nerve courses along the pericardium overlying the right side of the heart and is at risk for injury during procedures in or near the right atrium (eg, radiofrequency ablation). Right phrenic nerve injury is typically recognized by elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.",
    "zh": "正确答案是C。阵发性室上性心动过速(PSVTs) 是一种间歇性发生，具有突然发生和停止的心律失常。它们源于房室结、副通道或心房中发生的异常电活动区域。射频消融术可用于破坏诱发的心肌细胞并治愈心律失常。\n\n嵴界嵴位于右心房，是心房性PSVT的常见起源部位。支配右半膈的右膈神经沿着覆盖右心房的心包走行，并且在针对右心房内或附近结构（例如，嵴界嵴、腔三尖瓣峡部、右侧肺静脉）的手术中存在受伤风险。这种损伤通常通过胸部X线片上右侧半膈抬高来识别。\n\n(选项A) 副神经的脊髓根（脑神经XI）从上颈髓向上走行，穿过枕骨大孔，与颅根汇合。然后，联合的根通过颈静脉孔离开颅腔，为胸锁乳突肌和斜方肌提供运动神经支配。颈部活检或淋巴结清扫术期间存在受伤风险，但涉及右心房的手术除外。\n\n(选项B) 胸长神经起源于下颈髓，沿侧向和向下走行，为前锯肌提供运动神经支配。手术中可能发生损伤（导致“翼状”肩胛骨）；然而，由于其侧向位置，该神经在涉及右心房的手术中没有受伤风险。\n\n(选项D) 喉返神经是迷走神经（脑神经X）的分支，在左侧主动脉弓下方和右侧头臂干下方走行，为上食管、气管和喉的一部分提供运动、感觉和副交感神经支配。它在甲状腺手术期间有受伤风险，但在涉及右心房的手术中没有受伤风险。\n\n(选项E) 交感干沿脊柱的两侧平行延伸，并为全身提供交感神经支配。损伤会导致Horner综合征（即，瞳孔缩小、上睑下垂、无汗症），并且可能发生在脊柱手术期间，但不是在涉及右心房的手术期间。\n\n教育目标：\n右膈神经沿着覆盖心脏右侧的心包走行，并且在右心房内或附近的手术（例如，射频消融术）中存在受伤风险。右膈神经损伤通常通过右半膈抬高来识别。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the anatomical relationships between the cardiac structures targeted for radiofrequency ablation and nearby nerves, specifically focusing on the risk of iatrogenic injury during electrophysiology procedures.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the anatomical location of the crista terminalis in the right atrium and recall the course of major nerves in the thoracic cavity, particularly those in close proximity to the right atrium and pericardium, to determine which nerve is most vulnerable to injury during ablation at that site.",
