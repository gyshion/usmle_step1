    "en": "A 13-year-old boy is evaluated for a possible inherited genetic defect. He has growth retardation, microcephaly, sun-sensitive skin, and recurrent infections. The patient is the second-born child of 2 first cousins. His parents and siblings are healthy, but 2 of his maternal cousins have similar signs and symptoms. Genetic analysis of the patient reveals a defect in the *BLM* gene, which codes for a DNA helicase.",

    "en": "This patient has Bloom syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by small stature, photosensitivity, immunodeficiency, and markedly increased cancer rates. It is caused by a mutation affecting DNA helicase. Helicases are enzymes that facilitate unwinding of the double helix during DNA replication and repair; dysfunction results in DNA instability and breakage.\n\nDNA replication normally occurs during the S (synthesis) phase of the cell cycle and is initiated as follows:\n\n*   First, the origin of replication is identified and bound by a multi-subunit protein (the origin recognition complex), which locally dissociates double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).\n*   Helicase subsequently binds to ssDNA at the origin of replication and moves into the replication fork, where it facilitates separation and unwinding of dsDNA.\n*   Then ssDNA binding proteins bind to and stabilize the unwound strands as they move away from the replication fork, preventing them from reannealing (Choice C).\n*   DNA unwinding induces strain on the DNA segment upstream of the helicases (positive supercoiling), and topoisomerase (DNA gyrase) relieves this tension by introducing transient single- or double-stranded nicks in the DNA (Choice A).\n*   (Choice D) Before DNA polymerase can begin synthesizing DNA, it requires an RNA primer made up of short RNA sequences base-paired to the parent DNA. This primer is synthesized by the enzyme primase (DNA-dependent RNA polymerase).\n*   (Choice E) DNA polymerase synthesizes new daughter DNA strands in the 5' to 3' direction. The leading strand is formed continuously, whereas the lagging strand is formed discontinuously (ie, multiple short DNA fragments called Okazaki fragments).\n*   (Choice F) Okazaki fragments are ultimately bound together by DNA ligase.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nDuring DNA replication and repair, helicase mediates the continuous unwinding of double-stranded DNA at the replication fork.",
    "zh": "该患者患有Bloom综合征，这是一种罕见的常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是身材矮小、畏光、免疫缺陷和癌症发生率显着增加。它是由影响DNA解旋酶的突变引起的。解旋酶是促进DNA复制和修复过程中双螺旋解开的酶；功能障碍会导致DNA不稳定和断裂。\n\nDNA复制通常发生在细胞周期的S（合成）期，其启动过程如下：\n\n*   首先，复制起始位点被识别并被多亚基蛋白（起始位点识别复合物）结合，该复合物将双链DNA (dsDNA) 局部解离成单链DNA (ssDNA)。\n*   随后，解旋酶与复制起始位点的ssDNA结合并进入复制叉，在那里促进dsDNA的分离和解旋。\n*   然后，ssDNA结合蛋白结合并稳定解旋链，使其远离复制叉，防止其重新退火（选项C）。\n*   DNA解旋会对解旋酶上游的DNA片段产生应变（正超螺旋），拓扑异构酶（DNA促旋酶）通过在DNA中引入瞬时单链或双链切口来缓解这种张力（选项A）。\n*   （选项D）在DNA聚合酶开始合成DNA之前，它需要由与亲代DNA碱基配对的短RNA序列组成的RNA引物。该引物由引物酶（DNA依赖性RNA聚合酶）合成。\n*   （选项E）DNA聚合酶以5'到3'方向合成新的子代DNA链。前导链连续形成，而滞后链不连续形成（即，称为冈崎片段的多个短DNA片段）。\n*   （选项F）冈崎片段最终被DNA连接酶连接在一起。\n\n教育目标：\n\n在DNA复制和修复过程中，解旋酶介导复制叉处双链DNA的连续解旋。"
