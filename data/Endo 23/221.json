  "explanation": {
    "en": "Craniopharyngiomas are tumors arising from remnants of Rathke's pouch. The anterior pituitary is formed from an out-pouching of the pharyngeal roof and is called Rathke's pouch. The posterior pituitary gland arises from an extension of the hypothalamic neurons. Together, the anterior and posterior pituitary glands lie in the sella turcica at the skull base.\n\nDuring the time of pituitary development, remnants of Rathke's pouch cells can remain in the diencephalon (the posterior region of the forebrain). Neoplastic transformation of these \"pouch cells\" is called a craniopharyngioma. Typically, craniopharyngiomas have three components: solid, comprised of the actual tumor cells; cystic, filled with \"machinery oil\" liquid; and a calcified component. Any suprasellar mass with three components is highly suggestive of craniopharyngioma. Craniopharyngioma symptoms include headaches, visual field defects, and hypopituitarism, evidenced by the growth retardation of this child. Ultimately, compression of the pituitary stalk by craniopharyngioma leads to hyperprolactinemia by loss of dopaminergic inhibition. Craniopharyngiomas are usually tumors of childhood, being most frequently discovered between the ages of 5 and 10 years of age.\n\n(Choice A) Prolactinomas are uncommon in young children. They typically appear as a homogenous mass when imaged.\n\n(Choice C) Gliomas can occur in the suprasellar region if they arise from the optic apparatus, but do not appear on imaging with the three components described above. Gliomas typically presents with visual symptoms, hypothalamic dysfunction, and hypopituitarism.\n\n(Choice D) Meningiomas are tumors of the leptomeninges, which is the lining of the brain. Hence, meningiomas can occur in any \"lined\" part of the brain including sellar and suprasellar regions. Meningiomas are usually homogeneous appearance on MRI and can be seen \"sticking\" to leptomeninges.\n\nEducational Objective:\n\n1. The anterior pituitary is formed from an out-pouching of the pharyngeal roof and is called Rathke's pouch. The posterior pituitary gland arises from an extension of the hypothalamic neurons.\n\n2. Craniopharyngiomas are tumors arising from Rathke's pouch remnants in the anterior pituitary. They characteristically have three components: solid, cystic, and calcified. They present during childhood, usually, with mass effect and visual deficits.",
    "zh": "颅咽管瘤是源于 Rathke 囊残余的肿瘤。垂体前叶由咽顶部的外突形成，称为 Rathke 囊。垂体后叶源于下丘脑神经元的延伸。垂体前叶和后叶共同位于颅底的蝶鞍内。\n\n在垂体发育期间，Rathke 囊细胞的残余可以保留在间脑（前脑的后部）。这些“囊细胞”的肿瘤性转化被称为颅咽管瘤。典型的颅咽管瘤有三个组成部分：实体，由实际的肿瘤细胞组成；囊性，充满“机油”液体；以及钙化成分。任何具有三个组成部分的鞍上肿块都高度提示颅咽管瘤。颅咽管瘤的症状包括头痛、视野缺损和垂体功能减退，这可从该儿童的生长迟缓中得到证实。最终，颅咽管瘤对垂体柄的压迫会导致多巴胺能抑制的丧失，从而导致高催乳素血症。颅咽管瘤通常是儿童时期的肿瘤，最常在 5 至 10 岁之间发现。\n\n（选项 A）催乳素瘤在幼儿中不常见。它们在成像时通常表现为均匀的肿块。\n\n（选项 C）神经胶质瘤如果起源于视神经装置，可以发生在鞍上区域，但在影像学上不会出现上述三个组成部分。神经胶质瘤通常表现为视觉症状、下丘脑功能障碍和垂体功能减退。\n\n（选项 D）脑膜瘤是脑膜（即脑的内衬）的肿瘤。因此，脑膜瘤可以发生在脑的任何“衬里”部分，包括鞍区和鞍上区域。脑膜瘤在 MRI 上通常表现为均匀外观，并且可以看到“粘附”到脑膜上。\n\n教育目标：\n\n1. 垂体前叶由咽顶部的外突形成，称为 Rathke 囊。垂体后叶源于下丘脑神经元的延伸。\n\n2. 颅咽管瘤是源于垂体前叶中 Rathke 囊残余的肿瘤。它们具有三个特征性组成部分：实体、囊性和钙化。它们通常在儿童时期出现，通常伴有占位效应和视觉缺陷。"
