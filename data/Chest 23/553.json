    "en": "A 56-year-old construction worker comes to the office after receiving a letter from his employer advising him of significant exposure to asbestos during a building project 25 years ago. He is currently asymptomatic and feels well. Medical conditions include hypertension and osteoarthritis, for which he takes amlodipine daily and ibuprofen as needed. The patient quit smoking 10 years ago and does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Physical examination is within normal limits. Chest imaging is normal. He is concerned about his risk of developing cancer. Due to his occupational exposure, this patient is at greatest risk of malignancy arising from which of the following?",

    "en": "Asbestos is a fiber composed of hydrated magnesium silicates commonly used in the shipbuilding, construction, and textile industries. Inhalation of fine asbestos fibers causes epithelial cell injury, activation of macrophages, and chronic interstitial inflammation and fibrosis.\n\nThe major clinical manifestations of asbestos exposure include the following:\n\n*   **Pleural disease** includes pleural effusions and pleural plaques. Pleural plaques are a hallmark of asbestos exposure that typically affect the parietal pleura along the lower lungs and diaphragm. The plaques are composed of discrete circumscribed areas of dense collagen that frequently become calcified.\n*   **Asbestosis** is characterized by progressive PULMONARY FIBROSIS that is most predominant in the lower lobes and by the presence of ASBESTOS BODIES (golden-brown beaded rods with translucent centers).\n*   **Bronchogenic carcinoma** is the most common malignancy associated with asbestos exposure. Smoking and asbestos exposure have a synergistic effect on the development of lung carcinoma, increasing the risk from 6-fold in nonsmoking patients with asbestos exposure to 60-fold in asbestos-exposed patients who smoke regularly.\n*   **Malignant mesothelioma** is a rare malignancy of the pleura for which asbestos is the only known environmental risk factor. It is less common than bronchogenic carcinoma in asbestos-exposed patients {{exhibit_1}}.\n\n(Choice B) Direct-acting alkylating agents and benzene exposure are associated with acute leukemias, which occur due to malignant proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells.\n\n(Choice C) Aflatoxin exposure, which can occur after exposure to contaminated crops (eg, peanuts, corn), is a chemical risk factor associated with hepatocellular cancer, although viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and alcohol abuse are more common risk factors.\n\n(Choice D) Epstein-Barr viral infection and heavy alcohol use, particularly when combined with smoking, increase the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer.\n\n(Choice E) Pancreatic cancer is strongly associated with tobacco use and obesity. However, this patient's asbestos exposure places him at higher risk of developing bronchogenic carcinoma.\n\n(Choice G) Beta-naphthylamine is used in aniline dyes and the rubber industry; it is associated with increased incidence of bladder carcinoma.\n\nEducational objective: Patients with a long history of asbestos exposure are at risk for developing asbestosis, pleural disease, and malignancies such as bronchogenic carcinoma and mesothelioma. Bronchogenic carcinoma is the most common malignancy in this population, although mesothelioma is more specific for asbestos exposure.",
    "zh": "石棉是一种由水合硅酸镁组成的纤维，常用于造船、建筑和纺织行业。吸入细小的石棉纤维会导致上皮细胞损伤、巨噬细胞活化以及慢性间质炎症和纤维化。\n\n石棉暴露的主要临床表现包括：\n\n*   **胸膜疾病**包括胸腔积液和胸膜斑。胸膜斑是石棉暴露的标志，通常影响下肺和膈肌沿线的壁层胸膜。这些斑块由离散的、局限的致密胶原区域组成，这些区域经常钙化。\n*   **石棉肺**的特征是进行性肺纤维化，主要发生在下叶，并存在**石棉小体**（金棕色珠状棒，具有半透明中心）。\n*   **支气管癌**是与石棉暴露相关的最常见的恶性肿瘤。吸烟和石棉暴露对肺癌的发生具有协同作用，使未吸烟的石棉暴露患者的风险增加6倍，而在经常吸烟的石棉暴露患者中，风险增加60倍。\n*   **恶性间皮瘤**是一种罕见的胸膜恶性肿瘤，石棉是其唯一的已知环境风险因素。在石棉暴露的患者中，其发生率低于支气管癌{{exhibit_1}}。\n\n（选项B）直接作用的烷化剂和苯暴露与急性白血病相关，这些白血病是由于造血干细胞的恶性增殖引起的。\n\n（选项C）黄曲霉毒素暴露，可在接触受污染的作物（如花生、玉米）后发生，是与肝细胞癌相关的化学危险因素，尽管病毒性肝炎、肝硬化和酗酒是更常见的危险因素。\n\n（选项D）EB病毒感染和大量饮酒，特别是与吸烟结合时，会增加鼻咽癌的风险。\n\n（选项E）胰腺癌与烟草使用和肥胖密切相关。然而，该患者的石棉暴露使他罹患支气管癌的风险更高。\n\n（选项G）β-萘胺用于苯胺染料和橡胶工业；它与膀胱癌的发病率增加有关。\n\n教育目标：有长期石棉暴露史的患者有患石棉肺、胸膜疾病和恶性肿瘤（如支气管癌和间皮瘤）的风险。支气管癌是这一人群中最常见的恶性肿瘤，尽管间皮瘤对石棉暴露更具特异性。"
