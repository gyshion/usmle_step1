    "en": "A 23-year-old man is evaluated for prolonged paralysis following general anesthesia for an elective surgical procedure. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, succinylcholine was used for intubation, and anesthesia was maintained via propofol and fentanyl infusions. The patient has not had a return of neuromuscular function after several hours. His mother then discloses that she has also been \"slow to wake up\" from anesthesia.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient who developed prolonged muscle weakness (eg, failure of spontaneous respiration, voluntary muscle activity) after receiving succinylcholine most likely has pseudocholinesterase deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a genetic polymorphism in the *BCHE* gene.\n\nSuccinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent used to induce skeletal muscle relaxation during intubation and surgery. It acts as a competitive agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the motor endplate, where it induces PERSISTENT DEPOLARIZATION, leading to desensitization and skeletal muscle paralysis. Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma pseudocholinesterase; only around 10% of the administered dose reaches the neuromuscular junction, where it typically has a duration of action of <10 minutes.\n\nPatients with pseudocholinesterase deficiency are unable to metabolize succinylcholine, which leads to a large amount of the drug reaching the neuromuscular junction. Heterozygotes may experience double the normal duration of paralysis; homozygotes can have persistent paralysis for several hours.\n\n(Choice A) Decreased first-pass metabolism often occurs when drugs are administered via a nonoral route, allowing them to reach the systemic circulation without passing through the portal circulation and liver. Although succinylcholine is given intravenously, it is primarily inactivated in the plasma by pseudocholinesterase rather than the liver.\n\n(Choice C) The pharmacologic effects of drugs are typically enacted by the unbound (free) form of the drug. Therefore, increased binding to plasma proteins would likely decrease (rather than increase) the effect of the medication.\n\n(Choice D) Propofol is highly lipid soluble and has a very short duration of action (seconds) because of rapid redistribution from the brain (where it activates the GABA-A receptor) to other tissues (predominantly fat). However, propofol is a hypnotic agent; it does not cause muscle paralysis.\n\n(Choice E) Upregulation of target receptors would increase sensitivity to acetylcholine, which is one possible mechanism of spasticity in cerebral palsy. However, receptor upregulation occurs over many hours or days, not with a first dose.",
    "zh": "这位患者在接受琥珀酰胆碱后出现长时间的肌肉无力（例如，自发呼吸衰竭、随意肌活动），最有可能患有假性胆碱酯酶缺乏症，这是一种由*BCHE*基因的遗传多态性引起的常染色体隐性遗传病。\n\n琥珀酰胆碱是一种去极化神经肌肉阻滞剂，用于在插管和手术期间诱导骨骼肌松弛。它作为运动终板的烟碱乙酰胆碱受体的竞争性激动剂，在那里诱导持续去极化，导致脱敏和骨骼肌麻痹。琥珀酰胆碱可被血浆假性胆碱酯酶迅速水解；只有大约10%的给药剂量到达神经肌肉接头，其作用时间通常<10分钟。\n\n假性胆碱酯酶缺乏症患者无法代谢琥珀酰胆碱，这导致大量药物到达神经肌肉接头。杂合子可能会经历两倍于正常的麻痹持续时间；纯合子可能持续麻痹数小时。\n\n(选项A) 首过效应代谢降低通常发生在药物通过非口服途径给药时，使药物能够到达全身循环而无需通过门静脉循环和肝脏。尽管琥珀酰胆碱是静脉注射的，但它主要是在血浆中被假性胆碱酯酶灭活，而不是在肝脏中。\n\n(选项C) 药物的药理作用通常由药物的游离形式发挥。因此，与血浆蛋白结合增加可能会降低（而不是增加）药物的作用。\n\n(选项D) 丙泊酚具有高脂溶性，并且由于从大脑（在那里激活GABA-A受体）快速重新分布到其他组织（主要是脂肪），因此作用时间非常短（几秒钟）。然而，丙泊酚是一种催眠药；它不会引起肌肉麻痹。\n\n(选项E) 靶受体的上调会增加对乙酰胆碱的敏感性，这是脑瘫痉挛的一种可能机制。然而，受体上调发生在数小时或数天内，而不是第一次给药时。"
