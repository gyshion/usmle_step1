    "en": "A 55-year-old man is being evaluated for a 4-week history of right shoulder pain. The pain worsens when actively abducting the shoulder or when lying on the shoulder at night. The patient also has weakness with abduction and external rotation of the right shoulder. He has attempted treatment with over-the-counter analgesics with limited relief. MRI of the shoulder shows a partial rotator cuff tear, and the patient is scheduled for surgical repair. Immediately before the surgery, he receives anesthesia with an injection between the right anterior and middle scalene muscles in order to block the C3 through C7 nerve roots of the cervical and brachial plexuses.",
    "zh": "一名55岁男性正在接受评估，其有4周右肩疼痛病史。当主动外展肩关节或夜间侧卧时，疼痛加重。患者右肩外展和外旋时也有无力。他尝试了非处方止痛药治疗，但缓解有限。肩部MRI显示部分冈上肌撕裂，患者已安排手术修复。手术前，他接受了麻醉，在右侧前斜角肌和中斜角肌之间注射，以阻断颈部和臂丛的C3至C7神经根。"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The brachial plexus originates from the C5-T1 spinal nerve roots, which combine into 3 trunks and pass between the anterior and middle scalene muscles (scalenetrigone) in the posterior neck. The trunks then differentiate into divisions, cords, and terminal nerve branches. The brachial plexus supplies all sensory and motor innervation to the upper extremity, except for an area of skin near the axilla which is innervated by the intercostobrachial nerve and the trapezius muscle which is innervated by the accessory nerve (CN XI).\n\nAn interscalene nerve block is a regional anesthesia technique used for procedures involving the shoulder and upper arm. In this technique, anesthetic is administered to the brachial plexus roots and trunks between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. Anesthetic also traverses along the interscalene sheath and affects the roots of the phrenic nerve (C3-C5), which causes transient ipsilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. Therefore, an interscalene nerve block should be avoided in patients with conditions that could be worsened by unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis (eg, chronic lung disease, contralateral phrenic nerve dysfunction).\n\n(Choice A) The cricothyroid muscle is innervated by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (vagus nerve [CN X]) and helps tense the vocal cords, allowing higher-pitched speech.\n\n(Choice C) The intercostal muscles aid in expansion and contraction of the chest cavity during breathing. They are innervated by the intercostal nerves (ventral rami of thoracic spinal nerves).\n\n(Choice D) The platysma is a superficial neck muscle that covers the anterior neck from the clavicle to the mandible and tenses the skin of the neck and lower face. It is innervated by the cervical branch of the facial nerve (CN VII).\n\n(Choice E) The sternocleidomastoid, a superficial neck muscle controlling neck flexion and head rotation, is innervated by the accessory nerve (CN XI).\n\nEducational objective:\nAn interscalene nerve block is used to provide anesthesia for the shoulder and upper arm by anesthetizing the upper brachial plexus (C5-C7) as it passes between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. Anesthetic also traverses along the interscalene sheath, frequently resulting in transient ipsilateral diaphragmatic paralysis due to involvement of the phrenic nerve roots (C3-C5).",
    "zh": "臂丛神经起源于C5-T1脊神经根，它们合并成3个干，穿过后颈部的前斜角肌和中斜角肌（斜角肌三角）。然后这些干分化为分支、束和末梢神经分支。臂丛神经支配上肢的所有感觉和运动神经，除了腋窝附近的一片皮肤，它由肋间臂神经支配，以及斜方肌，它由副神经（脑神经XI）支配。\n\n斜角肌间神经阻滞是一种区域麻醉技术，用于涉及肩部和上臂的手术。在该技术中，麻醉剂被施用于前斜角肌和中斜角肌之间的臂丛神经根和干。麻醉剂也沿着斜角肌间鞘穿行，并影响膈神经（C3-C5）的根，这会导致一侧膈肌暂时性麻痹。因此，患有可因单侧膈肌麻痹而恶化的疾病的患者（例如，慢性肺病、对侧膈神经功能障碍）应避免进行斜角肌间神经阻滞。\n\n(选项A) 环甲肌由喉上神经的外支（迷走神经[CN X]）支配，有助于收紧声带，从而发出更高音调的声音。\n\n(选项C) 肋间肌有助于呼吸时胸腔的扩张和收缩。它们由肋间神经（胸脊神经的腹侧支）支配。\n\n(选项D) 颈阔肌是一块覆盖颈前部从锁骨到下颌骨的浅表颈部肌肉，收紧颈部和下脸的皮肤。它由面神经的颈支（脑神经VII）支配。\n\n(选项E) 胸锁乳突肌是一块控制颈部屈曲和头部旋转的浅表颈部肌肉，由副神经（脑神经XI）支配。\n\n教育目标：\n斜角肌间神经阻滞用于通过麻醉上臂丛神经（C5-C7，其穿过前斜角肌和中斜角肌之间）来为肩部和上臂提供麻醉。麻醉剂也会沿着斜角肌间鞘穿行，由于膈神经根（C3-C5）的参与，经常导致一侧膈肌暂时性麻痹。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the anatomy of the brachial plexus and the potential complications of an interscalene nerve block. Specifically, it assesses knowledge of which nerves are affected by anesthesia placed in the interscalene space and the resulting motor deficits.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the anatomical location of the interscalene nerve block and the nerves that pass through this region. Understanding the innervation of various muscles, particularly the diaphragm via the phrenic nerve, is crucial to determining which muscle would be most affected by anesthetic spread.",
