    "en": "A 22-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being involved in a fight at a nearby bar. The patient's respiratory rate is 28/min, blood pressure is 88/60 mm Hg, and heart rate is 114/min. Physical examination shows a penetrating right-sided stab wound along the upper surface of the clavicle between the lateral border of the sternum and the midclavicular line.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "In patients with neck injuries, it is important to remember that the lung apices and cervical pleura extend above the clavicle and first rib through the superior thoracic aperture. Stab wounds immediately above the clavicle and lateral to the manubrium can puncture the pleura and cause pneumothorax, tension pneumothorax, or hemothorax. This patient most likely has a TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX as a result of his pleural injury. As an increasing volume of air accumulates within the pleural space, the lungs and mediastinum deviate to the opposite side of the chest. Increased pressure within the chest cavity decreases systemic venous return to the heart, lowering cardiac output. Signs and symptoms of tension pneumothorax include tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and hyperresonance to percussion and absence of breath sounds on the affected side. Treatment is with emergency needle thoracostomy or chest tube. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) The accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI) innervates the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. This nerve may be injured during surgery involving the posterior triangle of the neck (a region bounded by the sternocleidomastoid muscle, trapezius muscle, and clavicle).\n\n(Choice B) The ansa cervicalis arises from the C1, C2, and C3 nerve roots and innervates the sternohyoid, sternothyroid, and omohyoid muscles of the anterior neck. Penetrating trauma to the neck above the cricoid cartilage can injure this nerve.\n\n(Choice C) The carotid body, which contains O2, CO2, and H+ chemoreceptors, lies at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery (just inferior to the hyoid bone).\n\n(Choice D) The inferior thyroid artery arises from the thyrocervical trunk and courses posterior to the carotid artery and jugular vein to supply the inferior pole of the thyroid gland. Injury to the inferior thyroid artery is commonly associated with hoarseness because it runs adjacent to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.",
    "zh": "对于颈部损伤的患者，重要的是要记住肺尖和颈胸膜通过胸廓上口延伸到锁骨和第一肋骨上方。锁骨正上方和胸骨柄外侧的刺伤可刺破胸膜并引起气胸、张力性气胸或血胸。该患者很可能因胸膜损伤而患有张力性气胸。随着越来越多的空气积聚在胸膜腔内，肺和纵隔会偏向胸部的另一侧。胸腔内压力升高会降低全身静脉回流到心脏，从而降低心输出量。张力性气胸的体征和症状包括心动过速、低血压、呼吸急促、低氧血症以及叩诊呈过度共鸣音，以及受累侧呼吸音消失。治疗方法是紧急针胸穿刺术或胸腔闭式引流术。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项 A）副神经（脑神经 XI）支配胸锁乳突肌和斜方肌。该神经可能在涉及颈后三角（由胸锁乳突肌、斜方肌和锁骨限定的区域）的手术中受伤。\n\n（选项 B）颈袢起自 C1、C2 和 C3 神经根，支配颈前部的胸骨舌骨肌、胸骨甲状肌和肩胛舌骨肌。环状软骨上方的颈部穿透性损伤会损伤此神经。\n\n（选项 C）颈动脉体含有 O2、CO2 和 H+ 化学感受器，位于颈总动脉的分叉处（舌骨下方）。\n\n（选项 D）甲状腺下动脉起自甲状颈干，走行于颈动脉和颈静脉后方，供应甲状腺下极。甲状腺下动脉的损伤通常与声音嘶哑有关，因为它与喉返神经相邻。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the anatomical location of the lung apices and cervical pleura in relation to the clavicle, and the potential for injury to these structures in penetrating trauma to the neck. It also tests the pathophysiology of tension pneumothorax.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the lung apices extend above the clavicle. A penetrating injury in this region is likely to injure the pleura, leading to pneumothorax or tension pneumothorax. Consider the signs and symptoms of tension pneumothorax (tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea).",
    "zh": "此题考察对肺尖和颈胸膜与锁骨解剖位置关系的认识，以及颈部穿透性创伤对这些结构的潜在损伤。它还考察了张力性气胸的病理生理学。\n\n要解决此问题，需要认识到肺尖延伸到锁骨上方。该区域的穿透性损伤可能会损伤胸膜，导致气胸或张力性气胸。考虑张力性气胸的体征和症状（心动过速、低血压、呼吸急促）。"
