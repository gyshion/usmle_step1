    "en": "A 44-year-old woman comes to the office due to indigestion. The patient says she often develops right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort and nausea with fatty meals, which subside spontaneously after several hours. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. The patient immigrated to the United States from Nepal 10 years ago. Abdominal ultrasound reveals numerous gallstones, and she undergoes elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The stones in her gallbladder have very low cholesterol content and appear small, dark, and spiculated. Which of the following conditions most likely predisposed this patient to gallstone formation?",

    "en": "Gallstones are formed by the aggregation of bile constituents and are categorized as cholesterol stones, pigment stones, or mixed stones. Pigment gallstones, which account for only 10%-25% of gallstone cases in the United States, are most common in rural Asian populations. These stones can be brown to black and arise from conditions that increase the amount of unconjugated bilirubin in bile, which promotes calcium bilirubinate precipitation. Brown pigment stones are associated with biliary tract infections (microbes producing β-glucuronidases), whereas black stones occur in the setting of CHRONIC HEMOLYSIS (eg, sickle cell anemia, β-thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis) and increased enterohepatic cycling of bilirubin (eg, ileal disease). Grossly, black pigment stones are usually present in significant numbers and are small, spiculated, and friable. Because these stones contain high amounts of calcium carbonates and phosphates, they are often radiopaque and appear on x-ray. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices B, C, D, and E) Obesity/metabolic syndrome, multiparity, oral contraceptive use, and rapid weight loss are significant risk factors for development of cholesterol gallstones.\n\nEducational objective:\nBlack pigment stones arise from conditions that increase the amount of unconjugated bilirubin in bile, which promotes calcium bilirubinate precipitation. This may occur in the setting of CHRONIC HEMOLYSIS (eg, sickle cell anemia, β-thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis) and increased enterohepatic cycling of bilirubin (eg, ileal disease). {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "胆结石由胆汁成分聚集而成，分为胆固醇结石、色素结石或混合结石。色素性胆结石仅占美国胆结石病例的10%-25%，在亚洲农村人群中最常见。这些结石可以呈现棕色到黑色，由增加胆汁中非结合胆红素量的病症引起，从而促进胆红素钙沉淀。棕色色素性结石与胆道感染（产生β-葡萄糖醛酸苷酶的微生物）有关，而黑色结石则发生于慢性溶血（例如，镰状细胞性贫血、β-地中海贫血、遗传性球形红细胞增多症）和胆红素的肝肠循环增加（例如，回肠疾病）的情况下。肉眼可见，黑色色素结石通常数量众多，且小、有刺状、易碎。由于这些结石含有大量的碳酸钙和磷酸盐，它们通常是放射线不透性的，并在X射线上显现。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项B、C、D和E）肥胖/代谢综合征、多产、口服避孕药和快速减肥是胆固醇结石发生的重要危险因素。\n\n教育目标：黑色色素结石由增加胆汁中非结合胆红素量的病症引起，从而促进胆红素钙沉淀。这种情况可能发生在慢性溶血（例如，镰状细胞性贫血、β-地中海贫血、遗传性球形红细胞增多症）和胆红素的肝肠循环增加（例如，回肠疾病）的情况下。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of gallstone formation, specifically the etiology of pigment stones versus cholesterol stones. It requires understanding the risk factors associated with each type of gallstone and how they relate to patient presentation.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key features of the gallstones (low cholesterol, small, dark, spiculated) which point towards pigment stones. Then, recall the common causes of pigment stones, such as chronic hemolysis or biliary tract infections, and select the option that aligns with these causes.",
