  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The visceral pleura covers the surface of the lung, whereas the parietal pleura lines the inner surface of the chest wall and diaphragm. The parietal pleura generally extends approximately 2 ribs below the inferior margin of the lungs. The potential space at the reflection of the costal pleura onto diaphragmatic pleura is called the costodiaphragmatic recess, where pleural fluid accumulates when the body is erect.\n\nThoracentesis is typically performed between the 6th and 8th ribs along the midclavicular line, the 8th and 10th ribs along the midaxillary line (above image), and the 10th and 12th ribs along the paravertebral line. This allows pleural fluid to be drained without risking lung injury (which can occur at higher insertion sites). However, insertion of a needle below the 9th rib still risks penetrating abdominal structures.\n\nIn this case, thoracentesis is being performed along the upper border of the 10th rib at the right midaxillary line, putting the patient at risk of LIVER INJURY if the needle is inserted too deep.\n\n(Choice A) Hepatic veins are found deep in the liver parenchyma and are not likely to be injured during thoracentesis.\n\n(Choices B and C) The intercostal vein, artery, and nerve lie in the subcostal groove along the lower border of the rib. Thoracentesis should be performed just above the upper border of the rib to prevent injury to the intercostal vessels.\n\n(Choice E) The lower border of the right lung is located 2 intercostal spaces above the pleural border. Therefore, the lung is less likely to be injured by insertion of a needle into the 10th intercostal space at the midaxillary line.\n\nEducational objective:\nThoracentesis should be performed below the 6th rib in the midclavicular line, the 8th rib along the midaxillary line, or the 10th rib along the paravertebral line in order to minimize the risk of lung injury. Insertion of a needle lower than 9th rib increases the risk of penetrating abdominal structures. The needle should also be inserted along the upper border of the rib to prevent injury to the intercostal vessels. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "脏层胸膜覆盖肺的表面，而壁层胸膜衬于胸壁和膈肌的内表面。壁层胸膜通常向下延伸到肺下缘下方大约 2 根肋骨。肋骨胸膜反射到膈肌胸膜上的潜在空间称为肋膈隐窝，当身体直立时，胸腔积液会聚集在那里。\n\n胸腔穿刺术通常在锁骨中线第 6 和 8 根肋骨之间、腋中线第 8 和 10 根肋骨之间（上图）以及椎旁线第 10 和 12 根肋骨之间进行。这使得可以引流胸腔积液，而不会有肺损伤的风险（这可能发生在较高的插入部位）。然而，将针插入第 9 根肋骨以下仍然存在穿透腹部结构的风险。\n\n在这种情况下，胸腔穿刺术沿右腋中线第 10 肋骨的上缘进行，如果针插入过深，则使患者有肝损伤的风险。\n\n（选项 A）肝静脉位于肝实质深处，在胸腔穿刺术期间不太可能受到损伤。\n\n（选项 B 和 C）肋间静脉、动脉和神经位于肋骨下缘的肋骨下沟中。胸腔穿刺术应在肋骨上缘上方进行，以防止损伤肋间血管。\n\n（选项 E）右肺的下缘位于胸膜缘上方 2 个肋间隙。因此，通过将针插入腋中线第 10 个肋间隙，肺部不太可能受到损伤。\n\n教育目标：\n胸腔穿刺术应在锁骨中线第 6 肋骨以下、腋中线第 8 肋骨或椎旁线第 10 肋骨进行，以尽量减少肺损伤的风险。将针插入第 9 根肋骨以下会增加穿透腹部结构的风险。针也应沿着肋骨的上缘插入，以防止损伤肋间血管。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the anatomical landmarks for thoracentesis and the potential complications associated with improper needle placement. It requires understanding the relationship between the ribs, pleura, lungs, and abdominal organs.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the location of the needle insertion (10th rib, midaxillary line) and consider which structures are in close proximity. Remember that the liver extends higher on the right side and is at risk of injury with lower intercostal space insertions.",
