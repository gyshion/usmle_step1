    "en": "A 60-year-old farmer is brought to the emergency department due to acute-onset confusion, muscle weakness, and difficulty breathing. The patient has vomited twice and has had 3 loose bowel movements over the past 2 hours. His medical history is insignificant and he currently takes no medications. Blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 58/min, and respirations are 26/min. His pupils are constricted, symmetric, and reactive to light. Examination reveals excessive sweating, lacrimation, and wheezing. He is incontinent of urine. Intravenous atropine is administered.",

    "en": "This farmer is exhibiting multiple signs of excessive cholinergic stimulation. He has likely been exposed to an ORGANOPHOSPHATE, a CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITOR that is commonly used in agricultural pesticides. Organophosphates inhibit cholinesterase in both muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic synapses, leading to decreased acetylcholine degradation. Overabundance of acetylcholine within the synaptic cleft leads to overstimulation of the corresponding receptors.\n\nThis patient is currently experiencing the effects of widespread muscarinic activation, which increases visceral smooth muscle tone and glandular secretions throughout the body (DUMBELS mnemonic). Nicotinic activation leads to muscle fasciculations, weakness, and paralysis. Activation of both receptors in the central nervous system leads to seizures and coma. Atropine is a competitive inhibitor of acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors, thereby reversing muscarinic symptoms of organophosphate poisoning. However, atropine has no effect on nicotinic receptors; patients are still at risk of MUSCLE PARALYSIS. Pralidoxime is a cholinesterase-reactivating agent that allows for degradation of excess acetylcholine and treats both the muscarinic and nicotinic effects of organophosphates.\n\n(Choices A, B, C, D and F) Bradycardia, bronchospasm, diarrhea, miosis, and urinary incontinence are symptoms of excessive muscarinic activation, and are reversed with atropine.\n\nEducational objective: Organophosphates inhibit cholinesterase in both muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic synapses, leading to decreased acetylcholine degradation and overstimulation of the corresponding receptors. Atropine reverses muscarinic effects but does not prevent the development of nicotinic effects such as muscle paralysis. Pralidoxime is a cholinesterase-reactivating agent that allows for degradation of excess acetylcholine and treats both the muscarinic and nicotinic effects of organophosphates.",
    "zh": "这位农民表现出多重过度胆碱能刺激的迹象。他可能接触了有机磷酸盐，这是一种胆碱酯酶抑制剂，常用于农业杀虫剂。有机磷酸盐抑制毒蕈碱性和烟碱性胆碱能突触中的胆碱酯酶，导致乙酰胆碱降解减少。突触间隙中乙酰胆碱过量会导致相应受体的过度刺激。\n\n该患者目前正在经历广泛的毒蕈碱性激活的影响，这会增加全身内脏平滑肌张力和腺体分泌（DUMBELS 记忆法）。烟碱性激活会导致肌肉束颤、无力和麻痹。中枢神经系统中两种受体的激活会导致癫痫发作和昏迷。阿托品是毒蕈碱受体上乙酰胆碱的竞争性抑制剂，从而逆转有机磷中毒的毒蕈碱性症状。然而，阿托品对烟碱受体没有影响；患者仍有发生肌肉麻痹的风险。氯解磷定是一种胆碱酯酶复活剂，可降解过量的乙酰胆碱，并治疗有机磷酸盐的毒蕈碱性和烟碱性影响。\n\n（选项 A、B、C、D 和 F）心动过缓、支气管痉挛、腹泻、缩瞳和尿失禁是过度毒蕈碱性激活的症状，可通过阿托品逆转。\n\n教育目标：有机磷酸盐抑制毒蕈碱性和烟碱性胆碱能突触中的胆碱酯酶，导致乙酰胆碱降解减少和相应受体的过度刺激。阿托品可逆转毒蕈碱性作用，但不能阻止烟碱性作用（如肌肉麻痹）的发生。氯解磷定是一种胆碱酯酶复活剂，可降解过量的乙酰胆碱，并治疗有机磷酸盐的毒蕈碱性和烟碱性影响。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of organophosphate poisoning, specifically differentiating between muscarinic and nicotinic effects and the role of atropine in treatment. It assesses the ability to recognize the clinical presentation of cholinergic toxicity and predict which symptoms will persist despite atropine administration.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the signs and symptoms of cholinergic toxicity, categorize them as muscarinic or nicotinic, and recall that atropine primarily reverses muscarinic effects. The key is to recognize that nicotinic effects, such as muscle weakness and paralysis, are not directly antagonized by atropine and will likely persist without specific treatment like pralidoxime.",
    "zh": "本题考察对有机磷酸盐中毒的理解，特别是区分毒蕈碱性和烟碱性作用，以及阿托品在治疗中的作用。它评估了识别胆碱能毒性临床表现并预测哪些症状即使在给予阿托品后仍会持续存在的能力。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要识别胆碱能毒性的体征和症状，将其分为毒蕈碱性或烟碱性，并记住阿托品主要逆转毒蕈碱性作用。关键是要认识到，烟碱性作用（如肌无力和麻痹）不会被阿托品直接拮抗，并且在没有氯解磷定等特定治疗的情况下很可能会持续存在。"
