    "en": "A 23-year-old-man is brought to the emergency department after he was stabbed in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. His blood pressure is 70/42 mm Hg, pulse is 135/min, and respirations are 26/min; pulse oximetry shows oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Physical examination shows a stab wound 2 cm inferior to the right costal margin. The patient's abdomen is firm and distended. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) is positive for blood in the right upper quadrant. He is taken for immediate laparotomy, and approximately 1 liter of blood is evacuated from the peritoneal cavity. Brisk, nonpulsatile bleeding is seen emanating from behind the liver. The surgeon occludes the hepatoduodenal ligament, but the patient continues to hemorrhage. Which of the following structures is the most likely source of this patient's bleeding?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The portal triad runs through the hepatoduodenal ligament and is composed of the hepatic artery, portal vein, and common bile duct. In the setting of traumatic liver injury with persistent bleeding, OCCLUSION of the hepatoduodenal ligament can be performed to identify the vascular source (ie, the Pringle maneuver) {{exhibit_1}}. If liver bleeding does not cease when the portal triad is occluded, it is likely that there has been injury to the INFERIOR VENA CAVA or hepatic veins. Although the inferior vena cava is a retroperitoneal structure, penetrating trauma can disrupt tissue barriers, facilitating bleeding into the peritoneal compartment.\n\n(Choice A) The common bile duct makes up one-third of the portal triad. Damage to the biliary ducts can cause biliary leakage and bile peritonitis.\n\n(Choice B) The cystic artery most commonly arises from the right hepatic artery and would be devascularized following portal triad occlusion. In addition, arterial bleeding is usually pulsatile whereas venous bleeding is nonpulsatile.\n\n(Choices C and E) The hepatic artery and portal vein are part of the portal triad: occlusion of the hepatoduodenal ligament would cause the bleeding to stop if either of these vessels is the source.\n\nEducational objective:\nOcclusion of the portal triad can be used to distinguish the source of right upper quadrant bleeding. If the bleeding subsides following occlusion, the source is likely to be the hepatic artery or portal vein. If hepatic bleeding persists after occlusion, the inferior vena cava or hepatic veins are likely to be injured.",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the anatomy of the hepatoduodenal ligament and the Pringle maneuver in the context of traumatic liver injury. It assesses the ability to identify the source of bleeding when the portal triad is occluded.\n\nThe key to solving this question is understanding that the hepatoduodenal ligament contains the portal triad (hepatic artery, portal vein, and common bile duct). If bleeding persists after occluding the hepatoduodenal ligament, the source is likely outside the portal triad, such as the inferior vena cava or hepatic veins.",
    "zh": "此题考察了肝十二指肠韧带的解剖结构以及普林格尔氏手法在外伤性肝损伤中的应用。它评估了在阻断门静脉三联体时识别出血来源的能力。\n\n解决此问题的关键是理解肝十二指肠韧带包含门静脉三联体（肝动脉、门静脉和胆总管）。如果阻断肝十二指肠韧带后出血持续存在，则来源可能在门静脉三联体之外，例如下腔静脉或肝静脉。"
