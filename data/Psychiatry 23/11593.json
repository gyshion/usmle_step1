    "en": "The patient's depression, suicidal ideation, and impulsivity in the setting of feeling rejected are characteristic of BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER (BPD). Individuals with this disorder exhibit a persistent pattern of unstable and intense relationships beginning in adolescence or early adulthood. They experience marked MOOD REACTIVITY to interpersonal stresses and frequently alternate between extremes of idealizing and devaluing others (defense mechanism of splitting). Difficulty controlling anger, IMPULSIVITY (eg, substance use, unsafe sex, recurrent suicidality, and self-mutilating behavior (eg, cutting, burning) are common. Individuals with BPD frequently seek clinical attention due to suicidal behavior or threats during an interpersonal crisis and comprise approximately 20% of psychiatric inpatients.\n\n(Choice A) Although bipolar II disorder and BPD can have similar clinical features, this patient has insufficient symptom quantity and duration to diagnose discrete episodes of hypomania and major depression required for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder. BPD is characterized by transient mood shifts and impulsive behaviors that occur in response to environmental triggers (eg, relationship breakup).\n\n(Choice C) Individuals with dependent personality disorder fear abandonment but respond to relationship strain by trying to appease others, versus being impulsive and having uncontrolled anger as seen in BPD.\n\n(Choice D) Both borderline and histrionic personality disorders are characterized by attention-seeking behavior, but this patient's excessive anger and self-destructive behavior are more characteristic of BPD.\n\n(Choice E) This patient has insufficient symptom quantity and duration for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). In MDD, ≥5 of the following symptoms are present for ≥2 weeks: depressed mood, sleep disturbances, anhedonia, guilt, decreased energy, concentration difficulty, appetite changes, psychomotor retardation or agitation, and suicidality.\n\n(Choice F) Patients with BPD may experience transient, stress-related paranoid ideation but do not exhibit the pervasive pattern of distrust and suspiciousness characteristic of paranoid personality disorder.\n\n(Choice G) This patient's alcohol misuse is a consequence, not the cause, of her behavioral disturbance.\n\nKEY PEARLS:\nBORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked IMPULSIVITY. The \"splitting\" defense mechanism (idealization/devaluation) is a hallmark. Impulsive behaviors include substance abuse, unsafe sex, reckless spending, binge eating, and recurrent suicidal behavior or self-mutilation. Mood reactivity is prominent, with intense anger and despair often triggered by perceived abandonment.",
    "zh": "患者在感到被拒绝的情况下出现抑郁、自杀意念和冲动行为，这是边缘型人格障碍(BPD)的特征。患有这种障碍的个体表现出持续的不稳定和强烈的人际关系模式，这种模式始于青春期或成年早期。他们对人际压力表现出明显的情绪反应性，并且经常在理想化和贬低他人之间交替（分裂的防御机制）。难以控制愤怒、冲动（例如，物质滥用、不安全的性行为、反复自杀和自残行为（例如，切割、烧伤））很常见。患有 BPD 的个体经常因为人际危机期间的自杀行为或威胁而寻求临床治疗，约占精神科住院患者的 20%。\n\n（选项 A）虽然双相 II 型障碍和 BPD 可以有相似的临床特征，但该患者的症状数量和持续时间不足以诊断双相 II 型障碍所需的轻躁狂和重度抑郁症的独立发作。BPD 的特点是短暂的情绪变化和对环境诱因（例如，关系破裂）做出反应的冲动行为。\n\n（选项 C）依赖型人格障碍患者害怕被抛弃，但通过试图安抚他人来应对人际关系紧张，而不是像 BPD 中那样冲动和不受控制的愤怒。\n\n（选项 D）边缘型和表演型人格障碍的特点都是寻求关注的行为，但该患者过度的愤怒和自毁行为更符合 BPD 的特征。\n\n（选项 E）该患者的症状数量和持续时间不足以诊断重度抑郁症 (MDD)。在 MDD 中，≥5 个以下症状持续存在 ≥2 周：抑郁情绪、睡眠障碍、快感缺失、内疚感、精力下降、注意力难以集中、食欲变化、精神运动迟缓或激动、以及自杀。\n\n（选项 F）BPD 患者可能会经历短暂的、与压力相关的偏执观念，但不会表现出偏执型人格障碍的普遍不信任和怀疑模式。\n\n（选项 G）该患者的酒精滥用是其行为障碍的结果，而不是原因。\n\n关键要点：\n边缘型人格障碍的特征是人际关系、自我形象和情感的不稳定模式，以及明显的冲动性。“分裂”防御机制（理想化/贬值）是其标志。冲动行为包括物质滥用、不安全的性行为、鲁莽消费、暴饮暴食和反复的自杀行为或自残行为。情绪反应性很突出，强烈的愤怒和绝望常常由感知到的被抛弃感引发。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to diagnose Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) based on a clinical vignette. It requires differentiating BPD from other personality disorders and mood disorders by recognizing the core features of instability in relationships, self-image, affect, and marked impulsivity, particularly in response to perceived abandonment or interpersonal stress.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully review the patient's history for patterns of unstable relationships, intense mood swings, impulsivity, self-harm, and fear of abandonment. Compare these findings to the diagnostic criteria for the listed differential diagnoses, paying close attention to the duration, severity, and triggers of symptoms. The presence of splitting, intense anger, and recurrent suicidal ideation in the context of interpersonal stressors strongly suggests BPD.",
    "zh": "这道题考察了根据临床案例诊断边缘型人格障碍 (BPD) 的能力。它需要通过识别人际关系、自我形象、情感和明显冲动性（尤其是在对感知到的被抛弃或人际压力做出反应时）的不稳定性的核心特征，将 BPD 与其他人格障碍和情绪障碍区分开来。\n\n要解决这个问题，请仔细检查患者的病史，以寻找不稳定的人际关系模式、剧烈的情绪波动、冲动性、自残和害怕被抛弃。将这些发现与所列鉴别诊断的诊断标准进行比较，特别注意症状的持续时间、严重程度和触发因素。在人际压力源的背景下出现分裂、强烈的愤怒和反复的自杀意念，强烈提示 BPD。"
