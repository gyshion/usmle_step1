    "en": "A 32-year-old man is evaluated for bowel dysfunction. The patient suffered multiple injuries during a motor vehicle collision 6 months ago. He was hospitalized for several weeks and is currently undergoing treatment with physical therapy. Since the injury, the patient has developed severe constipation with occasional fecal incontinence. Evaluation reveals a large amount of stool in the distal colon due to impaired motor function. Anal sphincter tone is decreased. Injury to which of the following structures best explains this patient's bowel dysfunction?",

    "en": "This patient has developed both constipation and fecal incontinence with decreased tone of the anal sphincter after traumatic injury.\n\nA deficiency of parasympathetic input or excess of sympathetic input can lead to constipation by impairing peristalsis. Above the splenic flexure, peristalsis is controlled by parasympathetic innervation from the vagus nerve. Beyond the splenic flexure, it is controlled by parasympathetic innervation from the S2-S4 nerve roots.\n\nThe innervation of the anal sphincter is complex and under voluntary, parasympathetic, and sympathetic control; therefore, fecal incontinence can occur due to lesions at multiple levels of the nervous system (eg, frontal cortex, spinal cord, peripheral nerves). The anal sphincter consists of an:\n\n*   External sphincter, which includes skeletal muscle and is under voluntary control innervated by the pudendal nerve (S2-S4 branches)\n*   Internal sphincter, which includes smooth muscle that is contiguous with the rectum. Sympathetic innervation normally maintains it in a state of tonic contraction. Pressure in the rectal vault (due to the presence of stool) stimulates parasympathetic input from the pelvic splanchnic nerves to relax the sphincter.\n\nTherefore, this patient likely has impairment of both parasympathetic and voluntary motor output from the S2-S4 nerve roots because of sacral spinal cord (ie, conus medullaris) damage. This is leading to impaired peristalsis beyond the splenic flexure (ie, constipation) and flaccid weakness of the external anal sphincter (fecal incontinence).\n\n(Choices A and D) Cervical or thoracic spinal cord injury could affect the upper motor neuron pathways involved in voluntary external anal sphincter function. However, this would lead to increased sphincter tone.\n\n(Choice B) The pudendal nerve is involved in external anal sphincter innervation; dysfunction can lead to fecal incontinence. However, it does not provide parasympathetic innervation to the colon, so dysfunction would not lead to stool retention in the distal colon.\n\n(Choice E) The vagus nerve (CN X) provides parasympathetic innervation to the GI tract above the colon's splenic flexure; injury classically causes delayed gastric emptying. However, distal colon stool retention is more likely related to impaired parasympathetic activity of the S2-S4 nerve roots. Also, vagal injury would not affect anal sphincter tone. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nEducational objective:\nSacral spinal cord injury can lead to lower motor neuron injury of the S2-S4 nerve rootlets; these contribute parasympathetic innervation to the distal colon to stimulate peristalsis and voluntary motor innervation to the external anal sphincter. Lesions in this area can lead to distal colon stool retention, fecal incontinence, and a weak external anal sphincter.",
    "zh": "该患者在遭受创伤性损伤后出现了便秘和粪便失禁，且肛门括约肌张力降低。\n\n副交感神经输入不足或交感神经输入过多会导致便秘，从而损害蠕动。在脾曲以上，蠕动由来自迷走神经的副交感神经支配控制。在脾曲以下，它由来自S2-S4神经根的副交感神经支配控制。\n\n肛门括约肌的神经支配是复杂的，受自主、副交感和交感神经的控制；因此，粪便失禁可能由于神经系统多个水平的病变而发生（例如，额叶皮质、脊髓、周围神经）。肛门括约肌包括：\n\n*   外括约肌，包括骨骼肌，受自主控制，由阴部神经（S2-S4分支）支配\n*   内括约肌，包括与直肠相连的平滑肌。交感神经支配通常使其保持紧张收缩状态。直肠腔内的压力（由于粪便的存在）刺激来自盆腔内脏神经的副交感神经输入，以放松括约肌。\n\n因此，该患者很可能由于骶髓（即圆锥）损伤而导致来自S2-S4神经根的副交感神经和自主运动输出受损。这导致脾曲以下蠕动受损（即便秘）和外括约肌弛缓无力（粪便失禁）。\n\n（选项A和D）颈髓或胸髓损伤可能会影响参与自主外括约肌功能的上运动神经元通路。然而，这会导致括约肌张力增加。\n\n（选项B）阴部神经参与外括约肌的神经支配；功能障碍可导致粪便失禁。然而，它不为结肠提供副交感神经支配，因此功能障碍不会导致粪便潴留在远端结肠中。\n\n（选项E）迷走神经（CN X）为结肠脾曲以上的胃肠道提供副交感神经支配；损伤通常会导致胃排空延迟。然而，远端结肠粪便潴留更可能与S2-S4神经根的副交感神经活动受损有关。此外，迷走神经损伤不会影响肛门括约肌张力。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n教育目标：\n骶髓损伤可导致S2-S4神经根的下运动神经元损伤；这些神经根有助于远端结肠的副交感神经支配，以刺激蠕动，并为外括约肌提供自主运动神经支配。该区域的病变可导致远端结肠粪便潴留、粪便失禁和外括约肌无力。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the innervation of the bowel and anal sphincter, specifically the parasympathetic and voluntary motor control provided by the sacral spinal cord (S2-S4 nerve roots). It also assesses the ability to correlate spinal cord injuries with bowel dysfunction symptoms like constipation and fecal incontinence. \n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's symptoms of constipation and fecal incontinence with decreased anal sphincter tone. Recall that the S2-S4 nerve roots provide parasympathetic innervation to the distal colon and voluntary motor innervation to the external anal sphincter. Therefore, damage to the sacral spinal cord is the most likely cause of the patient's bowel dysfunction.",
