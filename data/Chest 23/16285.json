  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has fever, productive cough, leukocytosis with left shift, and an area of consolidation on chest x-ray that is consistent with lobar pneumonia. Pulmonary consolidation occurs when the air in alveoli is replaced with a substance (eg, edema, pus, blood, cellular debris) that results in a region of opacification on radiographs. The borders of a consolidation tend to be indistinct as the alveoli become more sporadically involved at the peripheral portions of the disease process. However, if the consolidation abuts a fissure (eg, oblique, horizontal), it can be sharply defined because the consolidation cannot directly spread across the fissure to another lobe.\n\nThis patient's consolidation is sharply defined inferiorly by the horizontal fissure, which is present only in the right lung and separates the right upper lobe from the right middle lobe. Although multiple radiographic views are usually required for localization of a lung lesion, this patient's findings on lateral radiograph are consistent with right upper lobe pneumonia. Other features that can help localize a lobar pneumonia include:\n\n*   Right lung\n    *   Middle lobe consolidation can be sharply defined superiorly by the horizontal fissure and/or sharply defined inferiorly by the oblique fissure (Choice C).\n    *   Lower lobe consolidation can be sharply defined superiorly by the oblique fissure.\n*   Left lung\n    *   Left upper lobe and left lower lobe consolidations can be sharply defined by the oblique fissure but would not be sharply defined by a horizontal fissure because there is no middle lobe in the left lung (Choice A).\n\n(Choices B and D) In an upright chest x-ray, large accumulations of fluid in the pleural space (eg, pleural effusion) can blunt the costophrenic angles and spread across lung fissures to involve the area around more than one lung lobe.\n\nEducational objective:\nPulmonary consolidation is caused by the accumulation of material (eg, fluid, cellular debris) in the alveoli, which can be visualized on radiographs as an area of opacification with indistinct borders. A sharply defined horizontal or oblique line indicates that the consolidation abuts one of the lung fissures. Consolidation that is sharply defined inferiorly by the horizontal fissure is consistent with right upper lobe pneumonia. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of lobar pneumonia presentation on chest X-ray and the anatomical location of lung fissures. It requires the ability to interpret radiographic findings and correlate them with specific lung lobes.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the consolidation on the chest X-ray and note its sharp definition inferiorly by the horizontal fissure. Recognize that the horizontal fissure is only present in the right lung, separating the right upper and middle lobes, thus indicating right upper lobe pneumonia.",
