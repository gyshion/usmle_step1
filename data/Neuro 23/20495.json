    "en": "A 74-year-old man with metastatic lung cancer is brought to the emergency department due to sudden-onset severe headache, nausea, and vomiting. The patient was diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer 4 months ago and was found to have metastasis to the right frontal lobe of the brain. He refused chemotherapy and radiation treatments and is receiving palliative care. Blood pressure is 142/86 mm Hg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, the patient is somnolent but wakes up to voice and follows instructions. The right cingulate gyrus is seen herniating beneath the falx cerebri. Urgent CT scan of the head reveals hemorrhage within the tumor, causing significant surrounding edema; the right cingulate gyrus is seen herniating beneath the falx cerebri {{exhibit_1}}. Which of the following findings is most likely to be present in this patient given his neuroimaging results?",

    "en": "Brain herniation occurs when an acute increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) causes a portion of the brain to protrude through an opening in the dural folds or foramen magnum. In this patient, mass effect from hemorrhage within the right frontal lobe metastasis is causing the cingulate gyrus, which is located at the medial aspect of the cerebral cortex just above the corpus callosum, to herniate beneath the falx cerebri (ie, subfalcine herniation). Unlike in other herniation syndromes (eg, uncal, tonsillar), some consciousness is usually preserved in subfalcine herniation because there is no compression of brainstem wakefulness centers (eg, reticular activating system). Initial presentation may be as subtle as a headache; however, signs of increased ICP (eg, nausea, vomiting, lethargy) are often present, as in this patient. As it progresses, subfalcine herniation can cause ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery compression, leading to downstream ischemia and contralateral leg weakness {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}.\n\n(Choice A) A dilated and fixed right pupil may occur in uncal herniation due to compression of the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve (CN III). Uncal herniation involves herniation of the most medial portion of the temporal lobe (ie, uncus) beneath the tentorium cerebelli.\n\n(Choice C) Conjugate eye deviation is a classic finding in middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. Resulting damage to the frontal eye field interrupts conjugate gaze, with the eyes directed toward the side of the lesion (eg, leftward gaze in left MCA stroke).\n\n(Choice D) Loss of gag and cough reflexes may be seen with brainstem (eg, medulla) compression or injury, as can occur with acute herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum.\n\n(Choice E) Nonfluent/agrammatic speech (ie, expressive [motor] aphasia) is usually the result of injury to the Broca area, as can occur from a stroke involving the superior division of the dominant (typically left) middle cerebral artery.\n\nEducational objective:\nSubfalcine herniation occurs when the cingulate gyrus is displaced under the falx cerebri. Subfalcine herniation may compress the ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery, resulting in ischemia and contralateral leg weakness.",
    "zh": "当颅内压 (ICP) 急剧升高导致部分脑组织穿过硬脑膜皱襞或枕骨大孔的开口突出时，就会发生脑疝。在该患者中，右额叶转移瘤内的出血产生的占位效应导致扣带回（位于大脑皮质内侧，胼胝体正上方）在大脑镰下方疝出（即镰下疝）。与其他疝综合征（例如，钩回疝、小脑扁桃体疝）不同，在镰下疝中通常保留一定程度的意识，因为没有脑干觉醒中枢（例如，网状激活系统）的受压。最初的表现可能轻微，如头痛；然而，通常会出现颅内压增高的征象（例如，恶心、呕吐、嗜睡），就像该患者一样。随着病情的进展，镰下疝可导致同侧大脑前动脉受压，进而导致下游缺血和对侧腿部无力 {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}。\n\n(选项A) 右侧瞳孔散大且固定可能发生在钩回疝中，是由于同侧动眼神经 (CN III) 受压所致。钩回疝涉及颞叶最内侧部分（即钩回）在小脑幕下方疝出。\n\n(选项C) 共轭眼偏斜是大脑中动脉 (MCA) 卒中的典型表现。对额叶眼区的损害会导致共轭凝视中断，眼睛朝向病变侧（例如，左侧MCA卒中时向左凝视）。\n\n(选项D) 咽反射和咳嗽反射消失可能见于脑干（例如，延髓）受压或损伤，这可能发生在小脑扁桃体通过枕骨大孔急性疝出时。\n\n(选项E) 非流畅性/无语法性语言（即表达性[运动性]失语）通常是由于损伤Broca区所致，这种情况可能发生在涉及优势（通常是左侧）大脑中动脉上部支的卒中中。\n\n教育目标：\n当扣带回在大脑镰下移位时，就会发生镰下疝。镰下疝可能会压迫同侧大脑前动脉，导致缺血和对侧腿部无力。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of brain herniation syndromes, specifically subfalcine herniation, its causes, and associated clinical findings. It requires understanding the anatomical relationships and the consequences of compression of specific brain structures.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of increased intracranial pressure and the specific finding of cingulate gyrus herniation. Recall that subfalcine herniation can compress the anterior cerebral artery, leading to contralateral leg weakness.",
