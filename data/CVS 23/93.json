He is a lifelong nonsmoker. Blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg and pulse is 64/min. Examination reveals bibasilar crackles, elevated jugular venous pressure, and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume curve is shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}} (purple curve).",

    "en": "This patient's fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and orthopnea as well as lung crackles, jugular venous distension (JVD), and lower extremity edema on physical examination are consistent with decompensated heart failure. The left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure-volume curve shows elevated pressure at any given LV volume. This finding indicates reduced LV compliance (i.e. diastolic dysfunction), as occurs in conditions causing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (eg, hypertensive heart disease, restrictive cardiomyopathy).\n\nCardiac amyloidosis is a common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy resulting from abnormal accumulation of amyloid proteins, particularly immunoglobulin light chains or transthyretin (protein carrier of thyroxine and retinol). Transthyretin amyloidosis most often affects the heart of elderly patients and lead to an infiltrative restrictive cardiomyopathy. The ventricular walls become thickened and stiff and unable to relax during diastole; higher pressures are required to fill the ventricle. Elevated hydrostatic pressure backs up into the lungs (pulmonary edema) and into the right side of the heart and systemic venous system (JVD and peripheral edema).\n\nLV contractility is intact with infiltrative restrictive cardiomyopathy (especially early in the disease process), but it can decrease as the disease progresses, eventually leading to LV cavity dilation and a picture consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\n(Choices A, B, C, and E) Excessive alcohol use, doxorubicin chemotherapy, selenium deficiency, and viral myocarditis are all potential causes of dilated cardiomyopathy; they do not cause restrictive cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by LV cavity enlargement and reduced LV contractility leading to systolic dysfunction with reduced ejection fraction. LV wall compliance is typically normal or increased.\n\nEducational objective:\nReduced ventricular compliance is seen with restrictive cardiomyopathy and other causes of diastolic dysfunction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (eg, hypertensive heart disease). It involves ventricular wall thickening and/or stiffening that leads to increased diastolic filling pressure at any given ventricular volume.",
    "zh": "该患者的疲劳、劳力性呼吸困难和端坐呼吸，以及体格检查中的肺部啰音、颈静脉扩张（JVD）和下肢水肿，与失代偿性心力衰竭一致。左心室（LV）舒张压-容积曲线显示在任何给定的LV容积下压力升高。这一发现表明LV顺应性降低（即舒张功能障碍），这种情况发生在导致射血分数保留性心力衰竭的疾病中（例如，高血压性心脏病、限制性心肌病）。\n\n心脏淀粉样变是限制性心肌病的一个常见原因，由淀粉样蛋白的异常积累引起，特别是免疫球蛋白轻链或转甲状腺素（甲状腺素和视黄醇的蛋白载体）。转甲状腺素淀粉样变最常影响老年患者的心脏，并导致浸润性限制性心肌病。心室壁增厚且僵硬，在舒张期无法松弛；需要更高的压力来填充心室。静水压升高会回流到肺部（肺水肿）以及心脏右侧和体循环静脉系统（JVD和周围水肿）。\n\n浸润性限制性心肌病时，LV收缩力是完整的（尤其是在疾病早期），但随着疾病的进展，它可能会下降，最终导致LV腔扩张，并出现与扩张型心肌病一致的图像。\n\n（选项A、B、C和E）过度饮酒、多柔比星化疗、硒缺乏症和病毒性心肌炎均是扩张型心肌病的潜在原因；它们不会导致限制性心肌病。扩张型心肌病的特征是LV腔增大和LV收缩力降低，导致收缩功能障碍，射血分数降低。LV壁顺应性通常正常或增加。\n\n教育目标：\n在限制性心肌病以及其他导致舒张功能障碍和射血分数保留性心力衰竭的原因（例如，高血压性心脏病）中可见心室顺应性降低。它涉及心室壁增厚和/或僵硬，导致在任何给定的心室容积下舒张充盈压升高。"
