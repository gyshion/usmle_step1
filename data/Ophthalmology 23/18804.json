    "en": "4 5-year-old woman comes to the office due to progressive visual difficulty with night driving and reading road signs and fine print. The patient has systemic lupus erythematosus, which is treated with hydroxychloroquine and prednisone. She avoids sun exposure due to photosensitivity and has vitamin D deficiency for which she takes a vitamin D supplement. Examination shows opacities on the posterior side of the lenses in both eyes. Optic discs are normal. Ocular movements are full. The remainder of the eye examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most significant contributing factor for the eye findings in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient has bilateral opacities in the ocular lenses, findings consistent with cataracts. Cataracts can cause difficulty with reading and fine visual tasks; patients often see excessive glare at night and halos around bright lights due to light scattering in the lens. Examination findings include white or gray cloudiness of the lens, decreased visualization of retinal detail, and loss of the red reflex. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nCataracts are generally related to chronic photooxidative injury; the prevalence increases with age, and most patients with cataracts first develop symptoms at age >60. However, cataracts can develop earlier in individuals, such as this patient, with exposure to systemic or ophthalmic glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone). This may be due to glucocorticoid-induced transcription of genes in the lens epithelial cell that may alter lens homeostasis or increase the susceptibility to oxidative injury. Other causes of premature cataract formation include diabetes mellitus, ocular trauma, and external radiation exposure.\n\n(Choices A and D) The increased risk of premature cataract formation in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is due primarily to chronic/frequent glucocorticoid exposure, not to the disease itself. Patients with SLE are often treated with hydroxychloroquine; long-term use can cause retinopathy, which presents with decreased central visual acuity, photopsia (flashing lights), and central macular degeneration.\n\n(Choice B) Excessive, not limited, lifetime sun exposure is associated with an increased risk of cataracts.\n\n(Choice E) Common manifestations of vitamin D deficiency include hypocalcemia, bone pain, and accelerated bone loss. Cataracts are not a major consequence of vitamin D deficiency.\n\nEducational objective:\nCataracts are related primarily to chronic photooxidative injury. Most patients with cataracts first develop symptoms at age >60 but exposure to systemic or ophthalmic glucocorticoids can cause cataracts at an early age. Other causes of premature cataract formation include diabetes mellitus, ocular trauma, and external radiation exposure.",
    "zh": "该患者双眼晶状体混浊，与白内障一致。白内障可导致阅读和精细视觉任务困难；患者夜间常看到过度眩光，并在亮光周围出现光晕，这是由于晶状体内的光散射所致。检查结果包括晶状体发白或发灰、视网膜细节可视化下降以及红光反射消失。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n白内障通常与慢性光氧化损伤有关；其患病率随年龄增长而增加，大多数白内障患者在 60 岁以上时首次出现症状。然而，在接触全身或眼部糖皮质激素（如泼尼松）的个体（如该患者）中，白内障可以更早发生。这可能是由于糖皮质激素诱导的晶状体上皮细胞中基因的转录，这可能会改变晶状体稳态或增加对氧化损伤的易感性。其他导致早发性白内障形成的病因包括糖尿病、眼外伤和外部辐射暴露。\n\n（选项 A 和 D）系统性红斑狼疮 (SLE) 患者早发性白内障的风险增加，主要归因于长期/频繁接触糖皮质激素，而不是疾病本身。SLE 患者通常用羟氯喹治疗；长期使用可引起视网膜病变，表现为中心视力下降、视幻觉（闪光）和中心黄斑变性。\n\n（选项 B）终生过度（而非有限）的阳光照射与白内障风险增加相关。\n\n（选项 E）维生素 D 缺乏症的常见表现包括低钙血症、骨痛和骨质流失加速。白内障不是维生素 D 缺乏症的主要后果。\n\n教育目标：\n白内障主要与慢性光氧化损伤有关。大多数白内障患者在 60 岁以上时首次出现症状，但接触全身或眼部糖皮质激素可导致白内障在早期发生。其他导致早发性白内障形成的病因包括糖尿病、眼外伤和外部辐射暴露。"
