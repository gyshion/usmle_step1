  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The most likely presentation is of acanthosis nigricans (AN), which occurs most commonly in flexural areas. The most common locations are the axillae, posterior neck, and groin, but it may appear on other areas of the body such as the palms, soles, and oral mucosa & vermilion border. On physical examination, these lesions appear as hyperkeratotic, hyperpigmented plaques with a classic \"velvety\" texture. Skin tags (acrochordons) are pedunculated outgrowths of normal skin that are commonly present on regions affected by acanthosis nigricans.\n\nAN is associated with a number of diseases. Depending on the underlying condition, it is divided into benign and malignant forms.\n\n1.  Benign AN is commonly associated with INSULIN RESISTANCE. Increased levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factors stimulate epidermal and dermal proliferation.\n\n2.  Malignant AN is associated with underlying neoplasms, especially of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. The sudden appearance of such skin changes in middle-aged or elderly patients is suggestive of underlying malignancy. Gastric adenocarcinoma is the most common cause of malignant AN.\n\n(Choices A and E) Hypersecretion of calcitonin (as in medullary thyroid cancer) and vitamin D resistance are not associated with AN.\n\n(Choice C) Hypersecretion of serotonin can occur with carcinoid tumors, including the gastrointestinal variety. However, excess serotonin itself does not cause AN.\n\n(Choice D) Testosterone unresponsiveness (androgen insensitivity syndrome, testicular feminization syndrome) develops due to a defect in testosterone receptors in peripheral tissues. Such patients are phenotypic females who present with primary amenorrhea. The uterus is absent and the vagina ends as a blind pouch, but breast development is normal due to the production of estrogen by aromatase.\n\nEducational objective:\nAcanthosis nigricans presents with thickening and hyperpigmentation of skin in the flexural areas. The lesions have a classic \"velvety\" texture. Acanthosis nigricans is commonly associated with insulin-resistant states (eg, diabetes mellitus, acromegaly, obesity) and gastrointestinal malignancies.",
    "zh": "最可能的表现是黑棘皮病（AN），最常发生在屈曲部位。最常见的部位是腋窝、颈后和腹股沟，但它也可能出现在身体的其他部位，如手掌、足底和口腔粘膜和朱唇。体格检查显示，这些病变表现为角化过度、色素沉着过度的斑块，具有经典的“天鹅绒”质地。皮赘（软纤维瘤）是正常皮肤的蒂状增生物，通常存在于受黑棘皮病影响的区域。\n\nAN与多种疾病相关。根据潜在的病因，它被分为良性和恶性形式。\n\n1. 良性AN通常与胰岛素抵抗相关。胰岛素和胰岛素样生长因子的水平升高会刺激表皮和真皮增生。\n\n2. 恶性AN与潜在的肿瘤有关，特别是胃肠道和泌尿生殖道肿瘤。在中年或老年患者中，此类皮肤改变的突然出现提示潜在的恶性肿瘤。胃腺癌是恶性AN最常见的原因。\n\n（选项A和E）降钙素分泌过多（如髓样甲状腺癌）和维生素D抵抗与AN无关。\n\n（选项C）类癌肿瘤（包括胃肠道型）可发生5-羟色胺分泌过多。然而，过量的5-羟色胺本身不会导致AN。\n\n（选项D）睾酮无反应（雄激素不敏感综合征、睾丸女性化综合征）是由于睾酮受体在周围组织中存在缺陷而发生的。这类患者表现为女性表型，表现为原发性闭经。子宫缺失，阴道以盲囊结束，但由于芳香化酶产生雌激素，乳房发育正常。\n\n教育目标：黑棘皮病表现为屈曲部位皮肤增厚和色素沉着过度。这些病变具有经典的“天鹅绒”质地。黑棘皮病通常与胰岛素抵抗状态（如糖尿病、肢端肥大症、肥胖症）和胃肠道恶性肿瘤相关。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize acanthosis nigricans and its association with insulin resistance. Acanthosis nigricans is characterized by hyperpigmented, velvety plaques, often found in skin folds like the axillae. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of acanthosis nigricans and recall its most common association with insulin resistance. Rule out other options based on their lack of association with this skin condition.",
