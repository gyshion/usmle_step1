    "en": "A 22-year-old woman comes to the office due to 2 weeks of profound fatigue, which has prevented her from attending college classes. The fatigue was preceded by fevers and sore throat, but these have now improved. The patient is an exchange student from Turkey and has no prior medical conditions. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Oropharyngeal examination shows no abnormalities. There are several enlarged lymph nodes posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle bilaterally. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. The spleen is palpable 1 cm below the left costal margin. No skin rashes or other lymphadenopathy is present. Peripheral blood evaluation shows increased numbers of abnormal white blood cells as shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}. The observed cytoplasmic granules of these cells are most likely to contain which of the following substances?",
    "zh": "一名22岁的女性因2周的严重疲劳前来就诊，这让她无法参加大学课程。疲劳之前有发烧和咽喉痛，但这些症状现在有所改善。该患者是来自土耳其的交流生，既往无任何病史。她不吸烟、不饮酒，也不使用违禁药物。生命体征在正常范围内。口咽检查未见异常。双侧胸锁乳突肌后方有数个淋巴结肿大。心肺检查无特殊。脾脏可在左侧肋骨下缘下1厘米处触及。无皮疹或其他淋巴结病。外周血评估显示异常白细胞数量增加，如{{exhibit_1}}所示。这些细胞中观察到的细胞质颗粒最可能包含以下哪种物质？"

    "en": "This patient's peripheral blood smear reveals reactive (atypical) lymphocyte. In contrast to normal lymphocytes, which are small, round, and have minimal cytoplasm, reactive lymphocytes are large, scalloped, and have abundant cytoplasm. Reactive lymphocytes are activated, pathogen-specific cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells that form in response to certain intracellular infections (eg, HIV, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis); they are particularly linked to INFECTIOUS MONONUCLEOSIS, a primary Epstein-Barr virus characterized by fever, pharyngitis, adenopathy, splenomegaly, and severe fatigue (as is likely in this patient). Reactive lymphocytes are effector cells that contain cytotoxic granules composed of perforin (creates holes in the infected cell's membrane) and granzymes (enter the cytoplasm of infected cells and trigger cell death), which are released in response to foreign antigens on the surface (MHC class I receptors) of infected host cells. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) Elastase breaks down collagen and is released by neutrophils and macrophages during acute inflammation. Neutrophils have multi-lobe nuclei and pinkish cytoplasm; macrophages have central round nuclei and abundant greyish, vacuolated cytoplasm. Neither typically has scalloped edges or abundant basophilic cytoplasm.\n\n(Choice B) Immunoglobulins are secreted by plasma cells, which have an eccentric nucleus, perinuclear paleness (large Golgi apparatus), and spoke-wheel chromatin. Although immunoglobulins cannot typically be visualized on light microscopy, immunoglobulin inclusions can sometimes be seen in plasma cell malignancies such as multiple myeloma (characterized by anemia, hypercalcemia, bone pain, and renal insufficiency).\n\n(Choice C) Eosinophils generate and release major basic protein, which is the core constituent of eosinophilic granules; it acts as a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin and mediates epithelial damage, exfoliation, and bronchospasm in hypersensitivity diseases. Eosinophils have a bilobed nucleus and stain intensely pink.\n\n(Choice E) Ribosomes generate proteins from messenger RNA; they can be visualized by electron microscopy but usually cannot be seen on light microscopy. However, ribosomal aggregates can sometimes be seen as basophilic stippling in patients with thalassemia or alcoholism.\n\n(Choice F) Viral capsids are usually bound to viral genomes and shed in the cytoplasm prior to viral replication. This typically cannot be seen on light microscopy. Atypical lymphocytes are not infected by virus; they react to infected cells.",
    "zh": "该患者的外周血涂片显示反应性（异型）淋巴细胞。与正常淋巴细胞（小而圆，细胞质最少）相比，反应性淋巴细胞较大，呈扇形，细胞质丰富。反应性淋巴细胞是被激活的、病原体特异性的细胞毒性T细胞和自然杀伤细胞，它们对某些细胞内感染（如HIV、巨细胞病毒、弓形虫病）做出反应；它们尤其与感染性单核细胞增多症相关，这是一种原发性EB病毒，其特征是发热、咽炎、腺病、脾肿大和严重疲劳（这在该患者中很可能发生）。反应性淋巴细胞是效应细胞，包含细胞毒性颗粒，由穿孔素（在受感染细胞的膜上形成孔）和颗粒酶（进入受感染细胞的细胞质并触发细胞死亡）组成，这些颗粒是针对受感染宿主细胞表面的异物抗原（MHC I类受体）释放的。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n（选项A）弹性蛋白酶降解胶原蛋白，由中性粒细胞和巨噬细胞在急性炎症期间释放。中性粒细胞有多叶核和粉红色细胞质；巨噬细胞有中心圆形核和丰富的灰白色空泡化细胞质。两者通常都没有扇形边缘或丰富的嗜碱性细胞质。\n\n（选项B）免疫球蛋白由浆细胞分泌，浆细胞有一个偏心核、核周苍白（大型高尔基体）和轮辐状染色质。虽然免疫球蛋白通常无法通过光学显微镜观察到，但有时可以在浆细胞恶性肿瘤（如多发性骨髓瘤，其特征是贫血、高钙血症、骨痛和肾功能不全）中看到免疫球蛋白包涵体。\n\n（选项C）嗜酸性粒细胞产生并释放主要碱性蛋白，主要碱性蛋白是嗜酸性粒细胞颗粒的核心组成部分；它充当细胞毒素和驱虫毒素，并介导超敏反应性疾病中的上皮损伤、脱屑和支气管痉挛。嗜酸性粒细胞有一个双叶核，呈强烈的粉红色染色。\n\n（选项E）核糖体从信使RNA产生蛋白质；它们可以通过电子显微镜观察到，但通常不能通过光学显微镜观察到。然而，在患有地中海贫血或酒精中毒的患者中，有时可以看到核糖体聚集体，表现为嗜碱性点彩。\n\n（选项F）病毒衣壳通常与病毒基因组结合，并在病毒复制前在细胞质中脱落。这通常无法通过光学显微镜观察到。异型淋巴细胞未被病毒感染；它们对受感染的细胞作出反应。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of infectious mononucleosis (IM) and the characteristics of reactive lymphocytes seen in peripheral blood smears. It assesses the ability to recognize atypical lymphocytes and understand their function in response to intracellular infections.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation suggestive of IM (fatigue, fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly).
