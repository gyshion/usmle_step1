    "en": "{{exhibit_1}}\n\nThe pentose phosphate pathway (HMP shunt) generates NADPH for use in reductive reactions and ribose-5-phosphate, a precursor for the synthesis of nucleotides. The pathway consists of 2 types of reactions: oxidative (irreversible) and nonoxidative (reversible), both of which can function independently depending on cellular requirements.\n\nThe clinical scenario describes a patient with neonatal jaundice whose erythroblasts are unable to generate NADPH from glucose metabolism. This strongly suggests a problem with the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (e.g., GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE deficiency), which is the primary source of NADPH. However, the question specifically asks which enzyme is essential for the *latter conversion* mentioned: the ability to convert **fructose-6-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate**, which is required for nucleic acid synthesis. This particular conversion occurs in the NONOXIDATIVE (reversible) branch of the pentose phosphate pathway.\n\nActivity of the nonoxidative reactions is governed by the cellular demand for ribose-5-phosphate. When ribose-5-phosphate is produced in excess, transketolase and transaldolase can convert it into glycolytic intermediates (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate) for ATP generation. Conversely, when ribose-5-phosphate demand exceeds the production capabilities of the oxidative pathway, the nonoxidative pathway functions in reverse. In this reverse direction, **TRANSKETOLASE** and transaldolase catalyze the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate. Therefore, Transketolase is an essential enzyme for the direct interconversion of fructose-6-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate.\n\n(Choice A) Aconitase catalyzes the isomerization of citrate to isocitrate in the CITRIC ACID CYCLE. It is not involved in the pentose phosphate pathway.\n\n(Choice B) Enolase catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate in GLYCOLYSIS. It is a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, not the pentose phosphate pathway.\n\n(Choice C) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Deficiency of this enzyme results in hemolytic anemia due to the inability to generate NADPH. While the patient's inability to generate NADPH points to a potential issue with this enzyme, the question specifically asks about the enzyme for the *conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate*, which is a nonoxidative reaction. Therefore, while G6PD deficiency explains the NADPH issue, it is not responsible for the direct F6P to R5P conversion itself.\n\n(Choice D) Glutathione reductase catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide to glutathione using NADPH. It is involved in ANTIOXIDANT DEFENSE and requires NADPH, but it does not directly catalyze the interconversion of sugar phosphates within the pentose phosphate pathway. Deficiency would impair REDOX HOMEOSTASIS.",
