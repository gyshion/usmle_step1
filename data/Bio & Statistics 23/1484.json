    "en": "A 4-month-old boy is brought to the office for his first visit since arriving in the United States. The patient was recently adopted, and his mother says that he appears tremulous compared to her other children. Over the past week, the patient has also had episodes of upward eye deviation and bilateral arm and leg shaking for approximately 2 minutes at a time. Biologic family history is unavailable. Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 90/40 mm Hg, pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 30/min. Examination shows a fair-skinned infant with blue eyes and a musty body odor.",

    "en": "This patient's neurologic abnormalities (eg, tremors, seizures) in the setting of musty body odor and light skin/eye color are suggestive of PHENYLKETONURIA (PKU), an autosomal recessive disease in which patients have impaired metabolism of phenylalanine, an essential amino acid. PKU is caused by deficiency of PHENYLALANINE HYDROXYLASE, which catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine.\nMost patients with PKU are identified via routine newborn screening (ie, via elevated phenylalanine levels) and treated with a PHENYLALANINE-RESTRICTED DIET starting in the neonatal period (Choice D). This diet is typically sufficient to prevent manifestations of disease, which are largely due to hyperphenylalaninemia. However, TYROSINE is considered an essential amino acid in patients with PKU because it cannot be synthesized from phenylalanine and is required for the production of proteins, catecholamines, and melanin. Therefore, although tyrosine is usually available in a well-varied diet, TYROSINE SUPPLEMENTATION may be required if intake is insufficient.",
    "zh": "该患者的神经系统异常（例如，震颤、癫痫发作）伴有霉味和浅肤色/眼睛颜色，提示苯丙酮尿症（PKU），这是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，患者的苯丙氨酸（一种必需氨基酸）代谢受损。PKU是由苯丙氨酸羟化酶缺乏引起的，该酶催化苯丙氨酸转化为酪氨酸。\n大多数PKU患者通过常规新生儿筛查（即，通过苯丙氨酸水平升高）确定，并在新生儿期开始接受苯丙氨酸限制饮食（选项D）。这种饮食通常足以预防疾病的表现，这主要是由于高苯丙氨酸血症。然而，酪氨酸在PKU患者中被认为是必需氨基酸，因为它不能由苯丙氨酸合成，并且是蛋白质、儿茶酚胺和黑色素生成的必需物质。因此，尽管酪氨酸通常在多样化的饮食中可用，但如果摄入不足，可能需要补充酪氨酸。"
