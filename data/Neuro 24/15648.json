    "en": "A 62-year-old man comes to the office with his wife due to behavioral changes. The patient has become increasingly impulsive and irritable over the past 1-2 years. He recently lost his job after making inappropriate comments and touching female coworkers. The patient has also lost interest in his hobbies and appears withdrawn during social gatherings. His other medical problems are hypertension and hyperlipidemia. A thorough neuropsychological assessment is conducted. Inability to perform which of the following tasks would be most indicative of frontal lobe dysfunction?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The frontal lobes are involved in a wide array of functions, including PERSONALITY, LANGUAGE, MOTOR FUNCTIONS, and EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS. Executive functions include ABSTRACTION, planning, impulse inhibition, attention, and working memory. Abstraction may be tested by asking a patient to describe the similarities between two objects (eg, a watch and ruler both measure things). Patients with frontal lobe damage may be unable to provide an answer or may provide concrete answers such as \"they both have numbers.\"\n\nBecause of its role in personality and impulse inhibition, processes that damage the frontal lobe (eg, traumatic brain injury, frontotemporal dementia) may lead to significant changes in behavior. Behavior change is more likely with bilateral, rather than unilateral, injury. Patients with frontal lobe injury may be disinhibited, socially inappropriate, irritable, and impulsive.\n\n(Choice A) Impaired language comprehension (ie, Wernicke aphasia) results from lesions in the dominant superior temporal gyrus.\n(Choices C and D) Patients with lesions in the dominant angular and supramarginal gyri (located in the parietal lobe) may have right-left disorientation and finger agnosia (ie, inability to recognize fingers). When these symptoms are accompanied by agraphia (ie, inability to write) and acalculia (ie, inability to perform arithmetic), it is known as Gerstmann syndrome.\n(Choice E) The inability to recognize a familiar face (ie, prosopagnosia) may result from lesions in the fusiform gyrus (located in the temporal and occipital lobes).\n\nEducational objective:\nThe frontal lobes are involved in personality, language, motor functions, and executive functions (eg, abstraction). Frontal lobe function may be diagnosed by testing abstraction ability (eg, asking about the similarities between two related objects) on the mental status examination.",
    "zh": "额叶参与多种功能，包括人格、语言、运动功能和执行功能。执行功能包括抽象、计划、冲动抑制、注意力和工作记忆。抽象能力可以通过要求患者描述两个物体之间的相似之处来测试（例如，手表和尺子都可以测量东西）。额叶受损的患者可能无法提供答案，或者可能提供具体的答案，例如“它们都有数字”。\n\n由于其在人格和冲动抑制中的作用，损伤额叶的过程（例如，脑外伤、额颞叶痴呆）可能导致行为的显著变化。双侧损伤比单侧损伤更容易导致行为改变。额叶损伤的患者可能表现出失抑制、社交不当、易怒和冲动。\n\n（选项 A）语言理解受损（即，韦尼克失语症）是由优势颞上回的病变引起的。\n（选项 C 和 D）优势角回和缘上回（位于顶叶）病变的患者可能出现左右定向障碍和手指失认症（即，无法识别手指）。当这些症状伴有书写不能（即，无法书写）和计算不能（即，无法进行算术运算）时，被称为格斯特曼综合征。\n（选项 E）无法识别熟悉的面孔（即，面孔失认症）可能由梭状回（位于颞叶和枕叶）的病变引起。\n\n教育目标：\n额叶参与人格、语言、运动功能和执行功能（例如，抽象）。额叶功能可以通过在精神状态检查中测试抽象能力（例如，询问两个相关物体之间的相似之处）来诊断。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of frontal lobe functions and how their impairment manifests in specific cognitive tasks. It requires differentiating between deficits caused by frontal lobe lesions and those resulting from damage to other brain regions.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the core functions of the frontal lobes, particularly executive functions like abstraction and impulse control. By evaluating the presented clinical scenario and the options, one can determine which task's impairment is most directly linked to frontal lobe dysfunction.",
