    "en": "A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to severe agitation and aggressive behavior. He speaks loudly and rapidly, stating that he has \"superpowers\" of mind control and that violence is the only way to defend against \"the conspiracy.\" The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is prescribed olanzapine, lithium, and fluoxetine, although it is unclear if he has been compliant. The patient requires several doses of medication in the emergency department to calm down and is subsequently admitted to the hospital for further psychiatric evaluation. The following night he is found lying very still on his bed and does not respond to questions. Temperature is 40.6 C (105.1 F), blood pressure is 157/90 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 20/min. Examination is significant for diaphoresis and diffuse rigidity in upper and lower extremities.",

    "en": "This patient is experiencing a manic episode with psychotic features and most likely received multiple doses of antipsychotic medication to control his agitation in the emergency department. His HYPERTHERMIA, SYMPATHETIC HYPERACTIVITY (eg, diaphoresis, tachycardia), severe MUSCLE RIGIDITY (frequently described as \"lead-pipe rigidity\"), and ALTERED MENTAL STATUS are characteristic of NEUROLEPTIC MALIGNANT SYNDROME (NMS).\n\nNMS is a potentially life-threatening adverse reaction to ANTIPSYCHOTICS (ie, neuroleptics) that typically presents 1-3 days after initiation or dose escalation. It is thought to be caused by antagonism of central dopaminergic systems involved in thermoregulation and regulation of muscle tone and movement. Treatment involves cessation of the causative agent; benzodiazepines and dantrolene (a postsynaptic muscle relaxant) are used for treating severe cases.\n\n(Choices A, B, and C) Antipsychotic D2 dopamine receptor antagonism in the nigrostriatal pathway can cause a variety of reactions (known as extrapyramidal symptoms) that can be confused with NMS. Acute dystonic reactions involve distressing contractions of the neck, mouth, and tongue. Akathisia is a subjective feeling of intense restlessness and an inability to sit still. Drug-induced parkinsonism manifests as rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor. None of these conditions involves altered mental status, hyperthermia, or sympathetic hyperactivity.\n\n(Choice D) Lithium is a mood stabilizer used in bipolar disorder but is not used to control acute agitation and psychosis. Acute lithium toxicity typically begins with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, with neuromuscular signs developing later.\n\n(Choice F) Although serotonin syndrome (due to overdose or combinations of serotonergic drugs) can also present with mental status changes, hyperthermia, and sympathetic hyperactivity, it typically presents with neuromuscular hyperactivity (eg, clonus, hyperreflexia) as opposed to the diffuse rigidity seen in NMS and in this patient.",
    "zh": "该患者正在经历伴有精神病症状的躁狂发作，并且很可能在急诊科接受了多剂量的抗精神病药物来控制他的躁动。他的高热、交感神经活性亢进（如出汗、心动过速）、严重的肌肉僵硬（常被描述为“铅管样僵硬”）和精神状态改变是神经安定剂恶性综合征（NMS）的特征。\n\nNMS是对抗精神病药（即神经安定剂）的一种潜在的危及生命的副作用，通常在开始或增加剂量后1-3天出现。它被认为是由涉及体温调节和肌肉张力及运动调节的中枢多巴胺能系统的拮抗作用引起的。治疗包括停止使用致病药物；苯二氮卓类药物和丹曲林（一种突触后肌肉松弛剂）用于治疗严重病例。\n\n（选项A、B和C）在黑质纹状体通路中，抗精神病药D2多巴胺受体拮抗作用可引起多种反应（称为锥体外系症状），这些症状可能与NMS混淆。急性肌张力障碍反应涉及颈部、口腔和舌部的痛苦收缩。静坐不能是一种主观的强烈不安和无法静坐的感觉。药物引起的帕金森病表现为僵硬、运动迟缓和震颤。这些情况均不涉及精神状态改变、高热或交感神经活性亢进。\n\n（选项D）锂盐是一种用于治疗双相情感障碍的情绪稳定剂，但不用来控制急性躁动和精神病。急性锂中毒通常始于恶心、呕吐和腹泻，随后出现神经肌肉体征。\n\n（选项F）虽然血清素综合征（由于过量或血清素能药物的组合）也可能表现为精神状态改变、高热和交感神经活性亢进，但它通常表现为神经肌肉活性亢进（例如，阵挛、反射亢进），而不是NMS和该患者中出现的弥漫性僵硬。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a severe adverse reaction to antipsychotic medications. It requires differentiating NMS from other extrapyramidal symptoms and conditions like serotonin syndrome based on the constellation of symptoms including hyperthermia, autonomic instability, muscle rigidity, and altered mental status.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully review the patient's presentation, focusing on the timing of medication administration and the specific clinical findings. The presence of hyperthermia, severe rigidity (described as diffuse), diaphoresis, and altered mental status, especially following the administration of antipsychotics, strongly suggests NMS. Comparing these findings to the typical presentations of the other options is crucial for accurate diagnosis.",
    "zh": "本题考察对神经安定剂恶性综合征（NMS）的理解，NMS是对抗精神病药物的严重不良反应。它需要根据包括高热、自主神经功能不稳定、肌肉僵硬和精神状态改变在内的症状组合，将NMS与其他锥体外系症状和血清素综合征等疾病区分开来。\n\n为了解决这个问题，必须仔细回顾患者的临床表现，重点关注用药时间和具体的临床发现。高热、严重僵硬（描述为弥漫性）、出汗和精神状态改变的存在，特别是在使用抗精神病药后，强烈提示NMS。将这些发现与其他选项的典型表现进行比较，对于准确诊断至关重要。"
