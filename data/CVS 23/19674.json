    "en": "Researchers are studying the coronary circulation in various healthy and diseased states. They measure blood flow and pressure (blue circle) in one of the epicardial coronary arteries of an experimental animal with cardiovascular physiology similar to that of humans. Then they clamp the artery to simulate 60% atherosclerotic stenosis and remeasure the flow and pressure distal to the lesion. Which of the following changes are most likely to be observed once steady state is achieved? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "(Choices A, B, and C) Perfusion pressure decreases (rather than increases or remains the same) distal to a significant stenosis. Coronary autoregulation allows blood flow to remain nearly unchanged distal to the stenosis.\n\nEducational objective:\nPerfusion pressure decreases distal to a significant coronary artery stenosis, resulting in an initial decrease in blood flow. Coronary autoregulation stimulates arteriolar vasodilation, which reduces downstream vascular resistance and helps return blood flow to near-normal levels to prevent myocardial ischemia. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "（选项 A、B 和 C）灌注压力在显著狭窄的远端降低（而不是升高或保持不变）。冠状动脉自动调节使血流在狭窄远端保持几乎不变。\n\n教育目的：\n灌注压力在显著冠状动脉狭窄的远端降低，导致血流最初下降。冠状动脉自动调节刺激小动脉舒张，降低下游血管阻力，并有助于使血流恢复到接近正常水平，以防止心肌缺血。 {{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "The question explores the effects of coronary artery stenosis on blood flow and pressure. The correct answer is D, indicating that perfusion pressure decreases distal to the stenosis, while coronary autoregulation maintains blood flow at near-normal levels.",
