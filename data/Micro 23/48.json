    "en": "Hepatitis E virus is an unenveloped, single-stranded RNA virus spread through the fecal-oral route. Infection with HEV occurs primarily in young and middle-aged adults living in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Mexico, with an average incubation period of 6 weeks. While the virus is shed in the stool during the acute illness, the disease is typically self-limited and not associated with either chronic liver disease or a carrier state. HEV antigen or HEV RNA can be detected in the stool or liver in the earliest stages of infection (when the patient is asymptomatic). Later, serum transaminases and IgM anti-HEV titers rise in association with clinical illness. The most concerning feature of hepatitis E is the high mortality rate observed in infected pregnant women.\n\n(Choice B) Although hepatitis B, C, and D can be transmitted parenterally (with patients with intravenous drug use and hemophilia at particularly high risk), hepatitis A and E are primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route.\n\n(Choice C) Hepatitis E causes an acute illness and is not associated with chronic infection.\n\n(Choice D) Unlike hepatitis D virus, hepatitis E is not dependent on HBsAg for infection and multiplication.\n\n(Choice E) Because of their association with hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatitis B and C have been suggested to have oncogenic properties. Hepatitis E is not associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, however.",
    "zh": "戊型肝炎病毒是一种无包膜的单链RNA病毒，通过粪-口途径传播。HEV感染主要发生在亚洲、撒哈拉以南非洲和墨西哥的年轻人和中年人中，平均潜伏期为6周。虽然病毒在急性期通过粪便排出，但该疾病通常为自限性，且与慢性肝病或携带状态无关。HEV抗原或HEV RNA可在感染的早期（患者无症状时）在粪便或肝脏中检测到。随后，血清转氨酶和IgM抗-HEV滴度升高，与临床疾病相关。戊型肝炎最令人担忧的特征是感染孕妇的高死亡率。\n\n(选项B) 虽然乙型、丙型和丁型肝炎可以通过肠外途径传播（静脉吸毒和血友病患者的风险尤其高），但甲型和戊型肝炎主要通过粪-口途径传播。\n\n(选项C) 戊型肝炎引起急性疾病，与慢性感染无关。\n\n(选项D) 与丁型肝炎病毒不同，戊型肝炎不依赖于HBsAg进行感染和复制。\n\n(选项E) 由于与肝细胞癌相关，乙型和丙型肝炎被认为具有致癌性。然而，戊型肝炎与肝细胞癌风险增加无关。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) characteristics, including its transmission route, structure, and clinical presentation, especially in pregnant women.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the association of fulminant hepatitis in pregnant women with HEV and recalling that HEV is an unenveloped RNA virus transmitted via the fecal-oral route.",
    "zh": "本题考察对戊型肝炎病毒（HEV）特征的了解，包括其传播途径、结构和临床表现，尤其是在孕妇中的表现。\n\n解决此题的关键在于认识到孕妇爆发性肝炎与HEV的关系，并回想起HEV是一种通过粪-口途径传播的无包膜RNA病毒。"
