    "en": "A 30-year-old woman comes to the emergency department after a seizure. The patient reports pain on the left side of her face and is unable to fully open or close her mouth. She is drooling. On examination, the jaw deviates to the right and the left mandibular condyle is very prominent with a palpable depression posterior to it. The patient is diagnosed with an anterior dislocation of the left temporomandibular joint. The jaw is most likely maintained in a dislocated position due to continued spasm of which of the following muscles?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has an anterior dislocation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), the synovial joint that opens and closes the jaw. The joint is formed by the mandibular condyle that sits in the glenoid fossa of the squamous portion of the temporal bone.\n\nTMJ opening involves a complex movement that has both hinge and sliding components:\n\n*   The initial movement is rotational (ie, hinge) and driven by the lateral pterygoid muscles, which are the only muscles of mastication that aid in depressing the mandible (ie, opening the jaw).\n*   As the jaw opens, the ligaments become taut, stopping further rotation.\n*   Further action by the lateral pterygoids results in translational movement (ie, condyle slides anteriorly) that opens the jaw fully.\n\nTMJ dislocation occurs when translational movement is exaggerated due to extreme jaw opening (eg, yawning, orotracheal intubation, seizure) that causes displacement of the condyle anteriorly out of the glenoid fossa. Stretching of the ligaments causes significant pain and spasm of the muscles of mastication. This muscle spasm (specifically of the lateral pterygoids that aid jaw opening) prevents spontaneous resolution of the dislocation; manual reduction is usually necessary. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) The buccinator muscle underlies the cheek. It holds the cheek close to the teeth to control food boluses during chewing but is not involved in movement of the jaw.\n\n(Choice B) The genioglossus muscles form the body of the tongue. Although they originate on the tubercle of the mandible (and insert into the hyoid bone and the bottom of the tongue), they are responsible for tongue protrusion rather than mandibular movement.\n\n(Choice D) The sternocleidomastoid muscles originate at the sternum and the clavicle and insert on the mastoid tip. They rotate the head (when acting independently) or flex the neck (when acting in concert).\n\n(Choice E) The superior pharyngeal constrictor forms portions of the posterior and lateral oropharyngeal walls. Muscle contraction propels food and liquid inferiorly into the esophagus during swallowing.\n\n(Choice F) The zygomaticus major originates from the zygomatic bone and inserts onto the angle of the mouth. Contraction pulls the angle of the mouth laterally and superiorly during a smile.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe lateral pterygoid muscles are the only muscles of mastication that aid in depressing the mandible (ie, opening the jaw). Spasm of the lateral pterygoids prevents spontaneous reduction of an anterior dislocation of the temporomandibular joint.",
    "zh": "该患者患有颞下颌关节 (TMJ) 的前脱位，该关节是打开和关闭下颌的滑膜关节。该关节由下颌髁突形成，该髁突位于颞骨鳞状部分的关节窝内。\n\nTMJ的开放涉及一个复杂的运动，既有铰链又有滑动成分：\n\n*   最初的运动是旋转的（即，铰链），由外侧翼状肌驱动，外侧翼状肌是唯一有助于降低下颌骨（即，张开下颌）的咀嚼肌。\n*   当下颌张开时，韧带会变得紧张，停止进一步旋转。\n*   外侧翼状肌的进一步作用导致平移运动（即，髁突向前滑动），从而完全张开下颌。\n\n当由于极度张开下颌（例如，打哈欠、气管插管、癫痫发作）导致髁突向前移出关节窝时，就会发生TMJ脱位。韧带的拉伸会导致咀嚼肌的剧烈疼痛和痉挛。这种肌肉痉挛（特别是协助张开下颌的外侧翼状肌）阻止了脱位的自发复位；通常需要手动复位。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项A) 颊肌位于面颊下方。它使面颊靠近牙齿，以在咀嚼过程中控制食物团，但与下颌的运动无关。\n\n(选项B) 舌肌构成舌体。虽然它们起源于下颌结节（并插入舌骨和舌底），但它们负责舌头的突出而不是下颌的运动。\n\n(选项D) 胸锁乳突肌起源于胸骨和锁骨，并插入乳突尖。它们旋转头部（独立作用时）或屈曲颈部（协同作用时）。\n\n(选项E) 上咽缩肌形成后和侧口咽壁的一部分。肌肉收缩在吞咽过程中将食物和液体向下推入食管。\n\n(选项F) 颧大肌起源于颧骨，并插入到口角。收缩在微笑时将口角向外和向上拉。\n\n教育目标：\n外侧翼状肌是唯一有助于降低下颌骨（即，张开下颌）的咀嚼肌。外侧翼状肌的痉挛阻止了颞下颌关节前脱位的自发复位。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the anatomy and function of the muscles involved in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) movement, specifically the role of the lateral pterygoid muscle in TMJ dislocation. It also assesses understanding of the pathophysiology of TMJ dislocation and the mechanism by which muscle spasm prevents spontaneous reduction.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the muscles responsible for opening the jaw (depressing the mandible). Recognize that the lateral pterygoid muscle is the primary muscle involved in this action and that spasm of this muscle can maintain the dislocated position. Eliminate other options based on their known functions.",
