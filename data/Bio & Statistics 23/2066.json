  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient likely has hereditary orotic aciduria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder of de novo pyrimidine synthesis that results in developmental delay (eg, low height/weight, absent developmental milestones), megaloblastic anemia (eg, elevated mean corpuscular volume, low reticulocyte count), and elevated urinary orotic acid levels. Increased urinary orotic acid may also be seen in ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency; however, patients with this condition classically have failure to thrive and hyperammonemic encephalopathy within the first few weeks of life (due to impaired urea synthesis).\n\nHereditary orotic aciduria occurs due to a defect in uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) synthase, a polypeptide containing 2 enzymatic domains (orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and OMP decarboxylase) that catalyze the final conversion of orotic acid to UMP. Impaired conversion of orotic acid to UMP results in the excretion of large amounts of orotic acid in the urine and the clinical features described above. Uridine supplementation can bypass this enzymatic defect {{exhibit_1}} and improve symptoms as uridine is converted to UMP via nucleoside kinases.\n\n(Choice A) Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is required for hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen synthesis; therefore, it plays an important role in connective tissue maintenance and wound healing.\n\n(Choice B) Folate participates in single carbon transfer reactions, as in the de novo synthesis of purines and thymidine. Folate supplements will improve megaloblastic anemia resulting from folate deficiency but will not improve the anemia in orotic aciduria.\n\n(Choice C) Guanine and adenine are purine bases present in DNA and RNA. Orotic aciduria is a defect in the synthesis of pyrimidine bases, so supplementation with purines would not affect orate synthesis.\n\n(Choice D) Iron supplementation improves iron deficiency anemia, classically a microcytic hypochromic anemia.\n\n(Choice E) Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation is indicated during treatment with isoniazid. Pyridoxine is a cofactor in transamination, deamination, decarboxylation, and condensation reactions.",
    "zh": "该患者可能患有遗传性乳清酸尿症，这是一种罕见的常染色体隐性遗传病，涉及从头嘧啶合成，导致发育迟缓（例如，身高/体重低，缺乏发育里程碑）、巨幼细胞性贫血（例如，平均红细胞体积升高，网织红细胞计数低）和尿乳清酸水平升高。尿乳清酸升高也可见于鸟氨酸氨甲酰转移酶缺乏症；然而，患有这种情况的患者通常会在出生后几周内出现生长发育迟缓和高氨血症性脑病（由于尿素合成受损）。\n\n遗传性乳清酸尿症是由于尿苷 5'-单磷酸 (UMP) 合酶的缺陷引起的，这是一种多肽，包含 2 个酶结构域（乳清酸磷酸核糖转移酶和 OMP 脱羧酶），它们催化乳清酸最终转化为 UMP。乳清酸转化为 UMP 受损会导致尿液中大量乳清酸的排泄以及上述临床特征。尿苷补充剂可以绕过这种酶缺陷 {{exhibit_1}}，并通过核苷激酶将尿苷转化为 UMP 来改善症状。\n\n（选项 A）抗坏血酸（维生素 C）是胶原蛋白合成中脯氨酸和赖氨酸残基羟化所必需的；因此，它在结缔组织维持和伤口愈合中起着重要作用。\n\n（选项 B）叶酸参与单碳转移反应，如从头合成嘌呤和胸苷。叶酸补充剂将改善由叶酸缺乏引起的巨幼细胞性贫血，但不会改善乳清酸尿症中的贫血。\n\n（选项 C）鸟嘌呤和腺嘌呤是存在于 DNA 和 RNA 中的嘌呤碱基。乳清酸尿症是嘧啶碱基合成的缺陷，因此补充嘌呤不会影响乳酸盐的合成。\n\n（选项 D）铁补充剂可改善缺铁性贫血，这通常是一种小细胞低色素性贫血。\n\n（选项 E）在异烟肼治疗期间，需要补充吡哆醇（维生素 B6）。吡哆醇是转氨、脱氨、脱羧和缩合反应的辅助因子。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hereditary orotic aciduria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder of de novo pyrimidine synthesis, and its characteristic features like developmental delay, megaloblastic anemia, and elevated urinary orotic acid levels. It also assesses the understanding of how uridine supplementation can bypass the enzymatic defect in uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) synthase.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation suggestive of orotic aciduria based on developmental delay, megaloblastic anemia, and the presence of orotic acid crystals in the urine.
