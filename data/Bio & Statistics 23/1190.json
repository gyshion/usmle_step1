    "en": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the office with a palpable thyroid node. Medical history reveals that she was diagnosed with medulloblastoma during childhood and treated with chemotherapy and external beam radiation. Fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid shows no malignant cells. As the test results are explained to the patient, she asks, “What are the chances that I really do not have thyroid cancer?”",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Negative predictive value (NPV) is defined as the probability of not having a disease when the test result is negative. NPV is calculated as the proportion of true negatives divided by the total number of negative tests (true and false negatives); therefore, it varies with the prevalence of disease in the target population.\n\nThe prevalence of a disease in a population may be used as an estimate for the pretest probability of having the disease in patients who closely resemble the population. A patient with a high pretest probability will have a low NPV with a negative test, whereas a patient with a low pretest probability will have a high NPV with a negative test. This patient has a high pretest probability for having thyroid cancer since she most likely received significant radiation exposure to the thyroid during childhood. As such, her negative cytology results would have a lower NPV when compared to another patient with no risk factors for thyroid malignancy who also tests negative.\n\n(Choice B) Positive predictive value also varies according to the pretest probability but applies to positive test results.\n\n(Choices C and D) Sensitivity and specificity of a test are intrinsic characteristics of a test; their values are fixed and do not vary with the pretest probability of a disease. An ideal diagnostic test should be both highly sensitive and highly specific. In this case, fine-needle aspiration has a high sensitivity and specificity; however, NPV is a better parameter for addressing the patient’s question (ie, how likely is she to not have thyroid cancer given her negative test result?); in this case her NPV might be low given her prior radiation exposure.\n\n(Choice E) Validity represents the accuracy of the test (ie, the test measures what it is supposed to measure). It does not depend on the pretest probability of the disease.\n\nEducational objective:\nNegative predictive value (NPV) is the probability of not having a disease when the test result is negative. The NPV will vary with the pretest probability of a disease. A patient with a high probability of having a disease will have a low NPV with a negative test, but a patient with a low probability of having a disease will have a high NPV with a negative test.",
    "zh": "阴性预测值 (NPV) 定义为当检测结果为阴性时，未患该疾病的概率。NPV 的计算方法是用真阴性数除以阴性检测总数（真阴性和假阴性）；因此，它随目标人群中疾病的患病率而变化。\n\n人群中疾病的患病率可用作与该人群非常相似的患者患该疾病的 pretest 概率的估计值。pretest 概率高的患者，阴性检测的 NPV 较低，而 pretest 概率低的患者，阴性检测的 NPV 较高。由于该患者很可能在儿童时期接受了大量的甲状腺放射线照射，因此患甲状腺癌的 pretest 概率较高。因此，与没有甲状腺恶性肿瘤风险因素，且检测结果也为阴性的另一名患者相比，她的阴性细胞学检查结果的 NPV 会较低。\n\n(选项 B) 阳性预测值也随 pretest 概率而变化，但适用于阳性检测结果。\n\n(选项 C 和 D) 某项检测的敏感度和特异度是该检测的内在特征；它们的值是固定的，并且不随疾病的 pretest 概率而变化。理想的诊断检测应该具有高度的敏感度和高度的特异度。在这种情况下，细针穿刺具有高敏感度和高特异度；然而，NPV 是一个更好的参数，可以用来回答患者的问题（即，考虑到她的阴性检测结果，她未患甲状腺癌的几率有多大？）；在这种情况下，考虑到她之前的放射线照射，她的 NPV 可能会较低。\n\n(选项 E) 效度代表检测的准确性（即，检测测量了它应该测量的内容）。它不依赖于疾病的 pretest 概率。\n\n教育目标：\n阴性预测值 (NPV) 是指当检测结果为阴性时，未患疾病的概率。NPV 会随疾病的 pretest 概率而变化。患病概率高的患者，阴性检测的 NPV 较低，而患病概率低的患者，阴性检测的 NPV 较高。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the examinee's understanding of negative predictive value (NPV) and how it relates to pretest probability when interpreting diagnostic test results. It also tests knowledge of the differences between NPV, positive predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, and validity.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the patient is asking about the likelihood of *not* having thyroid cancer given a negative test result. This makes NPV the relevant parameter. Recognize that her prior radiation exposure increases her pretest probability, which affects the NPV.",
