    "en": "Gastric parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl) in response to 3 major stimulants: histamine, vagal output, and gastrin.\n\n1.  Histamine is released from enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells and binds to H2 receptors on the basolateral parietal cell membrane.\n\n2.  Vagal stimulation causes acetylcholine release, which directly stimulates HCl secretion by binding to parietal cell muscarinic (M3) receptors. In addition, vagal stimulation indirectly promotes HCl secretion via gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), which stimulates gastrin release from G cells.\n\n3.  G cells also release gastrin in response to protein-rich meals. Gastrin primarily stimulates HCl secretion by binding to the CCK receptor on ECL cells (promotes histamine release). It also directly binds to the CCK receptor on parietal cells, but this mechanism is less significant for acid secretion.\n\nThe final common pathway for HCl secretion is the H+/K+-ATPase proton pump, located on the apical membrane of the parietal cell. Based on the graphs shown above, drug A inhibits gastric acid secretion in response to all 3 major stimulants. Therefore, drug A is most similar to a proton pump inhibitor (eg, lansoprazole, omeprazole) as it is likely inhibiting the H+/K+-ATPase proton pump. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) Atropine is a nonselective antimuscarinic agent often used to produce mydriasis/cycloplegia or reverse bradycardia. Atropine may reduce gastric acid secretion in response to vagal stimulation by blocking parietal cell M3 receptors; however, it would not significantly decrease acid secretion during histamine or gastrin infusion.\n\n(Choice B) Bethanechol is a cholinomimetic muscarinic agonist used to treat ileus and urinary retention. Bethanechol would promote gastric acid secretion by stimulating parietal cell M3 receptors.\n\n(Choice C) Cimetidine treats gastroesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer disease by blocking parietal cell H2 receptors. Although H2 receptor blockade would reduce gastric acid secretion in response to histamine or gastrin infusion, it would not significantly reduce acid secretion in response to vagal stimulation.\n\n(Choice E) Sucralfate may promote peptic ulcer healing by binding to the base of mucosal ulcers and providing physical protection against gastric acid; however, it does not inhibit gastric acid secretion.",
    "zh": "胃壁细胞对3种主要刺激物作出反应，分泌盐酸（HCl）：组胺、迷走神经输出和胃泌素。\n\n1. 组胺从肠嗜铬样细胞 (ECL) 释放，并与基底外侧壁细胞膜上的 H2 受体结合。\n\n2. 迷走神经刺激引起乙酰胆碱释放，乙酰胆碱通过与壁细胞毒蕈碱（M3）受体结合直接刺激 HCl 分泌。此外，迷走神经刺激通过胃泌素释放肽 (GRP) 间接促进 HCl 分泌，GRP 刺激 G 细胞释放胃泌素。\n\n3. G 细胞还会响应富含蛋白质的膳食而释放胃泌素。胃泌素主要通过与 ECL 细胞上的 CCK 受体结合（促进组胺释放）来刺激 HCl 分泌。它也直接与壁细胞上的 CCK 受体结合，但这种机制对酸分泌的影响较小。\n\nHCl 分泌的最终共同途径是 H+/K+-ATP 酶质子泵，位于壁细胞的顶端膜上。根据上面显示的图表，药物A可抑制胃酸分泌，以应对所有3种主要刺激物。因此，药物A与质子泵抑制剂（例如，兰索拉唑、奥美拉唑）最相似，因为它可能抑制 H+/K+-ATP 酶质子泵。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n(选项A) 阿托品是一种非选择性抗毒蕈碱药剂，常用于产生瞳孔散大/睫状肌麻痹或逆转心动过缓。阿托品可能通过阻断壁细胞M3受体来减少对迷走神经刺激的胃酸分泌；然而，它不会显着减少组胺或胃泌素输注期间的酸分泌。\n\n(选项B) 贝胆碱是一种胆碱能拟毒蕈碱激动剂，用于治疗肠梗阻和尿潴留。贝胆碱通过刺激壁细胞M3受体来促进胃酸分泌。\n\n(选项C) 西咪替丁通过阻断壁细胞H2受体来治疗胃食管反流和消化性溃疡病。尽管H2受体阻断会减少对组胺或胃泌素输注的胃酸分泌，但它不会显着减少对迷走神经刺激的酸分泌。\n\n(选项E) 硫糖铝可以通过与黏膜溃疡的底部结合并提供对胃酸的物理保护来促进消化性溃疡的愈合；然而，它不会抑制胃酸分泌。"
