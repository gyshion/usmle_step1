  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The frontal lobes are involved in a wide array of functions, including personality, language, motor functions, and executive functions. Executive functions include abstraction, planning, impulse inhibition, attention, and working memory. Abstraction may be tested by asking a patient to describe the similarities between two objects (eg, a watch and ruler both measure things). Patients with frontal lobe damage may be unable to provide an answer or may provide concrete answers such as \"they both have numbers.\"\n\nBecause of its role in personality and impulse inhibition, processes that damage the frontal lobe (eg, traumatic brain injury, frontotemporal dementia) may lead to significant changes in behavior. Behavior change is more likely with bilateral, rather than unilateral, injury. Patients with frontal lobe injury may be disinhibited, socially inappropriate, irritable, and impulsive.\n\n(Choice A) Impaired language comprehension (ie, Wernicke aphasia) results from lesions in the dominant superior temporal gyrus.\n\n(Choices C and D) Patients with lesions in the dominant angular and supramarginal gyri (located in the parietal lobe) may have right-left disorientation and finger agnosia (ie, inability to recognize fingers). When these symptoms are accompanied by agraphia (ie, inability to write) and acalculia (ie, inability to perform arithmetic), it is known as Gerstmann syndrome.\n\n(Choice E) The inability to recognize a familiar face (ie, prosopagnosia) may result from lesions in the fusiform gyrus (located in the temporal and occipital lobes).",
    "zh": "额叶参与多种功能，包括人格、语言、运动功能和执行功能。执行功能包括抽象、计划、冲动抑制、注意力、和工作记忆。抽象可以通过询问患者描述两个物体之间的相似之处来测试（例如，手表和尺子都可以测量东西）。额叶受损的患者可能无法给出答案，或者可能提供具体的答案，例如“它们都有数字”。\n\n由于其在人格和冲动抑制中的作用，损伤额叶的过程（例如，脑外伤，额颞叶痴呆）可能导致行为的显著变化。双侧损伤比单侧损伤更容易引起行为改变。额叶损伤的患者可能会出现放松抑制、社会不适、易怒和冲动。\n\n（选项A）语言理解受损（即，韦尼克失语症）是由优势半球颞上回的病变引起的。\n\n（选项C和D）优势角回和缘上回（位于顶叶）病变的患者可能出现左右定向障碍和手指失认症（即，无法识别手指）。当这些症状伴有书写不能（即，无法书写）和计算不能（即，无法进行算术）时，称为格斯特曼综合征。\n\n（选项E）无法识别熟悉的面孔（即，面孔失认症）可能由梭状回（位于颞叶和枕叶）的病变引起。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of frontal lobe function and how to assess it on mental status examination. Specifically, it focuses on the concept of abstraction and its relationship to executive function.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of frontal lobe dysfunction (impulsivity, irritability, social inappropriateness) and then identify the task that directly assesses frontal lobe executive function, such as abstraction.",
