    "en": "A 38-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to abdominal discomfort and diarrhea. Her symptoms began after she returned yesterday from a Caribbean cruise. She consumed bottled water but ate raw, local seafood when visiting one of the islands. The cruise line has reported no other passengers with abdominal illness. On examination, the abdomen is soft with mild, generalized tenderness and hyperactive bowel sounds. A comma-shaped, oxidase-positive, gram-negative rod naturally found in salt water is implicated in her illness.",
    "zh": "一名38岁的女性因腹部不适和腹泻来到急诊科。她的症状始于她昨天从加勒比海游轮回来后。她在游览其中一个岛屿时饮用了瓶装水，但吃了当地的生海鲜。游轮公司报告说没有其他乘客出现腹部疾病。检查显示，腹部柔软，有轻微的弥漫性压痛和肠鸣音亢进。一种天然存在于盐水中、逗点状、氧化酶阳性、革兰氏阴性杆菌与她的疾病有关。"

    "en": "Vibrio cholerae is an oxidase-positive, gram-negative, comma-shaped organism that requires salt for growth and exists naturally in aquatic environments. Transmission occurs due to ingestion of contaminated food or water. Sporadic cases are often caused by the consumption of contaminated shellfish; outbreaks may occur in areas where safe water, sanitation, and health care services are limited.\n\nPathogens typically cause diarrhea by invading/damaging the intestinal epithelium or releasing enterotoxins. V cholerae is a noninvasive organism. It clumps together in colonies along the surface of the small intestine and causes diarrhea via the elaboration of cholera toxin (related to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin). This enterotoxin enters intestinal epithelial cells and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to increased chloride efflux, reduced sodium reabsorption, and the subsequent movement of water from the enterocyte to the gastrointestinal lumen.\n\nPatients typically present with high-volume, watery diarrhea that can cause dehydration and death within 12 hours. Because the pathogen is noninvasive and the toxin does not cause cell death, stool microscopy generally reveals no leukocytes or erythrocytes. However, flecks of mucus are often seen (rice-water stool) due to the activation of goblet cells. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is the mainstay of therapy.\n\n(Choice A) Charcot-Leyden crystals (from eosinophil breakdown) in the stool are sometimes seen in intestinal parasitic infections. Diarrhea with peripheral eosinophilia can be seen with Strongyloides, Ancylostoma, Ascaris, Toxocara, and Trichinella (but not with Giardia or Entamoeba).\n\n(Choice B) The presence of leukocytes with monocytic predominance is typical for typhoid fever caused by Salmonella Typhi.\n\n(Choices C and D) Invading bacteria that cause dysentery or inflammatory diarrhea (eg, Shigella species, Salmonella species, Campylobacter jejuni, enteroinvasive E coli [EIEC]) are usually marked by leukocytes with neutrophilic predominance and erythrocytes. A hemorrhagic organism (eg, enterohemorrhagic E coli O157:H7, which causes toxin-mediated enterocyte death) and intestinal hemorrhage without mucosal invasion) would be characterized by erythrocytes without leukocytes.\n\nEducational objective:\nVibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli cause a purely toxin-mediated watery diarrhea. The toxins secreted by these organisms modify electrolyte handling by enterocytes but do not cause cell death; therefore, no erythrocytes or leukocytes are typically noted on stool microscopy.",
    "zh": "霍乱弧菌是一种氧化酶阳性、革兰氏阴性、逗点状的生物，其生长需要盐，自然存在于水生环境中。传播是由于摄入了被污染的食物或水。散发病例通常由食用被污染的贝类引起；爆发可能发生在安全水、卫生和医疗保健服务有限的地区。\n\n病原体通常通过侵入/损伤肠上皮或释放肠毒素引起腹泻。霍乱弧菌是一种非侵入性生物。它聚集在小肠表面的菌落中，并通过产生霍乱毒素（与产肠毒素大肠杆菌耐热不稳定毒素有关）引起腹泻。这种肠毒素进入肠上皮细胞并激活腺苷酸环化酶，导致氯离子外流增加，钠重吸收减少，以及随后水从肠细胞向胃肠腔的转移。\n\n患者通常表现为高容量、水样腹泻，可在12小时内引起脱水和死亡。由于病原体是非侵入性的，并且毒素不会引起细胞死亡，粪便显微镜检查通常不会显示白细胞或红细胞。然而，由于杯状细胞的激活，通常会看到粘液斑点（米汤样便）。积极的液体复苏是治疗的主要方法。\n\n（选项A）粪便中的夏科-莱登结晶（来自嗜酸性粒细胞的分解）有时见于肠道寄生虫感染。周围嗜酸性粒细胞增多的腹泻可见于粪圆线虫、钩口线虫、蛔虫、犬弓首线虫和旋毛虫（但不伴有贾第虫或溶组织内阿米巴病）。\n\n（选项B）单核细胞占优势的白细胞的存在是伤寒（由伤寒沙门氏菌引起）的典型特征。\n\n（选项C和D）引起痢疾或炎症性腹泻的侵入性细菌（例如，志贺氏菌属、沙门氏菌属、空肠弯曲菌、肠侵袭性大肠杆菌[EIEC]）通常以嗜中性粒细胞占优势的白细胞和红细胞为标志。出血性生物（例如，产肠毒素大肠杆菌O157:H7，可引起毒素介导的肠细胞死亡）和没有黏膜侵袭的肠出血）的特征是红细胞，没有白细胞。\n\n教育目标：\n霍乱弧菌和产肠毒素大肠杆菌引起纯粹的毒素介导的水样腹泻。这些生物分泌的毒素会改变肠细胞对电解质的处理，但不会引起细胞死亡；因此，粪便显微镜检查中通常不会注意到红细胞或白细胞。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Vibrio cholerae infection, its pathogenesis, and expected stool microscopy findings. It emphasizes the non-invasive nature of the organism and the toxin-mediated mechanism of diarrhea.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the association between raw seafood consumption and Vibrio cholerae, understand that it causes a non-inflammatory diarrhea, and recall that stool microscopy in such cases typically shows mucus but no leukocytes or erythrocytes.",
