    "en": "A 12-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department with severe chest pain. He has had intermittent substernal chest pain for the past few months that typically occurs after heavy activity. The boy's activities have been limited due to the chest pain, and he is no longer able to play on the soccer team. The patient does not use tobacco or illicit drugs. His temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 132/min, respirations are 24/min, and pulse oximetry is 98% on room air. BMI is 17 kg/m². Physical examination shows an anxious-appearing boy with a rapid but regular pulse. No abnormalities are seen. Troponin is elevated, and ECG reveals ST segment elevations in leads II, III, and aVF. After acute stabilization and treatment, further laboratory workup shows an increased serum methionine level.",

    "en": "Methionine cycle\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\nHomocysteine is used for many methyltransferase reactions. After the transfer of a methyl group, SAM is converted into S-adenosyl-homocysteine, which is broken down to form adenosine and homocysteine. Subsequently, the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine requires the enzyme cystathionine synthase, the amino acid serine, and the cofactor vitamin B6. Cystathionine is then converted to cysteine by the enzyme cystathionase, which also requires vitamin B6 as a cofactor. Alternatively, the enzyme methionine synthase uses vitamin B12 as a cofactor to revert homocysteine back to methionine.\n\nThis patient most likely has homocystinuria, a condition that leads to hypercoagulability and thromboembolic occlusion. Because homocysteine is prothrombotic, individuals with complete cystathionine synthase deficiency can develop premature acute coronary syndrome, as seen in this patient (based on his troponin level and ECG findings). Other clinical features include ectopia lentis (ocular lens displacement) and intellectual disability.\n\nThe most common cause of homocystinuria is a defect in cystathionine synthase. Affected patients cannot form cysteine from homocysteine; therefore, cysteine is essential in their diet. In addition, homocysteine buildup results in hypermethioninemia, as seen in this patient.\n\n(Choice A) The enzyme asparagine synthase converts aspartate to asparagine, the amino acid that is essential for rapidly dividing tumor cells that cannot produce it quickly enough on their own. The chemotherapy drug asparaginase decreases asparagine concentration in tumor cells and leads to lysis of these rapidly growing cells.\n\n(Choices C, D, and F) Maple syrup urine disease is an amino acid disorder caused by deficiency of branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase. This deficiency leads to toxic buildup of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their metabolites, resulting in feeding difficulties, seizures, cerebral edema, and a sweet odor of the urine.\n\n(Choice E) Phenylalanine hydroxylase catalyzes the hydroxylation of the essential amino acid phenylalanine to form tyrosine. Deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase is the most common cause of phenylketonuria, which results in severe intellectual disability if left untreated.\n\nEducational objective:\nHomocystinuria is most commonly caused by a defect in cystathionine synthase, resulting in an inability to form cysteine from homocysteine. Cysteine becomes essential in affected patients, and homocysteine buildup leads to elevated methionine. Homocysteine is prothrombotic, resulting in premature thromboembolic events (eg, atherosclerosis, acute coronary syndrome) in these patients.",
    "zh": "甲硫氨酸循环\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\n同型半胱氨酸用于许多甲基转移酶反应。在甲基转移之后，SAM转化为S-腺苷-同型半胱氨酸，后者分解形成腺苷和同型半胱氨酸。随后，同型半胱氨酸转化为胱硫醚需要酶胱硫醚合酶、氨基酸丝氨酸和辅因子维生素B6。胱硫醚随后被酶胱硫醚裂解酶转化为半胱氨酸，这也需要维生素B6作为辅因子。或者，酶甲硫氨酸合酶使用维生素B12作为辅因子，使同型半胱氨酸恢复为甲硫氨酸。\n\n该患者最有可能患有高胱氨酸尿症，这是一种导致高凝状态和血栓栓塞阻塞的疾病。由于同型半胱氨酸具有促血栓形成作用，患有完全性胱硫醚合酶缺乏症的个体可能会发生早发性急性冠脉综合征，如该患者（根据其肌钙蛋白水平和心电图结果）。其他临床特征包括晶状体异位（眼球晶状体移位）和智力障碍。\n\n高胱氨酸尿症最常见的原因是胱硫醚合酶的缺陷。受影响的患者无法由同型半胱氨酸形成半胱氨酸；因此，半胱氨酸对他们的饮食至关重要。此外，同型半胱氨酸的积累会导致高甲硫氨酸血症，如该患者所示。\n\n(选项A) 酶天冬酰胺合酶将天冬氨酸转化为天冬酰胺，天冬酰胺是快速分裂的肿瘤细胞所必需的氨基酸，这些细胞自身无法足够快地产生天冬酰胺。化疗药物天冬酰胺酶降低肿瘤细胞中天冬酰胺的浓度，并导致这些快速生长的细胞溶解。\n\n(选项C、D和F) 枫糖尿症是一种氨基酸紊乱，由支链α-酮酸脱氢酶缺乏引起。这种缺乏导致支链氨基酸（亮氨酸、异亮氨酸和缬氨酸）及其代谢物的毒性积累，导致喂养困难、癫痫发作、脑水肿和尿液的甜味。\n\n(选项E) 苯丙氨酸羟化酶催化必需氨基酸苯丙氨酸的羟化反应，形成酪氨酸。苯丙氨酸羟化酶缺乏症是苯丙酮尿症最常见的原因，如果不及时治疗，会导致严重的智力障碍。\n\n教育目标：\n高胱氨酸尿症最常见的原因是胱硫醚合酶的缺陷，导致无法由同型半胱氨酸形成半胱氨酸。半胱氨酸在受影响的患者中变得必不可少，并且同型半胱氨酸的积累导致甲硫氨酸升高。同型半胱氨酸具有促血栓形成作用，导致这些患者发生早发性血栓栓塞事件（例如，动脉粥样硬化、急性冠脉综合征）。"
