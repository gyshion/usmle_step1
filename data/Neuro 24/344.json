    "en": "A 12-year-old boy is brought to the office by his adoptive parents for a routine physical examination. The boy has mild intellectual disability. The parents say he is adjusting well to a new school that has more resources for children with learning disabilities. The patient was adopted as an infant, and the birth family's history is unknown. His vaccinations are up to date, and he has no allergies. Review of the patient's medical records reveals that prior cytogenetic studies showed a small gap near the tip of the long arm of the X chromosome when cells were cultured under folate-deficient conditions. Which of the following findings are likely to be present on this patient's physical examination?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's history of mild intellectual disability and a cytogenetic study showing a gap near the tip of the long arm of the X chromosome when cultured under folate-deficient conditions is highly suggestive of FRAGILE X SYNDROME (FXS). FXS is an X-linked disorder caused by the expansion of CGG trinucleotide repeats in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. The characteristic physical features of FXS include a long face, prominent forehead, large ears, and MACROORCHIDISM (testicular enlargement) in postpubertal males. Intellectual disability and neurobehavioral issues, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder, are also common. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}\n\n(Choice A) Arachnodactyly, scoliosis, and lens dislocation are classic manifestations of MARFAN SYNDROME, a connective tissue disorder. While lens dislocation can occur in FXS, the other features are not typical. Furthermore, individuals with Marfan syndrome typically have normal cognition and chromosomes.\n\n(Choice C) Short neck, low-set ears, and epicanthal folds are characteristic features of DOWN SYNDROME (Trisomy 21). Cytogenetic studies in Down syndrome typically reveal an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\n(Choice D) Smooth philtrum and thin vermilion border are dysmorphic facial features associated with FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME (FAS). FAS is caused by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and is characterized by facial dysmorphia, growth deficiency, and central nervous system abnormalities. Cytogenetic studies in FAS are typically normal.\n\n(Choice E) Tall stature, gynecomastia, and small testes are characteristic features of KLINEFELTER SYNDROME (47,XXY karyotype). Cytogenetic studies in Klinefelter syndrome reveal an extra X chromosome in males.\n\nKey clinical pearls:\n- Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability.\n- The characteristic cytogenetic finding is a fragile site on the X chromosome that is visible when cells are cultured in folate-deficient media.\n- Physical features include long face, large ears, and macroorchidism.\n- Neurobehavioral issues are common.",
    "zh": "患者有轻度智力障碍病史，细胞遗传学研究显示，当细胞在叶酸缺乏的条件下培养时，X染色体长臂末端附近出现间隙，这高度提示脆性X染色体综合征（FXS）。FXS是一种X连锁疾病，由FMR1基因在X染色体上的CGG三核苷酸重复序列扩张引起。FXS的特征性体征包括长脸、突出的前额、大耳，以及青春期后男性的巨睾症（睾丸增大）。智力障碍和神经行为问题（如注意力缺陷多动障碍和自闭症谱系障碍）也很常见。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}\n\n（选项A）蜘蛛指（症）、脊柱侧弯和晶状体脱位是马凡综合征的典型表现，马凡综合征是一种结缔组织疾病。虽然晶状体脱位可能发生在FXS中，但其他特征并不典型。此外，马凡综合征患者通常具有正常的认知和染色体。\n\n（选项C）短颈、低位耳和内眦赘皮是唐氏综合征（21三体综合征）的特征。唐氏综合征的细胞遗传学研究通常显示21号染色体的额外拷贝。\n\n（选项D）人中平坦和红唇缘薄是与胎儿酒精综合征（FAS）相关的面部畸形。FAS是由母亲在怀孕期间饮酒引起的，其特征是面部畸形、生长迟缓和中枢神经系统异常。FAS的细胞遗传学研究通常是正常的。\n\n（选项E）身材高大、男性乳房发育和小睾丸是克氏综合征（47,XXY核型）的特征。克氏综合征的细胞遗传学研究显示男性有多余的X染色体。\n\n关键临床要点：\n- 脆性X染色体综合征是智力障碍最常见的遗传原因。\n- 细胞遗传学的特征性发现是X染色体上的脆性位点，当细胞在叶酸缺乏培养基中培养时可见。\n- 体征包括长脸、大耳和巨睾症。\n- 神经行为问题很常见。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation and diagnostic features of Fragile X syndrome, a common inherited cause of intellectual disability. It requires correlating cytogenetic findings with characteristic physical examination findings and differentiating it from other genetic syndromes.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key clues in the vignette, such as intellectual disability and the description of the cytogenetic study. Recognize that these findings are highly suggestive of Fragile X syndrome. Recall or deduce the characteristic physical features of Fragile X syndrome and select the option that best matches these findings, while also considering and ruling out other genetic syndromes based on their distinct clinical presentations.",
