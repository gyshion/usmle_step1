  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Advance directives record a patient's personal preferences for health care and treatment if the patient lacks decision-making capacity. During hospital admissions, all patients admitted to the hospital must be asked about RESUSCITATION PREFERENCES (eg, full code, Do-Not-Resuscitate [DNR]) and whether advance directives are in place because serious clinical deterioration can happen unexpectedly.\n\nAdvance directives include the following types of documents:\n\nLiving will, which specifies the patient's end-of-life wishes and often includes instructions regarding intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, enteral feeding, and other life-prolonging interventions. Given the breadth of medical scenarios that can arise, not all decisions can be accounted for in a living will.\n\nA health care proxy, which designates a specific individual (the surrogate decision-maker) to make health care decisions and interpret instructions in the living will on the patient's behalf if the patient is incapacitated, using the principle of substituted judgment (ie, considering what the patient would want).\n\nIdeally, advance care planning should take place through a series of open-ended conversations early in a patient's serious illness (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) in the context of a longitudinal patient-physician relationship. Patients without advance directives at the time of hospital admission should be provided with information and venues for learning about and completing this process.\n\n(Choices A, C, D, and E) Each of these components should be addressed during the patient's hospitalization course and discharge planning process. However, they do not need to be completed during admission. In contrast, discussion and documentation of a patient's advance care status must be completed during admission because unexpected clinical deterioration can occur at any time.",
    "zh": "预先指示记录了患者在缺乏决策能力时对医疗保健和治疗的个人偏好。在住院期间，所有入院的患者都必须被询问有关复苏偏好（例如，全面复苏、不进行复苏[DNR]）以及是否有预先指示，因为严重的临床恶化可能意外发生。\n\n预先指示包括以下类型的文档：\n\n生前遗嘱，它规定了患者的临终意愿，并且通常包括关于气管插管、心肺复苏、肠内喂养和其他延长生命的干预措施的指示。鉴于可能出现的广泛的医疗情景，并非所有决定都可以在生前遗嘱中得到说明。\n\n医疗保健代理人，它指定一个特定的人（替代决策者）代表患者做出医疗保健决定并解释生前遗嘱中的指示，如果患者无行为能力，则使用替代判断原则（即，考虑患者想要什么）。\n\n理想情况下，预先护理计划应通过一系列开放式的对话进行，这些对话应在患者患有严重疾病（例如，慢性阻塞性肺病）的早期阶段，在长期的医患关系背景下进行。在入院时没有预先指示的患者，应被提供有关信息和场所，以了解和完成此过程。\n\n（选项 A、C、D 和 E）这些组成部分中的每一个都应该在患者的住院过程和出院计划过程中得到解决。然而，它们不需要在入院期间完成。相比之下，患者的预先护理状况的讨论和文件记录必须在入院期间完成，因为意外的临床恶化可能随时发生。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of the importance of advance directives and resuscitation preferences during hospital admission, especially in patients with chronic illnesses. It emphasizes the need to address these issues early due to the potential for unexpected clinical deterioration.\n\nThe best approach is to prioritize options that directly address immediate medical decision-making and patient autonomy. Recognizing that advance directives and resuscitation preferences are crucial for ensuring patient wishes are respected during emergencies helps identify the correct answer.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试了对入院期间预先指示和复苏偏好重要性的认识，尤其是在患有慢性疾病的患者中。它强调需要尽早解决这些问题，因为有可能出现意外的临床恶化。\n\n最好的方法是优先考虑直接解决即时医疗决策和患者自主性的选项。认识到预先指示和复苏偏好对于确保在紧急情况下尊重患者意愿至关重要，有助于确定正确答案。"
