    "en": "A 34-year-old woman with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections comes to the physician with dysuria and increased urinary frequency. Her urine culture grows colonies of Gram-negative bacteria. The bacteria are isolated and placed in a growth-enhancing nutrient solution, where they undergo rapid cellular division. As they are actively dividing, the bacterial cells are lysed and their DNA is extracted and purified. Analysis of the partially replicated DNA fragments shows the presence of uracil. This finding is most likely mediated by which of the following enzymes? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The presence of uracil in DNA fragments during bacterial DNA replication is unusual because uracil is typically found in RNA, not DNA. Uracil is incorporated into RNA primers synthesized by primase during DNA replication. Primase is a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that synthesizes short RNA primers using the separated strands of DNA at the replication fork as templates. These RNA primers are then used by DNA polymerase to initiate DNA synthesis. Therefore, the finding of uracil in partially replicated DNA fragments strongly suggests the involvement of primase in synthesizing these fragments. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "在细菌DNA复制过程中，DNA片段中存在尿嘧啶是不寻常的，因为尿嘧啶通常存在于RNA中，而不是DNA中。尿嘧啶被整合到引物酶在DNA复制过程中合成的RNA引物中。引物酶是一种依赖DNA的RNA聚合酶，它使用DNA复制叉处的分离的DNA链作为模板合成短RNA引物。然后DNA聚合酶使用这些RNA引物来启动DNA合成。因此，在部分复制的DNA片段中发现尿嘧啶强烈提示引物酶参与了这些片段的合成。 {{exhibit_1}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "The question describes a scenario where uracil is found in bacterial DNA during replication. Uracil is normally found in RNA. The presence of uracil in DNA fragments indicates the involvement of an enzyme that synthesizes RNA primers for DNA replication. Primase is responsible for synthesizing these RNA primers. Therefore, primase is the most likely enzyme mediating this finding.",
