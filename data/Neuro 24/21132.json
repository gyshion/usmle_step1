    "en": "A 2-year-old boy with no chronic medical conditions is brought to the emergency department after he was found unresponsive with vomiting in his mouth. The patient has had muscle aches, cough, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, vomiting, and fever for the past 3 days. His parents gave him aspirin twice daily for symptom control. Vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, the patient is somnolent but withdraws from pain. Pupils are equal in size and reactive to light. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Hepatomegaly is present. Extremities are well perfused. Laboratory results are as follows:\n\nAspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) 2,170 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (SGPT) 1,587 U/L\nTotal bilirubin 1.7 mg/dL\nDirect bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL\nSerum ammonia 106 μmol/L (normal: 11-32)\n\nOver the next day, the patient's condition deteriorates and he dies despite supportive care. Examination of the brain would most likely reveal which of the following findings?",

    "en": "The patient's presentation of acute encephalopathy and liver failure following aspirin use during a viral illness is highly suggestive of REYE SYNDROME. Reye syndrome is a rare but serious condition that causes swelling in the liver and brain. It often occurs in children and teenagers who have or are recovering from a viral infection, such as the flu or chickenpox. Taking aspirin during these illnesses has been linked to Reye syndrome. The pathophysiology involves mitochondrial toxicity from salicylates, leading to impaired fatty acid metabolism, microvesicular fat deposition in the liver, hepatic dysfunction, and hyperammonemia. This hyperammonemia contributes to DIFFUSE ASTROCYTE SWELLING and cerebral edema, which are the hallmark neuropathological findings. The elevated AST and ALT, along with elevated bilirubin and serum ammonia, further support the diagnosis of acute liver injury and encephalopathy. \n\n(Choice B) Dural venous thrombosis typically presents with headache, seizures, and focal neurological deficits, and while it can lead to increased intracranial pressure and encephalopathy, it is not directly associated with the liver dysfunction seen in this patient. Hyperammonemia is also not a primary feature. \n(Choices C and D) Hemorrhagic necrosis and inflammation of vessel walls are more characteristic of infectious encephalitis (e.g., herpes simplex virus) or vasculitis, which do not typically present with the combination of severe liver dysfunction and hyperammonemia seen here. \n(Choice E) Long-chain fatty acid deposits in the brain are seen in various inherited metabolic disorders, such as Zellweger syndrome or certain lysosomal storage diseases, which usually have a different clinical presentation and are not typically triggered by aspirin use in the context of a viral illness. While Reye syndrome involves impaired fatty acid metabolism, the primary brain finding is edema, not diffuse fatty acid deposits. \n(Choice F) Pontine myelinolysis (osmotic demyelination syndrome) is typically associated with rapid correction of hyponatremia and affects the pons, leading to motor deficits. It is not directly linked to the liver failure and hyperammonemia seen in this case. \n\nKEY CLINICAL PEARLS:\n- REYE SYNDROME is associated with ASPIRIN use in children with VIRAL ILLNESSES.\n- Key features include HEPATIC DYSFUNCTION (elevated transaminases, hepatomegaly) and ENCEPHALOPATHY.\n- Pathophysiology involves MITOCHONDRIAL TOXICITY and HYPERAMMONEMIA.\n- Neuropathology shows DIFFUSE ASTROCYTE SWELLING and cerebral edema.",
    "zh": "患者在病毒性疾病期间使用阿司匹林后出现急性脑病和肝功能衰竭，高度提示 Reye 综合征。Reye 综合征是一种罕见但严重的疾病，可导致肝脏和大脑肿胀。它通常发生在患有或正在从病毒感染中康复的儿童和青少年中，例如流感或水痘。在这些疾病期间服用阿司匹林与 Reye 综合征有关。其病理生理学涉及水杨酸盐的线粒体毒性，导致脂肪酸代谢受损、肝脏微泡脂肪沉积、肝功能障碍和高氨血症。这种高氨血症导致弥漫性星形胶质细胞肿胀和脑水肿，这是其标志性的神经病理学发现。AST 和 ALT 升高，以及胆红素和血氨升高，进一步支持了急性肝损伤和脑病的诊断。\n\n(选项 B) 硬脑膜静脉窦血栓形成通常表现为头痛、癫痫发作和局灶性神经功能缺损，虽然它可能导致颅内压升高和脑病，但它与该患者所见的肝功能障碍没有直接关系。高氨血症也不是主要特征。\n(选项 C 和 D) 出血性坏死和血管壁炎症更具传染性脑炎（例如，单纯疱疹病毒）或血管炎的特征，这两种疾病通常不会出现此处所见到的严重的肝功能障碍和高氨血症的组合。\n(选项 E) 大脑中的长链脂肪酸沉积见于各种遗传性代谢疾病，例如 Zellweger 综合征或某些溶酶体贮积病，这些疾病通常具有不同的临床表现，并且通常不会由病毒性疾病背景下的阿司匹林使用引发。虽然 Reye 综合征涉及脂肪酸代谢受损，但主要的脑部发现是水肿，而不是弥漫性脂肪酸沉积。\n(选项 F) 脑桥髓鞘溶解（渗透性脱髓鞘综合征）通常与低钠血症的快速纠正有关，并影响脑桥，导致运动功能缺损。它与该病例中出现的肝功能衰竭和高氨血症没有直接关系。\n\n关键临床要点：\n- REYE 综合征与患有病毒性疾病的儿童使用阿司匹林有关。\n- 关键特征包括肝功能障碍（转氨酶升高、肝肿大）和脑病。\n- 病理生理学涉及线粒体毒性和高氨血症。\n- 神经病理学显示弥漫性星形胶质细胞肿胀和脑水肿。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of Reye syndrome, its clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and characteristic neuropathological findings. It specifically assesses the ability to recognize the association between aspirin use in children with viral infections and the development of acute liver failure and encephalopathy.\n\nTo solve this question, one must integrate the patient's history (viral illness, aspirin use), clinical findings (somnolence, hepatomegaly), and laboratory results (elevated transaminases, high ammonia) to arrive at the most likely diagnosis. Subsequently, knowledge of the specific neuropathological consequences of Reye syndrome is required to identify the expected brain findings upon examination.",
