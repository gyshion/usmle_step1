    "en": "A 31-year-old man comes to the office due to persistent nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. The patient has a history of allergic rhinitis and recently moved across the country to start a new job. His nasal symptoms worsened after the move, and he started using an over-the-counter intranasal decongestant spray that initially provided prompt relief. However, after a few days, he had to increase the frequency and number of sprays per nostril needed for adequate symptom control. On examination, the nasal turbinates are swollen and pale with a clear nasal discharge.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient is experiencing tachyphylaxis, a form of acute tolerance, to his intranasal decongestant spray. The spray contains an alpha-adrenergic agonist, such as oxymetazoline, which causes vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa, reducing rhinorrhea and congestion. Prolonged or frequent use of these agents can lead to rebound rhinitis and dosage escalation due to tachyphylaxis. Tachyphylaxis to alpha-adrenergic agonists is primarily mediated by receptor internalization. Upon ligand binding, adrenergic receptors undergo a conformational change, activating heterotrimeric G proteins. Arrestin proteins then bind to the activated receptor, preventing further G protein signaling and marking the receptor for endocytosis and depletion from the cell surface. As alpha-adrenergic receptors become scarce on the nasal mucosa, the release of endogenous catecholamines is insufficient to maintain vasoconstriction, leading to persistent congestion and rhinorrhea, which prompts the patient to increase the dose of the decongestant. The table shows that receptor inactivation and internalization by arrestins is a mechanism of tachyphylaxis for adrenergic agonists.\n\n(Choice A) Accelerated drug metabolism, such as induction of CYP450 enzymes, leads to tolerance but is typically a slower process and more characteristic of chronic drug use, not acute tolerance to intranasal decongestants. This mechanism is seen with barbiturates.\n\n(Choice B) Decreased receptor affinity can contribute to tolerance, but for adrenergic receptors, desensitization is better explained by the decoupling of G proteins and subsequent receptor internalization, rather than a simple decrease in affinity.\n\n(Choice C) While G proteins are involved in signal transduction, their depletion is not the primary mechanism of tachyphylaxis for adrenergic agonists. Arrestins bind to the receptor, preventing G protein activation, and then facilitate receptor internalization. The G proteins themselves are not depleted in this process.\n\n(Choice E) Parasympathetic stimulation of the nasal mucosa causes vasodilation and increased plasma extravasation, contributing to congestion and rhinorrhea. However, the patient's symptoms are a result of overstimulation and subsequent tolerance to an alpha-adrenergic agonist, not a primary issue with parasympathetic activity. Rhinitis medicamentosa can be exacerbated by increased parasympathetic tone, but the initial problem is the decongestant use.",
    "zh": "该患者正在经历对其鼻内减充血剂喷雾剂的快速耐受，这是一种急性耐受形式。该喷雾剂含有α-肾上腺素能激动剂，例如羟甲唑啉，它会导致鼻粘膜血管收缩，从而减少鼻漏和充血。长期或频繁使用这些药物会导致反弹性鼻炎和由于快速耐受而导致的剂量增加。α-肾上腺素能激动剂的快速耐受主要由受体内化介导。配体结合后，肾上腺素能受体发生构象变化，激活异源三聚体G蛋白。随后，阻遏蛋白与激活的受体结合，阻止进一步的G蛋白信号传导，并标记受体进行内吞和从细胞表面耗竭。当鼻粘膜上的α-肾上腺素能受体变得稀少时，内源性儿茶酚胺的释放不足以维持血管收缩，导致持续性充血和鼻漏，这促使患者增加减充血剂的剂量。该表显示，阻遏蛋白对受体进行失活和内化是肾上腺素能激动剂快速耐受的一种机制。\n\n(选项A) 药物代谢加速，例如CYP450酶的诱导，会导致耐受性，但通常是一个较慢的过程，更常见于慢性药物使用，而不是对鼻内减充血剂的急性耐受。这种机制见于巴比妥类药物。\n\n(选项B) 受体亲和力降低可能导致耐受性，但对于肾上腺素能受体，脱敏可以通过G蛋白的解偶联和随后的受体内化来更好地解释，而不是简单的亲和力降低。\n\n(选项C) 虽然G蛋白参与信号转导，但它们的耗竭不是α-肾上腺素能激动剂快速耐受的主要机制。阻遏蛋白与受体结合，阻止G蛋白激活，然后促进受体内化。在此过程中，G蛋白本身不会耗竭。\n\n(选项E) 鼻粘膜的副交感神经刺激引起血管舒张和血浆外渗增加，导致充血和鼻漏。然而，患者的症状是由于过度刺激和随后对α-肾上腺素能激动剂的耐受性，而不是副交感神经活动的主要问题。药物性鼻炎可能会因副交感神经张力增加而加剧，但最初的问题是减充血剂的使用。"
