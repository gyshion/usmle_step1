    "en": "A 34-year-old man comes to the office for evaluation of opioid use disorder. He was prescribed oxycodone for a sports-related injury in his mid-20s, developed dependency, and began using intravenous heroin in its place. In the past few weeks, the patient has had multiple overdoses requiring naloxone administration. He recently tried quitting heroin on his own but experienced recurrent relapses. He has now been abstinent for 2 days but reports significant cravings. After a discussion of various treatment options, the patient is prescribed buprenorphine. The dose-response curve of this medication is shown in the image below: {{exhibit_1}}",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Buprenorphine is a semisythetic opioid used to replace and treat dependency on unregulated opioids (eg, heroin) due to its favorable pharmacokinetics. As a partial agonist at the mu opioid receptor (ie, mixed agonist and antagonist activity), buprenorphine has a ceiling effect. At higher doses, the agonist activity is equally opposed by the antagonist activity, leading to a plateau (ceiling) in the dose-response curve. This ceiling effect caps its analgesic potency but reduces unwanted adverse effects such as respiratory depression. Therefore, high doses of buprenorphine carry a lower risk of respiratory depression compared to full agonists such as heroin (Choice C). {{exhibit_2}}\n\nA key drawback of partial agonists (eg, buprenorphine) is the potential to displace full agonists from the receptor: partial agonists act as relative antagonists in the presence of full agonists. Therefore, buprenorphine can precipitate acute withdrawal if administered when receptors are still occupied by full agonists (eg, heroin). For this reason, patients must discontinue opioids and partially enter the withdrawal state (eg, wait 48 hours) prior to the initiation of buprenorphine.\n\n(Choice A) Complete reversal of a full agonist (eg, heroin) requires a full antagonist (eg, naloxone). Because buprenorphine is a partial agonist-antagonist, the degree of reversal is limited by the ceiling effect.\n\n(Choice D) The ability of antagonists to displace bound drugs is determined by the affinity of the drug-receptor interaction. Drugs that bind tightly have a steep binding curve; in other words, a lower concentration of drug is required to achieve the same effect. Naloxone has a higher affinity to the mu receptor than heroin, which is apparent from its steeper binding curve. Overdose with buprenorphine often requires repeated, high doses of naloxone due to this higher affinity.",
    "zh": "丁丙诺啡是一种半合成阿片类药物，由于其良好的药代动力学特性，可用于替代和治疗对非管制阿片类药物（如海洛因）的依赖。作为μ阿片受体的部分激动剂（即混合的激动剂和拮抗剂活性），丁丙诺啡具有天花板效应。在高剂量下，激动剂活性与拮抗剂活性相等，导致剂量反应曲线出现平台期（天花板）。这种天花板效应限制了其镇痛效力，但减少了不良反应，如呼吸抑制。因此，与海洛因等完全激动剂相比，高剂量的丁丙诺啡发生呼吸抑制的风险较低（选项C）。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n部分激动剂（如丁丙诺啡）的一个主要缺点是可能从受体上置换完全激动剂：部分激动剂在完全激动剂存在下充当相对拮抗剂。因此，如果在受体仍被完全激动剂（如海洛因）占据时给予丁丙诺啡，则可能诱发急性戒断。由于这个原因，患者必须停止使用阿片类药物并部分进入戒断状态（例如，等待48小时）才能开始使用丁丙诺啡。\n\n（选项A）完全逆转完全激动剂（如海洛因）需要完全拮抗剂（如纳洛酮）。由于丁丙诺啡是部分激动剂-拮抗剂，逆转程度受到天花板效应的限制。\n\n（选项D）拮抗剂置换结合药物的能力取决于药物-受体相互作用的亲和力。结合紧密的药物具有陡峭的结合曲线；换句话说，实现相同效果所需的药物浓度较低。纳洛酮对μ受体的亲和力高于海洛因，这从其更陡峭的结合曲线中可见。由于这种较高的亲和力，丁丙诺啡过量通常需要重复、高剂量的纳洛酮。"
