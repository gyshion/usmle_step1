  "explanation": {
    "en": "HIV reverse transcriptase does not have a proofreading mechanism. This allows the virus to rapidly accumulate mutations (~1 nucleotide base pair per replication cycle) that may make it resistant to antiretroviral monotherapy. However, the consistent use of combination antiretroviral therapy, which contains medications that target multiple steps in the HIV replication cycle, effectively prevents the development of resistant strains.\n\nThis patient was found to have a large number of viral isolates with new mutations to the *pol* gene, which encodes for the major HIV enzymes protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase. Most first-line antiretroviral medications, including protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and integrase strand transfer inhibitors, target these enzymes. The emergence of a new predominant strain with mutation to the *pol* gene suggests that this patient has become resistant to his antiretroviral therapy. Nearly all cases of acquired antiretroviral resistance are due to INCONSISTENT USE (transmitted resistance can also occur when an individual is inoculated with a resistant strain). This patient will likely need a new antiretroviral regimen and should be encouraged to take it as prescribed.\n\n(Choice A) HIV infection results in the generation of antibodies that can reduce free virus in the circulatory system but cannot eliminate the infection due to viral integration into the host genome. The primary target of neutralizing antibodies against HIV is the surface glycoprotein GP120, which is encoded by the *env* gene, not the *pol* gene.\n\n(Choice C) The HIV *nef* gene encodes for a protein that downregulates major histocompatibility complex class I proteins, reducing the ability of cytotoxic T cells to recognize host cells infected with HIV. *Pol* gene mutations are unlikely to directly influence the ability of CD8 cells to respond to the infection.\n\n(Choice D) HIV infection triggers CD4 cell apoptosis through many mechanisms, including chronic immunologic stimulation, activation of the CD4 receptor by envelope glycoproteins (during viral attachment), and increased production of cytotoxic ligands by immune cells. Mutations to the *pol* gene are unlikely to result in a reduction in CD4 apoptosis.\n\n(Choice E) Viral replication rate is generally positively correlated with the mutation rate.\n\nEducational objective:\nHIV *pol* gene mutations are responsible for acquired resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, and integrase strand transfer inhibitors. Mutations of the *env* gene enable escape from host-neutralizing antibodies.",
    "zh": "HIV 逆转录酶没有校对机制。这使得病毒能够快速积累突变（每个复制周期约 1 个核苷酸碱基对），这可能使其对单一抗逆转录病毒治疗产生耐药性。然而，持续使用联合抗逆转录病毒治疗，其中包含靶向 HIV 复制周期中多个步骤的药物，可以有效防止耐药株的产生。\n\n该患者被发现有大量病毒分离株，其 *pol* 基因发生了新的突变，该基因编码主要的 HIV 酶蛋白酶、逆转录酶和整合酶。大多数一线抗逆转录病毒药物，包括蛋白酶抑制剂、逆转录酶抑制剂和整合酶链转移抑制剂，均靶向这些酶。出现新的、主要的、*pol* 基因突变的毒株表明该患者已对抗逆转录病毒治疗产生耐药性。几乎所有获得性抗逆转录病毒耐药性的病例都是由于使用不一致（当个体接种耐药株时，也会发生传播性耐药性）。该患者可能需要新的抗逆转录病毒治疗方案，并应鼓励其按处方服用。\n\n（选项 A） HIV 感染会导致抗体的产生，这些抗体可以减少循环系统中的游离病毒，但不能消除感染，因为病毒已整合到宿主基因组中。针对 HIV 的中和抗体的主要靶标是表面糖蛋白 GP120，它由 *env* 基因编码，而不是 *pol* 基因。\n\n（选项 C） HIV *nef* 基因编码一种蛋白，该蛋白可下调主要组织相容性复合体 I 类蛋白，从而降低细胞毒性 T 细胞识别感染 HIV 的宿主细胞的能力。*Pol* 基因突变不太可能直接影响 CD8 细胞对感染的反应能力。\n\n（选项 D） HIV 感染通过多种机制触发 CD4 细胞凋亡，包括慢性免疫刺激、包膜糖蛋白激活 CD4 受体（在病毒附着期间）以及免疫细胞产生细胞毒性配体的增加。*Pol* 基因突变不太可能导致 CD4 凋亡减少。\n\n（选项 E）病毒复制速率通常与突变率呈正相关。\n\n教育目标：\nHIV *pol* 基因突变是获得性耐药逆转录酶抑制剂、蛋白酶抑制剂和整合酶链转移抑制剂的原因。*env* 基因的突变使病毒能够逃避免疫宿主的中和抗体。"
