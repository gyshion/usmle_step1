    "en": "A 26-year-old woman comes to the office due to fever, malaise, and joint pain. A week ago, the patient had pain in the small joints of her right hand, which improved spontaneously but was quickly followed by pain in the right ankle and left wrist. She has no prior medical problems and takes no medications. Temperature is 38 C (100.4 F), blood pressure is 124/82 mm Hg, and pulse is 90/min. The extremity joints are not erythematous or swollen, but tenderness is present along the tendons of the left wrist and right ankle. Several small, nontender pustules are seen on the extremities. There is no other rash. Blood culture in a selective growth medium consisting of chocolate agar and multiple antibiotics yields the causative pathogen. Which of the following strategies would most likely have prevented this patient's current condition?",
    "zh": "一名26岁的女性因发热、不适和关节疼痛来就诊。一周前，患者右手的指关节疼痛，症状自行缓解，但很快出现右踝和左腕疼痛。她既往无任何健康问题，也没有服用任何药物。体温为38°C（100.4°F），血压为124/82 mmHg，脉搏为90次/分钟。四肢关节没有红斑或肿胀，但在左腕和右踝的肌腱处存在触痛。四肢可见数个小的、无压痛的脓疱。没有其他皮疹。在由巧克力琼脂和多种抗生素组成的特定生长培养基中进行的血培养显示了致病病原体。以下哪种策略最有可能预防该患者目前的病情？"

    "en": "Disseminated gonococcal infection occurs when *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* spreads from the genitourinary tract to the bloodstream. It typically presents with the triad of polyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis (painless pustules on the extremities) or purulent arthritis. The diagnosis is confirmed when the organism is isolated on Thayer-Martin media (chocolate agar infused with antibiotics), which permits selective growth of *Neisseria* species.\n\n*N. gonorrhoeae* is spread primarily via infected genital secretions during sexual contact. Therefore, most cases can be prevented by the consistent use of condoms. Patients with genitourinary *N. gonorrhoeae* infections may have purulent cervicitis or urethritis, but many are asymptomatic. Asymptomatic infection increases the risk of spread to deeper tissues (eg, disseminated gonococcal infection, pelvic inflammatory disease) because of treatment delay.\n\n(Choice A) Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the spirochete *Borrelia burgdorferi*. Early localized Lyme disease can be associated with arthralgias, myalgias, fever, and erythema migrans (a migrating, erythematous, bull's-eye rash). However, it is not associated with tendonitis/pustules, and spirochetes cannot be cultured on Thayer-Martin media.\n\n(Choice B) *N gonorrhoeae* undergoes dramatic antigenic variation of its surface molecules, which prevents the formation of protective antibodies against future infection. Therefore, recurrent infection is common and vaccinations are ineffective.\n\n(Choice C) The roundworm *Trichinella* can be transmitted via undercooked pork. It invades the skeletal muscle and causes severe muscle pain, swelling, and tenderness. Periorbital edema and eosinophilia are often important diagnostic clues; infection is typically confirmed with serology (not culture).\n\n(Choice E) Dengue fever, also called breakbone fever, is a mosquito-borne viral infection associated with fever, severe myalgias, arthralgias, and maculopapular rash. Hemorrhagic complications can occur. The diagnosis is usually made clinically; Thayer-Martin media would not yield an organism (as it is a viral pathogen).\n\nEducational objective:\n*Neisseria gonorrhoeae* is spread sexually by genitourinary secretions and can be prevented by the consistent use of condoms. Genitourinary infections are often asymptomatic, which increases the risk of spread through the bloodstream, leading to disseminated gonococcal infection. Patients with disseminated disease typically present with the triad of polyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis or purulent arthritis. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "播散性淋球菌感染发生在淋病奈瑟菌从泌尿生殖道扩散到血液时。它通常表现为多关节痛、腱鞘炎和皮炎（四肢无痛性脓疱）或化脓性关节炎的三联征。当从Thayer-Martin培养基（注入抗生素的巧克力琼脂）中分离出该病原体时，可确诊，该培养基允许淋病奈瑟菌属的选择性生长。\n\n淋病奈瑟菌主要通过性接触过程中受感染的生殖器分泌物传播。因此，大多数病例可以通过持续使用避孕套来预防。患有泌尿生殖道淋病奈瑟菌感染的患者可能患有化脓性宫颈炎或尿道炎，但许多患者无症状。无症状感染会因治疗延误而增加扩散到更深层组织（例如，播散性淋球菌感染、盆腔炎）的风险。\n\n（选项A）莱姆病是一种由疏螺旋体伯氏疏螺旋体引起的蜱传疾病。早期局限性莱姆病可能与关节痛、肌痛、发热和游走性红斑（游走性、红斑性、靶心样皮疹）有关。然而，它与肌腱炎/脓疱无关，并且不能在Thayer-Martin培养基上培养出螺旋体。\n\n（选项B）淋病奈瑟菌的表面分子发生剧烈的抗原变异，这阻止了针对未来感染的保护性抗体的形成。因此，复发性感染很常见，疫苗接种无效。\n\n（选项C）旋毛虫病可以通过未煮熟的猪肉传播。它侵入骨骼肌并引起严重的肌肉疼痛、肿胀和触痛。眶周水肿和嗜酸性粒细胞增多症通常是重要的诊断线索；感染通常通过血清学（而非培养）确认。\n\n（选项E）登革热，也称为断骨热，是一种蚊媒病毒感染，与发热、严重肌痛、关节痛和斑丘疹有关。可能发生出血性并发症。诊断通常是通过临床进行的；Thayer-Martin培养基不会产生病原体（因为它是一种病毒病原体）。\n\n教育目标：\n淋病奈瑟菌通过泌尿生殖道分泌物性传播，可以通过持续使用避孕套来预防。泌尿生殖道感染通常是无症状的，这增加了通过血液传播的风险，从而导致播散性淋球菌感染。播散性疾病患者通常表现为多关节痛、腱鞘炎和皮炎或化脓性关节炎三联征。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), its presentation (polyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, dermatitis), diagnosis (Thayer-Martin media), and prevention (condom use). It also requires differentiating DGI from other conditions with similar symptoms.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the triad of symptoms suggestive of DGI. Understand the transmission route of *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* and the effectiveness of barrier methods in preventing its spread. Rule out other infections based on their distinct clinical features and diagnostic methods.",
