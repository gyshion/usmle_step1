    "en": "A 46-year-old man comes to the office with chest pain and dyspnea on exertion. He has no known medical problems and leads a sedentary life. He is a lifetime nonsmoker. Noninvasive cardiac testing is nondiagnostic. Left and right heart catheterization is planned. During the procedure, the catheter records periodic pressure changes with a maximum of 25 mm Hg and minimum of 2 mm Hg. The catheter is advanced further, and then shows periodic pressure changes with a maximum of 25 mm Hg and a minimum of 10 mm Hg. Assuming the results of the procedure are normal, the first set of readings was most likely obtained from which of the following locations?",

    "en": "Cardiac catheterization is performed to evaluate for cardiac etiologies and obtain direct measurements of intracardiac pressures in patients with unexplained symptoms. In general, right-sided pressures are much lower than those of the left side as the right ventricle is pumping blood into a much lower resistance pulmonary vasculature.\n\nA balloon-tipped pulmonary artery (PA) catheter (attached distally to a pressure transducer) is inserted into the subclavian or internal jugular vein. When the PA catheter enters the superior vena cava (SVC), a venous waveform appears, and the balloon is inflated with air and the catheter is advanced. The location of the catheter tip is determined by the pressure readings as follows:\n\n1.  The venous pressure waveform of the SVC appears as small-amplitude oscillations. The pressure remains unchanged as the catheter is advanced into the right atrium (RA). Normal pressure in the SVC and RA is 1-6 mm Hg (Choice D).\n\n2.  As the catheter is advanced across the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle (RV), a pulsatile waveform appears. The peak (systolic) pressure is the strength of right ventricular contraction, and the lowest (diastolic) pressure is just below the RA pressure. RV systolic pressure is normally 15-30 mm Hg.\n\n3.  As the catheter advances across the pulmonic valve into a main pulmonary artery, the pressure waveform shows a sudden increase in diastolic pressure with no change in systolic pressure. This rise in diastolic pressure is due to pulmonary capillary resistance and backward transmission of left atrial pressure. The PA diastolic pressure is normally 6-12 mm Hg (Choice C).\n\n4.  When the catheter is advanced into the distal PA branches, a venous type waveform appears; this is called the PA occlusion pressure or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). This pressure is reflective of venous pressure in the left heart (left atrial pressure and left ventricular diastolic pressure) (Choice A). PCWP is usually equal to PA diastolic pressure (6-12 mm Hg).\n\n(Choice B) Left-sided pressures are much higher than right heart pressures in order to maintain systemic perfusion. The normal left ventricular systolic pressure is approximately 90-140 mm Hg with a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 6-12 mm Hg.\n\nEducational objective:\nRight-sided pressures in the heart are lower than left-sided pressures due to lower resistance in the pulmonary vasculature. Right ventricular diastolic pressure is similar to right atrial/central venous pressure (1-6 mm Hg), whereas pulmonary artery pressure is slightly higher (6-12 mm Hg) due to resistance to flow in the pulmonary circulation. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",

SVC的静脉压力波形表现为小幅度振荡。当导管推进到右心房（RA）时，压力保持不变。SVC和RA的正常压力为1-6 mm Hg（选项D）。\n\n2.  当导管穿过三尖瓣进入右心室（RV）时，出现搏动性波形。峰值（收缩压）是右心室收缩的强度，最低（舒张压）略低于RA压力。RV收缩压通常为15-30 mm Hg。\n\n3.  当导管穿过肺动脉瓣进入主肺动脉时，压力波形显示舒张压突然升高，收缩压没有变化。舒张压升高是由于肺毛细血管阻力和左心房压力的逆向传递。PA舒张压通常为6-12 mm Hg（选项C）。\n\n4.  当导管推进到远端PA分支时，出现静脉类型波形；这被称为PA闭塞压力或肺毛细血管楔压（PCWP）。该压力反映左心静脉压力（左心房压力和左心室舒张压）（选项A）。PCWP通常等于PA舒张压（6-12 mm Hg）。\n\n（选项B）左侧压力远高于右心压力，以维持全身灌注。正常左心室收缩压约为90-140 mm Hg，左心室舒张末期压力为6-12 mm Hg。\n\n教育目标：\n由于肺血管阻力较低，心脏右侧压力低于左侧压力。右心室舒张压与右心房/中心静脉压（1-6 mm Hg）相似，而肺动脉压由于肺循环中的血流阻力略高（6-12 mm Hg）。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of right heart catheterization and normal pressure ranges in different cardiac chambers. It requires understanding the sequence of catheter advancement and the expected pressure changes in each location.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the order in which a pulmonary artery catheter passes through the right heart chambers. Remember that right atrial pressures are the lowest, followed by right ventricular pressures, and then pulmonary artery pressures. The provided pressure range (25/2 mm Hg) is most consistent with the right ventricle.",
