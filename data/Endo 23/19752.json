    "en": "A newborn boy is found to have elevated TSH and low thyroxine (T4) levels on routine newborn screening. The patient was born vaginally to a 32-year-old, healthy woman at 39 weeks gestation. The 5-minute Apgar score was 9. Ultrasound of the neck reveals an ectopically located, small thyroid gland just above the hyoid bone. Early treatment with levothyroxine is indicated primarily to prevent which of the following?",

    "en": "This newborn with elevated TSH and low thyroxine (T4) has congenital hypothyroidism due to failed thyroid gland migration. Ectopic thyroid tissue typically produces inadequate levels of T4, a hormone critical to the metabolism, growth, and development of the fetus and young child.\n\nNewborns with congenital hypothyroidism are usually asymptomatic due to transplacental transfer of small amounts of maternal T4 that prevent development of overt symptoms. As such, most infants are identified via routine newborn screening. Prompt initiation of treatment with levothyroxine (ie, thyroid hormone supplementation) before maternally derived T4 wanes (weeks to months after birth) is associated with an excellent prognosis and no long-term deficits.\n\nIn contrast, untreated or inadequately treated hypothyroidism in the first few years of life is associated with NEUROCOGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION. These patients typically have lower intelligence quotients (IQs) compared to those with appropriately treated hypothyroidism. Severe, untreated hypothyroidism may also lead to neurologic deficits (eg, sensorineural hearing loss, poor coordination). Of note, pregnant women inadequately treated for hypothyroidism are at increased risk of having a child with a decreased IQ because the developing fetus depends solely on maternal T4 during early gestation.\n\n(Choices A and E) Elevated TSH associated with untreated hypothyroidism leads to thyroid gland overstimulation and, often, enlargement (ie, goiter). Myxedema (due to glycosaminoglycan accumulation) and a decreased metabolic rate can cause excessive weight gain in untreated disease. However, in contrast to irreversible neurocognitive dysfunction, preventing these largely reversible manifestations of hypothyroidism are not the primary goals of therapy.\n\n(Choice C) Some autoimmune diseases, such as celiac disease and pernicious anemia, are more common in patients with hypothyroidism, and are associated with nutrient loss due to malabsorption. Treatment of hypothyroidism does not decrease the risk for these conditions, and hypothyroidism alone does not cause malabsorption.\n\n(Choice D) Proptosis occurs with untreated Graves' hyperthyroidism, not hypothyroidism, due to extraocular muscle swelling and orbital edema. In contrast to this case, hyperthyroidism is characterized by low TSH and high T4. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "这名TSH升高、甲状腺素（T4）水平低下的新生儿患有先天性甲状腺功能减退症，病因是甲状腺迁移失败。异位甲状腺组织通常产生不足的T4水平，T4是胎儿和幼儿新陈代谢、生长和发育的关键激素。\n\n由于有少量母体T4的经胎盘转移，防止了明显症状的出现，患有先天性甲状腺功能减退症的新生儿通常无症状。因此，大多数婴儿是通过常规新生儿筛查来确定的。在母体来源的T4衰减之前（出生后数周到数月），及时开始左甲状腺素治疗（即，甲状腺激素补充剂）与良好的预后和无长期缺陷相关。\n\n相比之下，在生命的前几年未治疗或治疗不充分的甲状腺功能减退症与神经认知功能障碍有关。与甲状腺功能减退症治疗充分的患者相比，这些患者的智商（IQ）通常较低。严重的、未经治疗的甲状腺功能减退症也可能导致神经功能缺损（例如，感觉神经性听力损失、协调性差）。值得注意的是，未充分治疗甲状腺功能减退症的孕妇，其子女的智商降低的风险增加，因为发育中的胎儿仅依赖于孕早期母体T4。\n\n（选项A和E）与未经治疗的甲状腺功能减退症相关的TSH升高会导致甲状腺过度刺激，并常常导致甲状腺肿大（即，甲状腺肿）。黏液水肿（由于糖胺聚糖积聚）和代谢率降低会导致未经治疗的疾病中体重过度增加。然而，与不可逆的神经认知功能障碍相比，预防这些甲状腺功能减退症的很大程度上可逆的临床表现并非治疗的主要目标。\n\n（选项C）某些自身免疫性疾病，如乳糜泻和恶性贫血，在甲状腺功能减退症患者中更常见，并与营养物质吸收不良引起的营养物质流失相关。治疗甲状腺功能减退症并不会降低这些疾病的风险，并且仅甲状腺功能减退症不会引起吸收不良。\n\n（选项D）眼球突出症发生在未经治疗的 Graves' 甲状腺功能亢进症中，而非甲状腺功能减退症，这是由于眼外肌肿胀和眶周水肿所致。与本病例相反，甲状腺功能亢进症的特征是TSH低和T4高。{{exhibit_1}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of congenital hypothyroidism, its etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis via newborn screening, and the importance of early treatment to prevent neurocognitive deficits. It also requires understanding of the pathophysiology of hypothyroidism and its effects on growth and development.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the key findings of elevated TSH and low T4 in a newborn, indicating congenital hypothyroidism. Then, recall the most significant long-term complication of untreated hypothyroidism, which is neurocognitive impairment. Rule out other options based on their association with hyperthyroidism or other conditions.",
