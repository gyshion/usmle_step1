    "en": "A 38-year-old woman comes to the office for evaluation of a skin lesion. The lesion began as a pink papule on her right arm and has progressively enlarged over several weeks. It is not pruritic or painful and has not been associated with fever or other systemic symptoms. The patient returned from a trip to Costa Rica 5 weeks ago. During her travel, she stayed at a beachside resort and hiked in the rainforest. Skin examination findings are shown below. Biopsy of the lesion reveals intracellular, round-oval protozoa with rod-shaped kinetoplasts. Skin examination findings {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "Microscopy of this patient's skin lesion reveals intracellular protozoa with rod-shaped kinetoplasts, raising strong suspicion for CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS, a parasitic disease endemic to the Middle East and Central/South America. Leishmania species are harbored by small mammals and transmitted to humans via bites from INFECTED SAND FLIES. The parasite subsequently matures within mammalian macrophages and can be visualized on biopsy as intracellular, round-oval amastigotes with rod-shaped kinetoplasts {{exhibit_2}}.\n\nCutaneous leishmaniasis is characterized by a chronic, enlarging, pinkish papule at the site of the bite that eventually develops into a nodule or plaque and ulcerates. Most cases occur on exposed areas of skin because sand fly bites cannot penetrate clothing. More serious mucosal or lymphatic Leishmania infections can also occur.\n\n(Choice B) Yaws, a spirochetal infection caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies, is transmitted by skin-to-skin (nonsexual) contact and is seen in Central America. Patients typically develop a painless papule that eventually ulcerates (similar to syphilitic chancre). However, this organism is a bacterium, not a protozoan.\n\n(Choice C) Sporothrix schenckii, a dimorphic fungus, grows in decaying plant matter and is transmitted to humans via subcutaneous inoculation. Manifestations include a papule at the site of inoculation and subsequent papules along proximal lymphatic drainage pathways. Histopathology demonstrates granulomas and cigar-shaped, budding fungus.\n\n(Choice D) Bacillus anthracis, a gram-positive bacterial infection, is often transmitted to humans due to cutaneous contact with infected animals or animal hides. Manifestations include a painless cutaneous papule that evolves over days into an ulcer with a black eschar. Histopathology would show extracellular, gram-positive rods.\n\n(Choice E) Mycobacterium marinum, an acid-fast bacterium, causes cutaneous infection after exposure to contaminated water (eg, fish tank). Patients typically develop a papule that ulcerates and scars. However, histopathology would not show intracellular protozoa.\n\nEducational objective:\nLeishmania species are obligate intracellular protozoa that mature in macrophages and can be identified on biopsy by the presence of rod-shaped kinetoplasts. They are transmitted to humans by infected sand flies and cause the clinical syndrome of cutaneous leishmaniasis, characterized by a chronic, pinkish papule that evolves into a nodule or plaque.",
    "zh": "该患者皮肤病变的显微镜检查显示细胞内原生动物，带有杆状动基体，这强烈提示了皮肤利什曼病，这是一种在中东和中美洲/南美洲流行的寄生虫病。利什曼原虫物种由小型哺乳动物携带，并通过受感染白蛉叮咬传播给人类。随后，寄生虫在哺乳动物巨噬细胞内成熟，并且可以在活检中被可视化为细胞内、圆形卵形无鞭毛体，带有杆状动基体 {{exhibit_2}}。\n\n皮肤利什曼病的特征是在叮咬部位出现慢性、增大的粉红色丘疹，最终发展成结节或斑块并溃疡。大多数病例发生在皮肤暴露区域，因为白蛉叮咬无法穿透衣服。也可能发生更严重的粘膜或淋巴利什曼病感染。\n\n(选项 B) 雅司病，一种由苍白密螺旋体亚种引起的螺旋体感染，通过皮肤与皮肤（非性）接触传播，并在中美洲可见。患者通常会发展出一个无痛的丘疹，最终溃疡（类似于梅毒性下疳）。然而，这种生物体是细菌，而不是原生动物。\n\n(选项 C) 申克孢子丝菌，一种二态性真菌，生长在腐烂的植物物质中，并通过皮下接种传播给人类。表现包括接种部位的丘疹，随后沿近端淋巴引流途径出现丘疹。组织病理学显示肉芽肿和雪茄状芽生真菌。\n\n(选项 D) 炭疽杆菌，一种革兰氏阳性细菌感染，通常由于皮肤接触受感染的动物或动物皮而传播给人类。表现包括一个无痛的皮肤丘疹，在几天内演变成一个溃疡，带有黑色焦痂。组织病理学将显示细胞外、革兰氏阳性杆菌。\n\n(选项 E) 海洋分枝杆菌，一种抗酸性细菌，在暴露于受污染的水（例如，鱼缸）后引起皮肤感染。患者通常会发展成一个溃疡并留下疤痕的丘疹。然而，组织病理学不会显示细胞内原生动物。\n\n教育目标：\n利什曼原虫物种是专性细胞内原生动物，在巨噬细胞中成熟，并且可以通过存在杆状动基体在活检中识别出来。它们由受感染的白蛉传播给人类，并引起皮肤利什曼病的临床综合征，其特征是慢性、粉红色丘疹，发展成结节或斑块。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cutaneous leishmaniasis, its causative agent (Leishmania protozoa), transmission via sandfly bites, and characteristic histopathological findings (intracellular amastigotes with rod-shaped kinetoplasts). It also requires differentiating it from other cutaneous infections based on transmission routes and histopathology.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's travel history to an endemic area (Costa Rica), the clinical presentation (pink papule), and the key biopsy finding (intracellular protozoa with kinetoplasts). This points towards leishmaniasis transmitted by sandfly bites, making option A the most likely cause.",
