    "en": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department with breathing difficulty and drooling that have worsened rapidly over the last 8 hours. He has no chronic medical conditions. Temperature is 39.4 C (102.9 F). Examination shows a toxic-appearing patient leaning forward while sitting on the bed; he has inspiratory stridor and suprasternal retractions. There are pooled oral secretions, and the patient is unable to swallow. Which of the following is the greatest risk factor for this patient's condition?",

    "en": "This ill-appearing patient likely has epiglottitis, a rapidly progressive, life-threatening infection that classically presents with high fever, dysphagia, and drooling (often with pooled oral secretions) in young children. Older children and adults may initially have severe sore throat. Narrowing of the larynx causes signs of respiratory distress (eg, retractions) with inspiratory stridor, and patients classically assume tripod positioning (ie, leaning forward with the neck extended) to maximize airflow. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nHaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was historically the most common pathogen that caused epiglottitis, but routine immunization in infancy has greatly decreased its incidence. Individuals with incomplete vaccination against Hib remain at greatest risk of developing epiglottitis. Pathogens implicated in immunized children more commonly include nontypeable H influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, in addition to rare cases of Hib.\n\n(Choice A) A foreign body obstructing the larynx or trachea can present with stridor and acute respiratory distress. However, fever and pooled oral secretions would not be expected.\n\n(Choice B) Anaphylaxis, triggered by IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation, causes acute airway edema and respiratory distress, but other allergic symptoms (eg, hives, angioedema) are usually present. In addition, anaphylaxis does not cause fever.\n\n(Choice D) The incidence of epiglottitis is not increased with international travel in an immunocompetent, vaccinated child. Secondhand smoke exposure against Hib remains the greatest risk factor.\n\n(Choice E) Secondhand smoke exposure is a risk factor for asthma, which can present with acute respiratory distress due to lower airway hyperreactivity and inflammation. Examination would reveal wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, not signs of upper airway obstruction (eg, stridor).\n\nEducational objective:\nEpiglottitis causes rapidly progressive airway obstruction and classically presents with fever, dysphagia, drooling, stridor, and tripod positioning. Individuals with incomplete immunization against Haemophilus influenzae type b are at greatest risk. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "这位病情严重的患者很可能患有会厌炎，这是一种快速进展的、危及生命的感染，典型的表现是高烧、吞咽困难和流口水（通常伴有口腔分泌物积聚），常见于幼儿。较大儿童和成人最初可能出现严重的咽喉痛。喉部狭窄会导致呼吸窘迫的体征（例如，凹陷），伴有吸气性喘鸣，患者通常采取三脚架姿势（即，向前倾斜，颈部伸展）以最大限度地增加气流。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n历史上，b型流感嗜血杆菌（Hib）是引起会厌炎最常见的病原体，但婴儿期常规免疫接种大大降低了其发病率。Hib疫苗接种不完整的人患会厌炎的风险仍然最高。在已免疫的儿童中，与会厌炎相关的病原体更常见的是无分型流感嗜血杆菌和肺炎链球菌，此外还有罕见的Hib病例。\n\n（选项 A） 异物阻塞喉或气管可表现为喘鸣和急性呼吸窘迫。然而，预计不会出现发烧和口腔分泌物积聚。\n\n（选项 B） 过敏反应，由 IgE 介导的肥大细胞脱颗粒引起，导致急性气道水肿和呼吸窘迫，但通常会出现其他过敏症状（例如，荨麻疹、血管性水肿）。此外，过敏反应不会引起发烧。\n\n（选项 D） 在免疫功能正常、接种过疫苗的儿童中，国际旅行不会增加会厌炎的发生率。二手烟暴露仍然是 Hib 最大的危险因素。\n\n（选项 E） 二手烟暴露是哮喘的危险因素，哮喘可因下呼吸道过度反应和炎症而出现急性呼吸窘迫。检查将显示由于支气管收缩引起的哮鸣音，而不是上呼吸道阻塞的体征（例如，喘鸣）。\n\n教育目标：\n会厌炎引起快速进展的气道阻塞，典型表现为发烧、吞咽困难、流口水、喘鸣和三脚架姿势。未完全接种b型流感嗜血杆菌疫苗的人风险最高。{{exhibit_2}}"

It assesses the ability to recognize the classic presentation of epiglottitis and identify the greatest risk factor.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic symptoms of epiglottitis (fever, dysphagia, drooling, stridor, tripod positioning) and associate it with the risk factor of incomplete Hib vaccination.
