    "en": "A 64-year-old patient with frequent wheezing and shortness of breath is started on a new inhaled medication, with significant relief of symptoms. The medication has a long lipophilic side chain that allows attachment to the plasma membrane. The side chain also binds to an auxiliary, deeper site different from the one that binds epinephrine, helping to tether the molecule near the beta-2 adrenergic receptor.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Beta-2 agonists are bronchodilators frequently used in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). They can be categorized by their duration of action, which is largely due to drug lipophilicity.\n\n*   **Long-acting beta-2 agonists** (eg, salmeterol, formoterol) are typically used for maintenance therapy in COPD or with inhaled corticosteroids in asthma. These drugs have a **lipophilic side chain**, which allows them to attach to the plasma membrane and diffuse laterally across to the beta-2 receptor. As a result, they have an extended duration of action (≥12 hours) but slow onset of action. SALMETEROL has a slightly longer duration of action than formoterol due to its ability to bind a **secondary exosite** within the beta-2 receptor, which serves as an anchor to prevent active site dissociation.\n*   **Short-acting beta-2 agonists** (eg, albuterol, levalbuterol) are typically used for acute symptom relief. These drugs are relatively hydrophilic, interact minimally with the plasma membrane, and are rapidly metabolized, explaining their rapid onset (minutes) and short duration of action (4-6 hours) (Choices A and C).\n\n**(Choice B)** Isoproterenol is a nonselective beta agonist used primarily for its chronotropic effects in patients with bradycardia or heart block.\n\n**(Choice E)** Terbutaline is a short-acting beta-2 agonist administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection for very severe asthma exacerbations (ie, those requiring intubation). It does not have a long lipophilic side chain.\n\n**Educational objective:**\nShort-acting beta-2 agonists (eg, albuterol, levalbuterol) are hydrophilic and are rapidly metabolized, explaining their rapid onset and short duration of action. Long-acting beta-2 agonists (eg, salmeterol, formoterol) have a prolonged duration of action due to their lipophilic side chain, which allows them to attach to the cell plasma membrane. Salmeterol also binds to a secondary exosite within the beta-2 receptor, anchoring the molecule and further prolonging its action.",
    "zh": "β-2受体激动剂是常用于治疗哮喘和慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD）的支气管扩张剂。它们可以根据其作用持续时间进行分类，这主要取决于药物的亲脂性。\n\n*   **长效β-2受体激动剂**（例如，沙美特罗、福莫特罗）通常用于COPD的维持治疗或与吸入性皮质类固醇联合用于哮喘。这些药物具有**亲脂性侧链**，使其能够附着在细胞质膜上，并在其上横向扩散到β-2受体。因此，它们具有延长的作用持续时间（≥12小时），但起效缓慢。沙美特罗的作用持续时间略长于福莫特罗，因为它能够与β-2受体内的**第二个胞外结合位点**结合，该位点充当锚，以防止活性位点解离。\n*   **短效β-2受体激动剂**（例如，沙丁胺醇、左沙丁胺醇）通常用于缓解急性症状。这些药物相对亲水，与细胞质膜的相互作用很小，并且代谢迅速，这解释了它们起效迅速（数分钟）和作用持续时间短（4-6小时）（选项A和C）。\n\n**(选项B)** 异丙肾上腺素是一种非选择性β受体激动剂，主要用于治疗心动过缓或心脏传导阻滞患者的变时效应。\n\n**(选项E)** 特布他林是一种短效β-2受体激动剂，通过静脉注射或皮下注射给药，用于非常严重的哮喘加重（即，需要插管的病例）。它没有长的亲脂性侧链。\n\n**教育目标：**\n短效β-2受体激动剂（例如，沙丁胺醇、左沙丁胺醇）是亲水的，并且代谢迅速，这解释了它们起效迅速和作用持续时间短的原因。长效β-2受体激动剂（例如，沙美特罗、福莫特罗）由于其亲脂性侧链，具有延长的作用持续时间，这使得它们能够附着在细胞质膜上。沙美特罗还能与β-2受体内的第二个胞外结合位点结合，锚定分子并进一步延长其作用。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of beta-2 agonists, specifically the difference between short-acting and long-acting beta-2 agonists and their mechanisms of action. It also tests the understanding of the clinical use of these medications in asthma and COPD.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the medication described has a long lipophilic side chain and provides significant relief of symptoms. This points towards a long-acting beta-2 agonist like salmeterol, which has a prolonged duration of action due to its lipophilic properties and binding to a secondary exosite.",
