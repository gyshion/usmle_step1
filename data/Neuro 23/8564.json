She was delivered vaginally at 30 weeks gestation, and her birth weight was 1.200 g (2 lb 10 oz). Physical examination shows a lethargic infant with weak and high-pitched crying, prominent scalp veins, and tense fontanelles. Cranial ultrasound reveals blood in the lateral ventricles. Which of the following structures is the most likely source of the bleeding?",

    "en": "Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a common complication of prematurity that can lead to long-term impairment in neurodevelopment. IVH almost always manifests first in the neonatal period in infants born before 32 weeks gestation and/or with birth weight <1,500 g (3 lb 5 oz). IVH in a newborn can be clinically silent or present with altered level of consciousness, hypotonia, and decreased spontaneous movements. If the bleeding is severe, catastrophic deterioration can occur with a bulging anterior fontanelle, hypotension, tonic-clonic seizures, irregular respirations, and coma.\n\nIVH in preterm infants usually originates from the GERMINAL MATRIX, a highly cellular and vascularized layer in the subventricular zone (source of neurons and glial cells during brain development). The matrix contains numerous fragile, thin-walled vessels lacking the glial fibers that support other blood vessels throughout the brain, making them more susceptible to hemorrhage. Between 24-32 weeks gestation, the germinal matrix starts to become less prominent, and its cellularity and vascularity decrease, leading to a reduced risk of IVH in infants born after 32 weeks.\n\n(Choices A and C) In neonates, an assisted delivery (eg, forceps, vacuum) can result in subdural hematoma (cortical bridging veins) or epidural hematoma (middle meningeal artery). Both can cause bulging fontanelles and altered level of consciousness but are characterized by hematomas over the cerebral convexities rather than blood in the lateral ventricles.\n\n(Choice D) The sagittal sinus and other dural venous sinuses are channels found between layers of dura mater in the brain. Certain conditions (eg, malignancy, hypercoagulable states, infection) can result in thrombosis within the dural sinuses; however, intraventricular bleeding would not be seen.\n\n(Choice E) A ruptured saccular (berry) aneurysm at a branch point in vessels of the circle of Willis is the most common cause of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Aneurysmal SAH is rare in infants and is associated with blood in the basal cisterns rather than the lateral ventricles.\n\nEducational objective:\nNeonatal intraventricular hemorrhage usually originates from the fragile germinal matrix in infants born before 32 weeks gestation and/or with birth weight <1.500 g (3 lb 5 oz). It is a common complication of prematurity that can lead to long-term neurodevelopmental impairment.",
    "zh": "脑室内出血 (IVH) 是早产儿常见的并发症，可导致神经发育的长期损害。IVH 几乎总是在新生儿期首次出现，发生在妊娠 32 周前和/或出生体重 <1,500 克（3 磅 5 盎司）的婴儿中。新生儿的 IVH 临床上可能无症状，或者表现为意识水平改变、肌张力低下和自发活动减少。如果出血严重，可能出现灾难性恶化，如前囟隆起、低血压、阵挛-强直性癫痫发作、呼吸不规则和昏迷。\n\n早产儿的 IVH 通常起源于生发基质，它是室管下区高度细胞化和血管化的层（脑发育过程中神经元和神经胶质细胞的来源）。生发基质包含许多脆弱的、薄壁的血管，缺乏支持大脑中其他血管的神经胶质纤维，这使得它们更容易发生出血。在妊娠 24-32 周之间，生发基质开始变得不那么突出，其细胞性和血管性降低，导致 32 周后出生的婴儿 IVH 的风险降低。\n\n（选项 A 和 C）在新生儿中，辅助分娩（例如，产钳，真空吸引）可导致硬膜下血肿（皮质桥静脉）或硬膜外血肿（脑膜中动脉）。两者都可引起囟门隆起和意识水平改变，但其特征是脑凸面上的血肿而不是侧脑室内的出血。\n\n（选项 D）矢状窦和其他硬脑膜静脉窦是位于大脑硬脑膜各层之间的通道。某些情况（例如，恶性肿瘤、高凝状态、感染）可导致硬脑膜窦内血栓形成；然而，不会看到脑室内出血。\n\n（选项 E）Willis 环血管分支点的囊性（浆果状）动脉瘤破裂是自发性蛛网膜下腔出血 (SAH) 最常见的原因。动脉瘤性 SAH 在婴儿中很少见，并且与基底池中的出血有关，而不是侧脑室。\n\n教育目标：\n新生儿脑室内出血通常起源于妊娠 32 周前和/或出生体重 <1.500 克（3 磅 5 盎司）的婴儿中脆弱的生发基质。它是早产儿常见的并发症，可导致长期的神经发育障碍。"
