  "explanation": {
    "en": "The clinical presentation and the peripheral blood smear shown are typical of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Most cases of childhood HUS are preceded by bloody diarrhea, often caused by Shiga-like toxin released from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (particularly strain O157:H7). Undercooked ground beef is a common cause of HUS.\n\nThe smear contains classic schistocytes (fragmented red cells) and few platelets. Schistocytes are diagnostic of a traumatic mechanism and indicate either microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (eg, HUS, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [TTP], disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC]) or mechanical damage (eg, prosthetic valve, severely calcified valves). HUS and TTP lie on a spectrum. Unlike in DIC, the coagulation system is not activated in HUS-TTP; therefore, coagulation studies (prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time) are normal, as seen with this patient. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is due to an altered immune response and the production of antibodies against erythrocytes. AIHA can occur following infections with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Epstein-Barr virus but not usually following a diarrheal illness. In addition, thrombocytopenia and renal failure are not associated with AIHA.\n\n(Choice B) Erythropoietin deficiency results in normocytic, normochromic anemia; neither schistocytes nor decreased platelets are present. In addition, erythropoietin deficiency is usually seen in chronic renal failure; this patient has acute renal failure.\n\n(Choice C) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency causes hemolytic anemia due to oxidative stress. It is not associated with thrombocytopenia or renal failure. The peripheral smear usually shows bite cells. {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(Choice D) Leukoerythroblastic peripheral smears (ie, nucleated red cells and immature white cells) are usually seen when the marrow is replaced with fibrosis (or metastatic cancer). The red cells can be squeezed while passing through fibrous strands and appear on the peripheral smear as characteristic teardrop cells. {{exhibit_4}}\n\nEducational objective:\nSchistocytes suggest microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (eg, hemolytic-uremic syndrome [HUS], thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [TTP], disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC]) or mechanical damage [eg, prosthetic valve]). In childhood, HUS is often preceded by bloody diarrhea. Coagulation studies (prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time) are normal in HUS-TTP but abnormal in DIC.",
    "zh": "该临床表现和所示外周血涂片是溶血性尿毒症综合征(HUS)的典型表现。大多数儿童HUS病例之前都有血性腹泻，通常由来自肠出血性大肠杆菌(尤其是O157:H7菌株)释放的类似志贺毒素引起。未煮熟的碎牛肉是HUS的常见病因。\n\n涂片包含典型的裂红细胞(红细胞碎片)和少量血小板。裂红细胞诊断出一种创伤机制，并提示微血管病性溶血性贫血(如HUS、血栓性血小板减少性紫癜[TTP]、弥漫性血管内凝血[DIC])或机械损伤(如人工瓣膜、严重钙化的瓣膜)。HUS和TTP存在于一个谱系中。与DIC不同，HUS-TTP的凝血系统未被激活；因此，凝血检查(凝血酶原时间和部分凝血活酶时间)是正常的，正如该患者所见。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n(选项A)自身免疫性溶血性贫血(AIHA)是由于免疫反应改变和产生针对红细胞的抗体引起的。AIHA可发生在肺炎支原体和EB病毒感染之后，但通常不会发生在腹泻疾病之后。此外，血小板减少症和肾衰竭与AIHA无关。\n\n(选项B)促红细胞生成素缺乏导致正细胞性、正色素性贫血；既没有裂红细胞也没有血小板减少。此外，促红细胞生成素缺乏通常见于慢性肾衰竭；该患者患有急性肾衰竭。\n\n(选项C)葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶(G6PD)缺乏导致氧化应激引起的溶血性贫血。它与血小板减少症或肾衰竭无关。外周血涂片通常显示咬细胞。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n(选项D)当骨髓被纤维化(或转移性癌)取代时，通常会看到白细胞红细胞母细胞性外周血涂片(即，有核红细胞和未成熟白细胞)。红细胞在穿过纤维束时可能会受到挤压，并在外周血涂片上表现为特征性的泪滴细胞。{{exhibit_4}}\n\n教学目标：\n裂红细胞提示微血管病性溶血性贫血(例如，溶血性尿毒症综合征[HUS]、血栓性血小板减少性紫癜[TTP]、弥漫性血管内凝血[DIC])或机械损伤[例如，人工瓣膜])。在儿童时期，HUS之前常有血性腹泻。HUS-TTP中的凝血检查(凝血酶原时间和部分凝血活酶时间)是正常的，但在DIC中则异常。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and its characteristic findings on peripheral blood smear, including schistocytes and thrombocytopenia. It also assesses the ability to differentiate HUS from other causes of anemia based on clinical presentation and laboratory results.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the history of bloody diarrhea followed by anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. Identify the presence of schistocytes on the peripheral smear, which points towards a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia such as HUS. Rule out other causes of anemia based on their clinical and laboratory features.",
