    "en": "A 44-year-old previously healthy woman comes to the emergency department due to a 2-day history of left flank pain, dysuria, fever, and chills. Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 80/40 mm Hg, and pulse is 140/min and regular. Physical examination shows left costovertebral angle tenderness. Laboratory studies reveal leukocytosis, pyuria, and bacteriuria. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics and intravenous fluids are administered. The patient remains persistently hypotensive, and an intravenous phenylephrine infusion is begun. Several minutes later, her heart rate decreases to 100/min. Compared to just prior to the infusion, which of the following intracellular changes are expected in this patient? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "Phenylephrine is a selective alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist that causes vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure by increasing inositol triphosphate (IP3) levels in vascular smooth muscle cells. The abrupt increase in blood pressure triggers a baroreceptor reflex, resulting in increased parasympathetic and decreased sympathetic outflow to the heart and vasculature. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nThe baroreceptor reflex-driven changes in the heart are mediated by beta-1 adrenergic receptors and muscarinic-2 receptors. Both reduced sympathetic stimulation of beta-1 receptors and increased parasympathetic stimulation of muscarinic-2 receptors trigger a decrease in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which leads to a decrease in heart rate and contractility to reduce cardiac output and lessen the increase in blood pressure. The reduction in heart rate is driven in part by decreased inward calcium current during phases 4 and 0 of the sinoatrial node action potential.\n\nThe above baroreceptor response also affects vascular smooth muscle, which is mostly under sympathetic control. Although this response causes reduced sympathetic stimulation of vascular alpha-1 receptors, the infusion of phenylephrine still maintains IP3 activity above baseline, resulting in a persistent vasoconstrictive effect.\n\nIn contrast, an abrupt decrease in blood pressure triggers the opposite regulatory response via the baroreceptor reflex.\n\nEducational objective:\nPhenylephrine increase's pressure while decreasing via an alpha-1 receptor-mediated increase in inositol triphosphate in vascular smooth muscle cells. The abrupt increase in blood pressure triggers a reflexive increase in parasympathetic activity while decreasing sympathetic outflow. This leads to decreased cyclic AMP activity in the heart (mediated by beta-1 adrenergic and muscarinic-2 receptors), which decreases heart rate and myocardial contractility. The reduction in heart rate is driven in part by decreased inward calcium current in sinoatrial cells.",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the baroreceptor reflex and the intracellular changes that occur in response to changes in blood pressure. It also tests understanding of the effects of alpha-1 adrenergic agonists on vascular smooth muscle and the subsequent compensatory mechanisms in the heart.\n\nTo solve this question, one must understand that phenylephrine, an alpha-1 agonist, increases blood pressure, triggering the baroreceptor reflex. This reflex increases parasympathetic and decreases sympathetic outflow, leading to decreased cAMP in ventricular myocytes and decreased inward calcium current in sinoatrial nodal cells, while phenylephrine directly increases inositol triphosphate in vascular smooth muscle.",
    "zh": "本题考察对压力感受器反射以及对血压变化反应中发生的细胞内变化的了解。它还考察对α-1肾上腺素激动剂对血管平滑肌的影响以及心脏中随后的代偿机制的理解。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须了解苯肾上腺素（一种α-1激动剂）会升高血压，从而触发压力感受器反射。该反射增加副交感神经活动并减少交感神经流出，导致心室肌细胞中cAMP降低，窦房结细胞中内向钙电流降低，而苯肾上腺素直接增加血管平滑肌中的肌醇三磷酸。"
