The patient has a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and primary biliary cholangitis progressing to cirrhosis. She underwent a liver transplant 2 years ago and is on immunosuppressive therapy. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. The oropharynx is normal in appearance. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. The patient has epigastric tenderness with no abdominal distension or guarding. Upper endoscopy shows several small esophageal ulcerations with distinct borders located in the middle and lower portions of the esophagus. A biopsy taken at the edge of an ulcer shows giant cells and intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",

    "en": "Esophagitis in an immunocompromised patient {{exhibit_1}}\n\nEsophagitis is usually the result of a noninfectious process such as gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity (eg, chemotherapy, post-transplantation, AIDS) are also at risk for esophageal infections. The leading causes are Candida, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV esophagitis usually presents with significant pain and discomfort with swallowing. Endoscopy typically reveals small vesicles or punched-out ulcers (ie, distinct borders) on the esophageal mucosa. Classic HSV findings on biopsy include multinucleated giant cells and eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies (Cowdry type A). Treatment with oral acyclovir usually resolves the active infection, but latent virus can reactivate in the future, leading to recurrent symptoms.\n\n(Choice B) Alendronate is a bisphosphonate used in the treatment of osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates can cause medication-induced esophagitis and could worsen this patient's symptoms.\n\n(Choice C) Azithromycin can be used as part of the treatment for disseminated mycobacterium avium complex, which often involves the gastrointestinal tract. However, this condition usually occurs in those with advanced AIDS: the esophagus is affected less commonly than the intestine; and endoscopy typically reveals whitish-yellow nodules on the mucosa.\n\n(Choice D) Fluconazole is used for candidal esophagitis. Endoscopy would reveal white pseudomembranes on the esophageal mucosa, and histopathology would show yeasts with pseudohyphae.\n\n(Choice E) Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analogue that significantly reduces gastric acid secretion and is sometimes used to prevent ulcers due to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication.\n\n(Choice F) Proton pump inhibitors (eg, omeprazole) are used to treat erosive esophagitis from chronic reflux. Erosive esophagitis typically reveals irregular ulcers along the esophageal mucosa, and biopsy would demonstrate inflammatory exudates and fibrinoid necrosis.\n\n(Choice G) Tenofovir is an antiviral agent that can be used for HIV and chronic hepatitis B infections. Although tenofovir is an antiviral medication, it is not effective against HSV.\n\nEducational objective:\nHerpes simplex virus esophagitis is most common in those with impaired cell-mediated immunity. Endoscopy typically reveals small vesicles and punched-out ulcers. Findings on biopsy usually include multinucleated giant cells and eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions (Cowdry type A inclusion bodies). Acyclovir is the treatment of choice. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "免疫功能低下患者的食管炎 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n食管炎通常是非感染性过程的结果，例如胃食管反流病。然而，细胞介导免疫受损的患者（例如，化疗、移植后、AIDS）也面临食管感染的风险。主要病因是白色念珠菌、巨细胞病毒和单纯疱疹病毒（HSV）。HSV食管炎通常表现为吞咽时明显的疼痛和不适。内镜检查通常显示食管粘膜上有小水疱或穿孔性溃疡（即，边缘清晰）。活检的典型HSV发现包括多核巨细胞和嗜酸性核内包涵体（Cowdry A型）。口服阿昔洛韦治疗通常可以缓解活动性感染，但潜伏病毒将来可能会重新激活，导致复发性症状。\n\n（选项B）阿仑膦酸钠是一种用于治疗骨质疏松症的双膦酸盐。双膦酸盐可引起药物性食管炎，并可能加重该患者的症状。\n\n（选项C）阿奇霉素可用于治疗播散性鸟分枝杆菌复合体，该病通常涉及胃肠道。然而，这种情况通常发生在晚期AIDS患者中：食管受累的频率低于肠道；内镜检查通常显示粘膜上有白色-黄色结节。\n\n（选项D）氟康唑用于念珠菌性食管炎。内镜检查会显示食管粘膜上有白色假膜，组织病理学检查会显示有酵母菌和假菌丝。\n\n（选项E）米索前列醇是一种前列腺素类似物，可显著减少胃酸分泌，有时用于预防非甾体抗炎药引起的溃疡。\n\n（选项F）质子泵抑制剂（例如，奥美拉唑）用于治疗慢性反流引起的侵蚀性食管炎。侵蚀性食管炎通常显示沿食管粘膜的不规则溃疡，活检会显示炎性渗出物和纤维素样坏死。\n\n（选项G）替诺福韦是一种抗病毒药物，可用于HIV和慢性乙型肝炎感染。虽然替诺福韦是一种抗病毒药物，但对HSV无效。\n\n教育目标：\n单纯疱疹病毒性食管炎最常见于细胞介导免疫受损的人群。内镜检查通常显示小水疱和穿孔性溃疡。活检结果通常包括多核巨细胞和嗜酸性核内包涵体（Cowdry A型包涵体）。阿昔洛韦是首选治疗方法。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of esophagitis in immunocompromised patients, specifically HSV esophagitis, and its characteristic endoscopic and histologic findings, as well as appropriate treatment. The question requires recognizing the clinical presentation, endoscopic findings of small, punched-out ulcers, and the biopsy findings of multinucleated giant cells with eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions (Cowdry type A) to diagnose HSV esophagitis. \n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the patient's immunocompromised state, the endoscopic findings suggestive of HSV esophagitis, and the confirmatory biopsy results. Once HSV esophagitis is suspected, the appropriate treatment, acyclovir, should be selected. Ruling out other causes of esophagitis based on the clinical and pathological findings is also crucial.",
