    "en": "Bile acids are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol catabolism. Bile enters the duodenum through gallbladder contraction. Bile acids are primarily absorbed in the terminal ileum, with the small amount that remains unabsorbed being excreted in the stool (this amount is matched by bile acid synthesis).\n\nStatins are the first-line therapy for most patients with hypercholesterolemia. These drugs competitively INHIBIT HMG CoA reductase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonate (ie, the rate-limiting step in hepatic cholesterol synthesis). This inhibition decreases hepatic cholesterol synthesis. The resulting upregulation of LDL receptors causes increased uptake of LDL from the circulation. Statins' effects on triglyceride and HDL levels are comparatively modest.\n\nBile acid–binding resins (ie, bile acid sequestrants) work by binding bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby interfering with the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and causing increased bile acid excretion. This results in hepatic synthesis of new bile acids, a process that consumes liver cholesterol stores. Hepatic uptake of LDL from the circulation is increased for continued bile acid synthesis. Bile acid production and secretion are increased by 10-fold due to this interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Hepatic cholesterol reduction is an activating factor for HMG CoA reductase and subsequently results in increased hepatic cholesterol synthesis {{exhibit_1}}. This effect can be blocked with the addition of a statin drug to the treatment regimen, leading to a greater reduction in LDL levels than with use of either drug alone (synergistic action).\n\nEducational objective:\n\nSimvastatin decreases hepatic cholesterol production, while cholestyramine increases hepatic cholesterol and bile acid synthesis. Combination therapy results in a synergistic reduction in plasma LDL level.",
    "zh": "胆汁酸在肝脏中由胆固醇分解代谢合成。胆汁通过胆囊收缩进入十二指肠。胆汁酸主要在末端回肠被吸收，未被吸收的少量胆汁酸随粪便排出（此量与胆汁酸合成相匹配）。\n\n他汀类药物是大多数高胆固醇血症患者的一线治疗药物。这些药物通过竞争性地抑制 HMG辅酶A还原酶，该酶负责将HMG CoA转化为甲羟戊酸（即肝脏胆固醇合成的限速步骤）。这种抑制作用降低了肝脏胆固醇的合成。由此产生的LDL受体上调导致从循环中摄取更多的LDL。他汀类药物对甘油三酯和HDL水平的影响相对较小。\n\n胆汁酸结合树脂（即胆汁酸螯合剂）通过在胃肠道中结合胆汁酸起作用，从而干扰胆汁酸的肠肝循环，导致胆汁酸排泄增加。这导致肝脏合成新的胆汁酸，这个过程消耗肝脏胆固醇储存。肝脏从循环中摄取LDL以持续合成胆汁酸。由于这种对胆汁酸肠肝循环的中断，胆汁酸的产生和分泌增加了10倍。肝脏胆固醇的降低是HMG辅酶A还原酶的激活因子，随后导致肝脏胆固醇合成增加 {{exhibit_1}}。通过在治疗方案中添加他汀类药物可以阻断这种作用，从而导致LDL水平的降低比单独使用任何一种药物更大（协同作用）。\n\n教育目标：\n\n辛伐他汀降低肝脏胆固醇的产生，而考来烯胺增加肝脏胆固醇和胆汁酸的合成。联合治疗导致血浆 LDL 水平的协同降低。"

    "en": "This question tests the mechanism of action of statins and bile acid resins on hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Statins inhibit HMG CoA reductase, decreasing cholesterol synthesis, while bile acid resins interrupt enterohepatic circulation, increasing cholesterol synthesis.\n\nTo solve this question, understand the independent effects of each drug class on cholesterol synthesis.
