    "en": "A 64-year-old woman with history of lung cancer comes to the office due to the patient having severe chest wall pain due to cancer invading the parietal pleura and ribs. She is unable to take opioid medication due to intolerable adverse effects, so she should be offered other interventional pain management strategies. Options include nerve blocks (eg, injection of anesthetic near the nerve), neurolysis (eg, physical or chemical nerve destruction), and neuromodulation (eg, spinal cord stimulation). {{exhibit_1}} This patient is undergoing an intercostal nerve block to improve her pain control. Sensation from the parietal pleura, ribs, and overlying skin is mediated by thoracic intercostal nerves that derive from the ventral rami of the thoracic spinal nerves. An intercostal nerve block provides anesthesia over the dermatomal distribution of the nerve that is anesthetized. The intercostal vein, artery, and nerve lie in the subcostal groove along the lower border of the rib and therefore provide a straightforward target for a nerve block. {{exhibit_2}} Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment target?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "(Choices A and E) The inferior cervical ganglion and the thoracic sympathetic trunk are part of the sympathetic nervous system. They help convey thoracic and upper abdominal visceral pain but do not carry somatic sensory information. Nerve blockade here would decrease sympathetic activity (eg, decrease sweating in hyperhidrosis) but would not significantly improve chest wall pain. {{exhibit_3}}\n(Choice C) The phrenic nerve, which is derived from the C3-C5 nerve roots, delivers motor innervation to the diaphragm and carries pain fibers from the diaphragmatic and mediastinal pleura (not the costal pleura). Pain due to diaphragmatic and mediastinal pleura is often referred to the C3-C5 distribution at the base of the neck and over the shoulder. In addition, a nerve block that could paralyze the diaphragm is not typically recommended.\n(Choice D) The pulmonary plexus is derived from branches of the vagus nerve and the sympathetic trunk. It innervates the visceral pleura but not the parietal pleura or the chest wall. Unlike the parietal pleura, the visceral pleura can only detect stretch and is not sensitive to pain.\nEducational objective:\nSensation to the parietal pleura, chest wall, and skin of the chest is supplied by the intercostal nerves that derive from the ventral rami. A nerve block can be used to control pain from these areas when opioids are ineffective, contraindicated, or have intolerable adverse effects.",
    "zh": "（选项 A 和 E）颈下神经节和胸交感干是交感神经系统的一部分。它们有助于传递胸部和上腹部的内脏痛，但不携带躯体感觉信息。在此处进行神经阻滞会降低交感神经活动（例如，减少多汗症的出汗），但不会显着改善胸壁疼痛。{{exhibit_3}}\n（选项 C）膈神经源自 C3-C5 神经根，为膈肌提供运动神经支配，并携带来自膈肌和纵隔胸膜（而非肋骨胸膜）的疼痛纤维。由于膈肌和纵隔胸膜引起的疼痛通常会放射到颈部底部和肩部的 C3-C5 分布区域。此外，通常不推荐会使膈肌麻痹的神经阻滞。\n（选项 D）肺丛源自迷走神经和交感干的分支。它支配脏层胸膜，但不支配壁层胸膜或胸壁。与壁层胸膜不同，脏层胸膜只能检测到拉伸，对疼痛不敏感。\n教育目标：\n胸壁、胸壁和胸部皮肤的感觉由源自腹侧支的肋间神经提供。当阿片类药物无效、禁忌或有无法耐受的不良反应时，可以使用神经阻滞来控制这些区域的疼痛。"
