    "en": "A 54-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to severe fatigue and dyspnea. He has a long history of progressively worsening heart failure that has been resistant to treatment with medications, including diuretics. He was treated with chest radiation 10 years ago for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and has been in remission since then. The patient is admitted to the hospital, but his condition continues to deteriorate despite aggressive therapy. He dies 3 days later, and an autopsy is performed. Gross inspection of the heart shows dense, thick, fibrous tissue in the pericardial space between the visceral and parietal pericardium. Which of the following signs would most likely have been detected during a physical examination of this patient just prior to his death?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The autopsy finding of thick, fibrous tissue in the pericardial space is consistent with constrictive pericarditis, a potential complication of chest radiation therapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This dense, rigid pericardial tissue encases the heart and restricts ventricular filling, causing low cardiac output (manifesting with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion) and progressive right-sided heart failure. \n\nPhysical examination in constrictive pericarditis typically shows elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) with prominent x and y descents and a pericardial knock (early diastolic sound that occurs before S3) and may also demonstrate pulsus paradoxus (>10 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration). In addition, Kussmaul sign may be present. Under normal circumstances, the decrease in intrathoracic pressure during inspiration increases venous return to the right side of the heart and lowers JVP. However, in constrictive pericarditis, the rigid pericardium prevents the right side of the heart from accommodating increased venous return, which leads to a paradoxical rise in JVP during inspiration, referred to as Kussmaul sign.\n\n(Choice B) A loud pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) is heard in patients with pulmonary hypertension.\n\n(Choice C) During inspiration, venous return to the right side of the heart is increased, resulting in later closure of the pulmonic valve and physiologic splitting of the aortic (A2) and pulmonic components of S2. Paradoxical splitting occurs when cardiac pathology (eg, aortic stenosis, left bundle branch block) delays closure of the aortic valve, causing A2 to occur noticeably later than P2.\n\n(Choice D) An S3 gallop occurs due to the sudden deceleration of blood as it enters a dilated ventricle; it is typically heard in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or severe mitral regurgitation.\n\n(Choice E) A sustained left parasternal lift is most commonly a sign of right ventricular hypertrophy, such as occurs with chronic right ventricular pressure overload (eg, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonic stenosis) or volume overload (eg, tricuspid regurgitation).\n\nEducational objective: In constrictive pericarditis, normal pericardium is replaced by dense, rigid pericardial tissue that restricts ventricular filling, leading to low cardiac output and progressive right-sided heart failure. Physical examination findings in such patients include elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), pericardial knock, pulsus paradoxus, and a paradoxical rise in JVP with inspiration (Kussmaul sign).",
    "zh": "尸检发现心包腔内有厚的纤维组织，这与缩窄性心包炎一致，缩窄性心包炎是非霍奇金淋巴瘤胸部放射治疗的潜在并发症。这种致密的、僵硬的心包组织包裹着心脏并限制心室充盈，导致心输出量低（表现为疲劳和劳力性呼吸困难）和进行性右心衰竭。\n\n缩窄性心包炎的体格检查通常显示颈静脉压 (JVP) 升高，伴有明显的 x 和 y 下降以及心包叩击音（在 S3 之前发生的早期舒张期声音），也可能表现为反常脉搏（吸气时收缩压下降 >10 mm Hg）。此外，可能出现 Kussmaul 征。在正常情况下，吸气期间胸腔内压力的降低会增加静脉回流到心脏右侧并降低 JVP。然而，在缩窄性心包炎中，僵硬的心包阻止心脏右侧适应增加的静脉回流，这会导致吸气期间 JVP 出现反常升高，称为 Kussmaul 征。\n\n(选项 B) 在肺动脉高压患者中可听到第二心音肺动脉瓣成分 (P2) 亢进。\n\n(选项 C) 在吸气期间，静脉回流到心脏右侧增加，导致肺动脉瓣关闭延迟以及主动脉瓣 (A2) 和肺动脉瓣 S2 的生理性分裂。当心脏病理学（例如，主动脉瓣狭窄、左束支传导阻滞）延迟主动脉瓣关闭时，就会发生反常分裂，导致 A2 明显晚于 P2。\n\n(选项 D) S3 奔马律是由于血液进入扩张的心室时突然减速而发生的；它通常在扩张型心肌病或严重二尖瓣反流的患者中听到。\n\n(选项 E) 持续性左胸骨旁抬举最常见的是右心室肥大的征象，例如发生于慢性右心室压力超负荷（例如，肺动脉高压、肺动脉瓣狭窄）或容量超负荷（例如，三尖瓣反流）。\n\n教育目标：在缩窄性心包炎中，正常心包被致密的、僵硬的心包组织取代，从而限制心室充盈，导致心输出量低和进行性右心衰竭。此类患者的体格检查结果包括颈静脉压 (JVP) 升高、心包叩击音、反常脉搏和吸气时 JVP 的反常升高 (Kussmaul 征)。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of constrictive pericarditis, its etiology (radiation therapy), pathophysiology (rigid pericardium restricting ventricular filling), and associated physical exam findings (Kussmaul sign, elevated JVP). Constrictive pericarditis leads to right-sided heart failure due to impaired ventricular filling. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical scenario of heart failure resistant to diuretics in a patient with a history of chest radiation.
