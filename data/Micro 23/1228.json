    "en": "A 45-year-old man comes to the office due to 3 months of night sweats, productive cough, decreased appetite, and a 5-kg (10-lb) weight loss. He travels frequently to Vietnam. Vital signs are normal. Examination reveals crackles in the right upper lobe of the lung. Chest x-ray reveals a right upper lobe infiltrate. Acid-fast bacilli are present on sputum smear. The patient is started on combination therapy with isoniazid, ethambutol, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and pyridoxine. One month later, he returns to the office reporting blurring of vision. Examination shows bilateral central scotomas.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient, who travels regularly to Vietnam and now has a cough, night sweats, and weight loss with a right upper lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray and acid-fast bacilli on sputum examination, likely has pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Pulmonary TB is treated with a 4-drug regimen, sometimes referred to as RIPE: rifampin, isoniazid (INH), pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. The most notable side effect of ethambutol is optic neuropathy, which clinically manifests as decreased visual acuity, central scotoma, or color blindness. It may be reversible with discontinuation of the drug.\n\n(Choices B and D) The most important side effect of INH is hepatotoxicity. INH is also associated with peripheral neuropathy, which is due to the drug's interference with pyridoxine metabolism and can be prevented by pyridoxine administration.\n\n(Choice C) The most important side effects of pyrazinamide are hepatotoxicity and hyperuricemia (can exacerbate gout).\n\n(Choice E) Rifampin can cause body fluids (eg, urine, tears) to turn red. This condition is benign.\n\nEducational objective:\nEthambutol can cause optic neuropathy that results in color blindness, central scotoma, and decreased visual acuity. This adverse side effect may be reversed with discontinuation of the drug.",
    "zh": "这位患者经常前往越南，目前出现咳嗽、盗汗和体重减轻，胸部X光片显示右肺上叶浸润，痰涂片检查发现抗酸杆菌，很可能患有肺结核 (TB)。 肺结核的治疗方案是四联药物，有时称为 RIPE：利福平、异烟肼 (INH)、吡嗪酰胺和乙胺丁醇。乙胺丁醇最显著的副作用是视神经病变，临床表现为视力下降、中心暗点或色盲。停药后可能可逆。\n\n（选项 B 和 D）INH 最重要的副作用是肝毒性。INH 也与周围神经病变有关，这是由于该药干扰了吡哆醇的代谢，可以通过补充吡哆醇来预防。\n\n（选项 C）吡嗪酰胺最重要的副作用是肝毒性和高尿酸血症（可加重痛风）。\n\n（选项 E）利福平可导致体液（如尿液、眼泪）变红。这种情况是良性的。\n\n教育目标：\n乙胺丁醇可引起视神经病变，导致色盲、中心暗点和视力下降。这种不良反应可能通过停药而逆转。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the side effects of anti-tuberculosis medications, specifically the optic neuropathy associated with ethambutol. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of optic neuropathy (blurred vision, central scotomas) and linking it to the appropriate medication.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the common side effects of the RIPE drugs used to treat tuberculosis. Focus on the visual disturbances associated with ethambutol and differentiate it from the side effects of other medications like isoniazid (hepatotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy), pyrazinamide (hepatotoxicity, hyperuricemia), and rifampin (red-orange body fluids).",
    "zh": "此题考察对治疗结核病药物的副作用的了解，特别是与乙胺丁醇相关的视神经病变。它要求识别视神经病变的临床表现（视力模糊、中心暗点）并将其与适当的药物联系起来。\n\n为了解决这个问题，回想一下用于治疗结核病的 RIPE 药物的常见副作用。侧重于与乙胺丁醇相关的视觉障碍，并将其与其他药物的副作用（如异烟肼的肝毒性、周围神经病变，吡嗪酰胺的肝毒性、高尿酸血症以及利福平的红橙色体液）区分开来。"
