    "en": "A 56-year-old woman with a history of hypertension is brought to the emergency department due to 3 days of dysuria and back pain. Temperature is 39.2 C (102.6 F), blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 28/min. The patient is confused and has suprapubic and costovertebral angle tenderness. The skin is diffusely warm but there are no rashes or edema. Complete blood count demonstrates leukocytosis with increased neutrophils but is otherwise normal. Coagulation studies are normal. Urinalysis is positive for leukocyte esterase and nitrites, and microscopy shows numerous bacteria. Several hours later, the patient becomes increasingly hypoxic and requires mechanical ventilation. This patient's respiratory symptoms are most likely due to which of the following pathologic conditions?",

    "en": "This patient has a urinary tract infection complicated by fever and hemodynamic instability consistent with sepsis. Her rapid-onset respiratory failure is suggestive of ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS). ARDS is characterized by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemia in the absence of heart failure. It can occur due to direct pulmonary trauma (eg, pulmonary contusions, inhaled irritants) or indirect nonpulmonary insults (eg, sepsis, burns, pancreatitis) that result in pulmonary epithelial and/or endothelial injury.\n\nThe 3 phases of ARDS follow the disease's progression:\n\n*   Exudative phase: Inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, IL-6) activate the pulmonary endothelium and recruit neutrophils to the lung tissue. Resultant endothelial damage leads to increased capillary permeability and leakage of protein-rich fluid into the alveolar space. Organization of the edema and cellular debris leads to the formation of hyaline membranes.\n*   Proliferative phase: One to two weeks later, endothelial cells, pneumocytes, and fibroblasts proliferate in attempts to repair the damaged lung; collagen is deposited and scarring may occur. Edema is reabsorbed.\n*   Fibrotic phase: In a minority of patients, excessive collagen deposition leads to irreversible pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension.\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice B) Necrotizing inflammation and pulmonary hemorrhage are commonly associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which involves both the lungs and the kidneys. However, this condition normally presents subacutely with cough, hemoptysis, and nephritic syndrome; this patient's acute respiratory decline in the setting of sepsis is more consistent with ARDS.\n\n(Choice C) Noncaseating granulomas are found in sarcoidosis, which typically presents more chronically with cough, skin findings, or uveitis. Hemodynamic instability and acute respiratory failure would be unexpected.\n\n(Choice D) Mucus plugging typically occurs in patients with underlying lung disease (eg, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Mucus plugs can cause hypoxemia but would not be expected to cause hypotension and fevers, and acute respiratory deterioration in the setting of sepsis is more likely due to ARDS.\n\n(Choice E) Wedge-shaped areas of hemorrhagic necrosis can be seen with pulmonary embolism, which can cause acute respiratory failure, hypotension, and tachycardia. However, patients often have chest pain, and in general, decompensation occurs suddenly (not progressively over a course of hours). In addition, urinary symptoms, confusion, and high fevers are unexpected in this condition.\n\nEducational objective:\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome is caused by injury of the pulmonary epithelium and/or endothelium, and occurs most often due to sepsis or pneumonia. Cytokines recruit neutrophils to the lung tissue, which cause capillary damage and leakage of protein-rich fluid into the alveoli. Later, cellular proliferation and collagen deposition occurs, and in some patients, this leads to irreversible pulmonary fibrosis.",
    "zh": "该患者患有尿路感染，并发有发热和血流动力学不稳定，这与脓毒症一致。她快速发作的呼吸衰竭提示急性呼吸窘迫综合征 (ARDS)。ARDS 的特征是在没有心力衰竭的情况下出现双侧肺浸润和低氧血症。它可以因直接的肺部创伤（例如，肺挫伤、吸入刺激物）或间接的非肺部损伤（例如，脓毒症、烧伤、胰腺炎）而发生，这些损伤会导致肺上皮和/或内皮损伤。\n\nARDS 的 3 个阶段遵循疾病的进展：\n\n*   渗出期：炎性细胞因子（例如，肿瘤坏死因子、IL-1、IL-6）激活肺内皮，并将中性粒细胞募集到肺组织。由此产生的内皮损伤导致毛细血管通透性增加，富含蛋白质的液体渗漏到肺泡腔内。水肿和细胞碎片的组织化导致透明膜的形成。\n*   增殖期：一到两周后，内皮细胞、肺泡细胞和成纤维细胞增殖，试图修复受损的肺；胶原蛋白沉积，可能发生瘢痕形成。水肿被重新吸收。\n*   纤维化期：在少数患者中，过度的胶原蛋白沉积导致不可逆的肺纤维化和肺动脉高压。\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选择 B) 坏死性炎症和肺出血通常与伴有多血管炎的肉芽肿病相关，该病同时累及肺和肾脏。然而，这种情况通常以亚急性病程表现为咳嗽、咯血和肾炎综合征；在这种脓毒症的情况下，该患者的急性呼吸衰竭更符合 ARDS。\n\n(选择 C) 非干酪性肉芽肿见于结节病，通常以慢性咳嗽、皮肤表现或葡萄膜炎表现。血流动力学不稳定和急性呼吸衰竭是不常见的。\n\n(选择 D) 粘液栓塞通常发生在患有潜在肺部疾病的患者（例如，囊性纤维化、慢性阻塞性肺病）中。粘液栓塞可导致低氧血症，但预计不会引起低血压和发热，而且在脓毒症的情况下，急性呼吸恶化更有可能归因于 ARDS。\n\n(选择 E) 楔形出血性坏死区域可见于肺栓塞，可导致急性呼吸衰竭、低血压和心动过速。然而，患者通常有胸痛，并且通常情况下，代偿失调会突然发生（而不是在几个小时的过程中逐渐发生）。此外，在这种情况下，尿路症状、意识模糊和高热是不常见的。\n\n教育目标：\n急性呼吸窘迫综合征是由肺上皮和/或内皮损伤引起的，最常由于脓毒症或肺炎引起。细胞因子将中性粒细胞募集到肺组织，导致毛细血管损伤和富含蛋白质的液体渗漏到肺泡。之后，发生细胞增殖和胶原蛋白沉积，在某些患者中，这会导致不可逆的肺纤维化。"
