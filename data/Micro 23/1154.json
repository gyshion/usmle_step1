    "en": "A 45-year-old man comes to the office with groin pain and swelling. About a month ago, he noticed a sore on his penis but did not seek medical attention because the ulcer was not painful and disappeared within a week. Several days ago, he began to experience painful swelling in his inguinal region, with inflammation of the overlying skin and eventual formation of several draining ulcers. He also has mild fever and malaise that began around the same time as his groin symptoms. The patient is a sailor. His other medical problems include well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Cell scrapings from his lesions show cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. ",
    "zh": "一名45岁男性因腹股沟疼痛和肿胀前来就诊。大约一个月前，他注意到阴茎上有一个疮，但没有就医，因为溃疡不痛，一周内就消失了。几天前，他开始出现腹股沟区域的疼痛性肿胀，伴有覆盖皮肤的炎症，最终形成多个引流性溃疡。他也有轻微发烧和不适，这与腹股沟症状同时开始。患者是一名水手。他的其他疾病包括控制良好的高血压和高脂血症。从他的病变中刮取的细胞显示胞质内包涵体。"

    "en": "{{exhibit_1}}Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes L1 through L3 cause lymphogranuloma venereum, a sexually transmitted disease characterized initially by painless ulcers with later progression to painful inguinal lymphadenopathy (“buboes”) and ulceration. Chlamydial inclusion bodies are seen in host cell cytoplasm.\n\n(Choice B) Haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid, an ulcerative, sexually transmitted infection characterized by painful (rather than painless) red papules on the genitals that eventually erode to become tender ulcers (you “do cry” with H ducreyi). Regional lymph nodes may swell and become chronic ulcers.\n\n(Choice C) Herpes simplex virus type 2 is the most common cause of genital herpes, characterized by vesicles that develop into shallow ulcers. These lesions are often painful and heal within 10 days. Histologically, multinucleated giant cells and large pinkish-purple intranuclear (not intracytoplasmic) inclusions, termed Cowdry type A bodies, are present.\n\n(Choice D) Klebsiella granulomatis causes granuloma inguinale (donovanosis), which also initially manifests as a painless genital papule that eventually ulcerates; however, lymphadenopathy is uncommon. Intracytoplasmic Donovan bodies are diagnostic. If donovanosis is untreated, scarring and strictures can lead to severe lymphatic obstruction and lymphedema (elephantiasis).\n\n(Choice E) Syphilis, caused by the gram-negative spirochete Treponema pallidum, is initially characterized by a painless lesion (chancre) that heals without treatment within weeks. It does not typically develop into buboes and is not characterized by cytoplasmic inclusion bodies.\n\nEducational objective:\nChlamydia trachomatis serotypes L1 through L3 cause lymphogranuloma venereum, a sexually transmitted disease characterized initially by painless ulcers with later progression to painful inguinal lymphadenopathy (“buboes”) and ulceration. Chlamydial inclusion bodies are seen in host cell cytoplasm.",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of sexually transmitted infections, specifically lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. It assesses the ability to differentiate LGV from other ulcerative STIs based on clinical presentation and diagnostic findings. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the progression from a painless ulcer to painful inguinal lymphadenopathy (buboes) and the presence of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Understanding the characteristic features of other STIs like chancroid, herpes, granuloma inguinale, and syphilis helps eliminate incorrect options.",
