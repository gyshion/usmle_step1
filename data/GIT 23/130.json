    "en": "A 55-year-old man comes to the office due to recurrent abdominal discomfort. He also has bloating, a feeling of fullness, and indigestion. Vital signs are within normal limits, and abdominal examination is unremarkable. Fecal occult blood testing is positive. Gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures are performed and confirm the presence of an ulcer. The patient is told that the ulcer itself is very unlikely to be malignant based on its location. Which of the following is the most likely site of this patient's gastrointestinal ulcer?",

    "en": "Gastrointestinal ulcers are defined as breaches of the alimentary tract mucosa that extend through the muscularis mucosae into the submucosa (or beyond). Those specifically designated as peptic ulcers are chronic lesions in areas exposed to acid/peptic juices, most commonly in the proximal duodenum, antral stomach, and gastroesophageal junction. Patients may present with epigastric discomfort, early satiety, and a positive fecal occult blood test.\n\nAlmost all peptic ulcers are due to either Helicobacter pylori infection or use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The vast majority (>95%) of duodenal ulcers occur within the first part of the duodenum; however, multiple or refractory ulcers beyond the duodenal bulb may be seen in patients with gastrinoma (non-beta islet cell tumor of the pancreas). Duodenal ulcers are very rarely malignant and do not require biopsy. Conversely, gastric ulcers (located within the stomach) can be malignant (eg, gastric adenocarcinoma) and must be biopsied for confirmation (Choice E). Gastric ulcers caused by H. pylori infection are associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer, but duodenal ulcers related to this infection do not lead to a higher risk of duodenal carcinoma.\n\n(Choice B) Esophageal adenocarcinoma can appear as an ulcerated/exophytic lesion in the lower third of the esophagus and typically results from Barrett esophagus, chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease, obesity, and/or smoking. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma appears as plaque-like thickening of the mucosa in the upper two-thirds of the esophagus that may become ulcerated. Major risk factors include smoking, alcohol consumption, and caustic injury.\n\n(Choices C and D) Carcinomas of the distal colon tend to be annular lesions that result in \"napkin-ring\" constriction of the bowel, with heaped-up edges and an ulcerated central region. Risk factors include advanced age, hereditary (eg, familial adenomatous polyposis) or sporadic colon cancer in the family, and inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nEducational objective:\nDuodenal ulcers are not associated with an increased risk of carcinoma in the same location. In contrast, ulcers located in the esophagus, stomach (gastric), and colon may be malignant, and biopsy is required. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "胃肠道溃疡定义为消化道粘膜的破坏，穿透粘膜肌层进入粘膜下层（或更深层）。特指的消化性溃疡是指暴露于酸/胃蛋白酶消化液区域的慢性病变，最常见于十二指肠近端、胃窦和胃食管交界处。患者可能出现上腹部不适、早饱，以及粪便隐血试验阳性。\n\n几乎所有消化性溃疡都由幽门螺杆菌感染或使用非甾体类抗炎药（NSAIDs）引起。绝大多数（>95%）的十二指肠溃疡发生于十二指肠的第一部分；然而，在胃泌素瘤（胰腺非β细胞肿瘤）患者中，可能会看到十二指肠球部以外的多发性或难治性溃疡。十二指肠溃疡很少是恶性的，不需要活检。相反，胃溃疡（位于胃内）可能是恶性的（例如，胃腺癌），必须进行活检以确认（选项E）。由幽门螺杆菌感染引起的胃溃疡与胃癌风险增加相关，但与此感染相关的十二指肠溃疡不会导致十二指肠癌的风险增加。\n\n（选项B）食管腺癌可表现为食管下三分之一的溃疡/外生性病变，通常由Barrett食管、慢性胃食管反流病、肥胖和/或吸烟引起。食管鳞状细胞癌表现为食管上三分之二粘膜的斑块样增厚，可能发生溃疡。主要危险因素包括吸烟、饮酒和腐蚀性损伤。\n\n（选项C和D）远端结肠癌往往是环状病变，导致肠道的“餐巾环”样狭窄，边缘隆起，中央区域溃疡。危险因素包括高龄、家族遗传（例如，家族性腺瘤性息肉病）或家族性散发性结肠癌，以及炎症性肠病。\n\n教育目标：\n十二指肠溃疡与同一位置的癌变风险增加无关。相反，位于食管、胃（胃溃疡）和结肠的溃疡可能为恶性，需要活检。{{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the most common locations and etiologies of peptic ulcers, as well as the relative risk of malignancy associated with ulcers in different locations. It emphasizes the importance of considering the location of an ulcer when assessing the likelihood of malignancy.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that duodenal ulcers are the most common type of peptic ulcer and are usually benign. Recognize that gastric ulcers have a higher risk of malignancy and require biopsy, while esophageal and colorectal cancers typically present with different characteristics.",
