    "en": "A 72-year-old, previously healthy man is brought to the office by his wife due to unusual movements and behavior during sleep that have occurred with increasing frequency over the past 3 months. She says, \"Lately, he's been waking me up in the middle of the night, moaning and thrashing around like he's having a bad dream. Sometimes, he becomes so violent in his sleep that he'll kick and punch me. I can easily wake him up, but he's often confused for a few seconds. Then he usually describes a dream in which he was defending himself from an attack.\"\nPhysical examination is unremarkable. Neurodegeneration due to accumulation of which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's condition?",

    "en": "This patient's repeated nocturnal episodes of complex motor behaviors that reflect dream enactment are consistent with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). RBD is a parasomnia characterized by dream enactment that occurs because the muscle atonia usually accompanying REM sleep is absent or incomplete. When awakened, patients may be transiently confused but very quickly become fully alert. They may not recall their movements during sleep but can frequently remember their dreams.\nRBD is more likely to occur in men age >50 and is strongly associated with alpha-synuclein neurodegenerative disorders. Alpha-synuclein is a synaptic protein that accumulates in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. Spontaneous (ie, not associated with medications) RBD is considered a prodromal syndrome of alpha-synuclein neurodegeneration because up to 90% of patients with idiopathic RBD eventually develop one of these conditions.\n(Choices B and D) Extracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid and/or tau proteins occurs in Alzheimer dementia, which typically presents with early and prominent memory impairment with language deficits and spatial disorientation. Although sleep disturbances commonly occur in patients with Alzheimer dementia, they usually impact sleep initiation and continuity and occur later in the disease process.\n(Choice C) Excessive accumulation of misfolded, infectious proteins (ie, prions) causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a fatal disease that most commonly presents with rapid mental deterioration, behavioral abnormalities, and myoclonus.\n(Choice E) Accumulation of abnormally ubiquitinated TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43), which normally functions as a transcription inhibitor and DNA repair protein, is associated with both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis frequently have sleep difficulty, which is usually related to an inability to change position due to muscle weakness, pain due to muscle cramps, and comorbid anxiety.\nEducational objective: REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by dream-enactment behaviors due to a loss of atonia during REM sleep. Most patients with idiopathic RBD eventually develop a disorder of alpha-synuclein neurodegeneration, most commonly Parkinson disease.",
    "zh": "该患者反复出现的复杂夜间运动行为反映了梦境行为，这与REM睡眠行为障碍 (RBD) 相符。RBD是一种睡眠障碍，其特点是梦境行为的出现，这是因为通常伴随REM睡眠发生的肌肉张力消失或不完全。当患者醒来时，可能会短暂地感到困惑，但很快就会完全清醒。他们可能不记得在睡眠中的动作，但经常能回忆起他们的梦境。\nRBD更有可能发生在50岁以上的男性中，并且与α-突触核蛋白神经退行性疾病密切相关。α-突触核蛋白是一种突触蛋白，会在帕金森病、路易体痴呆和多系统萎缩等神经退行性疾病中积累。自发性（即，与药物无关）RBD被认为是α-突触核蛋白神经退行性变的先兆综合征，因为高达90%的特发性RBD患者最终会发展成这些疾病之一。\n（选项B和D）β-淀粉样蛋白和/或Tau蛋白的细胞外积累发生在阿尔茨海默病中，其典型表现为早期且突出的记忆障碍，伴有语言缺陷和空间定向障碍。尽管睡眠障碍常见于阿尔茨海默病患者，但它们通常会影响睡眠的启动和持续性，并且发生在疾病过程的后期。\n（选项C）错误折叠的、感染性蛋白（即朊蛋白）的过度积累会导致克雅病，这是一种致命的疾病，通常表现为快速的精神恶化、行为异常和肌阵挛。\n（选项E）异常泛素化的TAR DNA结合蛋白-43 (TDP-43) 的积累，TDP-43通常用作转录抑制剂和DNA修复蛋白，与肌萎缩侧索硬化症和额颞叶痴呆有关。肌萎缩侧索硬化症患者经常出现睡眠困难，这通常与由于肌肉无力而无法改变体位、由于肌肉痉挛引起的疼痛以及合并焦虑有关。\n教育目标：REM睡眠行为障碍 (RBD) 是一种睡眠障碍，其特征是由于REM睡眠期间张力丧失而产生的梦境行为。大多数特发性RBD患者最终会发展为α-突触核蛋白神经退行性疾病，最常见的是帕金森病。"
