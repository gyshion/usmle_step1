    "en": "A 26-year-old man returns to the emergency department after developing a fever and skin rash. The patient was discharged from the hospital 10 days ago after treatment for a copperhead snake bite to his left leg. He received multiple doses of polyvalent Fab antivenom therapy and other supportive care during hospitalization. The patient's bite site pain, swelling, and ecchymosis have resolved; however, he has developed fever, pain in multiple extremity joints, and pruritic rash over the past 2 days. He has no chronic medical conditions. Temperature is 38.5 C (101.3 F), blood pressure is 128/70 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination shows a diffuse urticarial rash. No mucous membrane lesions are present. There is tenderness to palpation of the bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints, wrists, and ankles with no redness or swelling. Blood cell counts, serum chemistry studies, and coagulation parameters are within normal limits.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Polyclonal fab antivenom is a collection of immunoglobulin fragments from the plasma of venom-inoculated animals (eg, horses). Because the antivenom contains foreign proteins, exposure triggers the adaptive immune response to form high-affinity IgG antibodies against the foreign components of the antivenom. This typically takes 1-2 weeks due to time lag between antigen processing, antigen presentation, CD4 T-lymphocyte activation, and T-cell-mediated B-cell activation/differentiation.\n\nOnce formed, IgG then binds to the free-circulating antivenom, which creates immune complexes (ICs). The Fc portion of the IgG triggers clearance of the ICs by activating the classical complement system and by directly binding to the Fc receptor on mononuclear phagocytes in the reticuloendothelial system. Clearance of ICs generally proceeds without issue when there is minimal antigen because the phagocytic system has a large capacity.\n\nHowever, the administration of multiple antivenom doses can overwhelm the phagocytic system, leading to the aggregation of ICs in the bloodstream. Aggregated ICs then deposit in tissue (eg, skin, joints), activate the complement cascade, and cause a type II hypersensitivity reaction called serum sickness. Serum sickness generally presents with fever, urticarial rash, and arthralgia 1-2 weeks after exposure to nonhuman proteins in antivenom, antitoxins, monoclonal antibodies, or vaccinations. Most cases resolve spontaneously over several days as the ICs are cleared.\n\n(Choices A and D) Antivenom administration can cause IgE antibodies to form against the nonhuman portions of the protein, which then triggers a type I hypersensitivity reaction upon reexposure. Although these reactions often cause urticaria due to mast cell degranulation, symptoms typically arise within seconds or minutes of reexposure, not a week or two after initial exposure.\n\n(Choice B) Superantigens directly activate polyclonal populations of T cells, leading to acute-onset fever, hypotension, sunburn-like rash, and organ failure. Fab fragments in antivenom are unlikely to activate T cells directly; they are processed by antigen-presenting cells and lead to the generation of antibodies.\n\n(Choice C) The phagocytic Fc receptor can only bind antivenom that has bound IgG or IgM antibody. Unbound antivenom cannot attach to phagocytic receptors.\n\nEducational objective:\nSerum sickness is an immune complex-mediated type III hypersensitivity reaction that occurs 1-2 weeks after exposure to nonhuman protein in antitoxins (eg, antivenom), monoclonal antibodies (eg, rituximab), or vaccines (eg, rabies antigens). Deposition of immune complexes in tissue leads to complement activation and subsequent self-limited fever, arthralgia, and urticarial rash.",
    "zh": "多克隆Fab抗蛇毒血清是提取自接种蛇毒动物（如马）血浆中的免疫球蛋白片段的集合。由于抗蛇毒血清含有外源蛋白，因此接触后会触发适应性免疫反应，从而产生针对抗蛇毒血清外源成分的高亲和力IgG抗体。这通常需要1-2周，因为抗原处理、抗原呈递、CD4 T淋巴细胞激活以及T细胞介导的B细胞激活/分化之间存在时间滞后。\n\n一旦形成，IgG就会与循环中的游离抗蛇毒血清结合，从而产生免疫复合物 (ICs)。IgG的Fc段通过激活经典补体系统，以及直接与单核吞噬细胞（位于网状内皮系统）上的Fc受体结合，从而触发ICs的清除。当抗原量最小时，ICs的清除通常进行顺利，因为吞噬系统具有很大的容量。\n\n然而，多次给予抗蛇毒血清剂量可能会使吞噬系统不堪重负，从而导致ICs在血流中聚集。聚集的ICs然后沉积在组织（如皮肤、关节）中，激活补体级联反应，并引起一种称为血清病的III型超敏反应。血清病通常在接触抗蛇毒血清、抗毒素、单克隆抗体或疫苗中的非人类蛋白1-2周后出现发热、荨麻疹和关节痛。大多数病例会在几天内自发缓解，因为ICs被清除。\n\n（选项A和D）抗蛇毒血清的给药可导致IgE抗体形成，以对抗蛋白质的非人类部分，然后在再次接触时触发I型超敏反应。尽管这些反应通常会因肥大细胞脱颗粒而引起荨麻疹，但症状通常在再次接触后的几秒钟或几分钟内出现，而不是在首次接触后的一两周。\n\n（选项B）超抗原直接激活T细胞多克隆群体，导致急性发热、低血压、晒伤样皮疹和器官衰竭。抗蛇毒血清中的Fab片段不太可能直接激活T细胞；它们由抗原呈递细胞处理，并导致抗体的产生。\n\n（选项C）吞噬Fc受体只能结合已结合IgG或IgM抗体的抗蛇毒血清。未结合的抗蛇毒血清不能附着在吞噬受体上。\n\n教育目标：\n血清病是一种免疫复合物介导的III型超敏反应，发生在接触抗毒素（如抗蛇毒血清）、单克隆抗体（如利妥昔单抗）或疫苗（如狂犬病抗原）中的非人类蛋白1-2周后。免疫复合物在组织中的沉积导致补体激活，进而引起自限性发热、关节痛和荨麻疹。"

It assesses the ability to recognize the clinical presentation and understand the underlying mechanism of this delayed hypersensitivity reaction.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the timeline of symptom onset (1-2 weeks after exposure), the clinical features (fever, rash, arthralgia), and the patient's history of antivenom administration.
