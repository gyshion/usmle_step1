    "en": "A 14-year-old girl is brought to the office due to a bump on her chest just below the right breast. The bump has been there as long as she can remember, but it became a little larger 2-3 years ago. The bump also becomes tender just before her menses start. Menarche was at age 12. Menses occur every 28 days and last 4-5 days. Examination shows Tanner stage 5 breasts. Both breasts and axillae appear normal. There is a soft, raised, hyperpigmented, 0.5-cm nontender lesion inferior to the right breast {{exhibit_1}}. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?",
    "zh": "一名14岁女孩因胸部右侧乳房下方出现肿块就诊。据她回忆，这个肿块一直存在，但在2-3年前稍微变大。肿块在月经来潮前也会变得触痛。初潮年龄为12岁。月经周期为28天，持续4-5天。检查显示Tanner分期为5期乳房。双侧乳房和腋窝外观正常。右侧乳房下方可见一个柔软的、隆起的、色素沉着的、0.5厘米大小的无压痛病灶{{exhibit_1}}。以下哪项最可能是该患者表现的原因？"

    "en": "This patient's hyperpigmented papule that is inferior to the breast and becomes tender before menses is most likely an ACCESSORY NIPPLE (ie, polythelia, supernumerary nipple). See image {{exhibit_2}}.\n\nIn utero, the breasts develop from the MAMMARY RIDGE (milk line), which is an ectodermal thickening that initially extends from the AXILLA to the MEDIAL THIGH bilaterally; the remainder of the mammary ridge subsequently regresses in early gestation. Incomplete involution of the mammary ridge results in an accessory nipple (sometimes with associated glandular tissue) anywhere along this ridge. The most common location of an accessory nipple is inferior to the breast, as seen in this patient.\n\nAccessory nipples are usually asymptomatic, well-circumscribed, hyperpigmented papules. They may become larger during puberty, before menses, or with pregnancy/lactation due to rising ESTROGEN and PROGESTERONE (similar to physiologic changes in normal breast tissue). Associated glandular tissue may also become tender or swollen, as seen in this patient. The diagnosis is clinical, and no treatment is generally required.\n\n(Choice A) A lipoma is a benign tumor characterized by adipocyte proliferation within a fibrous capsule. It typically presents as a soft, painless, subcutaneous nodule with normal overlying epidermis. This patient's hyperpigmentation and tenderness make this diagnosis unlikely.\n\n(Choice B) A congenital melanocytic nevus is a clonal proliferation of benign melanocytes presenting as hyperpigmentation that is well-demarcated and may be flat or raised. However, a congenital melanocytic nevus would be painless; premenstrual swelling/tenderness is more characteristic of accessory breast tissue.\n\n(Choice D) An acrochordon (skin tag) is a pedunculated outgrowth of normal skin that often develops near skinfolds (eg, axilla, beneath breasts) due to friction. Hyperpigmentation with tenderness before menstruation would not be seen.\n\n(Choice E) An ephelis (freckle) is a hyperpigmented macule that occurs due to sunlight-induced production of melanin by melanocytes. An isolated lesion beneath the breast (not sun-exposed) is atypical, and freckles are not raised or tender.\n\nEducational objective:\nIncomplete involution of the mammary ridge during fetal development can lead to an accessory nipple, a well-circumscribed, hyperpigmented papule located anywhere from the axilla to the thigh. Similar to hormone-induced changes in normal breast tissue (eg, due to puberty/menses), they may grow larger and become tender/swollen. See diagram {{exhibit_3}}; {{exhibit_4}}; {{exhibit_5}}.",
    "zh": "该患者乳房下方出现的色素沉着丘疹，并且在月经来潮前出现触痛，最有可能是一种副乳头（即多乳头、多余乳头）。见图{{exhibit_2}}。\n\n在子宫内，乳房由乳腺嵴（乳线）发育而来，乳腺嵴是一种外胚层增厚，最初双侧从腋窝延伸到大腿内侧；乳腺嵴的其余部分随后在妊娠早期退化。乳腺嵴的不完全退化会导致副乳头（有时伴有相关腺体组织）出现在该嵴的任何位置。副乳头最常见的部位是乳房下方，如该患者所示。\n\n副乳头通常无症状，为边界清楚的、色素沉着的丘疹。它们可能会在青春期、月经来潮前或怀孕/哺乳期间由于雌激素和孕酮水平升高而增大（类似于正常乳腺组织的生理变化）。相关腺体组织也可能变得触痛或肿胀，如该患者所示。诊断为临床诊断，通常不需要治疗。\n\n（选项A）脂肪瘤是一种良性肿瘤，其特征是脂肪细胞在纤维包膜内增生。它通常表现为柔软、无痛的皮下结节，表面覆盖正常的表皮。该患者的色素沉着和触痛使该诊断不太可能。\n\n（选项B）先天性黑色素细胞痣是良性黑色素细胞的克隆增生，表现为界限清楚的色素沉着，可能呈扁平或隆起。然而，先天性黑色素细胞痣是无痛的；经前肿胀/触痛是副乳腺组织的特征。\n\n（选项D）软纤维瘤（皮赘）是正常皮肤的蒂状生长，通常由于摩擦而发生在皮肤褶皱附近（例如，腋窝、乳房下方）。不会出现经前色素沉着并伴有触痛的情况。\n\n（选项E）雀斑是一种色素沉着的斑点，是由于黑色素细胞产生黑色素而引起的。乳房下方的孤立病变（未暴露于阳光下）是不典型的，并且雀斑不会隆起或触痛。\n\n教育目标：\n胎儿发育期间乳腺嵴的不完全退化可导致副乳头，这是一种边界清楚、色素沉着的丘疹，位于从腋窝到大腿的任何位置。类似于激素诱导的正常乳腺组织的变化（例如，由于青春期/月经），它们可能会增大并变得触痛/肿胀。见图{{exhibit_3}}；{{exhibit_4}}；{{exhibit_5}}。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the embryologic development of the breast and the etiology of accessory nipples (polythelia). It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of an accessory nipple and understanding its origin from incomplete involution of the mammary ridge. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the location and characteristics of the lesion (inferior to the breast, hyperpigmented, tender before menses) and associating it with the embryologic origin of the mammary ridge. Ruling out other common skin lesions based on their typical presentation is also important.",
    "zh": "本题考察对乳房胚胎发育的认识以及副乳头（多乳头）的病因学。它需要识别副乳头的临床表现，并了解其起源于乳腺嵴的不完全退化。\n\n解决此问题的关键是识别病变的部位和特征（乳房下方、色素沉着、经前触痛），并将其与乳腺嵴的胚胎学起源联系起来。根据其他常见皮肤病变的典型表现来排除它们也很重要。"
