    "en": "A 37-year-old woman comes to the office due to right-sided abdominal discomfort that has been getting progressively worse over the past few weeks. She has not had any nausea or vomiting. The patient's family moved to the United States from rural Kazakhstan when she was a child. The patient has no drug allergies. She does not use tobacco or alcohol. She has a dog at home. Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F). Physical examination is notable for hepatomegaly. Ultrasound reveals a large liver mass with cystic lesions. During surgery to resect the mass, the patient suffers from a procedural complication and dies. At the family's request, an autopsy is performed. A cut section of a portion of the mass is shown in the image below.",
    "zh": "一名37岁的女性因右侧腹部不适前来就诊，过去几周来，不适感逐渐加重。她没有出现恶心或呕吐。患者的家人在她小时候从哈萨克斯坦农村搬到了美国。患者无药物过敏史。她不吸烟也不喝酒。她在家里养了一只狗。体温36.7摄氏度（98.1华氏度）。体格检查显示肝肿大。超声显示肝脏内有一个大的肿块伴有囊性病变。在切除肿块的手术过程中，患者出现手术并发症并死亡。应家属要求，进行了尸检。以下图片显示了该肿块的一部分切面。"

    "en": "The tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus is the most common cause of hydatid cysts. Most cases occur in individuals from endemic regions (eg, eastern Mediterranean, Middle East, South America, sub-Saharan Africa, former Soviet Union, western China) or those residing in the southwestern United States with sheep and dog (participate in the tapeworm life cycle) exposure. Initial infection is generally asymptomatic, with subsequent manifestations depending on cyst location and size. The liver is often affected (leading to hepatomegaly or right upper quadrant pain), but other organs such as the lungs or muscles can be involved. Unilocular lesions are typical of E granulosus, and multilocular lesions are typical of E multilocularis. \n\nWhen infection occurs, echinococcal larvae implant within the capillaries, triggering an inflammatory reaction involving monocytes and eosinophils. Some larvae encyst. Microscopic examination demonstrates an encapsulated and calcified cyst (\"eggshell calcification\") containing fluid and budding cells that will eventually become daughter cysts. The outer wall is composed of gelatinous sheets surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule. Imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI) and serology testing can be used for diagnosis. \n\nDepending on the size of the cyst, surgery and adjunctive chemotherapy (eg, albendazole) are the treatment of choice for symptomatic patients. Cyst manipulation (eg, surgery, aspiration) should be performed with caution, as spilling of cyst contents can cause ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK, which likely occurred in this patient.\n\n(Choices B, C, D, and E) Fulminant liver failure can arise due to numerous conditions, including viral hepatitis, acetaminophen toxicity, idiosyncratic drug reactions, or Wilson disease. Hypovolemia is typically caused by severe blood loss, although excessive loss of other bodily fluids (eg, diarrhea, vomiting, burns, dehydration) may also be responsible. Pulmonary emboli are typically caused by the propagation of venous thrombi, with less common sources including air bubbles, fat droplets, amniotic fluid, or clumps of malignant cells. Overwhelming systemic infection with bacterial organisms can cause septic shock (hypotension, low blood flow). None of these conditions is typically associated with hydatid cysts.",
    "zh": "包虫绦虫（Echinococcus granulosus）是引起包虫囊肿最常见的原因。大多数病例发生在来自流行地区的个体（例如，东地中海地区、中东、南美洲、撒哈拉以南非洲、前苏联、中国西部）或居住在美国西南部且接触过绵羊和狗（参与绦虫生命周期）的人群中。初始感染通常无症状，随后的表现取决于囊肿的位置和大小。肝脏常受累（导致肝肿大或右上腹疼痛），但其他器官如肺或肌肉也可能受累。单房性病变是E granulosus的典型表现，而多房性病变是E multilocularis的典型表现。\n\n当发生感染时，棘球蚴幼虫植入毛细血管内，引发涉及单核细胞和嗜酸性粒细胞的炎症反应。一些幼虫包囊。显微镜检查显示一个包膜和钙化的囊肿（“蛋壳样钙化”），其中含有液体和芽生细胞，这些细胞最终会变成子囊。外壁由凝胶状薄片组成，周围环绕着厚的纤维囊。影像学检查（超声、CT、MRI）和血清学检测可用于诊断。\n\n根据囊肿的大小，手术和辅助化疗（例如，阿苯达唑）是针对有症状患者的首选治疗方法。囊肿操作（例如，手术、抽吸）应谨慎进行，因为囊肿内容物溢出可能导致过敏性休克，这很可能发生在患者身上。\n\n（选项B、C、D和E）暴发性肝衰竭可能由多种情况引起，包括病毒性肝炎、对乙酰氨基酚毒性、特异性药物反应或威尔逊病。血容量过低通常由严重的失血引起，尽管其他体液过度流失（例如，腹泻、呕吐、烧伤、脱水）也可能是原因。肺栓塞通常由静脉血栓的蔓延引起，不太常见的来源包括气泡、脂肪滴、羊水或恶性细胞团。细菌引起的压倒性全身感染可导致感染性休克（低血压、低血流）。这些情况通常与包虫囊肿无关。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Echinococcus granulosus infection (hydatid cysts) and the risk of anaphylaxis during cyst manipulation. It assesses understanding of the geographic distribution, clinical presentation, and potential complications of this parasitic infection.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's origin from an endemic region, the presence of liver cysts, and the procedural complication during surgery.
