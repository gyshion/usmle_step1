    "en": "The above tracing demonstrates the action potential of cardiac pacemaker cells in cardiac slow-response tissues such as the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes. The pacemaker action potential includes the following phases:\n\n*   Phase 4 (spontaneous depolarization) begins after hyperpolarization triggers the opening of HCN channels that allow slow influx of Na+ (\"funny current\"). T-type (transient) Ca2+ channels then open once the membrane potential becomes more positive, allowing Ca2+ influx to contribute to depolarization. As the pacemaker cell approaches threshold, L-type (long-lasting) Ca2+ channels begin to open, which further increases Ca2+ influx and significantly decreases the time until threshold is reached.\n*   Phase 0 (upstroke) is characterized by continued opening of L-type Ca2+ channels. In cardiac slow-response tissues, the action potential upstroke is much slower and transitions gradually from phase 4 due to the relatively slow influx of Ca2+ into the cell.\n*   Phase 3 (repolarization) is characterized by the opening of K+ channels and efflux of K- from the cell in conjunction with the closure of L-type Ca2+ channels.\n\nThis patient's anxiety-provoked episodes of sudden-onset palpitations associated with lightheadedness and shortness of breath are consistent with PAROXYSMAL SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA. Class IV antiarrhythmics (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) are commonly used to prevent recurrent nodal tachyarrhythmias such as PSVT. They work by blocking L-type calcium channels in cardiac slow-response tissues, which causes slowing of phase 4 depolarization and reduced conduction velocity in the SA and AV nodes.\n\n(Choice A) Verapamil decreases the amount of intracellular calcium available for excitation-contraction coupling within cardiac myocytes. This reduces myocardial contractility, which can be harmful in patients with impaired ventricular function. However, the tracing shown in the question stem corresponds to pacemaker action potentials, not cardiac myocyte action potentials.\n\n(Choices B and C) The threshold potential refers to the amount of depolarization required to initiate an action potential. Class I (sodium channel blockers) and class IV (calcium channel blockers) antiarrhythmics raise the threshold potential of cardiac fast- and slow-response tissues, respectively, by blocking the channels that trigger an action potential. This effect also results in reduced action potential amplitude, decreased upslope, and reduced impulse conduction speed within the respective tissues.\n\n(Choice D) Verapamil's calcium blocking activity reduces the action potential duration in nodal tissues, but it also increases the refractory period by slowing the recovery of inactivated calcium channels. Class IA (eg, quinidine) and class III (eg, amiodarone) antiarrhythmics also increase the refractory period by blocking potassium channels and prolonging repolarization.\n\nEducational objective:\nClass IV antiarrhythmics (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) are commonly used to prevent recurrent nodal arrhythmias (eg, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia). They work by blocking calcium channels in slow-response cardiac tissues, slowing phase 4 (spontaneous depolarization) and phase 0 (upstroke). This reduces impulse conduction velocity in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "上述描记图显示了心脏慢反应组织（如窦房结（SA）和房室结（AV）结）中起搏细胞的动作电位。起搏细胞动作电位包括以下几个阶段：\n\n*   第4期（自发去极化）在超极化触发HCN通道开放后开始，HCN通道允许Na+缓慢内流（“funny current”）。然后，当膜电位变得更正时，T型（瞬时）Ca2+通道开放，允许Ca2+内流促成去极化。当起搏细胞接近阈值时，L型（长时程）Ca2+通道开始开放，这进一步增加了Ca2+内流，并显著缩短了达到阈值的时间。\n*   第0期（上冲）的特征是L型Ca2+通道持续开放。在心脏慢反应组织中，由于Ca2+缓慢内流到细胞中，动作电位的上冲非常缓慢，并逐渐从第4期过渡。\n*   第3期（复极化）的特征是K+通道开放，K-从细胞中外流，同时L型Ca2+通道关闭。\n\n该患者焦虑诱发的伴有头昏和呼吸急促的突发性心悸发作，与阵发性室上性心动过速（PSVT）一致。IV类抗心律失常药（如维拉帕米、地尔硫卓）常用于预防复发性结性心动过速，如PSVT。它们通过阻断心脏慢反应组织中的L型钙通道发挥作用，导致第4期去极化减慢，并降低SA结和AV结的传导速度。\n\n(选项A) 维拉帕米减少了心肌细胞中可用于兴奋-收缩偶联的细胞内钙的量。这会降低心肌收缩力，这对于室功能受损的患者可能有害。然而，试题中显示的描记图对应于起搏细胞动作电位，而不是心肌细胞动作电位。\n\n(选项B和C) 阈电位是指启动动作电位所需的去极化量。I类（钠通道阻滞剂）和IV类（钙通道阻滞剂）抗心律失常药通过阻断触发动作电位的通道，分别提高心脏快反应和慢反应组织的阈电位。这种作用也会导致动作电位幅度降低、上升斜率降低以及相关组织内的冲动传导速度降低。\n\n(选项D) 维拉帕米的钙阻滞活性降低了结性组织中动作电位的持续时间，但它也通过减缓失活钙通道的恢复来增加不应期。IA类（如奎尼丁）和III类（如胺碘酮）抗心律失常药也通过阻断钾通道并延长复极化来增加不应期。\n\n教育目标：\nIV类抗心律失常药（如维拉帕米、地尔硫卓）常用于预防复发性结性心律失常（如阵发性室上性心动过速）。它们通过阻断心脏慢反应组织中的钙通道发挥作用，减缓第4期（自发去极化）和第0期（上冲）。这降低了窦房结和房室结的冲动传导速度。{{exhibit_2}}"
