    "en": "An 18-year-old man is brought to the clinic by his mother due to increasingly bizarre behavior over the past 2 months. The patient is in his first semester at an out-of-state college and has had difficulty adjusting to being away from home. For the past few weeks, he has not been attending classes, and he no longer socializes with friends. The patient spends most of his time alone in his dorm room and eats very little because he believes the cafeteria food is poisoned. He has no significant medical or psychiatric history and does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Physical examination is unremarkable. On mental status examination, he appears disheveled with unwashed hair, makes poor eye contact, and shouts \"leave me alone\" in response to unseen people.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's 2-month history of progressive bizarre behavior, including paranoid ideation (believing cafeteria food is poisoned) and auditory hallucinations (responding to unseen people), along with social withdrawal and poor hygiene, is highly suggestive of a psychotic disorder. The duration of symptoms (2 months) is critical in differentiating between several psychotic disorders.\n\n(Choice F) SCHIZOPHRENIFORM DISORDER is characterized by psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior, negative symptoms) lasting for at least 1 month but less than 6 months. Functional decline is often present but not required for diagnosis. This patient's symptom duration of 2 months fits this criterion.\n\n(Choice A) Adjustment disorder is characterized by increased anxiety, depressive symptoms, and/or disruptive behavior that develops within 3 months of an identifiable stressor and lasts no more than 6 months after the stressor ends. Symptoms of acute psychosis are not present in patients with adjustment disorder.\n\n(Choices B and E) The patient's symptom duration of 2 months rules out brief psychotic disorder (symptoms last at least 1 day but <1 month, with full return to premorbid functioning) and schizophrenia (requires symptoms for at least 6 months, including prodromal & residual periods, and functional decline).\n\n(Choice C) Delusional disorder involves at least 1 delusion and at least 1 month of duration, with no other psychotic symptoms. This patient has hallucinations and disorganized behavior, which are not typical of delusional disorder.\n\n(Choice D) While the patient exhibits social withdrawal and appetite disturbance, these are not sufficient to diagnose major depressive disorder with psychotic features. The primary symptoms are psychotic in nature and the duration points away from a primary depressive disorder.\n\nEducational objective: SCHIZOPHRENIFORM DISORDER is characterized by psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior, negative symptoms) lasting $\\ge$1 month and <6 months.",
    "zh": "该患者有2个月的进行性怪异行为病史，包括偏执观念（认为自助餐厅的食物被下毒）和幻听（对看不见的人作出反应），以及社交退缩和个人卫生差，这些都高度提示精神病性障碍。症状的持续时间（2个月）对于区分几种精神病性障碍至关重要。\n\n（选项 F） 精神分裂症样障碍的特征是精神病性症状（妄想、幻觉、言语和行为紊乱、阴性症状）持续至少1个月但少于6个月。功能衰退通常存在，但不是诊断所必需的。该患者的症状持续时间为2个月，符合这一标准。\n\n（选项 A） 适应障碍的特征是焦虑增加、抑郁症状和/或破坏性行为，这些症状在可识别的应激源的3个月内出现，并且在应激源结束后的6个月内结束。患有适应障碍的患者不存在急性精神病的症状。\n\n（选项 B 和 E） 患者的症状持续时间为2个月，排除了短暂精神病性障碍（症状持续至少1天但<1个月，完全恢复到发病前功能）和精神分裂症（需要症状至少6个月，包括前驱期和残留期，以及功能衰退）。\n\n（选项 C） 妄想障碍涉及至少1个妄想，且持续至少1个月，无其他精神病性症状。该患者有幻觉和行为紊乱，这并非妄想障碍的典型症状。\n\n（选项 D） 虽然该患者表现出社交退缩和食欲不振，但这不足以诊断为伴有精神病性特征的重度抑郁症。主要症状是精神病性的，并且持续时间指向远离原发性抑郁症。\n\n教育目标：精神分裂症样障碍的特征是精神病性症状（妄想、幻觉、言语和行为紊乱、阴性症状）持续$\\ge$1个月且<6个月。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to differentiate between various DSM-5 psychotic disorders based on the duration of symptoms and the specific symptom presentation. It requires understanding the diagnostic criteria for disorders such as schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, brief psychotic disorder, delusional disorder, and adjustment disorder.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully evaluating the timeline of the patient's symptoms, noting the presence and nature of psychotic features (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized behavior), and considering the impact on functioning. By comparing these findings to the diagnostic criteria for each differential diagnosis, the most likely diagnosis can be identified.",
