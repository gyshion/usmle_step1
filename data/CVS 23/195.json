    "en": "A 78-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to a 3-day history of intermittent but progressive substernal chest pain. Medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but the patient has had poor adherence with her medication and outpatient follow-up. She has a 30 pack-year smoking history. On admission, ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm with ST-segment elevation and pathologic Q waves in leads I, aVL, and V2 to V5. The patient refuses percutaneous coronary intervention and is treated medically. On the fifth day of hospitalization, she experiences severe dyspnea, sweating, and hypotension. Physical examination shows raised jugular venous pressure, no heart murmurs, and clear lungs. She rapidly loses consciousness and becomes pulseless, and the subsequent resuscitation attempt is ineffective. Which of the following most likely contributed to this patient's death?",

    "en": "This patient was initially admitted with chest pain and ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral ECG leads, findings consistent with an ST-ELEVATION myocardial infarction (MI) of the left ventricle. Several days later, her abrupt-onset dyspnea and hypotension were most likely due to left ventricular (LV) free wall rupture, a potential mechanical complication of transmural MI. \n\nLV free wall rupture usually occurs within 5 days but can occur up to 2 weeks following MI. During this time, the infarcted myocardial wall is substantially weakened by coagulative necrosis, leukocyte infiltration, and enzymatic lysis of myocardial connective tissue and may be unable to withstand the shear stress generated by the high-pressure left ventricle. Delayed reperfusion (or absent reperfusion as in this patient), increases myocardial damage, further weakening the LV wall and increasing the risk of rupture. \n\nWith LV rupture, blood abruptly fills the pericardial space, resulting in hemopericardium and acute cardiac tamponade with rapidly increased intrapericardial pressure. At onset, patients may experience dyspnea, diaphoresis, and sometimes chest discomfort. Diastolic filling of the relatively low-pressure right-sided heart chambers is abruptly restricted (causing jugular venous distension), and blood flow through the pulmonary circulation to the left side of the heart drops precipitously (the lungs remain clear). Cardiac output profoundly decreases, resulting in hypotension and obstructive shock that rapidly leads to cardiac arrest. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices B and D) Papillary muscle rupture, causing acute mitral regurgitation, and interventricular septum rupture, causing a ventricular septal defect, can occur acutely or within 5 days of MI. Both defects typically cause a new holosystolic murmur and lead to LV failure with pulmonary edema. Cardiogenic shock with hypotension commonly develops, but lung crackles would be expected on examination. \n\n(Choice C) Ischemic reperfusion injury can occur when blood flow is abruptly restored to infarcted myocardium, and it may rarely lead to cardiac arrest (via precipitation of ventricular fibrillation or profound myocardial contractile dysfunction). However, it is extremely unlikely in this patient who received no reperfusion therapy. \n\n(Choice E) LV aneurysm formation is typically a delayed mechanical complication of MI, occurring after several weeks or months. Patients typically develop gradually progressive heart failure or angina. \n\nEducational objective: \nLeft ventricular free wall rupture is a mechanical complication that can occur within 5 days or up to 2 weeks following transmural (ST-elevation) myocardial infarction. Patients usually develop acute cardiac tamponade with hypotension and obstructive shock that rapidly leads to cardiac arrest. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者最初因胸痛和前外侧心电图导联ST段抬高入院，这些发现与左心室ST段抬高型心肌梗死（MI）一致。几天后，她突然发作的呼吸困难和低血压很可能是由于左心室（LV）游离壁破裂，这是透壁性心肌梗死的潜在机械并发症。\n\n左心室游离壁破裂通常发生在5天内，但也可发生在心肌梗死后长达2周的时间内。在此期间，梗死心肌壁因凝固性坏死、白细胞浸润以及心肌结缔组织的酶解而大大减弱，可能无法承受由高压左心室产生的剪切应力。延迟再灌注（或像该患者这样没有再灌注）会增加心肌损伤，进一步削弱左心室壁并增加破裂的风险。\n\n发生左心室破裂时，血液突然充满心包腔，导致心包积血和急性心脏压塞，并迅速增加心包内压力。发病时，患者可能会出现呼吸困难、出汗，有时会出现胸部不适。相对低压的右侧心脏腔室的舒张期充盈突然受限（导致颈静脉扩张），通过肺循环到心脏左侧的血流量急剧下降（肺部保持清晰）。心输出量急剧下降，导致低血压和梗阻性休克，迅速导致心脏骤停。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项B和D）乳头肌断裂导致急性二尖瓣返流，室间隔破裂导致室间隔缺损，可发生在心肌梗死后急性期或5天内。这两种缺陷通常会导致新的全收缩期杂音，并导致左心衰竭伴肺水肿。通常会发生心源性休克伴低血压，但检查时应出现肺部啰音。\n\n（选项C）当血流突然恢复到梗死心肌时，会发生缺血再灌注损伤，并可能极少导致心脏骤停（通过诱发室颤或严重的心肌收缩功能障碍）。然而，对于未接受再灌注治疗的患者来说，这种情况极不可能发生。\n\n（选项E）左心室动脉瘤形成通常是心肌梗死的延迟机械并发症，发生在数周或数月后。患者通常会逐渐出现进行性心力衰竭或心绞痛。\n\n教学目标：\n左心室游离壁破裂是一种机械并发症，可发生在透壁性（ST段抬高）心肌梗死后5天内或长达2周。患者通常会发生急性心脏压塞，伴有低血压和梗阻性休克，迅速导致心脏骤停。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanical complications of myocardial infarction, specifically left ventricular free wall rupture leading to cardiac tamponade. It assesses the ability to recognize the clinical presentation and time course of this life-threatening complication. \n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's recent myocardial infarction, the sudden onset of dyspnea and hypotension, and the physical exam findings of jugular venous distension and clear lungs.
