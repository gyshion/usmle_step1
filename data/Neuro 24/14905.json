    "en": "A 42-year-old woman is brought to the office due to 2 weeks of personality changes. Her family reports that she has become withdrawn and does not talk as much as before. She has also had difficulty picking things up with her right hand. The patient has HIV infection and does not take her antiretroviral therapy consistently. She is a former smoker and used injection drugs in the past. The patient works in a food-processing facility and has not traveled recently. {{exhibit_1}} Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 126/78 mm Hg, pulse is 82/min, and respirations are 14/min. The patient is oriented to time, place, and person but is slow to respond to questions. Motor strength is decreased in her right upper extremity, with an exaggerated biceps reflex. CD4 count is 78 cells/mm³ and plasma HIV RNA is 400,000 copies/mL. CT scan of the head shows a small hypodense area in the left frontal lobe with ring enhancement after intravenous contrast administration. {{exhibit_2}} Two similar lesions are present in the basal ganglia and cerebellum. The infectious agent directly responsible for this patient's neurologic lesions is most likely transmitted by which of the following mechanisms?",
    "zh": "一名42岁女性因两周的性格改变被带到诊室。她的家人报告说她变得孤僻，不像以前那样多说话了。她还发现右手很难拿东西。该患者患有HIV感染，并且没有持续服用抗逆转录病毒疗法。她以前吸烟，过去使用过注射毒品。该患者在食品加工厂工作，最近没有旅行过。{{exhibit_1}} 体温37摄氏度（98.6华氏度），血压126/78 mmHg，脉搏82次/分钟，呼吸14次/分钟。患者对时间、地点和人物有定向力，但对问题的反应很慢。右侧上肢的运动力量减弱，肱二头肌反射亢进。CD4计数为78个细胞/mm³，血浆HIV RNA为400,000拷贝/mL。头部CT扫描显示左额叶有一个小的低密度区域，静脉注射对比剂后出现环形增强。{{exhibit_2}} 基底节和脑干中有两个类似的病灶。直接导致该患者神经系统病变的感染原最有可能通过以下哪种机制传播？"

    "en": "This patient with untreated AIDS has neurologic manifestations and multiple ring-enhancing brain lesions, raising strong suspicion for toxoplasmic encephalitis. The underlying pathogen is *Toxoplasma gondii*, an obligate intracellular parasite whose definitive host is cats. Transmission occurs when individuals come into contact with contaminated cat feces (eg, litter box or cat handling) and subsequently ingest oocytes or when patients ingest undercooked meat from an intermediate host (eg, pig, sheep). Healthy individuals rapidly contain the infection via a cell-mediated immune response and rarely develop clinical symptoms. However, latent infection is established (tissue cysts), and reactivation can occur in the setting of immuncompromise (eg, advanced AIDS). The most common manifestation of reactivation is toxoplasmic encephalitis, which is characterized by progressive headache, confusion, focal neurologic deficits, and/or seizure. Brain imaging classically shows multiple ring-enhancing lesions. (Choice A) Mosquito bites can transmit viral pathogens (eg, West Nile, Zika) that can cause encephalitis. Patients may present with slowly worsening headache, confusion, seizure, or focal neurologic findings. However, viral pathogens do not typically cause ring-enhancing brain lesions. (Choice B) Herpes virus type 1 is typically transmitted by close contact (eg, kissing) with an infected patient who has active lesions. Although this is the most common cause of sporadic encephalitis, imaging usually shows inflammation in the temporal lobe with edema and mass effect. (Choice D) *Cryptococcus neoformans*, a fungus found in soil contaminated by bird (especially pigeon) droppings, is a common cause of meningoencephalitis in patients with untreated AIDS and usually presents with slowly worsening fever, malaise, and headache. However, ring enhancing lesions are not typically seen. (Choice E) *Bartonella henselae* is a gram-negative bacterium transmitted to humans during a cat scratch. Healthy individuals can subsequently develop cat-scratch disease (regional lymphadenopathy), but patients with advanced AIDS are at risk for the more serious clinical syndrome of bacillary angiomatosis (violaceous, highly vascular skin lesions with constitutional symptoms). However, central nervous system manifestations are uncommon. (Choice F) Syphilis can be transmitted by unprotected sexual intercourse, and patients with HIV are at greater risk for developing neurosyphilis. This often presents with confusion, meningeal symptoms (eg, stiff neck), eye abnormalities, and cranial nerve palsies. However, MRI of the brain usually shows leptomeningeal enhancement, not ring-enhancing lesions.",
    "zh": "该未经治疗的艾滋病患者出现神经系统表现和多个环形增强的脑病灶，强烈提示弓形虫脑炎。潜在病原体是*弓形虫*，这是一种专性细胞内寄生虫，其最终宿主是猫。当个体接触受污染的猫粪便（例如，猫砂盆或处理猫）并随后摄入卵母细胞，或者当患者摄入来自中间宿主（例如，猪、羊）的未煮熟的肉时，就会发生传播。健康个体通过细胞介导的免疫反应迅速控制感染，很少出现临床症状。然而，潜伏感染得以建立（组织囊肿），并且在免疫功能低下的情况下（例如，晚期艾滋病）可能发生再激活。再激活最常见的表现是弓形虫脑炎，其特征是进行性头痛、意识模糊、局灶性神经功能缺损和/或癫痫发作。脑部影像学检查通常显示多个环形增强病灶。(选项A) 蚊虫叮咬可以传播病毒病原体（例如，西尼罗河病毒、寨卡病毒），这些病毒可引起脑炎。患者可能表现为缓慢恶化的头痛、意识模糊、癫痫发作或局灶性神经系统表现。然而，病毒病原体通常不会引起环形增强的脑病灶。(选项B) 单纯疱疹病毒1型通常通过与患有活动性病变的感染患者密切接触（例如，接吻）传播。虽然这是散发性脑炎最常见的原因，但影像学检查通常显示颞叶炎症伴水肿和占位效应。(选项D) *新型隐球菌*是一种真菌，存在于被鸟类（尤其是鸽子）粪便污染的土壤中，是未经治疗的艾滋病患者脑膜脑炎的常见原因，通常表现为缓慢恶化的发烧、不适和头痛。然而，通常看不到环形增强病灶。(选项E) *汉赛巴尔通体*是一种革兰氏阴性细菌，在猫抓伤期间传播给人类。健康个体随后可能发展为猫抓病（区域性淋巴结病），但晚期艾滋病患者有发生杆菌性血管瘤病（紫蓝色、高度血管性皮肤病变伴有全身症状）的风险。然而，中枢神经系统表现并不常见。(选项F) 梅毒可以通过无保护性交传播，HIV感染者发生神经梅毒的风险更高。这通常表现为意识模糊、脑膜症状（例如，颈项强直）、眼部异常和脑神经麻痹。然而，脑部MRI通常显示脑膜软脑膜增强，而不是环形增强病灶。"
