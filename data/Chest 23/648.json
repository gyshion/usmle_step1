    "en": "A 69-year-old man comes to the office due to progressive pain beneath his right scapula and in his right arm for the last several months. He has taken over-the-counter analgesics, which provide short-term relief, but the pain has become more severe and awakens him at night. The pain is associated with numbness in his right forearm extending up to the tips of the fourth and fifth fingers. The patient has also had persistent nonproductive cough and lately has been coughing up streaks of blood. He has a history of hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and osteoarthritis. He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for more than 40 years but recently cut down to 4 or 5 cigarettes a day.",

    "en": "This patient with an extensive smoking history who now has hemoptysis and shoulder pain likely has lung cancer, which can be associated with symptoms due to local or distant spread. PANCOAST SYNDROME is caused by a tumor at the lung apex. Such tumors often arise in the SUPERIOR SULCUS (groove formed by the subclavian vessels). The apical location allows for extensive local tumor spread. Invasion of surrounding structures can cause the following:\n\n*   Shoulder pain radiating toward the axilla and scapula (most common presenting symptom). It occurs due to involvement of the lower brachial plexus. Other associated symptoms include arm paresthesia, weakness, and muscle atrophy.\n*   Horner syndrome occurs due to involvement of the cervical sympathetic ganglia. Symptoms include ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis.\n*   Upper extremity edema may be due to compression of subclavian vessels.\n*   Spinal cord compression and paraplegia can result from tumor extension into the intervertebral foramina.\n\n(Choice A) Squamous cell carcinoma is associated with parathyroid-related peptide secretion and hypercalcemia. Cushing syndrome and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion can accompany small cell carcinoma of the lung.\n\n(Choice B) Centrally located lung cancers (squamous cell and small cell carcinomas) frequently obstruct the main bronchi, producing dyspnea and cough. Airway obstruction would not cause shoulder pain or muscle atrophy.\n\n(Choice C) Anterior mediastinal masses include thymoma, teratoma, thyroid cancer, and (terrible) lymphoma (\"terrible Ts\"). They are less likely to lead to hemoptysis or brachial plexus involvement.\n\n(Choice D) Lung cancers are associated with a number of autoimmune syndromes, most commonly Lambert-Eaton (progressive proximal muscle weakness, often in the legs).\n\n(Choice E) Pericardial effusions are characterized by dyspnea, distended neck veins, distant heart sounds, and - particularly if tamponade is present - pulsus paradoxus (decrease in systolic blood pressure >10 mm Hg during inspiration).\n\n(Choice F) A pleural effusion can lead to dyspnea and irritate the mediastinal and diaphragmatic pleura, causing referred shoulder pain (via the phrenic nerve); however, it would not cause hemoptysis.\n\nEducational objective:\nTumors located in the lung apex (superior sulcus) are called Pancoast tumors. Invasion of surrounding structures can lead to ipsilateral Horner syndrome, rib destruction, atrophy of hand muscles, and pain in the distribution of C8, T1, and T2 nerve roots.",
    "zh": "这位有长期吸烟史，且出现咯血和肩痛的患者，很可能患有肺癌，这可能与局部或远处扩散引起的症状有关。PANCOAST综合征是由肺尖肿瘤引起的。这种肿瘤通常发生在肺上沟（锁骨下血管形成的沟）中。肺尖位置允许肿瘤广泛局部扩散。侵犯周围结构可引起以下情况：\n\n*   肩部疼痛向腋窝和肩胛骨放射（最常见的首发症状）。这是由于累及下臂丛神经所致。其他相关症状包括手臂感觉异常、无力和肌肉萎缩。\n*   Horner综合征是由于累及颈交感神经节所致。症状包括同侧眼睑下垂、瞳孔缩小和无汗症。\n*   上肢水肿可能是由于锁骨下血管受压所致。\n*   肿瘤延伸到椎间孔可导致脊髓压迫和截瘫。\n\n（选项A）鳞状细胞癌与甲状旁腺相关肽分泌和高钙血症有关。库欣综合征和抗利尿激素分泌不当综合征可伴发于小细胞肺癌。\n\n（选项B）位于肺中央的肺癌（鳞状细胞癌和小细胞癌）常阻塞主支气管，引起呼吸困难和咳嗽。气道阻塞不会引起肩痛或肌肉萎缩。\n\n（选项C）前纵隔肿块包括胸腺瘤、畸胎瘤、甲状腺癌和（可怕的）淋巴瘤（“可怕的Ts”）。它们不太可能导致咯血或臂丛神经受累。\n\n（选项D）肺癌与多种自身免疫综合征相关，最常见的是Lambert-Eaton综合征（进行性近端肌无力，常在腿部）。\n\n（选项E）心包积液的特征是呼吸困难、颈静脉怒张、心音遥远，特别是存在心包填塞时，出现奇脉（吸气时收缩压降低>10毫米汞柱）。\n\n（选项F）胸腔积液可导致呼吸困难，并刺激纵隔和膈肌胸膜，引起牵涉性肩痛（通过膈神经）；然而，它不会引起咯血。\n\n教育目标：\n位于肺尖（上沟）的肿瘤称为Pancoast肿瘤。侵犯周围结构可导致同侧Horner综合征、肋骨破坏、手部肌肉萎缩以及C8、T1和T2神经根分布区域的疼痛。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Pancoast tumors and their clinical presentation, specifically the symptoms arising from local invasion of structures in the superior sulcus. Key features include shoulder pain, Horner's syndrome, and neurological deficits in the upper extremity. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the constellation of symptoms (shoulder pain, arm numbness, hemoptysis) in a smoker and associate them with the anatomical location of a superior sulcus tumor. Rule out other causes of chest pain and hemoptysis based on their typical presentations.",
