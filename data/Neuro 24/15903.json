    "en": "A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to head trauma sustained during a boxing match. During the fight, he had a brief loss of consciousness after a hard hit to the right side of his face. He has a headache and muffled hearing in his right ear. On examination, the patient is alert and oriented. Palpation of the head does not reveal any step-offs. Cervical spine examination is normal. Otoscopic examination reveals hemotympanum in the right ear. This patient is at greatest risk for injury involving which of the following cranial nerves?",

    "en": "This patient who sustained trauma to the head now has hearing loss and hemotympanum, which is concerning for a temporal bone fracture. Contained within the temporal bone are many structures involved in hearing, including the external auditory canal, tympanic membrane, ossicular chain, cochlea, and vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII). Injury or disruption to any of these structures can cause hearing loss, as in this patient.\n\nThe temporal bone also contains the facial nerve (CN VII), which originates in the brainstem and then enters the temporal bone at the internal auditory meatus. It travels through the internal auditory canal with the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) and then takes a complicated route through the temporal bone itself, traveling near the otic capsule, through the middle ear, and then through the mastoid portion to exit at the stylomastoid foramen.\n\nBecause of its location, the facial nerve is at risk of injury in temporal bone fractures. Deficits can be diverse and significant because the facial nerve has many functions, including:\n\n*   Movement of the face, including eye closure\n*   Taste from the anterior 2/3 of the tongue\n*   Parasympathetic innervation of submandibular and lacrimal glands\n*   Sound dampening (due to innervation of the stapedius muscle)\n\n(Choice A) Axons of chemoreceptor cells make up the olfactory nerve (CN I) rootlets, which project through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. Acceleration-deceleration head injuries can lead to avulsion of the olfactory nerve rootlets, but this would not be associated with hearing loss or hemotympanum.\n\n(Choice B) The oculomotor nerve (CN III) exits the skull base from the superior orbital fissure and is at risk with trauma to the orbit or anterior face.\n\n(Choice C) The trigeminal nerve (CN V) divides into V1, V2, and V3, which exit the skull base from the superior orbital fissure, foramen rotundum, and foramen ovale, respectively, which are all located in the sphenoid bone. These branches are at risk with trauma to the orbit or anterior face.\n\n(Choice E) The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) exits the skull base through the hypoglossal canal of the occipital bone. It could be injured by fractures involving the occipital bone, but it is more commonly injured due to penetrating neck trauma.\n\nEducational objective: In addition to the hearing apparatus (eg, ossicles, cochlea, vestibulocochlear nerve), the temporal bone also contains the facial nerve, which can be injured in temporal bone fractures.",
    "zh": "这位遭受头部外伤的患者现在有听力丧失和鼓膜内积血，这提示颞骨骨折。颞骨内包含许多与听觉相关的结构，包括外耳道、鼓膜、听小骨链、耳蜗和前庭耳蜗神经（CN VIII）。这些结构的损伤或破坏都可能导致听力丧失，正如该患者一样。\n\n颞骨还包含面神经（CN VII），其起源于脑干，然后进入颞骨的内听道。它与前庭耳蜗神经（CN VIII）一起穿过内听道，然后通过颞骨本身，行经耳蜗囊附近，穿过中耳，然后穿过乳突部分，最后从茎乳孔穿出。\n\n由于其位置，面神经在颞骨骨折中存在损伤风险。由于面神经具有许多功能，其缺陷可能多种多样且意义重大，包括：\n\n*   面部运动，包括眼睑闭合\n*   舌前2/3的味觉\n*   下颌下腺和泪腺的副交感神经支配\n*   声音减弱（由于镫骨肌的神经支配）\n\n（选项 A）化学感受器细胞的轴突构成嗅神经（CN I）的根，这些根穿过筛骨的筛板。加速-减速头部损伤可导致嗅神经根撕裂，但这与听力丧失或鼓膜内积血无关。\n\n（选项 B）动眼神经（CN III）从眶上裂穿出颅底，并有眶或前脸部外伤的风险。\n\n（选项 C）三叉神经（CN V）分为 V1、V2 和 V3，分别从眶上裂、圆孔和卵圆孔穿出颅底，所有这些都位于蝶骨中。这些分支有眶或前脸部外伤的风险。\n\n（选项 E）舌下神经（CN XII）通过枕骨的舌下神经管穿出颅底。它可能因涉及枕骨的骨折而受伤，但更常见的是由于穿透性颈部外伤而受伤。\n\n教育目标：除了听觉系统（例如，听小骨、耳蜗、前庭耳蜗神经）外，颞骨还包含面神经，面神经可在颞骨骨折中受伤。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of cranial nerve anatomy and the potential for injury in the context of head trauma, specifically focusing on temporal bone fractures. It requires correlating clinical findings such as hemotympanum and hearing loss with the anatomical course of cranial nerves within the temporal bone.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the likely injury mechanism (temporal bone fracture) based on the patient's presentation. Then, recall the anatomical pathways of the cranial nerves, particularly those traversing the temporal bone, and determine which nerve is most vulnerable to injury in this region given the described symptoms.",
    "zh": "本题测试对脑神经解剖学的理解以及头部外伤（特别是颞骨骨折）背景下的潜在损伤。它需要将临床发现（如鼓膜内积血和听力丧失）与颞骨内脑神经的解剖学路径相关联。\n\n要解决这个问题，首先必须根据患者的症状确定可能的损伤机制（颞骨骨折）。然后，回忆脑神经的解剖学通路，特别是那些穿过颞骨的脑神经，并确定在给定的症状下，该区域最容易受到损伤的神经。"
