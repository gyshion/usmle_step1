    "en": "A 43-year-old woman comes to the office with a 1-month history of dull abdominal pain that occurs mainly after eating. The pain is localized to the right upper quadrant and is especially severe after fatty meals. Physical examination is unremarkable. Ultrasound of the abdomen reveals several mobile echogenic foci within the gallbladder lumen.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Removal of excess cholesterol from the body occurs via 2 mechanisms: excretion of free cholesterol into bile and conversion of cholesterol into bile acids. In the liver, free cholesterol is converted into cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids through a series of chemical reactions beginning with cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis). These bile acids are then conjugated to either glycine or taurine (improving solubility and emulsifying ability) to create the bile salts that are actively secreted into the bile canaliculi. As water-insoluble cholesterol is secreted in bile, it is rendered soluble in small amounts by the detergent action of these amphipathic (eg, hydrophobic and hydrophilic) bile salts and phosphatidylcholine (a phospholipid). When there is more cholesterol than can be made soluble, it precipitates into crystals that eventually grow and merge to form gallstones. Gallbladder hypomotility further promotes cholesterol nucleation and gallstone formation. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices A, B, C, E, and F) These represent lower cholesterol concentrations related to total bile salt and phosphatidylcholine levels. Such conditions would decrease the likelihood of gallstone formation.\n\nEducational objective: Elevated cholesterol concentrations increase the likelihood of cholesterol precipitation and gallstone formation. High levels of bile salts and phosphatidylcholine increase cholesterol solubility and decrease the risk of gallstones.",
    "zh": "机体清除过量胆固醇的方式有两种：将游离胆固醇排泄到胆汁中和将胆固醇转化为胆汁酸。 在肝脏中，游离胆固醇通过一系列化学反应转化为胆酸和鹅去氧胆酸，这些反应始于胆固醇7α-羟化酶（胆汁酸合成的限速步骤）。 然后，这些胆汁酸与甘氨酸或牛磺酸结合（提高溶解度和乳化能力），生成主动分泌到胆小管中的胆盐。 由于不溶于水的胆固醇在胆汁中分泌，因此它可以通过这些两亲性（例如，疏水性和亲水性）胆盐和磷脂酰胆碱（一种磷脂）的去污剂作用以少量溶解。 当胆固醇超过可溶解量时，它会沉淀成晶体，最终生长并融合形成胆结石。 胆囊蠕动减弱会进一步促进胆固醇成核和胆结石的形成。 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项A、B、C、E和F）这些代表与总胆盐和磷脂酰胆碱水平相关的较低胆固醇浓度。 这种情况会降低胆结石形成的可能。\n\n教育目标：胆固醇浓度升高会增加胆固醇沉淀和胆结石形成的可能。 高水平的胆盐和磷脂酰胆碱会增加胆固醇的溶解度并降低患胆结石的风险。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the pathophysiology of cholesterol gallstone formation, specifically the roles of cholesterol, bile acids, and phosphatidylcholine in maintaining cholesterol solubility in bile. Understanding the relationship between these components is crucial for determining the likelihood of gallstone formation.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that increased cholesterol and decreased bile acids and phosphatidylcholine favor gallstone formation. Therefore, the correct answer will reflect a condition where cholesterol is relatively high and bile acids and phosphatidylcholine are relatively low.",
    "zh": "本题考察胆固醇胆结石形成的病理生理学，特别是胆固醇、胆汁酸和磷脂酰胆碱在维持胆汁中胆固醇溶解度方面的作用。 了解这些组分之间的关系对于确定胆结石形成的几率至关重要。\n\n要解决这个问题，请记住，胆固醇升高和胆汁酸和磷脂酰胆碱降低有利于胆结石形成。 因此，正确的答案将反映一种胆固醇相对较高，而胆汁酸和磷脂酰胆碱相对较低的情况。"
