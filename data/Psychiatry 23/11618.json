Medical history includes major depressive disorder as well as chronic knee and back pain due to injuries sustained in a motor vehicle collision. Developmental history is significant for physical abuse as a child. Family history is significant for bipolar disorder and completed suicide in her father. The patient reports increasing depression since losing her job a year ago and separating from her husband of 40 years 6 months ago. She has a history of 2 prior hospitalizations for depression and a previous suicide attempt. The patient is recovering from alcohol use disorder and attends weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meetings at her church. Although she lives alone, she is close to her daughter, who lives nearby. The patient reports that she owns a firearm that is kept in a locked cabinet. Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for completed suicide in this patient?",

    "en": "A comprehensive suicide risk assessment involves considering both risk and protective factors. This patient has multiple risk factors for suicide, including her marital status, unemployment, psychiatric illness, past suicide attempt, family history of suicide, chronic pain, childhood abuse, and access to a firearm. Of these risk factors, a history of attempted suicide is the strongest single factor predictive of completed suicide. Patients with previous suicide attempts are 5-6 times more likely to make another attempt. Studies suggest that 1 out of 100 people who survive a suicide attempt will complete suicide within a year. This is 100 times the risk seen in the general population. Protective factors in this patient include her status as a parent with a connection to her daughter, participation in her church, and sobriety (as alcohol and other drugs have disinhibiting effects that increase the risk of acting on suicidal impulses).\n\n(Choice A) Studies suggest that the risk of completed suicide in those who have access to firearms is 3 times greater than in those who do not.\n(Choices B, C, and H) Age, male sex, and being separated/divorced are risk factors for suicide. Elderly (age >75) white men have the highest suicide rate. Although women attempt suicide nearly twice as often, men use more lethal methods (eg, firearms) that result in completed suicide 3 times more often. Suicide risk is highest in individuals who have never married, followed by those who are widowed, separated, or divorced.\n(Choices D and E) A history of adverse childhood experiences (eg, abuse, parental discord, parental substance abuse) and a family history of suicide increase the risk of suicide, most likely due to both environmental and genetic factors.\n(Choice G) Psychiatric illness, especially when associated with hopelessness, is a strong predictive factor for suicide. Of patients who die by suicide, 90% have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder at the time of death. Increased severity of illness and recent discharge from psychiatric inpatient care are additional risk factors.\n\nEducational objective: Suicide risk assessment includes consideration of both risk and protective factors. A history of a previous suicide attempt is the strongest single factor for further attempts and completed suicide.",
    "zh": "全面的自杀风险评估涉及考虑风险因素和保护性因素。该患者有多种自杀风险因素，包括婚姻状况、失业、精神疾病、既往自杀未遂史、家族自杀史、慢性疼痛、童年虐待以及获得枪支。在这些风险因素中，既往自杀未遂史是预测完成自杀的最强单一因素。有既往自杀未遂史的患者再次尝试自杀的可能性高5-6倍。研究表明，在自杀未遂后幸存的100人中，有1人会在一年内完成自杀。这比普通人群的风险高100倍。该患者的保护性因素包括她作为一名与女儿有联系的父母、参与教会活动以及保持清醒（因为酒精和其他药物具有解除抑制作用，会增加冲动自杀的风险）。\n\n（选项A）研究表明，获得枪支者完成自杀的风险是没有获得枪支者的3倍。\n（选项B、C和H）年龄、男性和分居/离婚是自杀的风险因素。老年（>75岁）白人男性自杀率最高。尽管女性自杀未遂的频率几乎是男性的两倍，但男性使用更致命的方法（例如，枪支），导致完成自杀的频率高3倍。从未结婚者的自杀风险最高，其次是丧偶、分居或离婚者。\n（选项D和E）不良童年经历史（例如，虐待、父母不和、父母药物滥用）和家族自杀史会增加自杀的风险，这很可能与环境和遗传因素有关。\n（选项G）精神疾病，特别是与绝望感相关的精神疾病，是自杀的强预测因素。在自杀死亡的患者中，90%的患者在死亡时患有可诊断的精神疾病。疾病的严重程度增加和近期从精神科住院治疗中出院是额外的风险因素。\n\n教育目标：自杀风险评估包括考虑风险因素和保护性因素。既往自杀未遂史是进一步尝试和完成自杀的最强单一因素。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of suicide risk factors and their relative predictive power for completed suicide. It requires the clinician to identify the most significant risk factor among a list of potential contributors in a patient with multiple risk factors.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall or refer to established guidelines on suicide risk assessment, prioritizing the strongest predictors of completed suicide. The vignette provides numerous risk factors, and the key is to identify which one carries the highest statistical weight for lethality.",
