    "en": "This patient with heart failure (eg, progressive dyspnea, weight gain, peripheral edema) has copious pink, amorphous material (hyaline) on cardiac biopsy, which is characteristic of cardiac amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a systemic disorder caused by the extracellular deposition of fibrils of misfolded amyloid protein in various tissues (eg, heart, liver, kidney, blood vessels). The 2 types of amyloido that most commonly affect the heart are amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) and amyloid light chain (AL).\n\nCardiac amyloid deposition typically causes a restrictive cardiomyopathy with uniformly thickened ventricular walls that are stiff and have impaired diastolic relaxation (normal wall thickness can be seen with other, noninfiltrative etiologies of restrictive cardiomyopathy). Left ventricular (LV) cavity size is normal or decreased, and the impaired diastolic relaxation both increases LV filling pressure and reduces cardiac output (leading to dyspnea). The elevated LV pressure is transmitted backward, leading to left atrial dilation, increased pulmonary arterial pressure, and progressive right-sided heart failure (eg, jugular venous distension, peripheral edema).\n\n(Choice A) A dilated left atrial cavity with normal LV parameters is indicative of mitral stenosis. Patients typically have pulmonary edema in addition to symptoms of right-sided heart failure. Accumulation of amorphous extracellular material is not expected on autopsy.\n\n(Choice B) Dilated left atrial and ventricular cavities with normal LV wall thickness is consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy, which results from contractile dysfunction after direct myocardial insult (eg, infection, chronic alcohol toxicity). LV relaxation may be normal or impaired depending on the disease progression and underlying etiology. Interstitial fibrosis would be prominent on microscopy in addition to findings specific to the underlying cause (eg, inflammatory cells in viral myocarditis).\n\n(Choice D) These changes are not characteristic of any specific cardiac condition.\n\n(Choice E) Normal left atrial cavity size with a dilated LV cavity and thickened LV walls but normal LV relaxation is consistent with the changes that occur in response to intense endurance training in an athlete's heart. As these changes are physiologic, heart failure does not occur.\n\nEducational objective:\nCardiac amyloidosis, caused by the accumulation of misfolded amyloid fibrils, appears as pink, amorphous extracellular material on light microscopy {{exhibit_2}}. The ventricular walls become stiff and uniformly thickened, leading to impaired diastolic relaxation, a dilated left atrial cavity, and progressive left- and right-sided heart failure. Left ventricular cavity size is typically normal or decreased.\n\n{{exhibit_3}}\n{{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "这位患有心力衰竭的患者（如进行性呼吸困难、体重增加、周围水肿）的心脏活检显示有大量的粉红色、无定形物质（透明质），这是心脏淀粉样变性的特征。淀粉样变性是一种全身性疾病，由错误折叠的淀粉样蛋白原纤维在各种组织（如心脏、肝脏、肾脏、血管）中的细胞外沉积引起。最常影响心脏的两种淀粉样变性类型是转甲状腺素蛋白淀粉样变性 (ATTR) 和轻链淀粉样变性 (AL)。\n\n心脏淀粉样蛋白沉积通常会导致限制性心肌病，其特征是心室壁均匀增厚、僵硬并伴有舒张期松弛受损（在其他非浸润性病因引起的限制性心肌病中可见正常的壁厚）。左心室 (LV) 腔的大小正常或减小，而舒张期松弛受损会增加左心室充盈压并降低心输出量（导致呼吸困难）。升高的左心室压力向后传递，导致左心房扩张、肺动脉压力升高和进行性右心衰竭（如颈静脉扩张、周围水肿）。\n\n(选项 A) 左心房扩张伴有正常的左心室参数表明二尖瓣狭窄。患者通常有肺水肿以及右心衰竭的症状。尸检中预计不会出现无定形细胞外物质的积聚。\n\n(选项 B) 左心房和心室扩张伴有正常的左心室壁厚度与扩张型心肌病一致，扩张型心肌病是由于直接心肌损伤（如感染、慢性酒精中毒）后的收缩功能障碍引起的。左心室松弛可能正常或受损，具体取决于疾病进展和潜在病因。除了与潜在原因相关的特定发现（例如病毒性心肌炎中的炎性细胞）外，显微镜下间质纤维化也会很明显。\n\n(选项 D) 这些变化不是任何特定心脏病的特征。\n\n(选项 E) 左心房腔大小正常，左心室腔扩张且左心室壁增厚，但左心室松弛正常，这与运动员心脏中对剧烈耐力训练产生反应而发生的变化一致。由于这些变化是生理性的，因此不会发生心力衰竭。\n\n教育目标：\n心脏淀粉样变性是由错误折叠的淀粉样蛋白原纤维的积累引起的，在光学显微镜下表现为粉红色、无定形细胞外物质 {{exhibit_2}}。心室壁变得僵硬且均匀增厚，导致舒张期松弛受损、左心房扩张以及进行性左心和右心衰竭。左心室腔的大小通常正常或减小。\n\n{{exhibit_3}}\n{{exhibit_4}}"
