    "en": "A 2-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to progressively worsening \"floppiness\" and poor feeding. The infant was born in Eastern Europe via an uncomplicated vaginal delivery to a 38-year-old woman and then immigrated to the United States with his family. The parents describe the infant as a \"good baby\" who rarely cries and sleeps through the night but has lately been difficult to rouse for breastfeeding. Stools have also decreased to every other day and are small and pellet-like. Physical examination shows a hypotonic infant with a large anterior fontanelle, large tongue, and a reducible umbilical hernia. He has low tone and is unable to hold his head erect on his own. No other abnormalities are seen. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",

    "en": "Congenital hypothyroidism is one of the most common causes of preventable intellectual disability. Most cases are due to thyroid dysgenesis (agenesis, hypoplasia, or ectopy), and iodine deficiency is a common cause in areas endemic for iodine deficiency (eg, Europe).\n\nNeonates initially have no significant symptoms due to the presence of maternal thyroxine (T4) from transplacental transfer. T4 is responsible for the stimulation of protein synthesis as well as carbohydrate and lipid catabolism in many cells; as maternal T4 wanes, metabolism is impaired and marked by a slowing of physical and mental activity (lethargy, poor feeding, constipation, hypotonia). Accumulation of matrix substances cutaneously and internally results in nonpitting edema (eg, \"puffy\" face), umbilical hernia, protruding tongue, and a large anterior fontanelle. In addition, T4 is essential for normal brain development and myelination during early life, and infants are at risk of severe and irreversible intellectual disability.\n\nTreatment with levothyroxine by age 2 weeks can normalize cognitive and physical development. Therefore, universal newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism is performed in the United States but not in all other countries.\n\n(Choice A) Infants who are fed honey or exposed to spores from the soil are at risk for infantile botulism, which presents with constipation and flaccid paralysis. A large anterior fontanelle, umbilical hernia, and macroglossia are not seen.\n\n(Choice B) Hypotonia and hypothyroidism are features of Down syndrome. However, the absence of other dysmorphic features (eg, upslanting palpebral fissures, bilateral epicanthal folds, single palmar crease) makes Down syndrome unlikely in this patient.\n\n(Choice C) Galactosemia is caused by galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency. Patients with this condition present with jaundice, vomiting, hepatomegaly, and lethargy after ingesting galactose in breast milk or formula in the first few days of life. This patient was previously breastfeeding well and has no hepatomegaly.\n\n(Choice D) Hirschsprung disease is caused by abnormal migration of neural crest cells into the rectosigmoid colon. The lack of ganglion cells in this colon segment impedes gastrointestinal motility, resulting in failed meconium passage and bilious emesis in a newborn.\n\n(Choice F) Phenylketonuria is most commonly caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, resulting in hyperphenylalaninemia. It presents with developmental delay, light pigmentation, and a musty body odor.\n\nEducational objective:\nCongenital hypothyroidism is usually asymptomatic at birth. After maternal T4 wanes, infants develop constipation, lethargy, macroglossia, an umbilical hernia, and a large anterior fontanelle. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "先天性甲状腺功能减退症是可预防的智力障碍最常见的原因之一。大多数病例是由于甲状腺发育不全（无发生、发育不良或异位）所致，碘缺乏是碘缺乏流行地区（如欧洲）的常见病因。\n\n新生儿最初没有明显的症状，这归因于母体甲状腺素 (T4) 通过胎盘转移的存在。T4 负责刺激许多细胞中的蛋白质合成以及碳水化合物和脂质分解代谢；随着母体 T4 衰退，新陈代谢受损，表现为身体和精神活动减慢（嗜睡、喂养不良、便秘、肌张力低下）。基质物质在皮肤和内部的积聚会导致非凹陷性水肿（例如，“浮肿”的脸）、脐疝、舌突出和前囟大。此外，T4 对早期正常的大脑发育和髓鞘形成至关重要，婴儿有发生严重和不可逆转的智力障碍的风险。\n\n在 2 周龄前使用左甲状腺素治疗可以使认知和身体发育正常化。因此，美国对先天性甲状腺功能减退症进行普遍的新生儿筛查，但并非所有其他国家都这样做。\n\n（选项 A）食用蜂蜜或暴露于土壤中的孢子的婴儿有患婴儿肉毒杆菌病的风险，其表现为便秘和弛缓性麻痹。未见前囟大、脐疝和巨舌症。\n\n（选项 B）肌张力低下和甲状腺功能减退是唐氏综合征的特征。然而，缺乏其他畸形特征（例如，眼睑倾斜、双侧内眦赘皮、单手掌纹）使得该患者不太可能患有唐氏综合征。\n\n（选项 C）半乳糖血症是由半乳糖-1-磷酸尿苷酰转移酶缺乏症引起的。患有这种疾病的患者在出生后头几天摄入母乳或配方奶中的半乳糖后，会出现黄疸、呕吐、肝肿大和嗜睡。该患者以前母乳喂养良好，并且没有肝肿大。\n\n（选项 D）先天性巨结肠是由神经嵴细胞异常迁移到乙状结肠引起的。该结肠段缺乏神经节细胞会阻碍胃肠蠕动，导致新生儿胎便排出失败和胆汁性呕吐。\n\n（选项 F）苯丙酮尿症最常见的原因是苯丙氨酸羟化酶缺乏症，导致高苯丙氨酸血症。其表现为发育迟缓、色素沉着浅和霉味体味。\n\n教育目标：\n先天性甲状腺功能减退症通常在出生时无症状。在母体 T4 衰退后，婴儿会出现便秘、嗜睡、巨舌症、脐疝和前囟大。{{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of congenital hypothyroidism, its clinical presentation, and the importance of newborn screening. It also requires differentiating it from other causes of hypotonia and feeding difficulties in infants.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the constellation of symptoms (hypotonia, constipation, macroglossia, umbilical hernia, large fontanelle) as suggestive of hypothyroidism. Rule out other conditions based on the absence of specific features (e.g., dysmorphic features in Down syndrome, jaundice and hepatomegaly in galactosemia).",
