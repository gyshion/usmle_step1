She has had no complications in this pregnancy and had a normal anatomy ultrasound at 20 weeks gestation. On physical examination, the fundal height measures 28 cm. Cardiac auscultation reveals a 2/6 blowing systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border. The murmur intensifies with inspiration, and there is no ejection click or palpable thrill at the sternal notch. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is 1+ pitting edema to the midshins bilaterally.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient is a 29-year-old woman at 28 weeks gestation presenting for prenatal care. She has a new 2/6 blowing systolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border that intensifies with inspiration. She also has 1+ pitting edema. The murmur described is consistent with a pulmonic flow murmur, which is common in pregnancy due to increased cardiac output and blood volume. The cardiovascular system adapts accordingly with ventricular dilation and increased cardiac output. These changes can cause several auscultation findings during normal pregnancy. A pulmonic flow murmur is a low-grade systolic murmur best heard at the left upper or midsternal border. It is caused by high blood flow across the pulmonic valve. The anterior location of the pulmonic valve helps make the murmur relatively easily detectable. Like most right-sided murmurs, the intensity increases during inspiration as additional blood is pulled into the lungs and the right side of the heart. An S3 gallop can also be heard, caused by reverberation of sound during diastolic filling of an enlarged left ventricle, and is considered a normal finding in pregnancy. A venous hum, a continuous murmur likely caused by brisk blood flow through the jugular veins, is also common. The presence of pitting edema is also a common finding in pregnancy due to increased venous pressure and fluid retention.\n\n(Choice A) Bacterial vegetations on the mitral valve can occur with infective endocarditis, typically leading to mitral regurgitation. The murmur of mitral regurgitation is a holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex, with decreased intensity during inspiration. This is less likely given the location and inspiratory intensification of the murmur.\n\n(Choice B) Calcification of a congenital bicuspid aortic valve is a common cause of aortic stenosis. Affected patients are typically age >40 and have a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border. Like most left-sided murmurs, the murmur tends to decrease in intensity with inspiration. This is inconsistent with the patient's murmur characteristics.\n\n(Choice D) Inflammatory stiffening of the tricuspid valve can occur with rheumatic heart disease, leading to tricuspid stenosis. The murmur of tricuspid stenosis increases in intensity with inspiration, but it is diastolic rather than systolic. This is inconsistent with the patient's murmur.\n\n(Choice E) Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve can lead to mitral valve prolapse, which is recognized by a midsystolic click that may be followed by a murmur of mitral regurgitation. The timing (but not the intensity) of the click varies with changes in left ventricular blood volume. This is inconsistent with the patient's murmur.\n\nEducational objective: Normal pregnancy is associated with an increase in blood volume and cardiac output that frequently causes a pulmonic flow murmur and S3. The murmur is best heard at the left sternal border and intensifies with inspiration.",
    "zh": "患者为29岁女性，妊娠28周，前来就诊以进行产前护理。她出现了一个新的2/6级吹风样收缩期杂音，在左侧胸骨旁听诊最清楚，并且随吸气增强。她也有1+凹陷性水肿。所描述的杂音与肺动脉血流杂音一致，这在妊娠期间很常见，原因是心输出量和血容量增加。心血管系统相应地适应，出现心室扩张和心输出量增加。这些变化可能导致正常妊娠期间出现一些听诊结果。肺动脉血流杂音是一种低级收缩期杂音，在左上或胸骨中缘听诊最清楚。它是由血液流过肺动脉瓣的速度加快引起的。肺动脉瓣的前方位置有助于使杂音相对容易被检测到。像大多数右侧杂音一样，其强度在吸气期间增加，因为额外的血液被吸入肺部和右心。S3奔马律也可能听到，这是由于扩大了的左心室舒张期充盈期间声音的共振引起的，这被认为是妊娠的正常发现。静脉嗡鸣，一种可能由血液通过颈静脉的快速流动引起的连续性杂音，也很常见。凹陷性水肿的存在也是妊娠期间的常见发现，这归因于静脉压升高和体液潴留。\n\n（选项A）二尖瓣上的细菌赘生物可发生于感染性心内膜炎，通常导致二尖瓣反流。二尖瓣反流的杂音是全收缩期杂音，在心尖处听诊最清楚，并且在吸气时强度降低。考虑到杂音的部位和吸气增强，这种可能性较小。\n\n（选项B）先天性二叶式主动脉瓣钙化是主动脉瓣狭窄的常见原因。受影响的患者通常年龄>40岁，并且有在右侧胸骨上缘听诊最清楚的渐强-减弱型收缩期杂音。像大多数左侧杂音一样，该杂音倾向于随吸气强度降低。这与患者的杂音特征不一致。\n\n（选项D）三尖瓣的炎症性僵硬可发生于风湿性心脏病，导致三尖瓣狭窄。三尖瓣狭窄的杂音在吸气时强度增加，但它是舒张期的，而不是收缩期的。这与患者的杂音不符。\n\n（选项E）二尖瓣粘液样变性可导致二尖瓣脱垂，其特征是中收缩期喀喇音，随后可能出现二尖瓣反流的杂音。喀喇音的时间（而不是强度）随左心室血容量的变化而变化。这与患者的杂音不符。\n\n教育目标：正常妊娠与血容量和心输出量的增加有关，这常常会导致肺动脉血流杂音和S3。杂音在左侧胸骨旁听诊最清楚，并且随吸气增强。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of physiological murmurs that can occur during pregnancy due to increased cardiac output and blood volume. It requires differentiating these normal findings from pathological murmurs based on auscultatory characteristics and patient demographics.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the patient's demographic (pregnant woman) and the characteristics of the murmur (systolic, left sternal border, intensifies with inspiration). This pattern strongly suggests a physiological flow murmur, common in pregnancy, rather than a pathological valvular lesion. The presence of pitting edema further supports a physiological change related to pregnancy.",
    "zh": "此题考察了对妊娠期间由于心输出量和血容量增加而可能发生的生理性杂音的理解。它需要根据听诊特征和患者人口统计学，将这些正常发现与病理性杂音区分开来。\n\n解决此问题的方法包括识别患者的人口统计学特征（孕妇）和杂音的特征（收缩期、左侧胸骨旁、随吸气增强）。这种模式强烈提示生理性血流杂音，这在妊娠期间很常见，而不是病理性的瓣膜病变。凹陷性水肿的存在进一步支持了与妊娠相关的生理变化。"
