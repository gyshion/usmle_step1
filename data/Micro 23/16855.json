    "en": "This patient has a pruritic, erythematous rash affecting the feet. Microscopy of skin scrapings shows branching hyphae, confirming the diagnosis of tinea pedis (athlete's foot). Tinea pedis is a superficial infection of the epidermis caused by dermatophytes, especially Trichophyton rubrum and similar species. The organisms are widespread and are often acquired following exposure to public places while barefoot (eg, athletic facilities, swimming pools). They can also spread from other areas (eg, groin [tinea cruris], body [tinea corporis]) on the same patient via autoinoculation.\n\nTinea pedis most commonly occurs between the toes (interdigital pattern) but in chronic cases can cause a hyperkeratotic rash extending up the sides of the feet (moccasin pattern). Tinea pedis is treated with a variety of topical antifungals, including azoles (eg, miconazole, clotrimazole), allylamines (eg, terbinafine), and tolnaftate. However, nystatin (primarily used for Candida infections) is not effective against dermatophytes (Choice D).\n\n(Choice A) Albendazole is an antihelminthic agent used to treat cutaneous larva migrans, which presents with pruritic, red/brown serpiginous tracks in the skin. The feet are typically the initial location of infection, but symptoms would not be confined to the interdigital skin.\n\n(Choice C) Topical mupirocin is used to treat impetigo, which presents with well-defined erythematous, erosive lesions with yellow crust.\n\n(Choice E) Permethrin is used for scabies, which can affect the interdigital skin but presents with small papules, pustules, and burrows. Microscopy of skin scrapings shows mites or ova and fecal matter.\n\nEducational objective:\nTinea pedis is a superficial infection of the epidermis caused by dermatophytes (eg, Trichophyton rubrum). It most often presents as a pruritic, erythematous rash between the toes that frequently extends along the sole. Microscopy of skin scrapings shows branching hyphae. Treatment options include a variety of topical antifungals (eg, clotrimazole), but not nystatin.\n\n{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "该患者有影响足部的瘙痒性红斑皮疹。皮肤刮片的显微镜检查显示分支菌丝，证实了足癣的诊断。足癣是由皮肤癣菌引起的表皮浅表感染，尤其是红色毛癣菌和类似物种。这些生物体广泛存在，通常是在赤脚暴露于公共场所后获得（例如，体育设施、游泳池）。它们也可以通过自身接种从同一患者的其他部位（例如，腹股沟 [股癣]、身体 [体癣]）传播。\n\n足癣最常发生在脚趾之间（趾间型），但在慢性病例中，可导致角化过度皮疹，延伸到脚的两侧（莫卡辛型）。足癣的治疗方法是多种局部抗真菌药物，包括唑类（例如，咪康唑、克霉唑）、烯丙胺（例如，特比萘芬）和萘替芬。然而，制霉菌素（主要用于念珠菌感染）对皮肤癣菌无效（选项 D）。\n\n（选项 A）阿苯达唑是一种驱虫剂，用于治疗皮肤幼虫移行症，其表现为皮肤瘙痒、红色/棕色蛇形条纹。足部通常是感染的初始位置，但症状不会局限于趾间皮肤。\n\n（选项 C）局部莫匹罗星用于治疗脓疱病，其表现为边界清晰的红斑性侵蚀性病变，并伴有黄色痂皮。\n\n（选项 E）苄氯菊酯用于治疗疥疮，疥疮可影响趾间皮肤，但表现为小丘疹、脓疱和隧道。皮肤刮片的显微镜检查显示螨虫或卵和粪便物质。\n\n教育目标：\n足癣是由皮肤癣菌（例如，红色毛癣菌）引起的表皮浅表感染。它最常表现为脚趾间的瘙痒性红斑皮疹，经常沿足底延伸。皮肤刮片的显微镜检查显示分支菌丝。治疗方案包括多种局部抗真菌药（例如，克霉唑），但不包括制霉菌素。\n\n{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"
