    "en": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the office for evaluation of fatigue and bone pain. Physical examination shows diffuse lymphadenopathy and purpura over his arms and legs. Laboratory analysis reveals anemia and thrombocytopenia, and a peripheral blood smear shows lymphoblasts. After further work-up, acute lymphoblastic leukemia is diagnosed, and the patient begins a chemotherapy regimen that includes doxorubicin. This agent intercalates between DNA base pairs and inhibits DNA replication, a process that normally occurs at replication forks and produces 2 distinct daughter strands.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Synthesis of the daughter strands occurs simultaneously from both parent strands. However, because DNA synthesis can occur in only the 5'→3' direction, only 1 daughter strand is synthesized continuously toward the replication fork; this is the leading strand. The other strand, called the lagging strand, must be synthesized discontinuously in a direction away from the replication fork; more segments are added as the replication fork moves across the DNA double helix. This results in the formation of Okazaki fragments, short stretches of newly synthesized DNA that are separated by RNA primers. These primers are then removed and replaced with DNA, and the Okazaki fragments are subsequently joined together by DNA ligase.\n\n(Choice A) DNA polymerases have 3'→5' exonuclease activity (proofreading function) that allows them to reverse direction and remove incorrectly placed bases. This process occurs on both newly formed daughter strands (not just the lagging strand) to help reduce replication errors.\n\n(Choice B) DNA polymerases do not have 3'→5' polymerase activity; all polymerases synthesize in the 5'→3' direction.\n\n(Choice C) During the synthesis of the lagging strand, 5'→3' exonuclease activity is needed to remove RNA primers. However, it is also used to remove primers when joining leading strands from separate origins of replication and is therefore not a unique mechanism in the creation of the lagging strand.\n\n(Choice D) Before DNA polymerase can initiate DNA synthesis, RNA primers must first be synthesized by the enzyme primase (DNA-dependent RNA polymerase). This process is necessary for synthesis of both daughter strands and is therefore not unique to the lagging strand.",
    "zh": "子链的合成同时发生在两个亲链上。然而，由于DNA合成只能以5'→3'方向进行，因此只有一条子链朝着复制叉的方向连续合成；这就是前导链。另一条链，称为后随链，必须以远离复制叉的方向不连续地合成；随着复制叉穿过DNA双螺旋，会添加更多的片段。这导致冈崎片段的形成，冈崎片段是新合成的DNA的短片段，由RNA引物分隔开。然后，这些引物被移除并被DNA取代，冈崎片段随后通过DNA连接酶连接在一起。\n\n(选项 A) DNA聚合酶具有3'→5'外切酶活性（校对功能），这使它们能够反向并移除放置不正确的碱基。此过程发生在两个新形成的子链上（不仅仅是后随链），以帮助减少复制错误。\n\n(选项 B) DNA聚合酶没有3'→5'聚合酶活性；所有聚合酶都以5'→3'方向合成。\n\n(选项 C) 在后随链的合成过程中，需要5'→3'外切酶活性来移除RNA引物。然而，当连接来自不同复制起始点的先导链时，也使用它来移除引物，因此它不是后随链生成的独特机制。\n\n(选项 D) 在DNA聚合酶启动DNA合成之前，必须首先由引物酶（DNA依赖性RNA聚合酶）合成RNA引物。此过程对于两条子链的合成都是必需的，因此它不是后随链所独有的。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of DNA replication, specifically the differences between the leading and lagging strands. It requires understanding the directionality of DNA synthesis and the role of Okazaki fragments.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the unique characteristics of the lagging strand, which is synthesized discontinuously in short fragments due to the 5'→3' directionality constraint of DNA polymerase.",
