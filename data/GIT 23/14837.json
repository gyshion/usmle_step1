The patient has also had severe right shoulder and abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for the past 2 days. He had an appendectomy during childhood and a pacemaker placed 10 years ago for symptomatic sinus bradycardia. He has no other medical problems and takes no medications. The patient does not use tobacco but drinks an occasional beer. Temperature is 38.4 C (101.1 F), blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, and pulse is 120/min and regular. Abdominal examination shows generalized tenderness with rebound tenderness. Right shoulder examination is normal. Upright chest x-ray is shown below {{exhibit_1}}.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's upright chest x-ray demonstrates free air under the diaphragm (pneumoperitoneum), likely due to perforation of a hollow abdominal viscus. The most common cause of pneumoperitoneum is a perforated duodenal ulcer, but perforation can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal (or female reproductive) tract due to ulcers, tumors, trauma, or iatrogenic causes (eg, endoscopy, surgery).\n\nContamination of the sterile peritoneal cavity with bowel contents leads to chemical (acid or chyme-related) or bacterial peritonitis, which, if left untreated, can progress to sepsis and death. Diffuse irritation of the parietal peritoneum results in severe abdominal pain with rigidity and rebound tenderness. Shoulder pain is another frequent finding and reflects referred pain from diaphragmatic irritation. Referred pain is due to convergence of multiple nociceptors (visceral and somatic) onto a single secondary neuron within the spinal cord, which causes the brain to misinterpret visceral pain as arising from a body surface.\n\n(Choice A) Other common causes of abdominal pain with associated diaphragmatic irritation and referred shoulder pain include acute cholecystitis/biliary colic and splenic lacerations. However, these would not be associated with intraabdominal free air.\n\n(Choice B) Acute pancreatitis causes epigastric abdominal pain that may be referred to the back. X-ray findings are often normal, although a localized ileus near the inflamed pancreas (sentinel loop sign) may be seen.\n\n(Choice C) Nephrolithiasis typically presents with colicky flank pain that is referred to the groin. Radiopaque stones (calcium, struvite, and cystine) may be visualized on plain radiography.\n\n(Choice E) Small bowel obstruction causes poorly localized, constant abdominal pain, which can be referred to the epigastrium. Plain radiography demonstrates dilation of the small bowel with fluid air levels; free air is not seen in the absence of perforation.\n\nEducational objective:\nPneumoperitoneum is air or gas in the peritoneal cavity; it can be seen as free air under the diaphragm in an upright chest x-ray {{exhibit_2}}. The most common cause is a perforated duodenal ulcer, but perforation can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal (or female reproductive) tract. Subsequent peritonitis can lead to diffuse abdominal pain with rebound and guarding, sometimes with referred shoulder pain due to diaphragmatic irritation. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "该患者的直立位胸片显示膈下有游离气体（气腹），这可能是由于腹部空腔脏器穿孔所致。气腹最常见的原因是十二指肠溃疡穿孔，但由于溃疡、肿瘤、外伤或医源性原因（如内镜检查、手术），穿孔可发生在胃肠道（或女性生殖道）的任何部位。\n\n无菌腹腔被肠内容物污染会导致化学性（酸或食糜相关）或细菌性腹膜炎，如果不及时治疗，可能发展为脓毒症和死亡。腹膜壁层弥漫性刺激会导致严重的腹痛，伴有腹肌僵硬和反跳痛。肩痛是另一个常见发现，反映了来自膈肌刺激的牵涉痛。牵涉痛是由于多个伤害感受器（内脏和躯体）汇聚到脊髓中的单个二级神经元上，这导致大脑将内脏疼痛误解为来自体表。\n\n（选项A）与膈肌刺激和牵涉性肩痛相关的腹痛的其他常见原因包括急性胆囊炎/胆绞痛和脾脏撕裂伤。然而，这些不会与腹腔内游离气体相关。\n\n（选项B）急性胰腺炎引起上腹部疼痛，可放射至背部。X线表现通常正常，尽管可在发炎的胰腺附近观察到局部性肠梗阻（哨兵环征）。\n\n（选项C）肾结石病通常表现为绞痛性腰痛，并放射到腹股沟。可在平片摄影中观察到不透射线的结石（钙、鸟粪石和胱氨酸）。\n\n（选项E）小肠梗阻引起定位不明确的持续性腹痛，可放射到上腹部。平片摄影显示小肠扩张伴有液气平面；在没有穿孔的情况下看不到游离气体。\n\n教育目标：\n气腹是腹腔内的空气或气体；可在直立位胸片中观察到膈下游离气体 {{exhibit_2}}。最常见的原因是十二指肠溃疡穿孔，但穿孔可发生在胃肠道（或女性生殖道）的任何部位。随后的腹膜炎可导致弥漫性腹痛，伴有反跳痛和腹肌紧张，有时由于膈肌刺激而出现肩部牵涉痛。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize the signs and symptoms of a perforated viscus, including pneumoperitoneum on chest x-ray and referred shoulder pain. It also requires knowledge of the common causes of pneumoperitoneum and the pathophysiology of peritonitis.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to identify the free air under the diaphragm on the chest x-ray, which is indicative of a perforated viscus. The patient's presentation of fever, lethargy, abdominal pain with rebound tenderness, and hypotension further supports this diagnosis. Recognizing the referred shoulder pain as a sign of diaphragmatic irritation is also important.",
