  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has fluent aphasia, a form of receptive aphasia characterized by speech that is fluent, well articulated, and melodic - but meaningless. Individuals stricken with fluent aphasia cannot understand verbal or written language. Repetition is usually affected to the same degree as the impairment in comprehension. Typically, patients will have no awareness of their cognitive deficit. Fluent aphasia is often produced by a lesion in Wernicke's area, which is located in the auditory association cortex within the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant (usually left) temporal lobe.\n\nThe regions of the cerebral cortex supplied by the middle cerebral artery (MCA) are approximated by the red oval in the image below. The inferior terminal MCA branches supply Wernicke's area. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choices A, B, D, and E) The anterior cerebral artery, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, posterior cerebral artery, and posterior inferior cerebellar artery do not typically service Wernicke's area. Consequently, occlusions of these arteries would not be associated with Wernicke's aphasia.\n\nEducational objective:\nA lesion in Wernicke's area can cause receptive aphasia, which is characterized by well-articulated, nonsensical speech paired with a lack of language comprehension (Wernicke-Word salad). Wernicke's area is located in the auditory association cortex within the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant temporal lobe. The middle cerebral artery supplies Broca's area (superior division) and Wernicke's area (inferior division).",
    "zh": "该患者患有流畅性失语症，这是一种感受性失语症，其特征是言语流畅、清晰且有旋律，但毫无意义。患有流畅性失语症的个体无法理解口头或书面语言。复述通常会受到与理解障碍相同程度的影响。通常，患者不会意识到他们的认知缺陷。流畅性失语症通常由韦尼克区病变引起，该区域位于优势（通常是左侧）颞叶上颞回后部的听觉联合皮质内。\n\n大脑中动脉 (MCA) 供血的脑皮质区域由下图中的红色椭圆形表示。MCA 下端分支为韦尼克区供血。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}\n\n（选项 A、B、D 和 E）大脑前动脉、小脑前下动脉、大脑后动脉和小脑后下动脉通常不为韦尼克区供血。因此，这些动脉的阻塞不会与韦尼克失语症相关。\n\n教育目标：\n韦尼克区的病变可引起感受性失语症，其特征是清晰、无意义的言语，伴有缺乏语言理解能力（韦尼克词语杂烩）。韦尼克区位于优势颞叶上颞回后部的听觉联合皮质内。大脑中动脉为布罗卡区（上部分支）和韦尼克区（下部分支）供血。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of receptive aphasia (Wernicke's aphasia), its clinical presentation, and the neurovascular supply to the affected brain regions.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the type of aphasia based on the patient's symptoms (fluent but incomprehensible speech, poor comprehension) and then correlate this with the specific brain area involved (Wernicke's area) and its arterial supply (middle cerebral artery).",
