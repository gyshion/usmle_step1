    "en": "A 38-year-old man comes to the office with abdominal discomfort and loose stools over the past year. He has also lost 10 kg (22 lb) despite having a normal appetite. The patient eats a balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables, meats, whole grains, and dairy products. He has had no international travel, works indoors as an office manager, and has no sick contacts. Medical history is insignificant and the patient takes no medications. The patient drinks alcohol socially and does not use tobacco. Vital signs and physical examination are normal. Serum chemistry panel, complete blood count, and thyroid function tests are normal. Which of the following is the best next step for assessing for impaired nutrient absorption in this patient?",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Impaired intestinal absorption of nutrients is called malabsorption. Significant malabsorption may present with diarrhea and steatorrhea (bulky, foul-smelling stools; visible oil droplets; greasy toilet ring), but more often patients have nonspecific symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, or vague abdominal discomfort. Patients may also have characteristic findings due to specific nutrient deficiencies. Generalized malabsorption is commonly due to defects in pancreatic secretion (eg, chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis), mucosal disorders (eg, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease), bacterial overgrowth (eg, gastrointestinal surgery, abnormal motility), or parasitic diseases (eg, Giardia).\n\nDietary lipids are the macronutrient with the most complex digestive pathway. Fats are typically the earliest and most severely affected nutrient in generalized malabsorption, and testing for fat malabsorption is therefore the most sensitive strategy for screening for malabsorptive disorders. A qualitative assay of stool with Sudan III stain {{exhibit_1}} can quickly and easily identify unabsorbed fat and confirm malabsorption. (Stool should normally contain no measurable fat.)\n\n(Choices A, B, C, and D) Abdominal imaging can be used to identify thickening of the bowel wall due to inflammation or structural disorders of the pancreas (eg, chronic pancreatitis). Endoscopy with jejunal biopsy can diagnose celiac disease, and colonoscopy can identify inflammatory bowel disease. Stool inspection for ova and parasites can identify infectious causes of malabsorption such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Although these tests are useful for determining specific causes of generalized malabsorption, fecal fat testing is a less invasive and more sensitive test for confirming malabsorption of any etiology.\n\n(Choice F) Iron and vitamin B₁₂ deficiency occur commonly in patients with malabsorption. However, vitamin B₁₂ levels have a low sensitivity for malabsorption; deficiency develops only after years and is more common with specific etiologies (eg, pernicious anemia). In addition, this patient's normal complete blood count makes vitamin B₁₂ deficiency less likely.",
    "zh": "营养物质的肠道吸收受损称为吸收不良。严重的吸收不良可能表现为腹泻和脂肪泻（粪便量大、恶臭；可见油滴；马桶有油腻环），但更常见的是患者出现非特异性症状，如体重减轻、疲劳或模糊的腹部不适。患者也可能因特定的营养缺乏而出现特征性表现。 普遍性吸收不良通常是由于胰腺分泌缺陷（如慢性胰腺炎、囊性纤维化）、黏膜疾病（如乳糜泻、炎症性肠病）、细菌过度生长（如胃肠道手术、异常蠕动）或寄生虫病（如贾第虫病）引起的。\n\n膳食脂类是消化途径最复杂的大量营养素。脂肪通常是普遍性吸收不良中最早和受影响最严重的营养素，因此检测脂肪吸收不良是筛查吸收不良性疾病的最敏感策略。使用苏丹III染色的粪便定性测定 {{exhibit_1}} 可以快速轻松地识别未吸收的脂肪并确认吸收不良。（粪便通常不应含有可测量的脂肪。）\n\n（选项A、B、C和D）腹部影像学检查可用于识别由于炎症或胰腺结构异常（如慢性胰腺炎）引起的肠壁增厚。空肠活检内镜检查可诊断乳糜泻，结肠镜检查可识别炎症性肠病。粪便虫卵和寄生虫检查可识别吸收不良的感染原因，如贾第虫和隐孢子虫。尽管这些检查有助于确定普遍性吸收不良的特定原因，但粪便脂肪检测是确认任何病因吸收不良的侵入性较低且更敏感的检查。\n\n（选项F）缺铁和维生素B₁₂缺乏症在吸收不良患者中很常见。然而，维生素B₁₂水平对吸收不良的敏感性较低；缺乏症仅在数年后才会出现，并且在特定病因（如恶性贫血）中更常见。此外，该患者的正常全血细胞计数使维生素B₁₂缺乏症的可能性降低。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the initial diagnostic approach to suspected malabsorption, focusing on the sensitivity and specificity of different tests. It emphasizes the importance of assessing fat malabsorption as the most sensitive initial step.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the patient's symptoms as potentially indicative of malabsorption. Then, consider the most sensitive initial test to confirm malabsorption, which is stool microscopy with Sudan III stain to detect unabsorbed fat.",
