    "en": "A 36-year-old woman comes to the office for follow-up of a mood disorder. The patient has a history of several depressive episodes that started in her twenties. Two years ago, she was hospitalized after staying up for several nights without sleeping and claiming that she had special powers to \"end global poverty and climate change.\" Her symptoms responded well to treatment and she has remained on the same drug regimen since then. However, the patient now has new-onset constipation, dry skin, and hair loss. She is also concerned about a weight gain of 2.27 kg (5 lb) over the last 3-4 months despite eating healthy, low-calorie foods. Blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg and pulse is 55/min. The patient appears tired, but physical examination is otherwise normal. The diagnosis is established and her current condition is attributed to adverse effects from one of her medications. Which of the following is the most likely culprit drug?",

    "en": "This patient's weight gain, hair loss, and mild bradycardia are most likely due to LITHIUM-INDUCED HYPOTHYROIDISM. Lithium is a mood stabilizer primarily used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. It can cause HYPOTHYROIDISM by interfering with normal synthesis and release of thyroid hormone. The compensatory increase in TSH release by the pituitary can lead to goiter in some patients. Lithium-induced hypothyroidism is treated with standard levothyroxine (T4) replacement and does not require discontinuation of lithium therapy.\n\nLong-term lithium therapy is also associated with adverse effects on renal function (eg, NEPHROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS, chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy), requiring regular monitoring of blood lithium levels and renal function (blood urea nitrogen and creatinine). Lithium use during pregnancy has been associated with Ebstein anomaly of the tricuspid valve, but the absolute risk is small.\n\n(Choices A and D) Carbamazepine and lamotrigine are anticonvulsants that are also used as mood stabilizers in bipolar disorder. Carbamazepine can cause aplastic anemia. Lamotrigine is associated with a rash, including potentially life-threatening Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\n\n(Choice B) Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant. Sexual dysfunction is the most common long-term side effect. SSRIs are not used as monotherapy in bipolar disorder and are not associated with hypothyroidism.\n\n(Choice C) Clozapine, a second-generation antipsychotic indicated for treatment-refractory schizophrenia, is associated with agranulocytosis and requires regular monitoring of the absolute neutrophil count. Although clozapine can cause weight gain and constipation, it is not a first-line treatment for mood disorders and would not explain this patient's other hypothyroid features (eg, dry skin, hair loss, bradycardia).\n\n(Choice F) Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic that can cause weight gain and hyperprolactinemia (eg, galactorrhea, amenorrhea). It is not associated with hypothyroidism.\n\n(Choice G) Trazodone is an antidepressant that has significant sedating effects and is most commonly used to treat depression-related insomnia. Other adverse effects include priapism (prolonged painful erection) and anticholinergic effects (eg, dry mouth, constipation).\n\nEducational objective: Hypothyroidism and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus are the most common adverse effects of long-term lithium therapy. Serum TSH and renal function (blood urea nitrogen and creatinine) should be monitored routinely.",
    "zh": "该患者的体重增加、脱发和轻度心动过缓很可能由于锂引起的甲状腺功能减退症。锂是一种主要用于治疗双相情感障碍的情绪稳定剂。它会干扰甲状腺激素的正常合成和释放，从而导致甲状腺功能减退症。垂体释放促甲状腺激素（TSH）的代偿性增加会导致一些患者出现甲状腺肿。锂引起的甲状腺功能减退症用标准左甲状腺素（T4）替代治疗，不需要停止锂治疗。\n\n长期锂治疗也与肾功能不良反应（如肾性尿崩症、慢性肾小管间质性肾病）有关，需要定期监测血锂水平和肾功能（血尿素氮和肌酐）。妊娠期间使用锂与三尖瓣Ebstein畸形有关，但绝对风险很小。\n\n（选项 A 和 D）卡马西平和拉莫三嗪是抗惊厥药，也可作为双相情感障碍的情绪稳定剂。卡马西平可引起再生障碍性贫血。拉莫三嗪与皮疹有关，包括可能危及生命的史蒂文斯-约翰逊综合征。\n\n（选项 B）西酞普兰是一种选择性 5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（SSRI）抗抑郁药。性功能障碍是最常见的长期副作用。SSRI 不作为单药用于双相情感障碍，并且与甲状腺功能减退症无关。\n\n（选项 C）氯氮平是一种二代抗精神病药，适用于治疗难治性精神分裂症，与粒细胞缺乏症相关，需要定期监测中性粒细胞绝对计数。尽管氯氮平可引起体重增加和便秘，但它不是情绪障碍的一线治疗方法，也不能解释该患者的其他甲状腺功能减退特征（例如，皮肤干燥、脱发、心动过缓）。\n\n（选项 F）利培酮是一种二代抗精神病药，可引起体重增加和高泌乳素血症（例如，溢乳、闭经）。它与甲状腺功能减退症无关。\n\n（选项 G）曲唑酮是一种抗抑郁药，具有明显的镇静作用，最常用于治疗与抑郁症相关的失眠。其他不良反应包括阴茎异常勃起（持续性疼痛勃起）和抗胆碱能作用（例如，口干、便秘）。\n\n教育目标：甲状腺功能减退症和肾性尿崩症是长期锂治疗最常见的不良反应。应定期监测血清TSH和肾功能（血尿素氮和肌酐）。"
