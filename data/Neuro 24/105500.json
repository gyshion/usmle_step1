    "en": "The patient presents with a crossed pattern of neurological deficits: left-sided facial weakness and right-sided hemiparesis. This pattern is characteristic of a brainstem lesion, specifically in the pons. The facial nerve (CN VII) originates in the pons. Lesions above the pons (e.g., midbrain, internal capsule, or cerebral cortex) lead to an upper motor neuron pattern of facial weakness, which spares the forehead. Lesions at the level of the pons, however, result in a lower motor neuron pattern of facial weakness, affecting the entire ipsilateral (left) side of the face, including the forehead. The contralateral hemiparesis (right arm and leg weakness) is due to damage to the corticospinal tracts as they descend through the pons. The Babinski sign on the right further supports an upper motor neuron lesion affecting the corticospinal tract on that side. Therefore, the lesion is most likely located in the left pons, corresponding to the area labeled D in the provided diagram. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}\n\n(Choice A) Lesions impacting the cerebral cortex can lead to contralateral weakness of the face and body. However, facial weakness would typically follow an upper motor neuron pattern, sparing the forehead, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.\n\n(Choice B) A stroke in the midbrain can cause ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits with contralateral hemiparesis. However, the cranial nerves involved would typically originate in the midbrain, most classically the oculomotor nerve (CN III), which would lead to ipsilateral ptosis and an eye in the down-and-out position. This is not described in the patient's presentation.\n\n(Choice C) A stroke in the cerebellum often presents with vertigo, nystagmus, and ataxia. It would not typically cause cranial nerve deficits or hemiparesis.\n\n(Choice E) Medullary infarctions can cause ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits with contralateral hemiparesis. However, the cranial nerves involved originate in the medulla: glossopharyngeal (CN IX) (diminished gag reflex), vagus (CN X) (dysphonia), and hypoglossal (CN XII) (tongue weakness). In addition, medullary infarctions often result in well-known clinical stroke syndromes (e.g., lateral medullary syndrome, medial medullary syndrome). The patient's presentation is more consistent with a pontine lesion affecting the facial nerve and corticospinal tract.\n\nEducational objective:\nA stroke in the pons can lead to contralateral weakness of the arm and leg with ipsilateral facial weakness. Facial weakness occurs in a lower motor neuron pattern (ipsilateral, affects upper face) because the damage occurs at the level of the facial nerve (CN VII) origination.",

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of neuroanatomy and the localization of neurological deficits, specifically focusing on the interpretation of crossed signs (ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits with contralateral body weakness) to identify brainstem lesions. It assesses the ability to correlate clinical findings with specific anatomical structures within the brainstem.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the \"crossed sign\" pattern of deficits. Then, by recalling the origin of the facial nerve (CN VII) and the pathway of the corticospinal tracts, the lesion can be localized to the pons. The provided diagram of the brainstem is crucial for identifying the specific anatomical location corresponding to the clinical presentation.",
