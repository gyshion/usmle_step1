    "en": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to fever, headache, vomiting, and confusion. He has no prior medical conditions and is up to date with immunizations. The patient has not traveled recently, and his parents report no exposure to individuals with similar symptoms or ingestion of anything out of the ordinary. They recently noticed several dead birds around their neighborhood. Temperature is 39 C (102.2 F). Physical examination shows neck rigidity and right lower extremity weakness with fasciculations. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a leukocyte count of 200/mm³ with 20% neutrophils and 80% lymphocytes.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of meningoencephalitis, including fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, neck rigidity, and pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid. The presence of right lower extremity weakness with fasciculations is a key finding pointing towards a neuroinvasive process, specifically flaccid paralysis. The recent observation of dead birds in the neighborhood is a significant epidemiological clue, as birds are reservoirs for West Nile virus.\n\nWEST NILE VIRUS is an RNA virus transmitted by mosquitoes, which acquire the virus by feeding on infected birds. Humans are incidental hosts. The clinical spectrum of West Nile virus infection ranges from asymptomatic to West Nile fever (a self-limited, flu-like illness) to neuroinvasive disease. Neuroinvasive disease can manifest as meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis, which is characterized by asymmetric weakness of the limbs and fasciculations. The CSF typically shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis. The patient's presentation, including the neurological deficits and the epidemiological link to birds, strongly suggests West Nile virus infection.\n\n(Choice A) Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that can cause meningoencephalitis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. However, this patient has no known immunocompromise, and the presentation of focal neurological deficits with fasciculations is not typical for cryptococcal meningitis, which usually presents with more subacute symptoms like headache, lethargy, and cognitive impairment.\n\n(Choice B) Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common cause of sporadic encephalitis, typically presenting with confusion, fever, headache, and focal neurological deficits such as hemiparesis or aphasia. While HSV encephalitis can cause altered mental status and seizures, the specific finding of lower motor neuron signs like fasciculations and flaccid paralysis is less characteristic of HSV encephalitis compared to West Nile virus.\n\n(Choice C) Nonpolio enteroviruses are a common cause of viral meningitis and encephalitis, especially in children. They can cause fever, headache, and meningeal signs. However, they are not typically associated with bird vectors, and while they can cause neurological symptoms, the specific pattern of acute flaccid paralysis with fasciculations is more characteristic of West Nile virus or poliovirus.\n\n(Choice D) Polio virus causes acute flaccid paralysis, which is a key feature in this patient. However, widespread vaccination has made polio extremely rare in many parts of the world, including the United States. While polio virus can cause paralysis, the epidemiological link to dead birds makes West Nile virus a more likely culprit in this scenario, especially given the current prevalence of West Nile virus outbreaks.\n\nKey clinical pearls: The combination of fever, neurological symptoms (confusion, neck rigidity), and acute flaccid paralysis with fasciculations, especially in the context of recent exposure to dead birds, strongly points to WEST NILE VIRUS.",
