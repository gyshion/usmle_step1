    "en": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the clinic due to 4 days of worsening left ear pain. The patient was healthy until last week, when he developed a low-grade fever and congestion, which resolved prior to the sudden development of left ear pain. Vital signs are normal. On examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but nontoxic. The left external ear is nontender with manipulation and has no visible deformities. Several mobile, 1-cm, anterior cervical lymph nodes are palpated on the left side of the neck. The left tympanic membrane is erythematous and bulging; there are no visible perforations. Right ear examination is unremarkable.",

    "en": "Acute otitis media complicated by facial neuritis\n\nThis patient with ear pain and an erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane has acute otitis media (AOM), an infection of the middle ear space. AOM is common in children due to poor drainage through narrow, horizontally positioned eustachian tubes. Most cases are uncomplicated; however, patients are at risk for spread of infection to nearby structures.\n\nOne such structure is the facial nerve (CN VII), which emerges from the internal auditory meatus and travels through the middle ear into the mastoid air cells. Inflammation of the nerve in the middle ear space during an episode of AOM can result in unilateral facial paralysis. Common signs include inability to raise the eyebrow or close the eye, drooping of the corner of the mouth, and disappearance of the nasolabial fold.\n\nOther structures in close proximity to the middle ear space include mastoid air cells; direct extension of infection can cause purulent fluid to fill the air cells, leading to mastoiditis. CNS complications (eg, meningitis, brain abscess) are rare sequelae of intracranial spread.\n\n(Choices A and F) The ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses open into the superior nasal cavity and can become inflamed and filled with purulent material due to nasal congestion (eg, upper respiratory infection). However, these sinuses are not in direct contact with the middle ear space and are unlikely to be affected by AOM.\n\n(Choice B) The external jugular vein drains blood from the scalp and face. Complications (eg, thrombophlebitis) are rare; jugular thrombosis most often affects the internal jugular vein (Lemierre syndrome).\n\n(Choice C) The facial artery originates from the external carotid artery at the angle of the mandible and passes upward across the cheek, mouth, and side of the nose. In contrast, the blood supply to the ear is derived primarily from the posterior auricular artery.\n\n(Choice E) The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) travels down the neck with the internal carotid artery before entering the pharynx. The nerve provides innervation to the stylopharyngeus muscle and sensation to the posterior third of the tongue. Pathology of the middle ear is unlikely to affect this deep structure.\n\nEducational objective:\nAcute otitis media presents with an erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane and can be complicated by inflammation or infection of nearby structures. Spread of infection to the facial nerve (CN VII), which travels through the middle ear, can result in facial neuritis with unilateral facial paralysis. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "急性中耳炎并发面神经炎\n\n这位出现耳痛和鼓膜充血、膨隆的患者患有急性中耳炎 (AOM)，这是一种中耳腔感染。AOM在儿童中很常见，原因是咽鼓管狭窄、呈水平位置，导致引流不畅。大多数病例无并发症；然而，患者存在感染扩散到附近结构的风险。\n\n其中一种结构是面神经 (CN VII)，该神经从内听道口伸出，穿过中耳进入乳突气房。在AOM发作期间，中耳腔内神经发炎可导致单侧面瘫。常见体征包括无法抬眉毛或闭眼、嘴角下垂以及鼻唇沟消失。\n\n与中耳腔相邻的其他结构包括乳突气房；感染的直接蔓延可导致化脓性液体充盈气房，从而导致乳突炎。中枢神经系统并发症（如脑膜炎、脑脓肿）是颅内播散的罕见后遗症。\n\n（选项 A 和 F）筛窦和蝶窦开口于鼻腔上部，可因鼻腔充血（例如，上呼吸道感染）而发炎并充满化脓性物质。但是，这些窦与中耳腔没有直接接触，不太可能受到AOM的影响。\n\n（选项 B）颈外静脉引流来自头皮和面部的血液。并发症（如血栓性静脉炎）很少见；颈静脉血栓形成最常影响颈内静脉（Lemierre综合征）。\n\n（选项 C）面动脉起自下颌角的外颈动脉，向上穿过面颊、口腔和鼻侧。相比之下，耳朵的血液供应主要来自耳后动脉。\n\n（选项 E）舌咽神经 (CN IX) 与颈内动脉一起向下穿过颈部，然后进入咽部。该神经为茎突咽肌提供神经支配，并为舌后三分之一提供感觉。中耳病变不太可能影响这种深部结构。\n\n教育目标：\n急性中耳炎表现为鼓膜充血、膨隆，并可能因附近结构的炎症或感染而出现并发症。感染蔓延到穿过中耳的面神经 (CN VII) 可导致面神经炎，伴有单侧面瘫。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of acute otitis media (AOM) complications, specifically the risk of facial nerve involvement leading to facial paralysis. It assesses understanding of anatomical relationships within the middle ear. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the signs of AOM (erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane) and recall the anatomical structures adjacent to the middle ear. The facial nerve's proximity makes it the most vulnerable to infection spread.",
