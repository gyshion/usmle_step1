    "en": "This patient's presentation with dyspnea, tachypnea, prolonged expiration, and bilateral wheezing is suggestive of acute exacerbation of OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (asthma or COPD). Acute obstructive pulmonary exacerbations are primarily treated with BETA-ADRENERGIC AGONISTS, which produce relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle by stimulating the beta-2-adrenergic receptor. This receptor is a Gs protein-coupled receptor that activates adenylyl cyclase and increases intracellular cAMP concentrations.\n\nAsthma and COPD exacerbation are the most frequent causes of pulsus paradoxus in the absence of significant pericardial disease (pericardial effusion or constrictive pericarditis). There is a small normal variation in intrathoracic pressure with respiration, which drops 2-5 mm Hg below the atmospheric pressure during inspiration. In patients with severe asthma or COPD exacerbation, this drop in intrathoracic pressure becomes greatly exaggerated and is transmitted to extrathoracic structures. This leads to an excessive drop in blood pressure with inspiration that is detected as pulsus paradoxus.\n\n(Choice B) Cromolyn sodium inhibits mast cell degranulation and release of histamine and leukotrienes. It is used occasionally for management of chronic asthma but is not effective for immediate relief of acute asthmatic or COPD exacerbations.\n\n(Choice C) Eosinophil degranulation would be impaired by corticosteroids, which play an important role in treatment of acute asthma or COPD exacerbations. However, beta agonists provide immediate relief, whereas corticosteroids would take several hours to a few days to take effect.\n\n(Choice D) Histamine is one of several mediators released in response to a hypersensitivity reaction that can lead to bronchial smooth muscle contraction. However, antihistamine therapy is not an effective treatment for asthma or COPD exacerbation.\n\n(Choice E) Calcium channel agonists are not used in acute treatment of asthma or COPD exacerbation. On the contrary, increased calcium influx could potentially worsen bronchial smooth muscle contraction.\n\nEducational objective:\nAsthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation are the most frequent causes of pulsus paradoxus in the absence of significant pericardial disease. Beta-adrenergic agonists control acute asthma and COPD exacerbations by causing bronchial smooth muscle relaxation via increased intracellular cAMP.",
    "zh": "该患者的呼吸困难、呼吸急促、呼气延长和双侧喘息提示阻塞性肺病（哮喘或慢性阻塞性肺病，COPD）的急性加重。急性阻塞性肺病加重主要用β-肾上腺素能受体激动剂治疗，通过刺激β-2-肾上腺素能受体产生支气管平滑肌松弛。该受体是一种 Gs 蛋白偶联受体，可激活腺苷酸环化酶并增加细胞内 cAMP 浓度。\n\n哮喘和 COPD 加重是无明显心包疾病（心包积液或缩窄性心包炎）时奇脉最常见的原因。呼吸时胸腔内压力存在小的正常变化，吸气时下降 2-5 mm Hg，低于大气压。在患有严重哮喘或 COPD 加重的患者中，胸腔内压力的这种下降变得非常严重，并传递到胸外结构。这导致吸气时血压过度下降，表现为奇脉。\n\n（选项 B）色甘酸钠可抑制肥大细胞脱颗粒并释放组胺和白三烯。它偶尔用于慢性哮喘的管理，但对哮喘或 COPD 急性加重的即时缓解无效。\n\n（选项 C）嗜酸性粒细胞脱颗粒会受到皮质类固醇的抑制，皮质类固醇在治疗哮喘或 COPD 急性加重中起重要作用。然而，β-激动剂可提供即时缓解，而皮质类固醇则需要数小时到几天才能起效。\n\n（选项 D）组胺是多种介质之一，在对超敏反应的反应中释放，可导致支气管平滑肌收缩。然而，抗组胺药治疗对哮喘或 COPD 加重无效。\n\n（选项 E）钙通道激动剂不用于哮喘或 COPD 加重的急性治疗。相反，钙离子内流增加可能会加剧支气管平滑肌收缩。\n\n教育目标：\n哮喘和慢性阻塞性肺病 (COPD) 加重是无明显心包疾病时奇脉最常见的原因。β-肾上腺素能受体激动剂通过增加细胞内 cAMP 引起支气管平滑肌松弛来控制哮喘和 COPD 的急性加重。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology and treatment of acute exacerbations of obstructive pulmonary disease, specifically asthma and COPD. It assesses the mechanism of action of beta-adrenergic agonists in promoting bronchodilation through increased intracellular cAMP. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the clinical presentation as an acute exacerbation of asthma or COPD and understanding the immediate therapeutic effect of beta-adrenergic agonists on bronchial smooth muscle. By understanding the mechanism of action of these drugs, one can deduce that increasing cAMP levels is the most likely physiologic change to provide immediate relief.",
