    "en": "Adjustable gastric banding is a type of restrictive bariatric surgery designed for obese patients. The adjustable gastric band is an inflatable silicone device placed around the gastric cardia. It is intended to slow the passage of food, increasing satiety and limiting the amount of food consumed. To encircle the upper stomach, the gastric band must pass through the lesser omentum. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nThe lesser omentum is a double layer of peritoneum that extends from the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach and the beginning of the duodenum. Anatomically, the lesser omentum is divided into 2 ligaments:\n\n1.  Hepatogastric ligament: the portion connecting to the liver to the stomach\n2.  Hepatoduodenal ligament: the portion connecting to the duodenum\n\nBetween the 2 layers of the lesser omentum, close to the right-sided free margin, lie the hepatic artery, common bile duct, portal vein, lymphatics, and hepatic plexus. The right and left gastric arteries and gastric veins also lie between the 2 layers, near where the lesser omentum attaches to the stomach.\n\n(Choice A) The falciform ligament attaches the liver to the anterior body wall. It is a derivative of the embryonic ventral mesentery and contains the round ligament, the remnant of the fetal umbilical vein.\n\n(Choices B and C) The greater omentum is a large fold of visceral peritoneum that extends from the greater curvature of the stomach, travels inferiorly over the small intestine, and then reflects on itself and ascends to encompass the transverse colon before reaching the posterior abdominal wall. The gastrocolic ligament is the section that stretches from the greater curvature of the stomach to the transverse colon. It forms part of the anterior wall of the lesser sac and is often divided during surgery to provide access to the anterior pancreas and posterior wall of the stomach.\n\n(Choice E) The splenorenal ligament is derived from the peritoneum and lies between the left kidney and the spleen. It contains the splenic vessels and the tail of the pancreas.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nThe lesser omentum is a double layer of peritoneum that extends from the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach and the beginning of the duodenum. It is divided into the hepatogastric and hepatoduodenal ligaments.",
    "zh": "可调节胃束带是一种针对肥胖患者的限制性减肥手术。可调节胃束带是一种放置在胃贲门周围的可充气硅胶装置。其目的是减缓食物的通过，增加饱腹感并限制食物摄入量。为了环绕上部胃部，胃束带必须穿过小网膜。 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n小网膜是腹膜的双层结构，从肝脏延伸到胃的小弯和十二指肠的起始处。从解剖学上讲，小网膜分为 2 个韧带：\n\n1. 肝胃韧带：连接肝脏和胃的部分\n2. 肝十二指肠韧带：连接十二指肠的部分\n\n在小网膜的 2 层之间，靠近右侧游离缘，有肝动脉、胆总管、门静脉、淋巴管和肝丛。右侧和左侧胃动脉和胃静脉也位于 2 层之间，靠近小网膜附着于胃的地方。\n\n（选项 A）镰状韧带将肝脏连接到腹前壁。它是胚胎腹侧肠系膜的衍生物，包含脐圆韧带，即胎儿脐静脉的残余物。\n\n（选项 B 和 C）大网膜是内脏腹膜的大褶皱，从胃的大弯延伸，向下穿过小肠，然后自身反射并上升以包围横结肠，然后到达腹后壁。胃结肠韧带是胃大弯延伸到横结肠的部分。它形成小囊前壁的一部分，并且经常在手术中被切开，以便进入胰腺前部和胃后壁。\n\n（选项 E）脾肾韧带源自腹膜，位于左肾和脾脏之间。它包含脾血管和胰腺尾部。\n\n教育目标：\n\n小网膜是腹膜的双层结构，从肝脏延伸到胃的小弯和十二指肠的起始处。它分为肝胃韧带和肝十二指肠韧带。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the anatomical structures surrounding the stomach, specifically the omenta and ligaments, and their relevance to surgical procedures like adjustable gastric banding. It requires understanding the spatial relationships of these structures to determine which one the gastric band must pass through.\n\nTo solve this question, visualize the placement of the adjustable gastric band around the upper stomach and consider the anatomical attachments and locations of each listed structure. Eliminate options that are not directly adjacent to the stomach's cardia.",
