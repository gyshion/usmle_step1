    "en": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to sudden-onset, left-sided facial droop and arm weakness. The patient has also had right leg swelling after a recent road trip. She has no chronic medical conditions, and her only medication is an oral contraceptive pill. CT scan of the head reveals an acute infarction in the right middle cerebral artery territory. Lower extremity ultrasonography demonstrates a right femoral vein thrombus. No obvious cardiac structural abnormalities are detected on echocardiography. Agitated normal saline is injected into a peripheral vein to evaluate for abnormal right-to-left shunting. No bubbles are seen in the left side of the heart after several minutes. Which of the following is most appropriate for increasing right-sided heart pressure to reveal an obscured intracardiac shunt?",

    "en": "This patient has deep vein thrombosis and has experienced a large stroke, suggesting PARADOXICAL EMBOLIZATION of thrombus (ie, passage from the venous circulation to the arterial circulation). Because thrombi are too large to pass through the pulmonary capillaries, paradoxical embolization typically occurs via an INTRACARDIAC RIGHT-TO-LEFT SHUNT. In this case, echocardiography did not reveal overt septal abnormalities (ie, atrial or ventricular septal defect), raising strong suspicion for a PATENT FORAMEN OVALE (PFO). {{exhibit_1}}\nPFO is common, affecting up to 30% of adults. It results from failure of the septum primum and septum secundum to fuse during early childhood, creating a ONE-WAY VALVE. This valve is forced closed when left atrial pressure exceeds right atrial pressure (which is most of the time), but it opens when right atrial pressure EXCEEDS left atrial pressure, allowing for transient right-to-left shunting.\n\nIn testing for a PFO, normal saline bubbles are injected intravenously, and echocardiography is performed to observe whether the bubbles pass from the right atrium into the left atrium. The release phase of the VALSALVA MANEUVER increases venous return to the right atrium and consequently increases right atrial pressure to facilitate right-to-left shunting of saline bubbles. In contrast, the strain phase of Valsalva maneuver decreases venous return to the right atrium and discourages shunting through a PFO.\n\n(Choices A, B, and C) Medications and physiologic maneuvers that reduce venous return to the right atrium discourage right-to-left shunting through a PFO. Abrupt standing from a supine position causes blood to pool in the lower extremities, amyl nitrite (an inhaled nitrite) causes venous vasodilation, and exhalation causes increased intrathoracic pressure (resulting in partial collapse of the inferior vena cava at end-expiration), all of which reduce venous return to the right atrium.\n\n(Choice D) Sustained handgrip increases systemic vascular resistance, increasing pressure in the left ventricle and left atrium and discouraging shunting through a PFO.\n\nEducational objective:\nParadoxical embolization, or passage of a thromboembolism from the venous to the arterial circulation, most commonly occurs through a patent foramen ovale (PFO). A PFO is a one-way tissue valve in the atrial septum that opens only when right exceeds left atrial pressure; venous return to the right atrium increases during the release pass through the pulmonary capillaries, paradoxical embolization typically occurs via an INTRACARDIAC right-to-left shunt (ie, relaxation) phase of the Valsalva maneuver and encourages the PFO to open. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有深静脉血栓形成并经历了大规模中风，提示血栓的悖论性栓塞（即，从静脉循环进入动脉循环）。由于血栓太大而无法通过肺毛细血管，悖论性栓塞通常通过腔内心右向左分流发生。在这种情况下，超声心动图未显示明显的间隔异常（即，心房或心室间隔缺损），这强烈提示卵圆孔未闭（PFO）。{{exhibit_1}} PFO很常见，影响高达30%的成年人。它是由胚胎早期原发间隔和继发间隔融合失败引起的，从而形成一个单向瓣膜。当左心房压力超过右心房压力（大多数情况下）时，该瓣膜被强制关闭，但当右心房压力超过左心房压力时，它会打开，从而允许短暂的右向左分流。\n\n在测试PFO时，静脉内注射生理盐水气泡，并进行超声心动图检查，以观察气泡是否从右心房进入左心房。Valsalva动作的释放期增加了静脉回流到右心房，从而增加了右心房压力，以促进生理盐水气泡的右向左分流。相比之下，Valsalva动作的屏气期减少了静脉回流到右心房，并阻止了通过PFO的分流。\n\n（选项A、B和C）减少静脉回流到右心房的药物和生理操作会阻止通过PFO的右向左分流。从仰卧位突然站立会导致血液积聚在下肢，亚硝酸异戊酯（一种吸入的亚硝酸盐）会导致静脉血管舒张，呼气会导致胸腔内压力增加（导致呼气末下腔静脉部分塌陷），所有这些都会减少静脉回流到右心房。\n\n（选项D）持续握拳会增加全身血管阻力，从而增加左心室和左心房的压力，并阻止通过PFO的分流。\n\n教育目标：\n悖论性栓塞，或血栓栓塞从静脉循环进入动脉循环，最常见的是通过卵圆孔未闭（PFO）发生。PFO是心房间隔中的一个单向组织瓣膜，仅当右心房压力超过左心房压力时才打开；在释放 Valsalva 动作（即放松）期间，肺毛细血管的静脉回流到右心房增加，悖论性栓塞通常通过腔内心右向左分流发生，并促进 PFO 打开。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of paradoxical embolization through a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and the physiological maneuvers that can increase right atrial pressure to facilitate the detection of a PFO during echocardiography. Specifically, it focuses on the Valsalva maneuver and its effect on venous return and atrial pressures. \n\nThe best approach is to understand the pathophysiology of paradoxical embolization and the effect of different maneuvers on venous return and atrial pressures. The Valsalva maneuver release phase increases venous return, thereby increasing right atrial pressure and promoting right-to-left shunting through a PFO.",
