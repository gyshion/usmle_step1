  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Blotchy red muscle fibers on Gomori trichrome stain are characteristic of the mitochondrial myopathies. In these conditions, abnormal mitochondria accumulate under the sarcolemma of muscle fibers. The fibers have an irregular shape and size on cross section. For this reason, the mitochondrial myopathies are also known as the \"red ragged fiber\" diseases. Electron microscopy of the affected muscle reveals an increased number of enlarged, abnormally shaped mitochondria.\n\nThe most important mitochondrial myopathies are myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF, described in this vignette), Leber optic neuropathy (blindness), and mitochondrial encephalopathy with stroke-like episodes and lactic acidosis (MELAS). Each of these diseases is the result of a mitochondrial gene mutation.\n\nThe mitochondrial diseases are caused by mutations, deletions or duplications of mtDNA. Because sperm mitochondria do not pass into the ovum during fertilization, only maternal mitochondria are transmitted to the fetus. Mitochondrial diseases, therefore, have maternal inheritance. For this reason the male patient described in this vignette will not transmit the disease to his progeny.\n\n(Choice B) No pure single-gene inherited disease shows 75% transmission. There may be 75% transmission for a disease with variable penetrance.\n\nIndividuals affected by a disease with autosomal dominant inheritance receive one copy of the abnormal gene from one parent. The chance that an affected person will transmit the disease to his/her child is 50% (Choice C) if the parent is heterozygous for the given disease. If the parent is homozygous, there is a 100% chance (Choice A) of transmission.\n\n(Choice D) Autosomal recessive diseases occur when the individual inherits two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent). If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance that the child will be affected.\n\nEducational Objective:\n\"Red ragged\" muscle fibers are seen in mitochondrial diseases. Muscle fibers have this appearance because abnormal mitochondria accumulate under the sarcolemma. Mitochondrial diseases show maternal inheritance.",
    "zh": "Gomori 三色染色显示的斑驳红色肌纤维是线粒体肌病的特征。在这些疾病中，异常的线粒体聚集在肌纤维的肌膜下。这些纤维在横截面上呈不规则的形状和大小。因此，线粒体肌病也被称为“红色褴褛纤维”病。受影响肌肉的电子显微镜检查显示增大的、形状异常的线粒体数量增加。\n\n最重要的线粒体肌病包括伴有红色褴褛纤维的肌阵挛性癫痫（MERRF，在此小插曲中描述）、Leber 遗传性视神经病变（失明）和伴有卒中样发作和乳酸酸中毒的线粒体脑病（MELAS）。这些疾病中的每一种都是线粒体基因突变的结果。\n\n线粒体疾病是由 mtDNA 的突变、缺失或重复引起的。由于精子线粒体在受精过程中不会进入卵子，只有母系线粒体才会传递给胎儿。因此，线粒体疾病具有母系遗传的特征。因此，本小插曲中描述的男性患者不会将这种疾病传递给他的后代。\n\n（选项 B）没有纯粹的单基因遗传疾病显示出 75% 的传递率。对于具有可变外显率的疾病，可能存在 75% 的传递率。\n\n受常染色体显性遗传疾病影响的个体从一个父母那里获得异常基因的一个拷贝。如果父母对给定的疾病是杂合子，受影响的人将疾病传递给他的孩子是 50%（选项 C）。如果父母是纯合子，则有 100%（选项 A）的传递几率。\n\n（选项 D）常染色体隐性遗传病发生在个体从每个父母那里继承了两个突变基因拷贝（一个来自每个父母）时。如果父母都是携带者，那么孩子有 25% 的几率受到影响。\n\n教育目标：\n在线粒体疾病中可见“红色褴褛”肌纤维。肌纤维具有这种外观，因为异常线粒体聚集在肌膜下。线粒体疾病表现为母系遗传。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of mitochondrial myopathies, specifically their characteristic histopathological findings and their pattern of inheritance. It requires the student to recognize that mitochondrial diseases are maternally inherited and therefore cannot be passed from an affected father to his offspring.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the condition described as a mitochondrial myopathy based on the clinical presentation and biopsy findings. Then, recall or deduce the mode of inheritance for mitochondrial diseases, which is exclusively maternal. This knowledge directly leads to the conclusion that an affected male cannot transmit the disease to his children.",
