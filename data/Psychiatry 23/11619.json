    "en": "A 52-year-old woman comes to the office for a checkup. Her medical problems include hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. The patient has a long-standing relationship with her primary care physician, who has treated her children as well. During the examination, she confides that she has been \"down\" since her youngest child left for college 2 months ago. The patient is worried about her daughter being away from home for the first time and whether she will be successful at school. At work, the patient occasionally has lapses of concentration when worrying about whether her daughter is okay, but it has not affected her productivity. She says, \"I still enjoy going out with my husband but all we do is talk about our kids.\" The patient has occasional insomnia and tension headaches but notes that these are nothing new. Physical examination is normal.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Periods of sadness are a normal part of human experience and should not be diagnosed as a psychiatric disorder unless criteria are met for severity, duration, and clinically significant distress or impairment. This patient's mild depression in response to life changes is consistent with NORMAL SADNESS. She does not meet the full criteria for any disorder. In addition, her insomnia and headaches are no different from her baseline. Significantly, her SOCIAL AND OCCUPATIONAL FUNCTIONING IS NOT IMPAIRED, which is a DSM-5 requirement for the diagnosis of most psychiatric disorders, including adjustment disorders.\n\n(Choice A) Adjustment disorder involves the development of anxiety and/or depression symptoms within 3 months of the onset of the stressor with associated marked distress (exceeding what would normally be expected) and/or significant functional impairment.\n\n(Choice B) The duration and severity of this patient's worry about her daughter are not sufficient for a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. This disorder requires ≥ 6 months of excessive worry and anxiety about multiple issues.\n\n(Choices C and E) A diagnosis of major depressive disorder requires a 2-week period of ≥ 5 of 9 symptoms; depressed mood, decreased interest/pleasure, appetite disturbance, sleep disturbance, psychomotor agitation/retardation, loss of energy, excessive guilt, low energy, impaired concentration, and suicidal ideation. In persistent depressive disorder, depressive symptoms last ≥ 2 years.\n\nEducational objective: Evaluation of depressive symptoms occurring in response to psychosocial stressors must take into account the severity, duration, and degree of functional impairment. Mild or brief sadness without significant interference in psychosocial functioning is consistent with normal sadness.",
    "zh": "悲伤时期是人类经历的正常部分，除非符合严重程度、持续时间和临床上显著的痛苦或损害的标准，否则不应诊断为精神疾病。该患者对生活变化的轻度抑郁症与正常悲伤相符。她没有完全符合任何疾病的标准。此外，她的失眠和头痛与她的基线没有区别。重要的是，她的社会和职业功能并未受损，这是诊断大多数精神疾病（包括适应障碍）的DSM-5要求。\n\n（选项A）适应障碍涉及在应激源发病后3个月内出现焦虑和/或抑郁症状，并伴有明显的痛苦（超出正常预期）和/或显著的功能障碍。\n\n（选项B）该患者对女儿的担忧的持续时间和严重程度不足以诊断为广泛性焦虑症。该病需要≥6个月的对多个问题的过度担忧和焦虑。\n\n（选项C和E）诊断重度抑郁障碍需要持续2周，并出现≥9种症状中的5种：抑郁情绪、兴趣/快乐减少、食欲紊乱、睡眠紊乱、精神运动性激动/迟滞、精力丧失、过度内疚、低能量、注意力受损和自杀意念。在持续性抑郁障碍中，抑郁症状持续≥2年。\n\n教育目标：评估对社会心理应激源的反应中出现的抑郁症状时，必须考虑严重程度、持续时间和功能障碍程度。在社会心理功能未受显著干扰的情况下，轻度或短暂的悲伤与正常悲伤相符。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to differentiate between normal sadness in response to life stressors and clinical psychiatric disorders such as adjustment disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder. It emphasizes the diagnostic criteria for these conditions, particularly the requirement for significant functional impairment.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully evaluate the patient's symptoms against the diagnostic criteria for each listed disorder. Key factors to consider include the duration and severity of symptoms, the presence of functional impairment (social, occupational, or academic), and whether the symptoms exceed a normal stress response to a life event.",
    "zh": "此题测试区分对生活应激源的正常悲伤与临床精神疾病（如适应障碍、广泛性焦虑症和重度抑郁症）的能力。它强调了这些疾病的诊断标准，特别是对显著功能障碍的要求。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须根据每种所列疾病的诊断标准仔细评估患者的症状。需要考虑的关键因素包括症状的持续时间和严重程度、功能障碍（社会、职业或学业）的存在，以及症状是否超出了对生活事件的正常应激反应。"
