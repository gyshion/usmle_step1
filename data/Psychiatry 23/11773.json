    "en": "A 62-year-old woman comes to the office for a checkup. Her husband died 5 months ago in a biking accident, which she witnessed. She has little appetite, resulting in weight loss of 3.17 kg (7 lb), and tends to wake up two hours before her alarm clock rings. The patient feels overwhelmed at having to manage the household finances, saying, \"My husband always took care of the bills so I wouldn't have to worry.\" She avoids cycling, a hobby she shared with her husband, but continues to volunteer at a children's hospital. The patient has no nightmares or suicidal thoughts. During the visit, she tears up intermittently but smiles when sharing a memory of a vacation she took with her husband.",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's sadness, insomnia, and decreased appetite are consistent with a NORMAL GRIEF REACTION precipitated by the loss of a loved one (bereavement). In a normal grief reaction, the sadness revolves around FEELINGS OF LOSS and typically occurs in \"waves\" intermixed with POSITIVE MEMORIES of the deceased. For most, the natural mourning process lasts 6-12 months and is followed by the integration of grief, in which the individual continues to feel transient but less pronounced sadness, and life plans/routines have adapted to living without the deceased.\n\nNormal grief can resemble a MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODE as both may include intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss. However, this woman's positive memories about her husband, ability to continue volunteering, and lack of other depressive symptoms (eg, hopelessness, feelings of low self-worth, guilt, suicidal ideation) make major depression less likely (Choice B). A major depressive disorder can be diagnosed during a grief reaction if a sufficient number and severity of depressive symptoms are present.\n\n(Choice A) Dependent personality disorder is diagnosed when there is a lifelong pattern of excessive need to be taken care of, leading to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation.\n\n(Choice D) Persistent complex bereavement disorder (also known as complicated grief) is characterized by prolonged grief for >12 months, difficulty accepting the death, persistent yearning for the deceased, and inability to reengage with life. This patient's symptom duration is within the normal range for grief, and she is showing signs of adapting to living without the deceased.\n\n(Choice E) Persistent depressive disorder is a chronic depression that persists for at least 2 years.\n\n(Choice F) Although this patient witnessed her husband's accident and avoids cycling, her symptoms are not consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder as she is not re-experiencing the event (eg, nightmares, flashbacks) or having symptoms of trauma-related reactivity (eg, hypervigilance, heightened startle response).\n\nEducational objective: Normal grief presents with symptoms similar to those of a major depressive episode. However, in normal grief, pervasive anhedonia, worthlessness, and suicidality are not present.",
    "zh": "该患者的悲伤、失眠和食欲下降与因失去亲人（丧亲）而引发的正常悲伤反应一致。在正常的悲伤反应中，悲伤围绕着失落感，并且通常以“波浪”的形式出现，与对已故者的积极回忆交织在一起。对于大多数人来说，自然的哀悼过程持续6-12个月，随后是悲伤的整合，在这种整合中，个体继续感到短暂但不太明显的悲伤，并且生活计划/日常安排已经适应了没有已故者的生活。\n\n正常悲伤可能类似于重度抑郁发作，因为两者都可能包括强烈的悲伤、对失去的沉思、失眠、食欲不振和体重减轻。然而，这位女性对丈夫的积极回忆、继续志愿服务的能，以及缺乏其他抑郁症状（例如，无望感、自卑感、内疚感、自杀意念）使得重度抑郁症的可能性降低（选项B）。如果在悲伤反应期间出现足够数量和严重程度的抑郁症状，则可以诊断为重度抑郁症。\n\n（选项A）依赖型人格障碍的诊断标准是存在终生的过度需要被照顾的模式，导致顺从和依恋行为以及对分离的恐惧。\n\n（选项D）持续性复杂性悲伤障碍（也称为复杂性悲伤）的特征是持续超过12个月的悲伤、难以接受死亡、对已故者持续的思念，以及无法重新融入生活。该患者的症状持续时间在悲伤的正常范围内，并且她正在表现出适应没有已故者生活迹象。\n\n（选项E）持续性抑郁障碍是一种慢性抑郁症，至少持续2年。\n\n（选项F）虽然这位患者目睹了她丈夫的事故并避免骑自行车，但她的症状与创伤后应激障碍不符，因为她没有再次体验事件（例如，噩梦、闪回），也没有出现与创伤相关的反应症状（例如，过度警觉、惊吓反应增强）。\n\n教育目标：正常悲伤的症状与重度抑郁发作的症状相似。然而，在正常悲伤中，不存在普遍的快感缺失、无价值感和自杀倾向。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to differentiate between normal grief and pathological grief reactions, specifically major depressive disorder and persistent complex bereavement disorder. It requires understanding the diagnostic criteria for these conditions and recognizing the key features that distinguish normal mourning from clinical depression.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully evaluate the patient's symptoms in the context of her recent loss. Look for the presence of \"waves\" of sadness, positive memories, and the ability to continue with daily functioning and social engagement, which are characteristic of normal grief. Rule out other diagnoses by assessing for the core features of major depression, complicated grief, and PTSD.",
