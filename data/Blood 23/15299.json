    "en": "A 62-year-old woman comes to the office due to a month of progressive right chest and back pain. The patient also noticed a right breast lump several months ago, which has grown over time. She has no prior medical issues, has not seen a physician for many years, and has had no cancer screenings. Physical examination reveals a hard, 5-cm right breast mass, enlarged axillary lymph nodes, and point tenderness along the right-sided ribs and 10th thoracic vertebra. Biopsy of the breast mass shows hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, invasive ductal carcinoma. Skeletal survey demonstrates lytic lesions of the ribs and thoracic vertebrae. As part of the treatment regimen, the patient receives a medication that is a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase. Which of the following is the most likely dose-limiting toxicity of this medication?",
    "zh": "一名62岁的女性因进行性右胸和背部疼痛一个月来就诊。患者几个月前还注意到右乳房出现肿块，并且肿块随着时间的推移而增大。她之前没有任何医疗问题，多年未就医，也未接受过癌症筛查。体格检查显示右乳房出现一个5厘米的硬块，腋下淋巴结肿大，右侧肋骨和第10胸椎有压痛。乳房肿块活检显示激素受体阳性、HER2阴性的浸润性导管癌。骨骼调查显示肋骨和胸椎有溶骨性病变。作为治疗方案的一部分，患者接受了一种药物，该药物是细胞周期蛋白依赖性激酶的强效抑制剂。以下哪一项最可能是这种药物的剂量限制性毒性？"

    "en": "CDK4/6 inhibitors\n\nThe cellular growth cycle consists of 4 distinct phases: G1, S, G2, and M. Progression through the phases is controlled by surveillance systems (checkpoints) that interrupt the cell cycle and/or induce apoptosis if cells do not meet the requirements to progress forward:\n\n•\tThe transition from G1→S (initiation of DNA replication) is controlled by a combination of cell size and nutrient status, exposure to growth factors, and proper surveillance and repair of damaged DNA.\n•\tAt the G2→M transition, the cell again checks for DNA damage and repairs replication errors before they can be passed on to daughter cells during mitosis. An additional spindle checkpoint ensures that duplicated chromosomes separate appropriately during cell division.\n\nCyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6 control cell cycle progression from G1→S. These CDKs are activated by cyclin D and subsequently inhibit the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, leading to the upregulation of transcriptional factors that progress the cell cycle to S phase. Many cancers exploit this crucial checkpoint and achieve unregulated cellular growth via cyclin D amplification (or inactivating mutations to retinoblastoma gene).\n\nCDK 4/6 inhibitors (eg, palbociclib) can be used to block the cyclin D binding site on CDK, which results in decreased CDK 4/6 activation, increased activity of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, and cell cycle arrest. Although CDK 4/6 inhibitors are generally well tolerated, they often inhibit cellular replication in other rapidly dividing cells, particularly hematologic cells in the bone marrow. This can result in treatment-limiting hematologic side effects such as neutropenia, leukopenia, and anemia.\n\n(Choice C) Immunotherapy that targets PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 enhances the immune response against cancer and is often used in the treatment of malignant melanoma. The major side effects of these medications are autoimmune-related adverse events, including skin, liver, gastrointestinal, and endocrine inflammation.\n\n(Choices B, D, and E) CDK 4/6 inhibitors do not generally cause adverse side effects in cells that are arrested in G0, such as myocytes, cochlear hair cells, or neurons. Cardiomyopathy is a common side effect of anthracyclines (eg, doxorubicin) and HER2 antibodies (eg, trastuzumab). Sensorineural hearing loss can be seen with platinum-based chemotherapy (eg, cisplatin). Peripheral neuropathy is a common side effect of vincristine and bortezomib.\n\nEducational objective:\nCyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4/6 regulate the movement of cells from G→S phase. Cancers often have mutations that enhance the activity or downstream effects of CDK 4/6, which contribute to unregulated cellular growth. Inhibitors to CDK 4/6 can be used to treat certain forms of cancer. However, they can inhibit cellular replication in other rapidly dividing cells such as the hematologic cells in the bone marrow (eg, neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia). {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "CDK4/6抑制剂\n\n细胞生长周期由4个不同的阶段组成：G1、S、G2和M。通过各个阶段的进展由监视系统（检查点）控制，这些系统会中断细胞周期和/或诱导细胞凋亡，如果细胞未满足向前进展的要求：\n\n•\t从G1→S（DNA复制的起始）的转变受细胞大小和营养状态、暴露于生长因子以及对受损DNA的适当监视和修复的综合控制。\n•\t在G2→M的转变中，细胞再次检查DNA损伤，并在有丝分裂过程中传递给子细胞之前修复复制错误。另外一个纺锤体检查点确保在细胞分裂过程中复制的染色体适当分离。\n\n细胞周期蛋白依赖性激酶（CDKs）4和6控制细胞周期从G1→S的进展。这些CDK被细胞周期蛋白D激活，随后抑制视网膜母细胞瘤抑癌蛋白，导致转录因子的上调，从而使细胞周期进入S期。许多癌症利用这个关键的检查点，通过细胞周期蛋白D扩增（或视网膜母细胞瘤基因的失活突变）实现不受控制的细胞生长。\n\nCDK 4/6抑制剂（如palbociclib）可用于阻断CDK上的细胞周期蛋白D结合位点，从而导致CDK 4/6活化降低，视网膜母细胞瘤抑癌蛋白的活性增加，并导致细胞周期停滞。虽然CDK 4/6抑制剂通常耐受性良好，但它们经常抑制其他快速分裂细胞的细胞复制，特别是骨髓中的血液细胞。这可能导致治疗限制性的血液学副作用，如中性粒细胞减少症、白细胞减少症和贫血。\n\n（选项C）靶向PD-1、PD-L1和CTLA-4的免疫疗法可增强针对癌症的免疫反应，常用于恶性黑色素瘤的治疗。这些药物的主要副作用是与自身免疫相关的不良事件，包括皮肤、肝脏、胃肠道和内分泌炎症。\n\n（选项B、D和E）CDK 4/6抑制剂通常不会在G0期停滞的细胞中引起不良副作用，如心肌细胞、耳蜗毛细胞或神经元。心肌病是蒽环类药物（如阿霉素）和HER2抗体（如曲妥珠单抗）的常见副作用。铂类化疗药物（如顺铂）可引起感觉神经性听力损失。长春新碱和硼替佐米的常见副作用是周围神经病变。\n\n教育目标：\n细胞周期蛋白依赖性激酶（CDKs）4/6调节细胞从G→S期的运动。癌症通常具有增强CDK 4/6活性或下游效应的突变，这有助于不受控制的细胞生长。CDK 4/6的抑制剂可用于治疗某些类型的癌症。然而，它们可以抑制其他快速分裂细胞的细胞复制，如骨髓中的血液细胞（例如，中性粒细胞减少症、贫血或血小板减少症）。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action and side effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors, specifically their impact on rapidly dividing cells in the bone marrow. It requires understanding of cell cycle regulation and how these inhibitors disrupt cancer cell proliferation. \n\nThe best approach is to recall that CDK4/6 inhibitors target cell cycle progression and have a predilection for rapidly dividing cells. Recognizing that bone marrow cells are rapidly dividing helps identify bone marrow suppression as the most likely dose-limiting toxicity.",
