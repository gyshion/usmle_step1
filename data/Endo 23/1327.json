    "en": "A 58-year-old man is hospitalized due to sudden onset of chest pain. Blood pressure is 160/110 mm Hg and pulse is 90/min. BMI is 26.9 kg/m². A baseline ECG shows nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, and serial troponin measurements are normal. The patient's fasting plasma glucose level is 160 mg/dL, although he has not been diagnosed previously with diabetes mellitus. Serum triglyceride level is elevated, and the HDL level is low. Which of the following additional findings would be most suggestive of increased insulin resistance in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient has hypertension and likely type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary defects in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes include defective insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Insulin resistance is caused by a number of genetic (eg, insulin receptor and postreceptor mutations) and environmental factors (eg, lack of physical activity, obesity).\n\nAn adipose body habitus is commonly associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In particular, excess visceral fat (surrounding internal organs) correlates much more strongly with insulin resistance than does subcutaneous fat. Measurement of waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio is an effective indirect assessment of visceral fat, especially in patients who are overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m²) or mildly obese (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m²). A waist circumference >102 cm (40 in) in men and >88 cm (35 in) in women is associated with a higher risk of insulin resistance.\n\nThe association of insulin resistance, increased visceral adiposity (ie, increased waist circumference), hypertension, and serum lipid abnormalities (high triglyceride levels, low HDL levels) is known as metabolic syndrome (sometimes called syndrome X). Patients with metabolic syndrome have increased rates of cardiovascular events and warrant careful risk factor management.\n\n(Choice A) Insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis and promotes glycogen synthesis in the liver. In patients with insulin resistance, the inhibitory effect of insulin on gluconeogenesis is reduced, leading to increased hepatic glucose production.\n\n(Choice B) High LDL levels are an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic heart disease in patients with diabetes, but are not directly associated with increased insulin resistance. In contrast, insulin resistance is associated with high triglyceride and low HDL levels.\n\n(Choice C) High urinary excretion of ketones suggests absolute insulin deficiency, as seen in type 1 diabetes, rather than insulin resistance. Patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance typically have high circulating insulin levels that are more than adequate to suppress ketone formation.\n\n(Choice D) Skeletal muscle is a major repository for ingested glucose due to insulin-mediated glucose uptake. In patients with insulin resistance, decreased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle leads to reduced glycogen synthesis and higher blood glucose levels.\n\nEducational objective: Visceral obesity as measured by waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio is an important predictor of insulin resistance.",
    "zh": "该患者患有高血压，可能患有2型糖尿病。2型糖尿病病理生理学的主要缺陷包括胰腺β细胞胰岛素分泌缺陷和外周组织胰岛素抵抗。胰岛素抵抗是由多种遗传因素（如，胰岛素受体和受体后突变）和环境因素（如缺乏体力活动、肥胖）引起的。\n\n脂肪体型通常与胰岛素抵抗和2型糖尿病相关。特别是，过多的内脏脂肪（围绕内脏器官）与胰岛素抵抗的相关性远强于皮下脂肪。测量腰围或腰臀比是对内脏脂肪的有效间接评估，尤其是在超重（BMI 25-29.9 kg/m²）或轻度肥胖（BMI 30-34.9 kg/m²）的患者中。男性腰围>102 cm (40 in)和女性腰围>88 cm (35 in)与胰岛素抵抗的风险增加相关。\n\n胰岛素抵抗、内脏脂肪增加（即，腰围增加）、高血压和血脂异常（甘油三酯水平高、HDL水平低）的关联被称为代谢综合征（有时称为X综合征）。代谢综合征患者心血管事件的发生率增加，需要仔细的风险因素管理。\n\n(选项A) 胰岛素抑制肝糖异生并促进肝脏糖原合成。在胰岛素抵抗患者中，胰岛素对糖异生的抑制作用减弱，导致肝脏葡萄糖生成增加。\n\n(选项B) LDL水平高是糖尿病患者动脉粥样硬化性心脏病的独立危险因素，但与胰岛素抵抗增加没有直接关系。相比之下，胰岛素抵抗与甘油三酯高和HDL水平低有关。\n\n(选项C) 尿酮体高提示绝对胰岛素缺乏，如在1型糖尿病中所见，而不是胰岛素抵抗。2型糖尿病和胰岛素抵抗患者通常具有足够抑制酮体形成的循环胰岛素水平。\n\n(选项D) 由于胰岛素介导的葡萄糖摄取，骨骼肌是摄入葡萄糖的主要储存库。在胰岛素抵抗患者中，骨骼肌中葡萄糖摄取减少导致糖原合成减少和血糖水平升高。\n\n教育目标：通过腰围或腰臀比衡量的内脏肥胖是胰岛素抵抗的重要预测指标。"

It assesses the ability to recognize clinical features indicative of insulin resistance, particularly visceral adiposity.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key features of insulin resistance, such as elevated triglycerides, low HDL, hypertension, and increased waist circumference.
