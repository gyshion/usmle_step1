Temperature is 40.1 C (104.2 F), blood pressure is 105/75 mm Hg, pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 32/min. Examination shows inspiratory stridor and supraclavicular retractions. Lateral neck x-ray is shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}. The patient is admitted to the hospital, and blood cultures are obtained. If blood cultures are positive, which of the following would most likely be seen on Gram stain?",

    "en": "This child has high fever and rapidly progressive respiratory distress (eg, retractions, stridor) with a swollen epiglottis (\"thumbprint sign\") on lateral neck x-ray. These findings are consistent with epiglottitis, an uncommon but potentially fatal infection of the upper airway. Progressive epiglottic inflammation can also cause dysphagia and drooling with pooled oral secretions, and the potential for acute airway obstruction makes rapid diagnosis critical.\n\nEpiglottitis once occurred mainly in young children (age ~3) due to high rates of infection with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). With widespread vaccination against Hib, rates of epiglottitis dramatically declined; now, adults and school-aged children are more commonly affected. H influenzae remains the most common pathogen, including Hib (due to waning immunity) and nontypeable strains for which there are no vaccines. Hib epiglottitis is often associated with concomitant bacteremia, and Gram stain would show gram-negative coccobacilli consistent with H influenzae.\n\n(Choices A and C) Gram-negative cocci (eg, Moraxella in pairs) and rods (eg, Klebsiella in pairs or short chains) are rare causes of epiglottitis. In addition, associated bacteremia is far more likely when Hib is the causative pathogen due to its highly virulent capsule.\n\n(Choices D and E) Gram-positive organisms (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae in chains, Staphylococcus aureus in clusters) are less common causes of epiglottitis. Although the number of epiglottitis cases caused by these organisms (particularly S pneumoniae) has increased since widespread vaccination against Hib, the combined strains of H influenzae still occur more frequently than any other organism.\n\nEducational objective:\nEpiglottitis causes rapidly progressive respiratory distress and a swollen epiglottis (\"thumbprint sign\") on lateral neck x-ray. The most common pathogen is Haemophilus influenzae (ie, type b, nontypeable strains), a gram-negative coccobacillus that often causes concomitant bacteremia. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该儿童出现高热和快速进展的呼吸窘迫（如凹陷、喘鸣），侧位颈部X线片显示会厌肿胀（“拇指印征”）。这些发现与会厌炎一致，会厌炎是一种不常见但可能致命的上呼吸道感染。进行性会厌炎症也可能导致吞咽困难和流涎，口腔分泌物积聚，急性气道阻塞的可能性使得快速诊断至关重要。\n\n会厌炎曾经主要发生在幼儿（约3岁）中，因为嗜血杆菌流感嗜血杆菌b型（Hib）的感染率很高。随着Hib疫苗的广泛接种，会厌炎的发病率急剧下降；现在，成人和学龄儿童更常受到影响。 H流感嗜血杆菌仍然是最常见的病原体，包括Hib（由于免疫力下降）和无疫苗可用的非分型菌株。Hib会厌炎常伴有并发菌血症，革兰染色将显示与流感嗜血杆菌一致的革兰阴性球杆菌。\n\n（选项A和C）革兰阴性球菌（例如，成对的莫拉菌）和杆菌（例如，成对或短链的克雷伯菌）是会厌炎的罕见原因。此外，当Hib是病原体时，相关菌血症更有可能发生，这归因于其高毒力的荚膜。\n\n（选项D和E）革兰阳性生物（例如，链状排列的肺炎链球菌，簇状排列的金黄色葡萄球菌）是会厌炎的较不常见原因。尽管自广泛接种Hib疫苗以来，由这些生物（尤其是肺炎链球菌）引起的会厌炎病例数量有所增加，但流感嗜血杆菌的组合菌株仍然比任何其他生物更常发生。\n\n教育目标：\n会厌炎会导致快速进展的呼吸窘迫，并且在侧位颈部X线片上出现肿胀的会厌（“拇指印征”）。最常见的病原体是流感嗜血杆菌（即b型，非分型菌株），一种革兰阴性球杆菌，通常引起并发菌血症。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of epiglottitis, its clinical presentation, and the most likely causative organism. It also assesses the ability to interpret a lateral neck x-ray and correlate it with the clinical findings.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the signs and symptoms of epiglottitis (rapidly progressive respiratory distress, fever, stridor) and the characteristic \"thumbprint sign\" on lateral neck x-ray. Recall that Haemophilus influenzae is the most common cause, and it is a gram-negative coccobacillus.",
