    "en": "A 26-year-old woman comes to the office due to several weeks of pain and muffled hearing in the left ear, along with a sensation of jaw clicking when chewing food. The patient has had episodic headaches and left-sided facial pain for several years that is worse when moving her jaw. She also has been told that she grinds her teeth while asleep. On examination, the patient is unable to fully open her mouth and reports pain with passive movement of the jaw. The external auditory canal and tympanic membrane are normal. A disorder affecting pterygoid muscle contractility is suspected. Involvement of which of the following nerves is most likely contributing to this patient's ear symptoms?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's facial pain, headaches, jaw dysfunction, and ear pain/muffled hearing are characteristic of temporomandibular disorder (TMD). The underlying etiology of TMD is multifactorial but includes temporomandibular joint (TMJ) derangement (eg, jaw misalignment, trauma) and hypersensitivity of the mandibular nerve.\n\nThe mandibular nerve (CN V3) is the largest branch of the trigeminal nerve and supplies sensation to the TMJ, floor of the mouth, anterior tongue, and the lower part of the face. It also innervates the muscles of mastication (eg, medial and lateral pterygoid, masseter, temporalis), tensor veli palatini, and the tensor tympani in the middle ear, which dampens loud sounds by tensing the tympanic membrane.\n\nMechanical derangement of the TMJ can result in irritation and hypersensitivity of the mandibular nerve, leading to pathologic contraction of the pterygoid muscles (worsening the jaw pain and dysfunction) and tensor tympani (causing ear pain and muffled hearing despite normal otoscopic examination).\n\n(Choice A) Most patients with TMD have cervical spinal dysfunction and neck pain due to muscular and functional connections between the jaw and cervical regions. However, cervical spinal nerve damage is usually caused by overt structural lesions of the cervical spine (eg, cervical spondylosis, disc herniation) and would not result in ear pain or muffled hearing (but rather neck, shoulder, and arm pain/weakness).\n\n(Choice B) The facial nerve (CN VII) provides sensory innervation to the external auditory canal/concha and motor innervation to the muscles of facial expression and the stapedius muscle, which dampens high-amplitude sound wave transmission. However, the facial nerve does not innervate the pterygoid muscles or TMJ.\n\n(Choice D) The maxillary nerve (CN V2) provides sensory innervation to the cheek, nares, upper lip, and teeth. Involvement of the maxillary nerve in trigeminal neuralgia can cause facial pain; however, muffled hearing and pterygoid muscle dysfunction indicate mandibular nerve involvement.\n\n(Choice E) The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) carries auditory and balance information from the inner ear. Damage to the cochlear portion of CNVIII (eg, vestibular schwannoma) can result in hearing loss; however, it would not be associated with facial pain or pterygoid muscle dysfunction.\n\nEducational objective: Temporomandibular disorder is associated with dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint and hypersensitivity of the mandibular nerve (CN V3). This can result in pathologic contraction of the pterygoid muscles (eg, jaw pain) and the tensor tympani in the middle ear (eg, ear pain, muffled hearing).",
    "zh": "该患者的面部疼痛、头痛、下颌功能障碍和耳痛/听力模糊是颞下颌关节紊乱（TMD）的特征。TMD 的潜在病因是多因素的，但包括颞下颌关节 (TMJ) 紊乱（例如，下颌错位、创伤）和下颌神经的过度敏感。\n\n下颌神经 (CN V3) 是三叉神经的最大分支，为 TMJ、口腔底部、舌前部和面部下部提供感觉。它还支配咀嚼肌（例如，内、外翼内肌、咬肌、颞肌）、腭帆张肌和中耳的鼓膜张肌，通过使鼓膜紧张来抑制响亮的声音。\n\nTMJ 的机械紊乱可导致下颌神经的刺激和过度敏感，导致翼内肌的病理性收缩（加重下颌疼痛和功能障碍）和鼓膜张肌（导致耳痛和听力模糊，尽管耳镜检查正常）。\n\n(选项 A) 大多数 TMD 患者因下颌和颈部区域之间的肌肉和功能连接而出现颈椎功能障碍和颈部疼痛。然而，颈椎神经损伤通常是由颈椎的明显结构性病变（例如，颈椎病、椎间盘突出）引起的，不会导致耳痛或听力模糊（而是颈部、肩部和手臂疼痛/无力）。\n\n(选项 B) 面神经 (CN VII) 为外耳道/耳廓提供感觉神经支配，并为面部表情肌和镫骨肌提供运动神经支配，从而抑制高振幅声波的传播。然而，面神经不支配翼内肌或 TMJ。\n\n(选项 D) 上颌神经 (CN V2) 为面颊、鼻孔、上唇和牙齿提供感觉神经支配。上颌神经在三叉神经痛中的受累会导致面部疼痛；然而，听力模糊和翼内肌功能障碍表明下颌神经受累。\n\n(选项 E) 前庭蜗神经 (CN VIII) 携带来自内耳的听觉和平衡信息。CNVIII 的蜗部分受损（例如，前庭神经鞘瘤）可导致听力损失；然而，它不会与面部疼痛或翼内肌功能障碍相关联。\n\n教学目标：颞下颌关节紊乱与颞下颌关节功能障碍和下颌神经 (CN V3) 的过度敏感有关。这会导致翼内肌的病理性收缩（例如，下颌疼痛）和中耳的鼓膜张肌（例如，耳痛、听力模糊）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and the innervation of the muscles of mastication, specifically the role of the mandibular nerve (CN V3) in TMD-related symptoms such as jaw pain, ear pain, and muffled hearing. It also requires understanding the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve and its branches.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the constellation of symptoms (facial pain, jaw clicking, muffled hearing) as suggestive of TMD. Then, recall that the mandibular nerve innervates the muscles of mastication, including the pterygoid muscles, and that dysfunction of this nerve can lead to the patient's symptoms.",
