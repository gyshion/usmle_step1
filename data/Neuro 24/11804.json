    "en": "A 65-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to sudden-onset headache. The patient has had no recent falls or head trauma. Medical history includes hypertension and lung adenocarcinoma with abdominal metastasis. Initial noncontrast CT scan of the head reveals a small temporal lobe hemorrhage. Over the next 24 hours, the patient becomes progressively obtunded and develops generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Blood pressure is 190/96 mm Hg, pulse is 38/min, and respirations are 10/min with brief episodes of apnea. A repeat noncontrast CT scan of the head reveals acute hemorrhage expansion with brain herniation. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient developed a spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage with subsequent clinical deterioration due to ongoing bleeding and hemorrhage expansion. Expanding space-occupying lesions (eg, hemorrhage, hematoma) increase intracranial pressure, which can manifest with headache, vomiting, impaired consciousness, and ultimately Cushing triad (eg, hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations) when brain herniation is imminent. Herniation can occur in different portions of the brain depending on the location of the initial lesion. Lesions in the temporal lobe tend to cause transtentorial herniation of the uncus, which can compress the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve (CN III) as it exits the midbrain at the same level. Patients often develop ipsilateral CN III palsy with a fixed dilated pupil due to preganglionic parasympathetic nerve fiber damage. If intracranial pressure continues to increase, the herniation can progress to involve the uncus bilaterally, ultimately causing downward displacement of the brainstem (ie, central herniation). This results in brainstem hemorrhages (ie, from rupture of paramedian basilar artery branches), continued clinical deterioration from damage to medullary cardiac and respiratory centers, abnormal posturing, and ultimately death.\n(Choice B) Horner syndrome (ie, ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) is associated with lesions affecting the posterolateral hypothalamus or sympathetic tracts in the brainstem (eg, lateral medulla).\n(Choice C) Uncal herniation can compress the cerebral peduncles, resulting in corticospinal tract injury with contralateral hemiparesis. However, patients initially have flaccid paralysis with hyporeflexia (ie, spinal shock); spasticity/hyperreflexia develops days to weeks following acute upper motor neuron injury and would not yet be present in this patient.\n(Choice D) Nystagmus is generally seen with lesions to the pons, medulla, or cerebellum due to disruption of vestibular pathways.\n(Choice E) Hydrocephalus can cause upward gaze palsy due to dilation of the third ventricle with compression of the dorsal midbrain (eg, superior colliculus, pretectal area). {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者发生自发性脑内出血，随后由于持续出血和出血扩大导致临床恶化。扩张性占位性病变（例如，出血、血肿）会增加颅内压，当脑疝即将发生时，可表现为头痛、呕吐、意识障碍，并最终出现Cushing综合征（例如，高血压、心动过缓、呼吸不规则）。脑疝可发生在不同脑部区域，具体取决于最初病变的位置。颞叶病变易引起钩回经小脑幕切迹疝，可压迫同侧动眼神经（CN III），该神经从脑干中脑同一水平穿出。患者常发生同侧CN III麻痹，伴有瞳孔固定扩大，这与节前副交感神经纤维损伤有关。如果颅内压持续升高，脑疝可进展至双侧钩回受累，最终导致脑干向下移位（即，中央疝）。这会导致脑干出血（即，来自正中旁基底动脉分支破裂），由于损伤延髓心脏和呼吸中枢，临床持续恶化，出现异常姿势，并最终导致死亡。\n(选项B) Horner综合征（即，上睑下垂、瞳孔缩小、无汗）与影响脑干后外侧下丘脑或交感神经束（例如，外侧延髓）的病变有关。\n(选项C) 钩回疝可压迫大脑脚，导致皮质脊髓束损伤，伴有对侧偏瘫。然而，患者最初出现弛缓性瘫痪，伴有反射减退（即，脊髓休克）；痉挛/反射亢进会在急性上运动神经元损伤后数天至数周出现，但在此患者中尚未出现。\n(选项D) 眼球震颤通常见于脑桥、延髓或小脑病变，这是由于前庭通路受损所致。\n(选项E) 脑积水可引起向上凝视麻痹，这是由于第三脑室扩张，压迫背侧中脑（例如，上丘、视前区）所致。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of brain herniation syndromes, specifically uncal herniation, and its associated neurological findings. It requires correlating the clinical presentation of increased intracranial pressure and temporal lobe hemorrhage with the specific cranial nerve deficits that arise from uncal herniation.\nTo solve this question, identify the signs of increased intracranial pressure and brain herniation. Recognize that temporal lobe lesions, particularly uncal herniation, commonly affect the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve (CN III), leading to pupillary abnormalities. Differentiate this from other herniation syndromes and their respective clinical manifestations.",
