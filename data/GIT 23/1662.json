    "en": "A 34-year-old man with upper gastrointestinal bleeding is brought to the local emergency department by ambulance. He was found in front of a grocery store after customers called emergency medical services. The patient is unable to provide any information, but his medical records show a history of alcohol use disorder. After undergoing emergency evaluation and appropriate resuscitation, his condition stabilizes. Gastric lavage fluid initially contained blood but cleared quickly. Upper endoscopy shows a linear mucosal tear at the gastroesophageal junction. The process directly responsible for causing this patient's mucosal tear will most likely result in which of the following acid-base disturbances?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a Mallory-Weiss tear of the gastric mucosa near the gastroesophageal junction. Mallory-Weiss tears are caused by high intragastric pressure being transmitted to the esophagus through a tight lower esophageal sphincter. They are most commonly caused by repetitive retching and vomiting but can also occur with straining during defecation or heavy lifting, seizures, blunt abdominal injury, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Repetitive vomiting leads to metabolic alkalosis due to net loss of acidic gastric secretions.\n\n(Choice A) Unlike methanol or ethylene glycol, acute ethanol intoxication does not usually cause high anion gap metabolic acidosis, but chronic alcohol use can cause ketoacidosis in malnourished patients. Ethanol abuse is a common predisposing factor for Mallory-Weiss tears; however, it is the repetitive vomiting and retching that directly cause the tears.\n\n(Choice C) Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis is usually caused by loss of bicarbonate, which can occur with prolonged diarrhea. Recurrent vomiting causes metabolic alkalosis, not acidosis.\n\n(Choices D and E) Respiratory acidosis usually occurs in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or central nervous system depression (eg, narcotic overdose). Respiratory alkalosis occurs with hyperventilation (eg, panic attacks, pulmonary emboli).\n\nEducational objective:\nA Mallory-Weiss tear is a tear in the gastric mucosa near the gastroesophageal junction. It typically results from repetitive forceful vomiting, which can also cause metabolic alkalosis.",
    "zh": "该患者患有胃食管交界处附近的胃黏膜马洛里-韦斯撕裂。马洛里-韦斯撕裂是由高胃内压力通过紧张的食管下括约肌传递到食管引起的。它们最常见的原因是反复干呕和呕吐，但也可能发生在排便或搬运重物时的用力、癫痫发作、钝性腹部损伤和上消化道内镜检查中。反复呕吐会导致代谢性碱中毒，这是由于净损失了酸性胃分泌物。\n\n(选项A) 与甲醇或乙二醇不同，急性乙醇中毒通常不会引起高阴离子间隙代谢性酸中毒，但长期饮酒会导致营养不良患者发生酮症酸中毒。乙醇滥用是马洛里-韦斯撕裂的常见诱因；然而，直接导致撕裂的是反复呕吐和干呕。\n\n(选项C) 正常阴离子间隙代谢性酸中毒通常由碳酸氢盐的丢失引起，这可能发生在长期腹泻时。反复呕吐引起代谢性碱中毒，而不是酸中毒。\n\n(选项D和E) 呼吸性酸中毒通常发生在慢性阻塞性肺病或中枢神经系统抑制（例如，麻醉剂过量）的患者中。呼吸性碱中毒发生在过度通气时（例如，惊恐发作、肺栓塞）。\n\n教育目标：\n马洛里-韦斯撕裂是胃食管交界处附近胃黏膜的撕裂。它通常由反复剧烈呕吐引起，这也可能导致代谢性碱中毒。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Mallory-Weiss syndrome and its association with metabolic alkalosis due to repetitive vomiting. It also assesses understanding of acid-base disturbances related to other conditions like alcohol intoxication and respiratory disorders.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the Mallory-Weiss tear from the clinical vignette, link it to repetitive vomiting, and then associate repetitive vomiting with the acid-base disturbance of metabolic alkalosis.",
    "zh": "本题考察对马洛里-韦斯综合征的了解及其与反复呕吐引起的代谢性碱中毒的关系。它还评估对与其他疾病（如酒精中毒和呼吸系统疾病）相关的酸碱紊乱的理解。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要从临床摘要中识别出马洛里-韦斯撕裂，将其与反复呕吐联系起来，然后将反复呕吐与代谢性碱中毒的酸碱紊乱联系起来。"
