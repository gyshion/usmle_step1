    "en": "Pertussis {{exhibit_1}}\n\nA forceful cough in an unimmunized infant and a household contact with prolonged coughing symptoms should raise concern for pertussis. Pertussis is caused by the gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis and spreads via respiratory droplets. The greatest risk factor is lack of immunization, and older children/adults with mild disease are often the source of infection.\n\nPertussis is a prolonged illness that typically progresses through 3 stages: catarrhal (mild rhinorrhea or cough), paroxysmal (bouts of severe cough), and convalescent (weeks to months of gradual resolution). Infants are at high risk of complications (eg, cyanosis, apnea, seizure), particularly during the paroxysmal stage. Diagnostic clues include lack of fever, as well as cough associated with turning red in the face, an inspiratory whoop, or posttussive emesis. Lymphocytosis, the degree of which correlates with disease severity, is also a characteristic finding and related to impaired leukocyte chemotaxis caused by pertussis toxin.\n\nPertussis is usually a clinical diagnosis and should be treated empirically with a macrolide antibiotic (eg, azithromycin). Macrolides bind the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit, which prevents the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain. This results in the inhibition of protein synthesis by bacteria.\n\n(Choice A) Beta-lactam antibiotics (eg, penicillins, cephalosporins) and vancomycin inhibit cell wall synthesis. These medications are often indicated for lobar pneumonia in children, which is unlikely in a child with clear lungs on auscultation and no fever. In addition, beta-lactam antibiotics do not clear B pertussis from the nasopharynx, and vancomycin is generally effective against gram-positive, not gram-negative, bacteria.\n\n(Choice B) Fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin) interfere with bacterial DNA synthesis but are not effective against B pertussis. Moreover, their use is avoided in children when possible due to potential adverse effects (eg, tendon rupture).\n\n(Choice C) Certain antiparasitic medications (eg, mebendazole, albendazole) inhibit microtubule assembly, disrupting the cytoskeleton of the parasite. B pertussis is a bacterium.\n\n(Choice E) Neuraminidase inhibitors (eg, oseltamivir) block virion release from cells infected by influenza virus. In contrast to this case, influenza typically presents with cough and fever that improve within a week.\n\nEducational objective:\nPertussis is a clinical diagnosis (eg, prolonged, forceful cough; household contact with prolonged cough; lack of immunization; lymphocytosis) and should be treated empirically. The treatment of choice is a macrolide antibiotic (eg, azithromycin), which binds to the bacterial ribosomal subunit and inhibits protein synthesis.\n\nReferences {{exhibit_2}}\n\n*   Pertussis: microbiology, disease, treatment, and prevention.\n*   How macrolide antibiotics work. {{exhibit_3}}",
