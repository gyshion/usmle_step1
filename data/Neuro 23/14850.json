    "en": "A 42-year-old woman is hospitalized for surgical removal of a mediastinal mass. The patient has had intermittent episodes of double vision, difficulty chewing food, and weakness of the extremities for the past several months. During evaluation she was found to have a circumscribed anterior mediastinal mass. Preoperative nerve conduction studies demonstrated a decremental response to repetitive motor nerve stimulation. The patient has no other medical conditions and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. She has no drug allergies.",

    "en": "This patient has an anterior mediastinal mass and a nerve conduction study consistent with **myasthenia gravis (MG)**, a disease caused by autoantibodies against postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors found within the neuromuscular junction. Antibody-induced degradation leads to **fewer functional receptors**, which may be insufficient to generate muscle action potentials despite normal acetylcholine release.\n\nWeakness most commonly affects the extraocular, bulbar, and proximal muscles, worsening with repetitive nerve stimulation (fatigability) due to depletion of acetylcholine stores in the presynaptic nerve terminal. **Thymic abnormalities** (eg, thymoma, thymic hyperplasia) are common and may appear as an anterior mediastinal mass on imaging; thymectomy can often improve symptoms.\n\nNeuromuscular blocking agents are used to induce skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery by competing with acetylcholine at the postsynaptic membrane. They can be subclassified by their effects:\n\n*   **Nondepolarizing agents** (eg, vecuronium, rocuronium) are competitive antagonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Because of the low number of functional receptors, patients with MG are **extremely sensitive** to these agents; very small doses can induce paralysis with loss of airway patency.\n*   **Depolarizing agents** (eg, succinylcholine) are competitive agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; persistent depolarization leads to desensitization of the motor end plate. Because the low number of functional receptors tends to inhibit end-plate depolarization, patients with MG are often **resistant** to these agents; extremely large doses are required to induce muscle relaxation.\n\n(Choice A) Atropine is a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist often used before general anesthesia to decrease salivary and bronchial secretions (helping maintain airway patency) and to prevent myocardial depression (minimizing risk for hypotension). It has no effect on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junctions.\n\n(Choices B and C) Isoflurane is a general anesthetic (acting centrally on multiple receptors) that can cause malignant hyperthermia in those with genetic predispositions. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine (acting on the GABA A receptor) that produces sedation. These medications are not contraindicated in MG.\n\n(Choice D) Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (eg, neostigmine, pyridostigmine) hinder the degradation of acetylcholine in the synapse, thereby increasing the amount available to stimulate nicotinic receptors. They are often used to hasten recovery from nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade and to improve muscle strength in patients with MG. Because such patients have fewer functional receptors, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors typically exhibit decreased potency.",
    "zh": "该患者患有前纵隔肿块，神经传导研究结果与**重症肌无力（MG）**一致，这是一种由针对神经肌肉接头内突触后烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体的自身抗体引起的疾病。抗体诱导的降解导致**功能性受体减少**，尽管乙酰胆碱的释放正常，但可能不足以产生肌肉动作电位。\n\n无力最常影响眼外肌、延髓肌和近端肌肉，重复神经刺激会加重（易疲劳），这是由于突触前神经末梢乙酰胆碱储存耗竭所致。**胸腺异常**（如胸腺瘤、胸腺增生）很常见，在影像学检查中可能表现为前纵隔肿块；胸腺切除术通常可以改善症状。\n\n神经肌肉阻滞剂用于手术中通过与突触后膜上的乙酰胆碱竞争来诱导骨骼肌松弛。它们可以根据其作用进行分类：\n\n*   **非去极化剂**（如维库溴铵、罗库溴铵）是烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体的竞争性拮抗剂。由于功能性受体数量少，MG患者对这些药物**极其敏感**；非常小的剂量即可诱发麻痹，并导致气道通畅性丧失。\n*   **去极化剂**（如琥珀酰胆碱）是烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体的竞争性激动剂；持续去极化导致运动终板脱敏。由于功能性受体数量少往往会抑制终板去极化，MG患者通常对这些药物**耐药**；需要极大的剂量才能诱导肌肉松弛。\n\n（选项A）阿托品是毒蕈碱型乙酰胆碱受体拮抗剂，常用于全身麻醉前以减少唾液和支气管分泌物（有助于维持气道通畅性）并预防心肌抑制（使低血压风险最小化）。它对神经肌肉接头中的烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体没有影响。\n\n（选项B和C）异氟烷是一种全身麻醉剂（作用于多个受体），对于有遗传易感性的人来说，可引起恶性高热。咪达唑仑是一种苯二氮卓类药物（作用于GABA A受体），可产生镇静作用。这些药物在MG中没有禁忌症。\n\n（选项D）乙酰胆碱酯酶抑制剂（如新斯的明、吡啶斯的明）阻碍突触中乙酰胆碱的降解，从而增加可用于刺激烟碱型受体的量。它们常用于加速非去极化神经肌肉阻滞的恢复，并改善MG患者的肌力。由于此类患者的功能性受体较少，乙酰胆碱酯酶抑制剂通常表现出降低的效力。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of myasthenia gravis and its implications for anesthesia, specifically the altered sensitivity to neuromuscular blocking agents. It assesses the understanding of the pathophysiology of MG and how it affects the response to different types of neuromuscular blockers. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the patient's symptoms and nerve conduction study results as indicative of myasthenia gravis. Then, understanding that patients with MG are more sensitive to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents like vecuronium due to the reduced number of available acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction.",
