    "en": "A 7-year-old boy is admitted to the hospital after his adoptive parents brought him to the emergency department due to fatigue and pallor. Laboratory evaluation reveals pancytopenia with an absolute neutrophil count consistent with severe neutropenia. Bone marrow examination reveals signs of aplastic anemia, and subsequent genetic testing reveals a congenital genomic defect in DNA repair leading to chromosomal instability. A bone marrow transplant is required for treatment. The patient's only living relatives are an identical twin brother and older sister who were both adopted by the same parents. He also has stored umbilical stem cells that were harvested after birth. Which of the following is the best bone marrow transplantation method for this patient?",

    "en": "Hematologic stem cell transplantation (HCT) requires identification of a donor with similar human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), polymorphic proteins expressed on the surface of every cell. The most important HLA proteins to match are HLA-A, B, and C, which form major histocompatibility complex class I molecules; and HLA-DP, DQ, and DR, which form major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. Because these HLAs play a vital role in the differentiation between self and nonself, recipients who receive well-matched donor cells have lower rates of graft rejection (ie, host cells attack the donor) and graft-versus-host disease (ie, donor cells attack the host).\n\nDonor sources are generally categorized as follows:\n\n*   Autologous: Stem cells harvested from the patient or banked from the patient's cord blood at birth are transplanted to reconstitute the patient's bone marrow. However, autologous transplants cannot be used for congenital genetic disorders because the genetic mutation will be present in all cells harvested from the patient (Choices A and C).\n*   Syngeneic: Identical twins have the same genome; therefore, cells transplanted from one identical twin to the other will be an exact HLA match and will not cause graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease. However, syngeneic transplants are not helpful for congenital genetic conditions because any congenital mutation present in one twin will be present in the other (Choice D).\n*   Allogeneic donors: Donors who do not have the same genome as the patient are classified as related or unrelated.\n    *   Related donors: Because HLA alleles are encoded on chromosome 6, each nonidentical sibling has a 25% chance of being an exact HLA match (HLA identical), a 50% chance of sharing half the HLA alleles (haploidentical), and a 25% chance of sharing none of the HLA alleles (HLA mismatch). Therefore, siblings often are tested first for HLA matching because there is a 1:4 chance they will be an exact match. However, unmatched siblings usually are not used for donation because their HLA alleles are not the same as the patient's (Choice E).\n    *   Unrelated donors: Unrelated donors do not have the same genome as the patient but can have perfect or near-perfect HLA matching; however, extensive searching is often required. Matched unrelated donors generally are best for congenital genetic conditions because the genomic error that leads to the patient's condition will not usually be present in an unrelated individual. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nEducational objective:\n\nPatients who require stem cell transplantation due to a congenital genomic disease typically receive matched unrelated donor cells because they will have matched human leukocyte antigen alleles but will not have the genomic mutation that caused the condition.",
    "zh": "血液干细胞移植（HCT）需要识别具有相似人类白细胞抗原（HLA）的供者，HLA是一种表达在每个细胞表面的多态性蛋白。最重要的HLA蛋白是HLA-A、B和C，它们构成主要组织相容性复合体I类分子；以及HLA-DP、DQ和DR，它们构成主要组织相容性复合体II类分子。由于这些HLA在区分自体和非自体方面起着至关重要的作用，接受配型良好的供者细胞的受者具有较低的移植物排斥率（即，宿主细胞攻击供者）和移植物抗宿主病（即，供者细胞攻击宿主）发生率。\n\n供者来源通常分为以下几类：\n\n*   自体：从患者身上采集或从患者出生时的脐带血中储存的干细胞被移植以重建患者的骨髓。然而，自体移植不能用于先天性遗传疾病，因为遗传突变将存在于从患者身上采集的所有细胞中（选项A和C）。\n*   同基因：同卵双胞胎具有相同的基因组；因此，从一个同卵双胞胎移植到另一个的细胞将是完全的HLA匹配，并且不会引起移植物排斥或移植物抗宿主病。然而，同基因移植对先天性遗传病无益，因为一个双胞胎中存在的任何先天性突变也将存在于另一个双胞胎中（选项D）。\n*   异基因供者：与患者不具有相同基因组的供者被分类为相关或不相关。\n    *   相关供者：由于HLA等位基因编码在6号染色体上，每个非同卵双胞胎兄弟姐妹有25%的几率是完全HLA匹配（HLA相同），50%的几率共享一半的HLA等位基因（单倍型相同），以及25%的几率不共享任何HLA等位基因（HLA不匹配）。因此，通常首先对兄弟姐妹进行HLA匹配测试，因为他们有1:4的几率完全匹配。然而，不匹配的兄弟姐妹通常不用于捐献，因为他们的HLA等位基因与患者的不同（选项E）。\n    *   无关供者：无关供者与患者的基因组不同，但可以具有完美或接近完美的HLA匹配；然而，通常需要广泛的搜索。对于先天性遗传病，配型相符的无关供者通常是最佳选择，因为导致患者病情的基因组错误通常不会存在于无关个体中。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n教学目标：\n\n由于先天性基因组疾病需要干细胞移植的患者通常接受配型相符的无关供者细胞，因为他们将具有匹配的人类白细胞抗原等位基因，但不会具有导致该疾病的基因组突变。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of stem cell transplantation, specifically the selection of the best donor source for a patient with a congenital genomic defect. It requires understanding the different types of donors (autologous, syngeneic, allogeneic) and their suitability based on the patient's condition. \n\nThe best approach is to consider the underlying genetic defect and the goal of transplantation. Autologous and syngeneic transplants are not suitable because they would also carry the genetic defect.
