    "en": "A 47-year-old woman has a tumor that is causing symptoms of excessive hormone production. Surgical resection of the lesion is performed with no operative complications, and the neoplastic tissue is subjected to detailed pathologic studies. Electron microscopy reveals the tumor cells have highly developed, smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Which of the following is a possible direct effect of the substance secreted by these cells?",

    "en": "The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is involved in the synthesis and processing of hydrophobic compounds, including lipids, phospholipids, and cholesterol derivatives (eg, STEROID HORMONES). Cholesterol is initially converted to pregnenolone in the mitochondria and then transferred to the SER, where the remaining steps of steroidogenesis occur. The SER contains the enzymes (eg, 21-hydroxylase) required for steroid and phospholipid biosynthesis. Steroid-producing cells (in the adrenals, gonads, and liver) characteristically contain a well-developed SER. This patient is likely experiencing VIRILIZATION due to an ANDROGEN-SECRETING ovarian or adrenal tumor {{exhibit_1}}. Paraneoplastic syndromes can also occur due to overproduction of other sex steroids, cortisol (ie, Cushing syndrome), or aldosterone.\n\nBy contrast, the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is characterized by numerous ribosomes on the outer membrane. The RER plays an important role in the synthesis and modification of targeted proteins, including secretable polypeptide hormones. Some of the clinically significant syndromes due to overproduction of PEPTIDE HORMONES by the RER include:\n\n*   Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (characterized by increased water reabsorption in the renal collecting ducts), often abbreviated SIADH, due to overproduction of vasopressin (Choice A)\n*   Hypoglycemia due to overproduction of insulin by certain pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (insulinomas) (Choice B)\n*   Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastric acid hypersecretion and recurrent peptic ulcer) due to excess secretion of gastrin from pancreatic or small intestine gastrinomas (Choice D)\n*   Galactorrhea (pathologic mammary milk production) due to a prolactin-secreting lactotroph pituitary adenoma (Choice E)",
    "zh": "滑面内质网(SER)参与疏水性化合物的合成和加工，包括脂质、磷脂和胆固醇衍生物（例如，类固醇激素）。胆固醇最初在线粒体中转化为孕烯醇酮，然后转移到SER，在那里发生类固醇生成的剩余步骤。SER含有类固醇和磷脂生物合成所需的酶（例如，21-羟化酶）。产生类固醇的细胞（在肾上腺、性腺和肝脏中）通常含有发达的SER。该患者可能正在经历男性化，这归因于分泌雄激素的卵巢或肾上腺肿瘤 {{exhibit_1}}。副肿瘤综合征也可能由于其他性类固醇、皮质醇（即，库欣综合征）或醛固酮的过度产生而发生。\n\n相比之下，粗面内质网(RER)的特征是外膜上有许多核糖体。RER在靶向蛋白质的合成和修饰中起重要作用，包括可分泌的多肽激素。由于RER过度产生肽激素而引起的一些具有临床意义的综合征包括：\n\n*   抗利尿激素不适当分泌综合征（特征是肾集合管对水的重吸收增加），通常缩写为SIADH，是由于加压素的过度产生（选项A）\n*   由于某些胰腺神经内分泌肿瘤（胰岛素瘤）过度产生胰岛素引起的低血糖症（选项B）\n*   卓-艾综合征（胃酸分泌过多和复发性消化性溃疡），是由于胰腺或小肠胃泌素瘤分泌过多的胃泌素所致（选项D）\n*   溢乳症（病理性乳腺乳汁分泌），是由于催乳素分泌型泌乳素细胞垂体腺瘤所致（选项E）"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of the function of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) in steroid hormone synthesis and the clinical manifestations of androgen-secreting tumors. It also tests the ability to differentiate between the functions of smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the tumor cells have highly developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in steroid hormone synthesis. Consider the possible effects of excessive steroid hormone production, particularly androgens, which can lead to virilization.",
