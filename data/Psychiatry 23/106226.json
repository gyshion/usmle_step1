    "en": "A 2-day-old infant is evaluated in the newborn nursery due to poor feeding. The infant is irritable, is not sleeping well, and has had several episodes of vomiting and loose stools today. A review of the maternal history reveals that the mother had poor prenatal care and that the pregnancy was complicated by fetal growth restriction. On examination, the infant is diaphoretic and has a high-pitched cry. The infant is also noted to have occasional sneezing and is mildly tachypneic. No dysmorphic features are noted, and the remainder of the examination is unremarkable. This infant's symptoms are most likely caused by prenatal exposure to which of the following?",
    "zh": "一名 2 天大的婴儿因喂养不良在新生儿病房接受评估。婴儿烦躁不安，睡眠不好，今天有几次呕吐和稀便。回顾母亲病史显示，母亲产前保健不良，妊娠并发胎儿生长受限。体格检查显示，婴儿出汗，哭声尖锐。婴儿还被注意到偶尔打喷嚏，并有轻微的呼吸急促。未发现畸形特征，其余检查无特殊发现。该婴儿的症状最有可能由产前暴露于以下哪种物质引起？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This newborn has signs of NEONATAL ABSTINENCE SYNDROME (NAS) (also known as neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome). Withdrawal from transplacental exposure to maternal substances (primarily opioids) occurs in the setting of maternal prescription use/misuse, recreational drug use (eg, heroin), or treatment for a substance use disorder (eg, methadone).\n\nNAS usually presents in the first few days of life and is characterized by irritability, a high-pitched cry, sleeping and feeding difficulties, tremors, seizures, autonomic dysfunction (eg, sweating, sneezing), tachypnea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\nTreatment for NAS includes symptomatic care to calm the infant and help the infant sleep, such as swaddling and maintaining a low-stimulation environment. Pharmacologic treatment (eg, morphine, methadone) is used when supportive treatment alone does not control the infant's withdrawal symptoms.\n\n(Choice A) Fetal alcohol syndrome consists of growth deficiency; presence of a long, smooth philtrum; small palpebral fissures; and a thin upper lip in addition to CNS abnormalities such as intellectual disability. Withdrawal symptoms are usually not seen unless the mother was drinking just prior to delivery.\n\n(Choice B) Prenatal exposure to cocaine can result in jitteriness, excessive sucking, and a hyperactive Moro reflex (due to the toxic effects of cocaine); by contrast, withdrawal symptoms from cocaine are usually not as severe as with opiates. Long-term effects on behavior, attention level, and intelligence may be seen.\n\n(Choice D) Prenatal exposure to phenytoin can result in fetal hydantoin syndrome, which is characterized by nail and digit hypoplasia, dysmorphic faces, and intellectual disability. Growth deficiency can also be seen.\n\n(Choice E) Fetal exposure to valproic acid significantly increases the risk of neural tube defects; may result in cardiac anomalies; and can produce dysmorphic faces, including a cleft lip, narrow bifrontal diameter, midface hypoplasia, broad and depressed nasal bridge, and long philtrum.\n\nEducational objective:\nNeonatal abstinence syndrome is caused by infant withdrawal to opiates (eg, heroin) and usually presents in the first few days of life. It is characterized by irritability, a high-pitched cry, poor sleeping, tremors, seizures, sweating, sneezing, tachypnea, poor feeding, vomiting, and diarrhea.",
    "zh": "该新生儿有新生儿戒断综合征 (NAS)（也称为新生儿阿片类药物戒断综合征）的体征。由于经胎盘暴露于母体物质（主要是阿片类药物）而引起的戒断发生在母亲处方使用/滥用、娱乐性吸毒（如海洛因）或物质使用障碍治疗（如美沙酮）的情况下。\n\nNAS 通常在出生后几天内出现，其特征是易怒、哭声尖锐、睡眠和喂养困难、震颤、惊厥、自主神经功能障碍（如出汗、打喷嚏）、呼吸急促、呕吐和腹泻。\n\nNAS 的治疗包括对症护理，以安抚婴儿并帮助婴儿入睡，如襁褓和维持低刺激环境。当单纯的支持性治疗无法控制婴儿的戒断症状时，可使用药物治疗（如吗啡、美沙酮）。\n\n(选项 A) 胎儿酒精综合征包括生长迟缓；存在长而光滑的人中；睑裂小；以及薄薄的上唇，此外还有中枢神经系统异常，如智力残疾。除非母亲在分娩前饮酒，否则通常不会出现戒断症状。\n\n(选项 B) 产前暴露于可卡因可导致兴奋、过度吸吮和过度活跃的莫罗反射（由于可卡因的毒性作用）；相比之下，可卡因的戒断症状通常不如阿片类药物严重。可能会观察到对行为、注意力水平和智力的长期影响。\n\n(选项 D) 产前暴露于苯妥英可导致胎儿苯妥英综合征，其特征是甲和指发育不全、畸形面容和智力残疾。也可以看到生长迟缓。\n\n(选项 E) 胎儿暴露于丙戊酸会显著增加神经管缺陷的风险；可能导致心脏异常；并可能产生畸形面容，包括唇裂、窄额宽、中面部发育不全、宽而凹陷的鼻梁和长人中。\n\n教育目标：\n新生儿戒断综合征是由婴儿对阿片类药物（如海洛因）的戒断引起的，通常在出生后几天内出现。其特征是易怒、哭声尖锐、睡眠不佳、震颤、惊厥、出汗、打喷嚏、呼吸急促、喂养不良、呕吐和腹泻。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the recognition of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) based on clinical presentation and maternal history. It requires differentiating NAS from other prenatal exposure syndromes.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the constellation of symptoms (irritability, vomiting, diarrhea, sneezing, tachypnea, high-pitched cry) and correlating them with the maternal history of poor prenatal care and fetal growth restriction. Understanding the typical withdrawal symptoms associated with various prenatal exposures is crucial for selecting the correct answer.",
