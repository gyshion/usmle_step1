    "en": "A 15-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother due to difficulty with movement. The patient enjoys playing high school basketball but had to leave the team this year due to his progressively worsening symptoms. On examination, he is found to have significant kyphoscoliosis and a high plantar arch. His older brother suffered from a neurologic disorder and died of heart failure at age 25. This patient most likely has which of the following neuropathologic findings?",

    "en": "Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation of the frataxin (FXN) gene. This gene codes for an essential mitochondrial protein involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur enzymes. An increased number of trinucleotide repeats (GAA) is present in the mutated gene, causing decreased FXN expression. This leads to decreased mitochondrial energy production and increased oxidative stress, resulting in degeneration of neural tracts and peripheral nerves. The following sites of involvement are characteristic:\n1. Spinocerebellar and lateral corticospinal tract degeneration causes gait ataxia and spastic muscle weakness, respectively.\n2. Degeneration of the dorsal columns and dorsal root ganglia causes loss of position and vibration sensation.\n3. Kyphoscoliosis and foot abnormalities (pes cavus) are characteristic skeletal deformities.\n4. Heart involvement includes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure.\n5. Diabetes mellitus develops in about 10% of patients with Friedreich ataxia.\n\n(Choice A) Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by trinucleotide repeats (CAG) in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which results in severe neuronal loss in the caudate nucleus. This condition manifests with dementia, behavioral abnormalities, and choreiform movements.\n\n(Choice B) Cerebral cortex atrophy occurs in Alzheimer and Pick diseases. Alzheimer disease is characterized by diffuse, mild cortical atrophy and progressive memory loss. Pick disease causes pronounced frontotemporal atrophy, illustrated by behavioral and emotional abnormalities.\n\n(Choice D) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with demyelination of peripheral nerves. Typical findings include distal leg weakness/atrophy with sensory deficits, pes cavus, and kyphoscoliosis; cardiomyopathy is not characteristic.\n\n(Choice E) Loss of neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord occurs in poliomyelitis and leads to flaccid paralysis, atrophy, areflexia, and muscle fasciculations. Damage of these neurons also occurs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\n(Choice F) Loss of neurons in the substantia nigra occurs in Parkinson disease, which manifests with bradykinesia, rigidity, and a resting \"pill-rolling\" tremor.\n\nEducational objective:\nFriedreich ataxia is characterized by cerebellar ataxia (spinocerebellar tract degeneration) and loss of position/vibration sensation (dorsal column/dorsal root ganglia degeneration), kyphoscoliosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Foot abnormalities and diabetes mellitus are also common.",
    "zh": "Friedreich共济失调是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，由frataxin (FXN) 基因突变引起。该基因编码一种重要的线粒体蛋白，参与铁硫酶的组装。突变基因中存在三核苷酸重复序列（GAA）增加，导致FXN表达降低。这导致线粒体能量产生减少和氧化应激增加，导致神经束和周围神经变性。以下受累部位是其特征：\n1. 脊髓小脑束和侧皮质脊髓束变性分别导致步态共济失调和痉挛性肌无力。\n2. 后索和背根神经节的变性导致位置觉和振动觉丧失。\n3. 脊柱侧弯和足部畸形（马蹄内翻足）是特征性的骨骼畸形。\n4. 心脏受累包括肥厚型心肌病和充血性心力衰竭。\n5. 大约10%的Friedreich共济失调患者会发生糖尿病。\n\n(选项 A) 亨廷顿病是一种常染色体显性遗传病，由huntingtin (HTT) 基因中的三核苷酸重复序列 (CAG) 引起，导致尾状核严重神经元丢失。这种情况表现为痴呆、行为异常和舞蹈病样动作。\n\n(选项 B) 大脑皮质萎缩发生在阿尔茨海默病和皮克病中。阿尔茨海默病的特征是弥漫性、轻度皮质萎缩和进行性记忆丧失。皮克病导致明显的额颞叶萎缩，表现为行为和情绪异常。\n\n(选项 D) Charcot-Marie-Tooth病是一种常染色体显性遗传病，与周围神经脱髓鞘有关。典型发现包括远端腿部无力/萎缩伴感觉缺陷、马蹄内翻足和脊柱侧弯；心肌病不具有特征性。\n\n(选项 E) 脊髓前角神经元丢失发生在脊髓灰质炎中，并导致弛缓性麻痹、萎缩、反射消失和肌束颤动。这些神经元的损伤也发生在肌萎缩侧索硬化症中。\n\n(选项 F) 黑质神经元丢失发生在帕金森病中，表现为运动迟缓、僵硬和静止性“搓丸样”震颤。\n\n教育目标：\nFriedreich共济失调的特征是小脑性共济失调（脊髓小脑束变性）和位置觉/振动觉丧失（后索/背根神经节变性）、脊柱侧弯和肥厚型心肌病。足部畸形和糖尿病也很常见。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation and characteristic neuropathologic findings of Friedreich ataxia, a common inherited ataxia. It requires differentiating Friedreich ataxia from other neurodegenerative disorders based on the constellation of symptoms and family history.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key clinical features presented: progressive difficulty with movement, kyphoscoliosis, high plantar arch, and a family history of a neurologic disorder with early heart failure. Consider the differential diagnosis of inherited ataxias and other neuromuscular disorders, and match the patient's findings to the typical pathology of Friedreich ataxia.",
