  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Hemoglobin {{exhibit_1}} is a tetramer that consists of 2 pairs of globin chains (total of 4 chains per molecule). During the first few weeks of embryogenesis, hemoglobin is synthesized by the yolk sac and contains zeta and epsilon globin chains (Choices G and F). Thereafter, one pair of the globin chains should always be alpha and the other should be non-alpha.\n\nFetal hemoglobin (Hb F) production begins around 8 weeks gestation and replaces all embryonic hemoglobin by 14 weeks gestation, when erythropoiesis in the fetal liver and spleen is established. Hb F consists of 2 alpha and 2 gamma protein subunits (α2γ2). Production declines at birth, and Hb F comprises ~60-80% of all hemoglobin in a term newborn. Hb F is gradually replaced by adult hemoglobin (Hb A, α2β2) (Choice A) during the first 6 months of life, after which Hb A composes the vast majority of adult hemoglobin.\n\nCompared to red blood cells with Hb A, those with Hb F have a high oxygen affinity as Hb F binds to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate poorly. The greater affinity of Hb F facilitates transplacental oxygen delivery from the maternal circulation to that of the fetus.\n\n(Choice C) Hemoglobin A2 (α2δ2) is a normal hemoglobin variant that makes up 2%-3% of hemoglobin in a healthy adult and is functionally similar to Hb A. Patients with beta-thalassemia major have impaired beta globin production, resulting in an excess of alpha globin chains (eg, Hb A2, Hb F) and no Hb A.\n\n(Choices D and E) Alpha-thalassemia results from a shortage of alpha globin chains. Hemoglobin H (β4) and hemoglobin Barts (γ4) have a very high oxygen affinity and cannot release oxygen, resulting in tissue hypoxia. Hemoglobin H disease manifests as chronic hemolytic anemia. Hemoglobin Barts is incompatible with life (eg, hydrops fetalis) as normal fetal and adult hemoglobin cannot be produced.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nHemoglobin F (Hb F) is the predominant hemoglobin type in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and during the first few months after birth. Hb F consists of 2 alpha and 2 gamma protein subunits (α2γ2) and has a high affinity for oxygen, which facilitates oxygen transport across the placenta to the fetus. Hb A (α2β2) is the major hemoglobin in adults.",
    "zh": "血红蛋白 {{exhibit_1}} 是一种四聚体，由两对珠蛋白链组成（每个分子总共4条链）。在胚胎发生的前几周，血红蛋白由卵黄囊合成，包含zeta和epsilon珠蛋白链（选项G和F）。此后，一对珠蛋白链应始终为alpha链，另一对应为非alpha链。\n\n胎儿血红蛋白（Hb F）的产生始于妊娠约8周，并在妊娠14周时取代所有胚胎血红蛋白，此时胎肝和脾脏的红细胞生成已建立。Hb F由2个alpha和2个gamma蛋白亚基（α2γ2）组成。其产量在出生时下降，足月新生儿中Hb F约占所有血红蛋白的60-80%。在出生后的头6个月，Hb F逐渐被成人血红蛋白（Hb A，α2β2）（选项A）取代，此后Hb A构成成人血红蛋白的绝大部分。\n\n与含有Hb A的红细胞相比，含有Hb F的红细胞具有高氧亲和力，因为Hb F与2,3-二磷酸甘油酸酯的结合较差。Hb F的更大亲和力促进了氧气从母体循环向胎儿的经胎盘输送。\n\n（选项C）血红蛋白A2（α2δ2）是一种正常的血红蛋白变体，占健康成人血红蛋白的2%-3%，在功能上与Hb A相似。重型β-地中海贫血患者的β珠蛋白生成受损，导致alpha珠蛋白链过量（例如，Hb A2、Hb F）且无Hb A。\n\n（选项D和E）α-地中海贫血是由于alpha珠蛋白链短缺引起的。血红蛋白H（β4）和血红蛋白Barts（γ4）具有非常高的氧亲和力，并且不能释放氧气，导致组织缺氧。血红蛋白H病表现为慢性溶血性贫血。血红蛋白Barts与生命不相容（例如，胎儿水肿），因为无法产生正常的胎儿和成人血红蛋白。\n\n教育目标：\n\nHb F是妊娠中期和晚期以及出生后头几个月的主要血红蛋白类型。Hb F由2个alpha和2个gamma蛋白亚基（α2γ2）组成，对氧气具有高亲和力，这有助于氧气通过胎盘输送到胎儿。 Hb A（α2β2）是成人的主要血红蛋白。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hemoglobin composition during fetal development and the transition to adult hemoglobin. It requires understanding the different globin chains and their relative proportions at various stages of life.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is the predominant type in newborns.
