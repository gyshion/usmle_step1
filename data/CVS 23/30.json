    "en": "A 7-year-old girl is brought to the clinic by her parents, who are concerned about her loss of interest in playing sports. During a recent competition, she walked off the field in the middle of the game because of pain in her legs. The patient takes no medications, and vaccinations are up to date. Height is at the 2nd percentile, and weight is at the 10th percentile. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 16/min. On physical examination, a systolic click and 2/6 systolic ejection murmur are heard. Femoral pulses are diminished relative to brachial pulses. Back examination is significant for an asymmetric curvature of the thoracic spine. This patient's underlying condition is most likely associated with which of the following additional findings?",
    "zh": "一位7岁女孩由父母带到诊所，他们担心她对运动失去兴趣。在最近的一次比赛中，她因腿部疼痛而中途走出了赛场。患者未服用任何药物，且疫苗接种已完成。身高处于第2百分位数，体重处于第10百分位数。体温为36.7摄氏度（98华氏度），血压为130/80毫米汞柱，脉搏为80次/分钟，呼吸为16次/分钟。体格检查显示，可听到收缩期喀喇音和2/6级收缩期喷射性杂音。股动脉搏动相对肱动脉搏动减弱。背部检查显示胸椎不对称弯曲。该患者的潜在病症最有可能与以下哪种附加发现相关？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Aortic coarctation is often an isolated finding, but this patient's other characteristics are suggestive of Turner syndrome {{exhibit_1}} (TS), which is caused by loss of an X chromosome. Left-sided cardiac lesions (eg, aortic coarctation, bicuspid aortic valve) are common comorbidities in TS, and almost all patients have short stature (height ≤2nd percentile) due to loss of a *SHOX* (short-stature homeobox) gene on chromosome X required for appropriate linear growth. Dysmorphic features and scoliosis are also common.\n\nAbsence of an X chromosome in TS results in **gonadal dysgenesis**, in which ovarian follicles are fibrotic and unable to produce estrogen. Primary ovarian insufficiency (low estrogen, elevated FSH/LH) leads to absent/minimal breast development, primary or secondary amenorrhea, and infertility.\n\n(Choice A) Blue sclerae are characteristic of osteogenesis imperfecta, a collagen disorder that causes spontaneous fractures. Patients can have short stature and scoliosis, but aortic coarctation is not typical.\n\n(Choice B) Brushfield spots (hypopigmented spots in the iris) are seen in Down syndrome, which is associated with endocardial cushion defects (eg, atrial septal defects, regurgitant atrioventricular valves), not aortic coarctation.\n\n(Choice D) Patients with neurofibromatosis type I have a predilection for neurofibromas, and scoliosis is common. However, short stature and heart defects are not typical.\n\n(Choice E) Skin elasticity and joint hypermobility are classic for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Risk of aortic dissection and mitral valve prolapse, not aortic coarctation, is increased.\n\n(Choice F) Thymic hypoplasia occurs in DiGeorge syndrome, which is associated with conotruncal cardiac defects (eg, truncus arteriosus, interrupted aortic arch) but typically presents in infancy with dysmorphic facies, recurrent infections (T-cell deficiency), cleft palate, and hypocalcemia (hypoparathyroidism).\n\nEducational objective:\nAortic coarctation can present with lower extremity claudication, upper and lower extremity blood pressure discrepancy, and diminished femoral pulses. It is commonly associated with Turner syndrome, a genetic condition characterized by short stature and gonadal dysgenesis.",
    "zh": "主动脉缩窄通常是一个孤立的发现，但该患者的其他特征提示特纳综合征 {{exhibit_1}}（TS），其病因是X染色体的缺失。左侧心脏病变（例如，主动脉缩窄、二叶式主动脉瓣）是TS常见的合并症，几乎所有患者都因X染色体上负责适当线性生长的*SHOX*（矮身材同源盒）基因缺失而身材矮小（身高≤第2百分位数）。畸形特征和脊柱侧弯也很常见。\n\nTS中X染色体的缺失导致**性腺发育不全**，其中卵泡纤维化且无法产生雌激素。原发性卵巢功能不全（低雌激素，FSH/LH升高）导致乳房发育缺失/微小、原发性或继发性闭经以及不孕。\n\n（选项A）蓝色巩膜是成骨不全的特征，这是一种导致自发性骨折的胶原疾病。患者可能身材矮小和脊柱侧弯，但主动脉缩窄不典型。\n\n（选项B）在唐氏综合征中可见Brushfield斑点（虹膜中的色素减退斑点），其与心内膜垫缺损（例如，房间隔缺损、反流性房室瓣）有关，而非主动脉缩窄。\n\n（选项D）神经纤维瘤病I型患者易患神经纤维瘤，脊柱侧弯常见。然而，身材矮小和心脏缺陷不典型。\n\n（选项E）皮肤弹性和关节过度活动是Ehlers-Danlos综合征的典型特征。主动脉夹层和二尖瓣脱垂的风险增加，而不是主动脉缩窄。\n\n（选项F）胸腺发育不全发生在DiGeorge综合征中，该综合征与圆锥干心脏缺陷（例如，动脉干、主动脉弓中断）相关，但通常在婴儿期出现，表现为面部畸形、反复感染（T细胞缺陷）、腭裂和低钙血症（甲状旁腺功能减退症）。\n\n教育目标：\n主动脉缩窄可表现为下肢跛行、上肢和下肢血压差异以及股动脉搏动减弱。它通常与特纳综合征相关，特纳综合征是一种以身材矮小和性腺发育不全为特征的遗传疾病。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Turner syndrome and its associated findings, including aortic coarctation, short stature, scoliosis, and gonadal dysgenesis. It also requires differentiating Turner syndrome from other genetic conditions with overlapping features.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the constellation of findings (short stature, aortic coarctation, scoliosis) as suggestive of Turner syndrome. Then, identify the additional finding most commonly associated with Turner syndrome, which is gonadal dysgenesis.",
