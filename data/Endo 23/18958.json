    "en": "A 53-year-old man comes to the office due to uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient was diagnosed 3 years ago and prescribed metformin and lifestyle modification. In the past year, his hemoglobin A1c levels have been steadily rising. Blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg. BMI is 37 kg/m². Laboratory results are normal except for a fasting plasma glucose of 155 mg/dL and a hemoglobin A1c level of 8%. Additional treatment with canagliflozin is initiated. Over the next several days, which of the following effects are most likely to occur in this patient due to the new medication?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) is a low-affinity, high-capacity transport protein that normally reabsorbs 90% of filtered glucose in the proximal renal tubule. Glucose reabsorption by SGLT2 is driven by the cotransport of sodium, which occurs down its concentration gradient. The sodium is actively pumped across the basolateral membrane by Na-K-ATPase, and glucose follows by facilitated diffusion via glucose transporter 2.\n\nSGLT2 inhibitors (eg, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin) are oral antidiabetic agents that have the following effects:\n\n*   Decreased renal reabsorption of glucose, leading to increased urinary glucose excretion and lower blood glucose levels\n*   Natriuresis and osmotic diuresis due to decreased reabsorption of sodium and glucose, leading to a small decrease in extracellular fluid volume, total body sodium content, and blood pressure\n*   Decreased sodium reabsorption and increased tubular sodium delivery to the macula densa, leading to decreased activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lower glomerular (and systemic) pressure, and delayed progression of nephropathy\n\nEducational objective:\n\nSodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors decrease renal reabsorption of glucose and sodium, leading to increased urinary glucose excretion and decreased blood glucose levels. In addition, natriuresis and osmotic diuresis lead to a small decrease in extracellular fluid volume, total body sodium content, and blood pressure. {{exhibit_1}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors and their effects on glucose excretion, sodium balance, and fluid volume. Understanding the cotransport of glucose and sodium in the proximal tubule is key.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that SGLT2 inhibitors block glucose reabsorption, leading to increased urinary glucose excretion. This also causes natriuresis and osmotic diuresis, resulting in decreased total body sodium content and extracellular fluid volume.",
