    "en": "This patient's pearly nodule with telangiectasias on the inner canthus is most consistent with basal cell carcinoma (BCC), a common form of skin cancer that most often occurs on the face; risk factors include fair skin and a history of heavy sun exposure (eg, while constructing homes).\n\nBCCs arise from keratinocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis or hair follicle, most commonly as a result of ultraviolet radiation–induced mutations in the hedgehog signaling pathway (causing hyperactivation and uncontrolled cell proliferation) or the TP53 tumor suppressor gene (causing inactivation). Microscopically, the malignant basaloid cells characteristically form nests or strands in the dermis, with cells at the periphery often displaying parallel alignment (ie, peripheral palisading) {{exhibit_2}}.\n\nAs in this patient, BCC frequently appears as a pink or skin-colored papule, often with a pearly or translucent quality and/or central telangiectatic vessels. Some lesions may develop a raised border and central ulceration.\n\nBCCs rarely metastasize but may grow locally and invade nearby tissues and structures.\n\n(Choice A) Dermatofibromas (ie, benign fibrous histiocytomas) represent a benign proliferation of dermal fibroblasts and histiocytes. They commonly appear as small, firm, hyperpigmented, solitary papules/nodules that characteristically dimple when pinched. In contrast to BCC, they typically appear on the lower extremities (vs the face) and lack central telangiectasias.\n\n(Choice B) Neoplastic proliferation of dermal vascular endothelial cells can give rise to cherry angiomas, common benign vascular tumors in adults. These classically appear as multiple small, blanchable, red papules on the trunk.\n\n(Choice D) Epidermal melanocytes are derived from neural crest cells and reside within the stratum basale, where they synthesize melanin, giving the skin pigmentation. They can transform into malignant melanoma, which commonly appears as an asymmetric, pigmented patch or plaque with irregular borders.\n\n(Choice E) Lipomas are benign tumors that arise from subcutaneous adipocytes. They characteristically form a soft, mobile, subcutaneous mass; the overlying epidermis is normal.\n\nEducational objective:\nBasal cell carcinomas arise from keratinocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis or hair follicle. They most commonly occur on the face and often appear as pearly or translucent, pink or skin-colored papules with central telangiectatic vessels. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}}",
    "zh": "该患者内眦出现珍珠状结节伴毛细血管扩张，最符合基底细胞癌（BCC），这是一种常见的皮肤癌，最常发生在面部；危险因素包括皮肤白皙和大量日晒史（例如，在建造房屋时）。\n\nBCC起源于表皮或毛囊的基底层中的角质形成细胞，最常见是由于紫外线辐射诱导的刺猬信号通路突变（导致过度激活和不受控制的细胞增殖）或TP53肿瘤抑制基因突变（导致失活）。在显微镜下，恶性基底样细胞通常在真皮中形成巢或索，外周细胞通常呈平行排列（即，外周栅栏状排列）{{exhibit_2}}。\n\n如该患者一样，BCC经常表现为粉红色或肤色丘疹，通常具有珍珠状或半透明的性质和/或中心毛细血管扩张血管。一些病变可能会出现隆起的边界和中心溃疡。\n\nBCC很少转移，但可能局部生长并侵犯附近的组织和结构。\n\n（选项A）皮下纤维瘤（即，良性纤维组织细胞瘤）代表真皮成纤维细胞和组织细胞的良性增殖。它们通常表现为小的、坚硬的、色素沉着的、孤立的丘疹/结节，用手捏时通常会出现凹陷。与BCC相比，它们通常出现在下肢（相对于面部），并且缺乏中心毛细血管扩张。\n\n（选项B）真皮血管内皮细胞的肿瘤性增殖可引起樱桃状血管瘤，这是成人中常见的良性血管肿瘤。它们通常表现为躯干上多个小的、可变白的红色丘疹。\n\n（选项D）表皮黑色素细胞源自神经嵴细胞，位于基底层内，在那里合成黑色素，使皮肤着色。它们可以转化为恶性黑色素瘤，通常表现为不对称的、色素沉着的斑块或斑块，边界不规则。\n\n（选项E）脂肪瘤是由皮下脂肪细胞引起的良性肿瘤。它们通常形成柔软、可移动的皮下肿块；覆盖的表皮是正常的。\n\n教育目标：\n基底细胞癌起源于表皮或毛囊基底层的角质形成细胞。它们最常发生在面部，并且通常表现为珍珠状或半透明的粉红色或肤色丘疹，伴有中心毛细血管扩张血管。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}}"
