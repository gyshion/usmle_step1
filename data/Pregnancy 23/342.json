    "en": "A 35-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 0, comes to the office for an initial prenatal visit. The patient has had no vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain and has not yet felt fetal movement. Menarche occurred at age 13. She sometimes has heavy menstrual bleeding with passage of clots, and other times she skips her menses. The patient's estimated gestational age based on her last menstrual period is 16 weeks. She has type 1 diabetes mellitus that is controlled with insulin. She smokes a pack of cigarettes daily. As part of her prenatal laboratory screening, a second-trimester maternal serum quadruple screen is performed and reveals an elevated alpha-fetoprotein level. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's abnormal screening result? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "The maternal serum quadruple screen is used to identify pregnancies at risk for congenital defects or fetal aneuploidy (eg, Down syndrome). It measures the concentration of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), estriol, beta-hCG, and inhibin A in the maternal blood. AFP is a glycoprotein produced in the fetal liver and gastrointestinal tract. Levels are dependent on gestational age and maternal conditions such as diabetes mellitus (typically associated with decreased MSAPP and estriol levels). Therefore, accurate pregnancy dating and complete medical history are required to correctly interpret an AFP level. The most common cause of an abnormal AFP level is inaccurate pregnancy dating (ie, dating error). In patients with irregular menses, dating by a last menstrual period can underestimate the true gestational age. Therefore, these patients require a fetal ultrasound, which can accurately determine gestational age and evaluate for other common causes of elevated MSAPP levels, which include multiple gestation (eg, twin pregnancy), open neural tube defects, and abdominal wall defects. {{exhibit_2}} (Choices B and C) Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) are associated with low AFP levels. (Choice D) Fetal growth restriction can occur due to tobacco use, which causes placental ischemia and resultant placental insufficiency. However, maternal serum quadruple screen shows decreased estriol levels, not increased AFP levels, with fetal growth restriction. (Choice E) Although the risk for fetal heart defects is increased with maternal diabetes mellitus, heart defects are not associated with abnormal AFP levels because AFP is not produced in fetal cardiac tissue. (Choice F) Hydatidiform moles and other gestational trophoblastic diseases typically present with markedly elevated beta-hCG levels, not elevated AFP levels. Patients may have vaginal bleeding and a significantly enlarged uterus. The educational objective is that the maternal serum quadruple screen assesses for risk of congenital defects and fetal aneuploidy and includes measurement of alpha-fetoprotein levels, which are dependent on gestational age. An abnormal alpha-fetoprotein level is most commonly due to a dating error (eg, inaccurate gestational age).",
    "zh": "母亲血清四联筛查用于识别患有先天性缺陷或胎儿非整倍体（例如，唐氏综合征）风险的妊娠。它测量母亲血液中甲胎蛋白 (AFP)、雌三醇、β-hCG 和抑制素 A 的浓度。 AFP 是一种在胎儿肝脏和胃肠道中产生的糖蛋白。其水平取决于孕龄和母亲状况，如糖尿病（通常与 MSAPP 和雌三醇水平降低相关）。因此，需要准确的孕龄估算和完整的病史才能正确解释 AFP 水平。 AFP 水平异常最常见的原因是不准确的孕龄估算（即，孕龄估算错误）。在月经不规律的患者中，通过末次月经来确定孕龄可能会低估真实的孕龄。因此，这些患者需要进行胎儿超声检查，可以准确确定孕龄，并评估其他常见的 MSAPP 水平升高的原因，包括多胎妊娠（例如，双胎妊娠）、开放性神经管缺陷和腹壁缺陷。 {{exhibit_2}} （选项 B 和 C）唐氏综合征（21三体）和爱德华兹综合征（18三体）与低 AFP 水平相关。（选项 D）胎儿生长受限可能由于吸烟引起，导致胎盘缺血和随之而来的胎盘功能不全。然而，母亲血清四联筛查显示，胎儿生长受限时，雌三醇水平降低，而不是 AFP 水平升高。（选项 E）尽管患有母亲糖尿病时，胎儿心脏缺陷的风险增加，但心脏缺陷与 AFP 水平异常无关，因为 AFP 不是在胎儿心脏组织中产生的。（选项 F）葡萄胎和其他妊娠滋养细胞疾病通常表现为 β-hCG 水平显著升高，而不是 AFP 水平升高。患者可能出现阴道出血和子宫明显增大。教育目标是，母亲血清四联筛查评估先天性缺陷和胎儿非整倍体的风险，并包括甲胎蛋白水平的测量，该水平取决于孕龄。 AFP 水平异常最常见的原因是孕龄估算错误（例如，孕龄不准确）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of maternal serum quadruple screening, specifically the interpretation of elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels in the context of a patient with irregular menses and other risk factors. It assesses knowledge of common causes of abnormal AFP, including dating errors, aneuploidies, and structural defects.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the abnormal lab finding (elevated AFP) and then consider the patient's history, particularly her irregular menstrual cycles, which makes dating by LMP unreliable. The most common cause of an elevated AFP in such a scenario is a dating error, leading to an underestimation of gestational age. Other options should be ruled out based on their typical association with normal or low AFP levels, or different screening markers.",
