    "en": "A 48-year-old woman comes to the office for follow-up of primary hypothyroidism due to chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. She feels well and has no palpitations, heat/cold intolerance, diarrhea/constipation, or changes in weight. The patient takes levothyroxine daily on an empty stomach. She has no other medical conditions and takes no other medications. The patient has no drug allergies and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg and pulse is 72/min. BMI is 27 kg/m². On physical examination, the thyroid is normal to palpation. There is no peripheral edema. Laboratory results show a serum TSH level of <0.01 µU/mL. Maintaining the current dose of levothyroxine would put this patient at the greatest risk for which of the following complications?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient is on thyroid replacement therapy for hypothyroidism and has a suppressed TSH (normal range: 0.5 to 5.0 µU/mL), indicating that her current dose is too high. Excess thyroid hormone, whether due to endogenous hyperthyroidism or iatrogenic over-replacement with levothyroxine, causes increased beta-adrenergic receptor expression. The resulting hyperadrenergic state can lead to significant cardiovascular complications. \n\nThyrotoxicosis is associated with hypertension, tachycardia, and increased myocyte automaticity. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION is the most common supraventricular arrhythmia and is a frequent complication of thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis also increases contractility, which increases myocardial oxygen demand and can PRECIPITATE ANGINA in patients with underlying coronary disease. It can also increase cardiac output (while also decreasing systemic vascular resistance) and lead to HIGH-OUTPUT HEART FAILURE. Therefore, even though this patient feels well, her dose of levothyroxine should be reduced to avoid long-term complications of over-replacement.\n\n(Choices A and E) Agranulocytosis is a potential complication of thionamide antithyroid drugs (eg, propylthiouracil, methimazole). Propylthiouracil can also cause hepatotoxicity. However, levothyroxine used in thyroid replacement therapy does not cause these complications.\n\n(Choice C) Thyroid over-replacement can cause insomnia and affective symptoms (eg, anxiety, irritability). Although hyperthyroidism in elderly patients may manifest as social withdrawal and slowed responses (apathetic depression) resembling dementia, cognitive dysfunction in younger patients is more likely to be seen in hypothyroidism rather than in hyperthyroidism.\n\n(Choice D) The goiter seen in hypothyroidism is due to chronic thyroid stimulation by TSH. This manifestation improves with the administration of levothyroxine (as TSH levels are decreased) and is not seen in over-replacement.\n\n(Choice F) Thyroid cancer is a potential long-term complication of radioiodine therapy for hyperthyroidism.\n\nEducational objective:\nThyrotoxicosis, whether due to endogenous hyperthyroidism or over-replacement with thyroid hormone in patients with hypothyroidism, causes a hyperadrenergic state that can lead to atrial fibrillation, high-output heart failure, and worsening of angina pectoris.",
    "zh": "该患者接受甲状腺功能减退症的甲状腺替代治疗，并且TSH受到抑制（正常范围：0.5至5.0 µU/mL），表明她目前的剂量过高。过量的甲状腺激素，无论是由于内源性甲状腺功能亢进症还是医源性左旋甲状腺素过量替代，都会导致β-肾上腺素能受体表达增加。由此产生的过度肾上腺素能状态可导致严重的心血管并发症。\n\n甲状腺毒症与高血压、心动过速和心肌细胞自律性增加有关。房颤是最常见的心上性心律失常，是甲状腺毒症的常见并发症。甲状腺毒症也会增加收缩力，从而增加心肌耗氧量，并可能诱发潜在冠心病患者的心绞痛。它还可以增加心输出量（同时降低全身血管阻力）并导致高输出性心力衰竭。因此，即使该患者感觉良好，也应减少其左旋甲状腺素的剂量，以避免过量替代的长期并发症。\n\n（选项A和E）粒细胞缺乏症是硫脲类抗甲状腺药物（例如，丙硫氧嘧啶，甲巯咪唑）的潜在并发症。丙硫氧嘧啶也可引起肝毒性。然而，用于甲状腺替代治疗的左旋甲状腺素不会引起这些并发症。\n\n（选项C）甲状腺激素过量替代可引起失眠和情感症状（例如，焦虑、烦躁）。尽管老年患者的甲状腺功能亢进症可能表现为社交退缩和反应迟缓（冷漠抑郁），类似于痴呆，但年轻患者的认知功能障碍更有可能见于甲状腺功能减退症而非甲状腺功能亢进症。\n\n（选项D）甲状腺功能减退症中出现的甲状腺肿是由于TSH对甲状腺的慢性刺激所致。这种表现会随着左旋甲状腺素的给药而改善（因为TSH水平降低），并且在过量替代中未见。\n\n（选项F）甲状腺癌是用于治疗甲状腺功能亢进症的放射性碘治疗的潜在长期并发症。\n\n教育目标：\n甲状腺毒症，无论是由于内源性甲状腺功能亢进症还是甲状腺功能减退症患者的甲状腺激素过量替代，都会引起过度肾上腺素能状态，从而导致房颤、高输出性心力衰竭和心绞痛恶化。"

    "en": "This question tests the complications of levothyroxine over-replacement in the treatment of hypothyroidism, specifically focusing on the cardiovascular effects of thyrotoxicosis. It requires understanding the relationship between TSH levels, thyroid hormone excess, and the resulting hyperadrenergic state. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that a suppressed TSH level in a patient on levothyroxine indicates over-replacement. Then, recall the most common cardiovascular complication of thyrotoxicosis, which is atrial fibrillation, and eliminate other options that are not directly related to levothyroxine over-replacement.",
