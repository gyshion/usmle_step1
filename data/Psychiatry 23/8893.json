    "en": "A 21-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 0, comes to the office for a prenatal visit at 16 weeks gestation. The patient, who has not gained weight since her last visit 4 weeks ago, has occasional nausea with vomiting twice a week. She has little appetite, which she attributes to mild indigestion, and her food consumption has decreased. However, the patient craves ice and has been consuming it throughout the day for the last few months. Medications include daily prenatal vitamins. The patient was prescribed twice-daily iron for anemia but does not take it because it causes constipation. She has no diarrhea, dysuria, chills, or fever. The patient does not use tobacco. The uterine fundus is consistent with a 16-week pregnancy. Fetal heart tone is 140-149/min. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits.",

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Pica is the compulsive consumption of nonfood substances for ≥1 month. The ingested substance usually has no caloric value (eg, ice), is not a culturally accepted food source, and its consumption is not appropriate to the person's developmental level. Pica is often associated with NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES, such as iron and zinc deficiencies.\n\nThe 3 main types of materials consumed are earth/soil-rich substances, raw starch (eg, flour), and ice. Ice is the most common, but many people ingest more than one substance. Craving ice is particularly associated with IRON-DEFICIENCY ANEMIA, which is common in PREGNANCY due to increased iron requirements to supply the fetus, placenta, and expansion in maternal red blood cell mass.\n\n(Choice A) Patients with anorexia nervosa restrict caloric intake to maintain a low body weight (typical BMI <18.5 kg/m²). They may demonstrate decreased food consumption, like this patient, but they do not typically consume large quantities of ice. Anorexia nervosa should be suspected in pregnant patients with weight loss, low body weight, and distorted body image or intense fear of weight gain.\n\n(Choice B) Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is the avoidance of eating due to unpleasant sensations (eg, taste, texture, smell) associated with a particular foodstuff or fear of the consequences of eating (eg, fear of choking or vomiting). Although this patient has reduced her food consumption due to indigestion, she does not fear or avoid particular foods.\n\n(Choice C) Bulimia nervosa involves episodes of binge eating followed by behaviors to compensate for weight gain (eg, vomiting, fasting, diuretic and/or laxative use), which are not seen in this patient.\n\n(Choice D) Hyperemesis gravidarum is severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy that can lead to weight loss and electrolyte imbalances. In contrast, this patient's occasional nausea/vomiting (eg, twice weekly) is consistent with normal morning sickness.\n\n(Choice E) Patients with normal pregnancy cravings typically desire nutritive (ie, calorie-containing) foods, particularly those with a sweet or salty taste (eg, ice cream, pickles).\n\nEducational objective:\nPica is the compulsive consumption of a nonfood substance. It is often associated with iron deficiency anemia, which is common during pregnancy, and other forms of nutritional deficiency (eg, zinc).",
    "zh": "异食癖是指强迫性地摄入非食物物质≥1个月。摄入的物质通常没有热量（如冰），不是文化上可接受的食物来源，并且其摄入不符合该人的发育水平。异食癖通常与营养缺乏有关，例如铁和锌缺乏。\n\n摄入的三种主要物质类型是富含泥土/土壤的物质、生淀粉（如面粉）和冰。冰是最常见的，但许多人摄入不止一种物质。对冰的渴望特别与缺铁性贫血有关，这在妊娠期间很常见，因为妊娠需要增加铁的需求以供应胎儿、胎盘和母体红细胞量的扩张。\n\n（选项A）神经性厌食症患者限制热量摄入以维持低体重（典型BMI <18.5 kg/m²）。他们可能会表现出食物摄入量减少，就像这位患者一样，但他们通常不会摄入大量的冰。对于孕妇出现体重减轻、体重低以及对体像的扭曲或对体重增加的强烈恐惧时，应怀疑神经性厌食症。\n\n（选项B）回避/限制性食物摄入障碍是指由于与特定食物相关的令人不愉快的感觉（例如，味道、质地、气味）或害怕进食的后果（例如，害怕窒息或呕吐）而避免进食。虽然该患者由于消化不良而减少了食物摄入量，但她并没有害怕或避免特定的食物。\n\n（选项C）神经性贪食症包括暴食发作，随后出现补偿体重增加的行为（例如，呕吐、禁食、利尿剂和/或泻药），而这些在该患者中并未观察到。\n\n（选项D）妊娠剧吐是妊娠期间严重的恶心和呕吐，可导致体重减轻和电解质失衡。相比之下，该患者偶尔出现的恶心/呕吐（例如，每周两次）与正常的晨吐一致。\n\n（选项E）有正常妊娠渴望的患者通常渴望营养丰富的（即，含热量）的食物，尤其是那些具有甜味或咸味的食物（例如，冰淇淋、泡菜）。\n\n教育目标：\n异食癖是指强迫性地摄入非食物物质。它通常与缺铁性贫血有关，这在妊娠期间很常见，也与其他形式的营养缺乏（例如锌）有关。"

    "en": "This question tests the diagnosis of Pica in a pregnant patient presenting with unusual cravings and associated symptoms. It requires differentiating Pica from other eating disorders and pregnancy-related conditions based on the specific nature of the craving and the patient's overall clinical presentation.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully evaluate the patient's chief complaint and history, paying close attention to the type of craving (ice), its frequency, and any associated symptoms or medical history. Consider the differential diagnoses provided and rule them out based on the specific diagnostic criteria for each condition.",
