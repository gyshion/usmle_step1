    "en": "This lethargic child with bilateral retinal hemorrhages and a large, full, anterior fontanelle has most likely experienced abusive head trauma (AHT). Abusive head trauma (AHT), formerly known as shaken baby syndrome, is inflicted intracranial injury usually due to vigorous shaking. The resultant injuries are due to infants' unique anatomic features. Infants have larger heads, enlarged subarachnoid spaces, higher brain water content, and decreased cervical muscle tone compared to older children. These factors lead to increased movement of the immature brain in relation to the skull, shearing the bridging cortical veins that run between the dura and arachnoid mater (subdural space). This can result in multiple subdural hematomas; because AHT may occur repeatedly over weeks to months, chronic subdural hemorrhages are often seen. {{exhibit_2}} The shaking motion also applies shearing forces at the interface between the vitreous and the retinal vessels (vitreoretinal traction), commonly causing bilateral retinal hemorrhage. Posterior rib fractures are another frequent manifestation due to grasping of the torso during shaking. (Choice B) Although bacterial meningitis can cause lethargy and a bulging fontanelle, patients are typically febrile and bilateral retinal hemorrhages would not be expected. (Choice C) Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), caused by platelet autoantibody formation, presents with petechiae, ecchymoses, and bleeding after minor trauma. Intracranial hemorrhage is rare, and retinal hemorrhages are not seen in patients with ITP. (Choice D) Although vitamin K deficiency can present with intracranial bleeding, bilateral retinal hemorrhages are not typical, and patients with bleeding due to vitamin K deficiency usually come to medical attention within a week after birth. In addition, this patient's other red flags (eg, history inconsistent with development) are more concerning for AHT. (Choice E) Retinoblastoma is the most common ocular tumor of infancy and presents with absence of the red reflex on physical examination. Lethargy, a bulging fontanelle, and retinal hemorrhage are not seen. (Choice F) An accidental fall from bed-height would be generally insufficient to cause a large intracranial hemorrhage resulting in altered mental status, and would not explain this patient's retinal hemorrhages. In addition, the history provided by this patient's parent does not match his developmental age (rolling over is not typical before age 4 months). Educational objective: Abusive head trauma is classically caused by vigorous shaking of an infant and results in subdural hemorrhage (due to shearing of bridging cortical veins) and retinal hemorrhages (sheared retinal vessels). Additional red flags include injuries inconsistent with history or developmental age. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "这个患有双侧视网膜出血和饱满的前囟门的嗜睡儿童很可能经历了虐待性头部外伤 (AHT)。虐待性头部外伤 (AHT)，以前称为婴儿摇晃综合征，是由于剧烈摇晃引起的颅内损伤。由此造成的损伤是由于婴儿独特的解剖特征。与年龄较大的儿童相比，婴儿的头部更大，蛛网膜下腔增大，脑含水量更高，颈部肌肉张力降低。这些因素导致未成熟的大脑相对于颅骨的运动增加，剪切了位于硬脑膜和蛛网膜之间的桥静脉（硬膜下腔）。这可能导致多发性硬膜下血肿；由于 AHT 可能会在数周到数月内反复发生，因此经常会看到慢性硬膜下出血。{{exhibit_2}} 摇晃动作也会对玻璃体和视网膜血管之间的界面（玻璃体视网膜牵引力）施加剪切力，通常会导致双侧视网膜出血。后肋骨骨折是由于摇晃过程中抓住躯干而导致的另一种常见表现。（选项 B）尽管细菌性脑膜炎可引起嗜睡和囟门膨隆，但患者通常会发烧，并且不应出现双侧视网膜出血。（选项 C）特发性血小板减少性紫癜 (ITP) 是由血小板自身抗体形成引起的，表现为瘀点、瘀斑和轻微外伤后的出血。颅内出血很少见，ITP 患者未见视网膜出血。（选项 D）尽管维生素 K 缺乏症可表现为颅内出血，但双侧视网膜出血不典型，且因维生素 K 缺乏症引起出血的患者通常在出生后一周内就医。此外，该患者的其他危险信号（例如，病史与发育不符）更令人担忧 AHT。（选项 E）视网膜母细胞瘤是婴儿最常见的眼部肿瘤，表现为体格检查时红光反射缺失。未见嗜睡、囟门膨隆和视网膜出血。（选项 F）从床的高度意外跌落通常不足以引起导致精神状态改变的大量颅内出血，并且无法解释该患者的视网膜出血。此外，该患者的父母提供的病史与其发育年龄不符（4 个月前翻身不典型）。教育目标：虐待性头部外伤通常是由剧烈摇晃婴儿引起的，导致硬膜下出血（由于剪切桥静脉）和视网膜出血（剪切视网膜血管）。其他危险信号包括与病史或发育年龄不符的损伤。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the recognition of abusive head trauma (AHT) in an infant, focusing on the characteristic triad of subdural hematomas, retinal hemorrhages, and altered mental status, along with the understanding of why other differential diagnoses are less likely. It emphasizes the importance of correlating physical findings with the provided history and considering the typical presentations of various pediatric emergencies.\n\nTo solve this question, one should first identify the key clinical features presented: lethargy, bulging fontanelle, and bilateral retinal hemorrhages in an infant. Then, consider the differential diagnoses provided in the options and evaluate which one best explains all the findings, paying close attention to the mechanism of injury and typical age-related presentations. The history of the infant rolling off a bed should be critically assessed for plausibility in causing the observed injuries.",
