    "en": "An 82-year-old man is found unresponsive by his neighbor. The patient lives alone in his suburban home. When the neighbor went to check on him, the patient was on the floor and not answering any questions. His medical history is unknown. On arrival of emergency medical services, the patient is obtunded and responds only to painful stimuli. Supportive measures are begun, including endotracheal intubation, but the patient dies en route to the hospital. Autopsy reveals extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the coronary and internal carotid arteries. Histopathologic examination of the brain in the right middle cerebral artery territory shows neurons with intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm and nuclear fragmentation. Based on these findings, this patient's cerebral injury most likely occurred approximately how long ago?",
    "zh": "一位82岁男性被邻居发现无反应。患者独自居住在郊区家中。当邻居去查看他时，患者倒在地上，没有回答任何问题。他的病史不详。急救医疗服务人员到达时，患者意识模糊，仅对疼痛刺激有反应。开始采取支持措施，包括气管插管，但在送往医院的途中患者死亡。尸检显示广泛的动脉粥样硬化，累及冠状动脉和颈内动脉。右侧大脑中动脉区域的脑组织病理学检查显示神经元具有强烈的嗜酸性细胞质和核碎裂。根据这些发现，该患者的脑损伤最可能发生于大约多久之前？"

    "en": "This patient was found unconscious, in rapid hemodynamic decline, an unknown amount of time after an inciting cardiovascular event. The autopsy demonstrates histopathologic evidence of ischemic stroke caused by widespread atherosclerosis. Sustained interruption in blood circulation to branches of the internal carotid arteries (eg, middle cerebral artery) can lead to tissue hypoxia and irreversible cellular injury with characteristic microscopic and macroscopic changes.\n\nSpecific findings vary with time but follow a predictable course. Red neurons are typically seen 12-24 hours after irreversible ischemic injury and are characterized by intense eosinophilic staining of the cytoplasm due to dissolution of Nissl bodies (basophilic granules consisting of rough endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes). The nuclei also become pyknotic (eg, shrunken and deeply basophilic) and undergo fragmentation (karyorrhexis). After about a day, the tissue damage promotes neutrophil infiltration, followed by macrophage/microglial recruitment a few days later.\n\n(Choice A) There is typically little change in the microscopic or macroscopic appearance of brain tissue <1 hour after irreversible ischemic injury.\n\n(Choice C) At 1-2 weeks, there will be robust phagocytosis of neuron and myelin breakdown products by activated macrophages/microglia. Around this time, astrocytes start proliferating with the development of a network of cytoplasmic extensions (reactive gliosis), and new vessels are formed in the periphery of the necrotic area.\n\n(Choices D and E) Several months to years after brain infarction, the necrotic area appears as a cystic cavity surrounded by a wall of dense fibers formed by astrocytic processes (glial scar).\n\nEducational objective:\nInadequate blood supply to the brain (eg, arterial thrombosis or embolism) leads to ischemic stroke. The first microscopic changes are typically seen 12-24 hours after irreversible ischemic injury and include intense eosinophilic staining of the neuronal cytoplasm (red neurons) and nuclear fragmentation.",
    "zh": "该患者被发现不省人事，在诱发性心血管事件发生后，血流动力学迅速下降，具体时间不详。尸检显示，组织病理学证据表明，广泛的动脉粥样硬化导致缺血性卒中。持续中断流向颈内动脉分支（例如，大脑中动脉）的血液循环可导致组织缺氧和不可逆的细胞损伤，并具有特征性的微观和宏观变化。\n\n具体发现随时间而异，但遵循可预测的进程。红染神经元通常在不可逆缺血性损伤后12-24小时出现，其特征是细胞质强烈的嗜酸性染色，这是由于尼氏体（由粗面内质网和核糖体组成的嗜碱性颗粒）溶解所致。细胞核也变得固缩（例如，萎缩且深度嗜碱性），并发生碎裂（核碎裂）。大约一天后，组织损伤会促进中性粒细胞浸润，几天后会发生巨噬细胞/小胶质细胞募集。\n\n（选项A）在不可逆缺血性损伤后<1小时，脑组织的微观或宏观外观通常几乎没有变化。\n\n（选项C）在1-2周时，活化的巨噬细胞/小胶质细胞会对神经元和髓磷脂分解产物进行强烈的吞噬作用。大约在这个时候，星形胶质细胞开始增殖，形成细胞质延伸网络（反应性神经胶质增生），并且在新生的坏死区域周围形成新的血管。\n\n（选项D和E）脑梗死后数月至数年，坏死区域呈现为囊性空腔，周围由星形胶质细胞突起形成的致密纤维壁（神经胶质瘢痕）包绕。\n\n教育目标：\n脑部供血不足（例如，动脉血栓形成或栓塞）会导致缺血性卒中。最初的微观变化通常在不可逆缺血性损伤后12-24小时出现，包括神经元细胞质的强烈嗜酸性染色（红染神经元）和核碎裂。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the timeline of microscopic changes following an ischemic stroke, specifically the appearance of red neurons. The key is to recognize the histopathological findings of intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm and nuclear fragmentation, which are characteristic of red neurons seen 12-24 hours after an ischemic event.\n\nTo solve this question, correlate the provided histopathological findings with the expected timeline of changes after an ischemic stroke. Remember that red neurons, with their characteristic eosinophilic cytoplasm and nuclear fragmentation, are a hallmark of the 12-24 hour timeframe.",
