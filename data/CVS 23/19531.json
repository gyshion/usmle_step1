    "en": "This patient with a harsh, holosystolic murmur along the lower left sternal border most likely has a ventricular septal defect (VSD), an abnormal connection between the right ventricle (RV) and the left ventricle (LV). Deoxygenated blood is normally delivered to the right atrium (RA) from the systemic circulation, and oxygenated blood is delivered to the left atrium (LA) via the pulmonary circulation. Because of increased pressure on the left side of the heart compared to the right, a VSD allows for left-to-right shunting of blood. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nThe delivery of oxygenated blood to the RV via a VSD results in increased RV oxygen saturation (SaO₂) compared to that of a patient with an anatomically normal heart. The SaO₂ in the other cardiac chambers and systemic circulation remains unchanged, and patients are often asymptomatic (eg, no shortness of breath, cyanosis, or clubbing).\n\n(Choice A) In tricuspid atresia (absent communication between the RA and the RV), an atrial septal defect (ASD) is always present, allowing deoxygenated blood to flow from the RA to the LA. This decreases SaO₂ in the LA, LV, and systemic circulation, causing neonatal cyanosis. The little blood that reaches the lungs usually does so through a VSD, causing a relative increase in RV SaO₂.\n\n(Choice B) The pattern of increased right-sided and decreased left-sided SaO₂ is seen in total anomalous pulmonary venous return, a condition in which the pulmonary veins (ie, oxygenated blood) drain into the RA rather than the LA.\n\n(Choice C) An ASD typically causes left-to-right shunting of oxygenated blood between the atria, increasing SaO₂ in both the RA and RV. In contrast to a VSD, an ASD typically causes a systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border (pulmonic flow murmur).\n\n(Choice E) Over time, increased pulmonary blood flow from left-to-right shunting via a VSD can reverse to right-to-left shunting (ie, Eisenmenger syndrome). SaO₂ on the right side will be normal, whereas that in the LV and systemic circulation is decreased because of mixing with deoxygenated blood from the RV. However, Eisenmenger syndrome takes years to develop and typically presents with signs of right heart failure and cyanosis in adolescents/adults. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "这位患者在左下胸骨旁有响亮的全收缩期杂音，最有可能患有室间隔缺损（VSD），即右心室（RV）和左心室（LV）之间的异常连接。正常情况下，来自体循环的去氧血输送到右心房（RA），而氧合血通过肺循环输送到左心房（LA）。由于心脏左侧的压力高于右侧，VSD允许血液从左向右分流。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n通过VSD将氧合血输送到RV会导致RV血氧饱和度（SaO₂）升高，而与解剖结构正常的心脏的患者相比。其他心腔和体循环的SaO₂保持不变，患者通常无症状（例如，无呼吸急促、发绀或杵状指）。\n\n（选项A）在三尖瓣闭锁（RA和RV之间无交通）中，始终存在房间隔缺损（ASD），允许去氧血从RA流向LA。这会降低LA、LV和体循环中的SaO₂，引起新生儿发绀。少量到达肺部的血液通常通过VSD，导致RV SaO₂相对升高。\n\n（选项B）在完全肺静脉异位引流中，可观察到右侧升高和左侧降低的SaO₂模式，在这种情况下，肺静脉（即，氧合血）引流入RA而不是LA。\n\n（选项C）ASD通常导致房间之间的氧合血从左向右分流，从而增加RA和RV中的SaO₂。与VSD相比，ASD通常会在左上胸骨旁引起收缩期喷射性杂音（肺动脉血流杂音）。\n\n（选项E）随着时间的推移，通过VSD从左向右分流增加的肺血流量会逆转为从右向左分流（即，Eisenmenger综合征）。右侧的SaO₂将正常，而LV和体循环中的SaO₂则由于与来自RV的去氧血混合而降低。然而，Eisenmenger综合征需要数年时间才能发展，通常表现为青少年/成人的右心衰竭和发绀体征。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of ventricular septal defect (VSD) and its effect on oxygen saturation in different heart chambers. A VSD causes left-to-right shunting, leading to increased oxygen saturation in the right ventricle due to the mixing of oxygenated blood from the left ventricle. The oxygen saturation in other chambers and systemic circulation remains relatively unchanged.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of a VSD (harsh holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border). Understand the pathophysiology of left-to-right shunting and its impact on oxygen saturation levels in the heart chambers. Eliminate options that suggest changes in oxygen saturation inconsistent with VSD physiology.",
