    "en": "A 74-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to acute-onset lower abdominal and back pain that was followed by an episode of syncope 2 hours ago. The pain is sharp and constant. He has had no changes in bowel or bladder function. Other medical conditions include hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient has a 50-pack-year history of smoking cigarettes. Temperature is 36.9 C (98.4 F), blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, pulse is 108/min and regular, and respirations are 18/min. BMI is 34 kg/m². The patient is diaphoretic and appears pale. Heart and lung sounds are normal. Abdominal examination reveals moderate tenderness to deep palpation in the lower abdomen; there is no guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are normal.",

    "en": "Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a surgical emergency involving full-thickness compromise of the aortic wall with extravasation of blood into surrounding tissues and spaces. The acute onset of severe abdominal and back pain is the most common presenting symptom. In general, anterior rupture into the peritoneal cavity is quickly accompanied by syncope, hypotension, and shock, whereas posterior rupture into the retroperitoneum may be temporarily contained, resulting in delayed onset of hemodynamic instability. Other signs suggesting AAA rupture include abdominal distension, a pulsatile abdominal mass, and umbilical or flank hematoma (indicators of retroperitoneal hemorrhage).\n\nEarly detection of AAA can be difficult because patients frequently have few symptoms until the AAA either ruptures or markedly expands. Therefore, ruptured AAA should be suspected in patients with consistent symptoms and known risk factors, which include advanced age (>60), smoking, male sex, and a history of atherosclerosis or connective tissue disease. CT imaging can confirm the diagnosis, but hemodynamically unstable patients with suspected ruptured AAA should go straight to emergent surgical repair. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Acute mesenteric ischemia has similar risk factors to AAA. Patients typically describe severe abdominal pain but have few findings on physical examination (eg, minimal tenderness) and hypotension and syncope are not usually seen.\n\n(Choice B) Colonic perforation can be due to diverticulitis, malignancy, or complications from colonoscopy. Patients can develop hypotension due to sepsis, but signs of infection (eg, fever) and peritonitis (eg, rebound, guarding) are also expected.\n\n(Choice C) Renal colic is characterized by episodic (eg, every 30 min) flank or groin pain due to capsular stretch from nephrolithiasis-associated obstruction. Hypotension and syncope are not typical features.\n\n(Choice E) Vertebral compression fractures can cause acute back pain exacerbated by minimal movement (eg, coughing, bending). Although the pain can occasionally refer to the abdomen, it is most commonly at the midline over the spinous processes. There should not be associated hypotension.\n\nEducational objective:\nRuptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is a surgical emergency that usually presents with the acute onset of severe abdominal and back pain in patients with appropriate risk factors (eg, advanced age, smoking, atherosclerosis). Accompanying syncope, hypotension, and shock may occur quickly (intraperitoneal rupture) or may be delayed (retroperitoneal rupture).",
    "zh": "腹主动脉瘤破裂（AAA）是一种外科急症，涉及主动脉壁的全层受损，血液外渗到周围组织和空间。突发严重的腹部和背部疼痛是最常见的首发症状。一般来说，向前破入腹腔会迅速伴有晕厥、低血压和休克，而向后破入腹膜后间隙则可能暂时被限制，导致血流动力学不稳定的延迟发生。其他提示 AAA 破裂的体征包括腹胀、搏动性腹部肿块以及脐部或侧腹血肿（腹膜后出血的指标）。\n\nAAA 的早期检测可能很困难，因为患者在 AAA 破裂或明显扩张之前通常只有少数症状。因此，对于具有一致症状和已知危险因素的患者，应怀疑 AAA 破裂，这些危险因素包括高龄（>60岁）、吸烟、男性和动脉粥样硬化或结缔组织病史。CT 影像学检查可以确诊，但对于血流动力学不稳定的疑似 AAA 破裂患者应立即进行急诊手术修复。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项 A） 急性肠系膜缺血与 AAA 有相似的危险因素。患者通常描述严重的腹痛，但在体格检查中发现很少（例如，轻微压痛），并且通常不会出现低血压和晕厥。\n\n（选项 B） 结肠穿孔可能是由于憩室炎、恶性肿瘤或结肠镜检查并发症引起的。患者可能因败血症而发生低血压，但也可能出现感染体征（例如，发烧）和腹膜炎（例如，反跳痛，腹肌紧张）。\n\n（选项 C） 肾绞痛的特征是由于肾结石相关的梗阻引起的包膜牵张而出现的阵发性（例如，每30分钟一次）侧腹或腹股沟疼痛。低血压和晕厥不是典型特征。\n\n（选项 E） 椎体压缩性骨折可引起因轻微活动（例如，咳嗽、弯腰）而加剧的急性背痛。虽然疼痛有时可以放射到腹部，但最常见于棘突正中线上。不应伴有低血压。\n\n教学目标：\n腹主动脉瘤破裂是一种外科急症，通常表现为具有适当危险因素的患者（例如，高龄、吸烟、动脉粥样硬化）突发严重的腹部和背部疼痛。伴随晕厥、低血压和休克可能很快发生（腹腔内破裂），也可能延迟（腹膜后破裂）。"

Key elements include acute abdominal/back pain, syncope, hypotension, and risk factors like age and smoking.\n\nTo solve this, recognize the classic triad of abdominal/back pain, hypotension, and pulsatile mass (if present).
