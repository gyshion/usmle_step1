    "en": "A 43-year-old man comes to the office due to depression. He feels sad and unmotivated, sleeps 12 hours a day, and has increased appetite, poor concentration at work, and fleeting thoughts of suicide. The patient has no medical history and laboratory evaluation is unremarkable. Major depressive disorder is diagnosed and antidepressant medication administered. Several weeks after starting the medication, the patient's depressive symptoms are mildly improved, but he is now distressed by a significant decrease in libido and impaired sexual performance. He is considering stopping the medication and requests an alternate treatment.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient was most likely treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), a commonly prescribed initial treatment for major depressive disorder that causes sexual dysfunction in up to 50% of patients. SSRI-related sexual side effects include decreased libido, decreased arousal, anorgasmia, and increased ejaculation latency.\n\nBupropion is an antidepressant that does not cause sexual dysfunction. It is classified as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Because of its stimulating effects, bupropion is useful in treating depression associated with hypersomnia and low energy. Bupropion is also preferred because it causes less weight gain compared with other antidepressants.\nBupropion is contraindicated in patients with bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa, and seizure disorders because it lowers the seizure threshold.\n(Choices B and D) Citalopram and sertraline are SSRIs that would likely cause sexual dysfunction in this patient. Switching to a non-SSRI such as bupropion is more likely to improve his sexual dysfunction.\n(Choice C) Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant with numerous side effects, including sexual dysfunction. These types of antidepressants are dangerous in overdose because of cardiotoxicity, so they are not a first-line treatment for depression.\n(Choice E) Trazodone is a highly sedating antidepressant that can be helpful for patients with insomnia. Trazodone can cause sexual dysfunction and priapism, a rare but serious side effect.\n(Choice F) Venlafaxine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that can cause sexual side effects.\n\nEducational objective:\nSexual dysfunction is seen in up to 50% of patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, is a first-line treatment for major depressive disorder and does not cause sexual dysfunction.",
    "zh": "该患者很可能接受了选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（SSRI）的治疗，这是一种常用于治疗重度抑郁症的初始治疗药物，可导致多达50%的患者出现性功能障碍。SSRI相关的性副作用包括性欲下降、唤醒度降低、性高潮障碍和射精延迟。\n\n安非他酮是一种不会引起性功能障碍的抗抑郁药。它被归类为去甲肾上腺素-多巴胺再摄取抑制剂。由于其刺激作用，安非他酮可用于治疗与嗜睡和低能量相关的抑郁症。安非他酮也是优选药物，因为它与其他抗抑郁药相比，引起的体重增加较少。\n安非他酮禁用于神经性贪食症、神经性厌食症和癫痫患者，因为它会降低癫痫发作阈值。\n（选项B和D）西酞普兰和舍曲林是SSRI，可能会导致该患者出现性功能障碍。改用安非他酮等非SSRI药物更有可能改善他的性功能障碍。\n（选项C）丙咪嗪是一种三环类抗抑郁药，具有多种副作用，包括性功能障碍。这些类型的抗抑郁药在过量时具有危险性，因为具有心脏毒性，因此它们不是治疗抑郁症的一线药物。\n（选项E）曲唑酮是一种镇静作用很强的抗抑郁药，可用于帮助失眠患者。曲唑酮可引起性功能障碍和阴茎异常勃起，这是一种罕见但严重的副作用。\n（选项F）文拉法辛是一种5-羟色胺-去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂，可引起性副作用。\n\n教育目标：\n在接受选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂治疗的患者中，高达50%的患者会出现性功能障碍。安非他酮是一种去甲肾上腺素-多巴胺再摄取抑制剂，是治疗重度抑郁症的一线药物，不会引起性功能障碍。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of antidepressant side effects, specifically sexual dysfunction associated with SSRIs, and the appropriate management strategy by switching to an alternative agent with a different mechanism of action.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the likely class of antidepressant the patient was initially prescribed based on its common side effects, and then selecting an alternative antidepressant that is known to have a lower incidence of sexual dysfunction.",
