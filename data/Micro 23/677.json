    "en": "A 45-year-old man comes to the physician due to pain, swelling, and erythema affecting his right leg. He says that he suffered a minor cut to his leg a few days ago while cleaning his garage. Physical examination shows an indurated region surrounding a minor laceration that is draining a purulent exudate. He is diagnosed with cellulitis and started on the appropriate treatment. Gram stain of the exudate shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. The organism most likely responsible for this patient's infection synthesizes a protein as part of its peptidoglycan cell wall that does which of the following?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Clusters of gram-positive cocci on Gram stain is a characteristic finding of staphylococcal species such as *Staphylococcus aureus*. Protein A is a virulence factor that forms part of the outer peptidoglycan layer of *S. aureus*. Protein A binds with the Fc portion of IgG antibodies at the complement-binding site, preventing complement activation (Choice A). This results in decreased production of C3b, leading to impaired opsonization and phagocytosis.\n\n(Choice C) Hemolysin is secreted by staphylococci and causes hemolysis as well as the destruction of neutrophils, macrophages, and platelets. It is a secreted factor that is not bound to the cell wall.\n\n(Choice D) *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* produce IgA proteases that cause cleavage of IgA antibodies, preventing them from interfering with bacterial adhesion to mucous membranes.\n\n(Choice E) Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (found on antigen presenting cells) normally interacts with processed antigens, presenting them to T-lymphocytes to initiate an immune response. In contrast, superantigens (enterotoxins, toxic shock syndrome toxin) interact with MHC class II and the T-cell receptor outside of standard antigen binding sites to initiate widespread and nonspecific activation of T- lymphocytes. Although superantigens are synthesized by staphylococci, they are not bound to the peptidoglycan cell wall.\n\nEducational objective: Protein A is a virulence factor found in the peptidoglycan cell wall of *Staphylococcus aureus* that binds to the Fc portion of IgG, leading to impaired complement activation, opsonization, and phagocytosis.",
    "zh": "革兰染色显示成簇的革兰阳性球菌是葡萄球菌属（如金黄色葡萄球菌）的特征性表现。蛋白A是一种毒力因子，是金黄色葡萄球菌外层肽聚糖层的一部分。蛋白A与IgG抗体的Fc片段在补体结合位点结合，阻止补体激活（选项A）。这导致C3b的产生减少，从而导致调理作用和吞噬作用受损。\n\n（选项C）溶血素由葡萄球菌分泌，引起溶血以及中性粒细胞、巨噬细胞和血小板的破坏。它是一种分泌因子，不与细胞壁结合。\n\n（选项D）肺炎链球菌和淋病奈瑟菌产生IgA蛋白酶，导致IgA抗体裂解，阻止其干扰细菌粘附于粘膜。\n\n（选项E）主要组织相容性复合物（MHC）II类（存在于抗原呈递细胞上）通常与加工后的抗原相互作用，将其呈递给T淋巴细胞以启动免疫反应。相比之下，超抗原（肠毒素、中毒性休克综合征毒素）与MHC II类和T细胞受体在标准抗原结合位点之外相互作用，以启动T淋巴细胞的广泛和非特异性激活。尽管超抗原由葡萄球菌合成，但它们不与肽聚糖细胞壁结合。\n\n教育目标：蛋白A是金黄色葡萄球菌肽聚糖细胞壁中的一种毒力因子，可与IgG的Fc片段结合，导致补体激活、调理作用和吞噬作用受损。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Staphylococcus aureus virulence factors, specifically Protein A, and its mechanism of action in evading the immune system. Understanding the interaction between Protein A and IgG is crucial.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the gram-positive cocci in clusters as indicative of Staphylococcus, then recall the function of Protein A in binding the Fc portion of IgG, thereby inhibiting complement activation and opsonization.",
