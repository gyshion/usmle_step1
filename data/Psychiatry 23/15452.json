    "en": "A 16-year-old boy is brought to the office for a well-child visit. The patient has no medical history but reports that his appetite is low and he has lost 2.3 kg (5 lb). He stopped playing soccer recently due to lack of interest. The patient is also worried about his grades due to difficulty staying focused in class and concentrating on his homework after school. He feels tired despite sleeping 10 hours a night and taking afternoon naps when he gets home. The patient says, \"My parents try to be supportive, but everything they say these days gets on my nerves.\" He has tried alcohol and marijuana a few times at parties but does not use other drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable.",

    "en": "This patient's loss of interest, weight loss, hypersomnia, low energy level, and impaired concentration are concerning for MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD). Depressed adolescents may experience feelings of annoyance and IRRITABILITY rather than sadness. Other common signs are loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, changes in academic functioning and relationships with peers and family, feelings of worthlessness/inappropriate guilt, and SUICIDAL THOUGHTS.\n\nSUICIDE is the third leading cause of death in adolescents age 15-19 years. Any adolescent with behavioral changes should be assessed for SUICIDAL IDEATION, which has an immediate impact on safety and acute management (eg, an actively suicidal patient may require hospitalization). Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to assess this patient for suicidal thoughts.\n\n(Choice A) This patient's recent difficulty concentrating is one of multiple symptoms characteristic of depression. In attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, concentration difficulties are chronic, with typical onset prior to adolescence.\n\n(Choice B) It would be inappropriate to involve the parents prior to fully assessing the patient and his safety.\n\n(Choices C and D) A complete blood count and thyroid function testing may be included as part of a workup to rule out medical causes of depressive symptoms (eg, anemia, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism). However, these conditions are unlikely to be contributory in a patient with no medical history and a normal physical examination. In addition, the results of these tests take time, whereas suicidality and safety are immediate concerns.\n\n(Choice F) This patient appears to be forthcoming about his substance use and has no signs of intoxication or abuse. Screening the urine for drugs is unlikely to yield helpful information and may damage the trusting relationship with the patient.\n\nEducational objective:\nDepressed adolescents may display irritable rather than depressed mood, declining academic performance, and withdrawal from social activities. Initial evaluation of all children and adolescents with suspected depression should include a careful SUICIDE RISK ASSESSMENT.",
    "zh": "该患者的兴趣丧失、体重减轻、嗜睡、低能量水平和注意力受损令人担忧，提示重度抑郁障碍 (MDD)。抑郁的青少年可能会感到烦恼和易怒，而不是悲伤。其他常见体征包括对先前喜欢的活动失去兴趣、学业表现和与同伴及家人的关系发生变化、感到毫无价值/不适当的内疚感以及自杀念头。\n\n自杀是15-19岁青少年死亡的第三大原因。任何出现行为改变的青少年都应进行自杀意念评估，这会立即影响安全和急性期管理（例如，积极自杀的患者可能需要住院治疗）。因此，最合适的下一步是评估该患者的自杀念头。\n\n(选项 A) 该患者最近难以集中注意力是抑郁症的多种特征性症状之一。在注意力缺陷多动障碍中，注意力困难是慢性的，通常在青春期前发病。\n\n(选项 B) 在充分评估患者及其安全之前，让父母参与是不合适的。\n\n(选项 C 和 D) 全血细胞计数和甲状腺功能检测可作为排除抑郁症状的医学病因（例如，贫血、甲状腺功能减退或甲状腺功能亢进）的一部分进行检查。然而，对于无既往病史且体格检查正常的患者，这些情况不太可能起作用。此外，这些测试的结果需要时间，而自杀倾向和安全是即时关注的问题。\n\n(选项 F) 该患者似乎坦诚地谈论了他的物质使用情况，并且没有任何中毒或滥用的迹象。进行尿液药物筛查不太可能产生有用的信息，并且可能会损害与患者的信任关系。\n\n教育目标：\n抑郁的青少年可能表现出易怒而不是抑郁的情绪、学业成绩下降以及退出社交活动。对所有疑似抑郁症的儿童和青少年进行初步评估时，应包括仔细的自杀风险评估。"

    "en": "This question tests the recognition of major depressive disorder in adolescents, emphasizing the importance of assessing for suicidal ideation as the immediate priority in management. It also highlights characteristic features of depression in this age group, such as irritability and declining academic performance.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the constellation of symptoms suggestive of depression, considering the unique presentation in adolescents, and prioritizing immediate safety concerns, particularly the risk of suicide, over less urgent diagnostic workups.",
