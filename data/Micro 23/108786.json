    "en": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the clinic due to cough. His parents report that he had a low-grade fever last night, and this morning he woke up with a temperature of 39 C (102.2 F), itchy rash all over his body, and cough. Two weeks ago, the patient was playing with his cousin who also developed an itchy rash that lasted about a week. He has a history of liver transplantation and is taking immunosuppressive medications. Temperature is 38.4 C (101.1 F), pulse is 120/min, blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg, and respirations are 35/min. Oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. On examination, conjunctivae are clear, mucous membranes are moist, and tympanic membranes are gray. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs have coarse crackles bilaterally. Abdomen is soft and nontender. Diffuse papules and vesicles containing clear fluid are present. Chest x-ray {{exhibit_1}} shows bilateral infiltrates.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's acute cough with bilateral infiltrates is consistent with viral pneumonia; in the setting of a diffuse, pruritic, papulovesicular rash, the most likely underlying cause is primary varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. VZV (human herpesvirus 3) is a highly contagious, double-stranded DNA virus transmitted by respiratory droplets or direct contact with vesicular lesions. The virus can spread 48 hours prior to rash onset, and the typical incubation period is 1-3 weeks. Infection usually occurs in those who are unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated with the live attenuated VZV vaccine (typically administered at age 1 and 4). \n\nIn healthy, young children, varicella is usually a mild, self-limited illness that causes fever and malaise followed by a pruritic rash (typically within 24 hr) consisting of lesions in different stages of progression (eg, papules and vesicles). However, adolescents/adults and immunocompromised individuals are at risk for complications, such as pneumonia (as seen in this patient) and encephalitis. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) Coxsackievirus causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease, which presents with maculopapular and/or vesicular lesions and is uncommonly complicated by pneumonia. In contrast to this patient, the rash is nonpruritic and usually limited to the palms/soles, and oral ulcers would be expected. {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(Choice B) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in immunocompromised patients can cause fever, rash (eg, maculopapular, vesiculobullous), and pneumonitis. However, infection in immunocompetent children is usually asymptomatic, and the patient's cousin with a similar rash makes this diagnosis less likely. Moreover, the rash associated with CMV is typically nonpruritic. {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choice C) Human herpesvirus 6 causes roseola infantum, a self-limited illness that presents with high fever followed by a diffuse maculopapular rash once the fever subsides. In contrast, this patient has concurrent fever and vesicles.\n\n(Choice D) Measles can be complicated by pneumonia but usually presents with conjunctivitis, Koplik spots, and a maculopapular/morbilliform rash. This patient's vesicular rash makes measles unlikely.\n\n(Choice E) Respiratory syncytial virus causes fever and lower respiratory tract infection in children. A rash, if present, would likely be a nonspecific, maculopapular viral exanthem; vesicles would not be expected.\n\nEducational objective:\nPrimary varicella-zoster virus infection is typically a self-limited illness characterized by a pruritic, vesicular rash. However, immunocompromised patients are at risk for complications such as pneumonia (cough, tachypnea, hypoxia, and bilateral lung infiltrates).",
    "zh": "该患者的急性咳嗽伴双侧浸润与病毒性肺炎一致；在出现弥漫性、瘙痒性、丘疹性水疱性皮疹的情况下，最可能的潜在病因是原发性水痘-带状疱疹病毒（VZV）感染。VZV（人类疱疹病毒3型）是一种高度传染性的双链DNA病毒，通过呼吸道飞沫或直接接触水疱病灶传播。该病毒可在皮疹出现前48小时传播，典型潜伏期为1-3周。感染通常发生在未接种或未完全接种减毒活VZV疫苗（通常在1岁和4岁时接种）的人群中。\n\n在健康的幼儿中，水痘通常是一种轻度的自限性疾病，可引起发烧和不适，然后出现瘙痒性皮疹（通常在24小时内），皮疹由不同进展阶段的病灶组成（例如，丘疹和水疱）。然而，青少年/成人和免疫功能低下的人群有发生并发症的风险，例如肺炎（如该患者所示）和脑炎。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n（选项 A）柯萨奇病毒可引起手足口病，其表现为斑丘疹和/或水疱病灶，并且不常见肺炎并发症。与该患者相反，皮疹无瘙痒，通常局限于手掌/足底，并且预计会出现口腔溃疡。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n（选项 B）在免疫功能低下的患者中，巨细胞病毒（CMV）可引起发烧、皮疹（例如，斑丘疹、水疱）和肺炎。然而，在免疫功能正常的儿童中，感染通常无症状，并且该患者的表/堂兄弟有类似的皮疹使得该诊断的可能性降低。此外，CMV相关的皮疹通常无瘙痒。{{exhibit_4}}\n\n（选项 C）人类疱疹病毒6型引起幼儿急疹，这是一种自限性疾病，表现为高烧，然后一旦发烧消退，就会出现弥漫性斑丘疹。相比之下，该患者同时存在发烧和水疱。\n\n（选项 D）麻疹可并发肺炎，但通常表现为结膜炎、柯氏斑和斑丘疹/麻疹样皮疹。该患者的水疱性皮疹使得麻疹不太可能。\n\n（选项 E）呼吸道合胞病毒可引起儿童发烧和下呼吸道感染。如果出现皮疹，则可能是非特异性的斑丘疹病毒疹；预计不会出现水疱。\n\n教育目标：\n原发性水痘-带状疱疹病毒感染通常是一种自限性疾病，其特征是瘙痒性水疱性皮疹。然而，免疫功能低下的患者有发生并发症的风险，例如肺炎（咳嗽、呼吸急促、低氧血症和双侧肺浸润）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox) presentation, especially in immunocompromised individuals, and its potential complications like viral pneumonia. It also requires differentiating varicella from other viral exanthems based on rash characteristics and associated symptoms. \n\nTo solve this question, focus on the patient's immunocompromised status, the presence of a diffuse pruritic papulovesicular rash, and the bilateral lung infiltrates. Consider the typical presentation of varicella and rule out other viral infections based on their distinct clinical features.",
