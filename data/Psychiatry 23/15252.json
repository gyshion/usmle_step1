    "en": "A 27-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her employer due to increasingly paranoid and disorganized behavior over the past year. The patient works as a housekeeper and has had progressive difficulty performing her work responsibilities. She has become increasingly secretive over the past 6 months and recently started talking in a whisper because she believes that listening devices are planted in the walls. Over the past month, she started hiding food and personal possessions in closets and under beds. The patient does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Vital signs are stable, and physical examination is unremarkable. During the interview, she changes topics frequently and rambles about voices harassing her.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's paranoid delusions, disorganized speech and behavior, auditory hallucinations, and 1-year history of functional decline are consistent with schizophrenia. Symptom domains in schizophrenia include positive symptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations, disorganization) and negative symptoms (eg, flat affect, apathy, poverty of speech, social withdrawal). On mental status examination, flat affect is manifested by a lack of facial expression and a monotone voice, typically accompanied by poor eye contact. Negative symptoms are less responsive to antipsychotic medication and typically persist between acute psychotic episodes.\n\nAlthough patients with schizophrenia commonly have cognitive impairments (eg, attention, processing speed, executive functioning), they are typically oriented and do not show a fluctuating level of consciousness that is associated with delirium (Choice C).\n\n(Choices B and E) Euphoric mood and rapid, pressured speech are characteristic findings of an acute manic episode in bipolar disorder. Patients with schizophrenia may have speech that is disorganized (eg, tangential speech, derailment), but it is typically not pressured.\n\n(Choices D and F) Although olfactory and tactile hallucinations can occur in schizophrenia, they are uncommon and more likely to be associated with substance use or neurological disorders. Auditory is the most common type of hallucination in schizophrenia.\n\nEducational objective: In addition to positive psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations, disorganization), patients with schizophrenia frequently exhibit negative symptoms such as flat affect (ie, lack of facial expression). Negative symptoms typically persist between acute psychotic episodes and are more resistant to treatment.",
    "zh": "该患者的偏执妄想、思维和行为紊乱、幻听以及1年的功能下降病史与精神分裂症一致。精神分裂症的症状包括阳性症状（如妄想、幻觉、思维紊乱）和阴性症状（如情感淡漠、冷漠、言语贫乏、社交退缩）。在精神状态检查中，情感淡漠表现为缺乏面部表情和单调的语调，通常伴有眼神交流差。阴性症状对精神病药物的反应较差，并且通常在急性精神病发作之间持续存在。\n\n尽管精神分裂症患者通常有认知障碍（例如，注意力、处理速度、执行功能），但他们通常定向清楚，并且不会表现出与谵妄相关的意识水平波动（选项C）。\n\n（选项B和E）欣快情绪和快速、语速过快的言语是双相情感障碍急性躁狂发作的特征性表现。精神分裂症患者的言语可能混乱（例如，思维散漫、脱轨），但通常不会语速过快。\n\n（选项D和F）虽然嗅觉和触觉幻觉可能发生在精神分裂症中，但它们并不常见，更可能与物质使用或神经系统疾病有关。听觉幻觉是精神分裂症中最常见的幻觉。\n\n教育目标：除了阳性精神病症状（如妄想、幻觉、思维紊乱）外，精神分裂症患者经常表现出阴性症状，如情感淡漠（即，缺乏面部表情）。阴性症状通常在急性精神病发作之间持续存在，并且对治疗的抵抗力更强。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, specifically differentiating between positive and negative symptoms, and recognizing common presentations of the disorder.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the patient's symptoms that align with the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, particularly focusing on the negative symptom domain, and then distinguish these from symptoms characteristic of other psychiatric disorders.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察对精神分裂症诊断标准的理解，特别是区分阳性症状和阴性症状，并识别该疾病的常见表现。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须确定患者的症状与精神分裂症的诊断标准相符，特别是侧重于阴性症状领域，然后将其与其它精神疾病的特征性症状区分开来。"
