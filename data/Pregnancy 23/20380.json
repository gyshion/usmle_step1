    "en": "A 29-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after a syncopal episode while getting out of bed. Yesterday, the patient developed right-sided abdominal pain, which has spread across the lower abdomen over the past few hours. She also noticed a blood stain on her underwear after the syncopal episode. Her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago. The patient uses condoms intermittently for contraception. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, and pulse is 125/min. The patient has diffuse lower abdominal pain with rebound tenderness and voluntary guarding. Pelvic examination shows cervical motion tenderness and right-sided adnexal tenderness; no masses are palpated.",

    "en": "This patient with diffuse abdominal pain, rebound tenderness, and hemodynamic instability (syncope, hypotension, tachycardia) likely has intra-abdominal bleeding (ie, hemoperitoneum). In the setting of a missed menstrual cycle (ie, last menstrual period 8 weeks ago), right adnexal tenderness, and vaginal bleeding, the most likely cause is a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies occur due to implantation in an extrauterine location, most commonly the fallopian tube. Unlike the uterus, which has a thick wall of distensible smooth muscle, the fallopian tube cannot expand as the ectopic pregnancy enlarges. This strain on the tubal wall, in addition to surrounding tissue ischemia (from the redirection of blood flow toward the pregnancy), causes unilateral abdominal pain and tubal rupture. Rupture at this highly vascular site typically results in brisk intra-abdominal bleeding. Because blood is highly irritating to the peritoneum, patients with hemoperitoneum usually develop diffuse abdominal pain with rebound and guarding; low-grade fever (due to inflammation) is also common. Patients with blood accumulation in the posterior cul-de-sac can also have cervical motion tenderness and a strong urge to defecate. Patients with hemodynamic instability (eg, orthostatic hypotension, syncopal episode) require urgent surgical management.\n\n(Choice A) Acute appendicitis can present with right lower abdominal pain that progresses to diffuse pain in cases of appendiceal rupture (ie, peritonitis from spilled intestinal contents). However, this diagnosis is less likely in this patient who also has a missed menstrual cycle and vaginal bleeding.\n\n(Choice B) Ovarian torsion can cause unilateral abdominal pain and adnexal tenderness; patients with prolonged torsion may develop rebound and guarding due to ovarian necrosis. However, the pain is typically sudden onset (ie, acute occlusion of ovarian blood flow) and vaginal bleeding is uncommon. An adnexal mass (not present in this patient) may be palpable.\n\n(Choices C and E) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) typically presents with abdominal pain and cervical motion tenderness due to infection and inflammation of the upper genital tract. Tuboovarian abscess (TOA) is a severe form of PID that has localized to the adnexa. Unlike this patient, those with PID or TOA are typically febrile with malodorous cervical discharge.",
    "zh": "这位患者出现弥漫性腹痛、反跳痛和血流动力学不稳定（晕厥、低血压、心动过速），很可能存在腹腔内出血（即，腹膜腔积血）。在停经（即，上次月经8周前）、右侧附件压痛和阴道出血的情况下，最可能的原因是异位妊娠破裂。异位妊娠是由于在子宫外位置着床引起的，最常见于输卵管。与具有厚壁的可扩张平滑肌的子宫不同，输卵管不能随着异位妊娠的增大而扩张。这种对输卵管壁的压力，以及周围组织缺血（由于血流转移到妊娠部位），会导致单侧腹痛和输卵管破裂。在这种高度血管化的部位破裂通常会导致剧烈的腹腔内出血。由于血液对腹膜有高度刺激性，腹膜腔积血患者通常会出现弥漫性腹痛伴反跳痛和防御；轻度发烧（由于炎症）也很常见。后穹窿积血的患者也可能出现宫颈举痛和强烈的排便欲望。血流动力学不稳定的患者（例如，体位性低血压、晕厥发作）需要紧急手术治疗。\n\n（选项A）急性阑尾炎可表现为右下腹痛，在阑尾破裂（即，肠内容物溢出引起的腹膜炎）的情况下，疼痛会进展为弥漫性疼痛。然而，对于这位也有停经和阴道出血的患者，这种诊断的可能性较小。\n\n（选项B）卵巢扭转可引起单侧腹痛和附件压痛；长时间扭转的患者可能会因卵巢坏死而出现反跳痛和防御。然而，疼痛通常是突然发生的（即，卵巢血流的急性阻塞），并且阴道出血不常见。附件肿块（该患者未出现）可能可触及。\n\n（选项C和E）盆腔炎（PID）通常表现为腹痛和宫颈举痛，这与上生殖道的感染和炎症有关。输卵管卵巢脓肿（TOA）是PID的严重形式，已局限于附件。与该患者不同，PID或TOA患者通常会发烧，并伴有恶臭的宫颈分泌物。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the presentation and differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in a woman of reproductive age, specifically focusing on conditions that can cause intra-abdominal bleeding and hemodynamic instability.\n\nTo solve this question, one must integrate the patient's symptoms (syncope, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding), vital signs (hypotension, tachycardia), physical exam findings (rebound tenderness, guarding, cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness), and menstrual history (missed period) to arrive at the most likely diagnosis among the given options, considering the possibility of intra-abdominal hemorrhage.",
