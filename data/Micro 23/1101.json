    "en": "A 65-year-old man comes to the emergency department with a sore on his right hand. The lesion began as a small, painless papule 3 days ago and rapidly enlarged and ulcerated. The patient has had no injury or insect bite, has no prior medical conditions, and takes no medications. He is in the wool business and recently returned from a tour of wool-processing plants in several Asian countries. Physical examination shows a necrotic ulcer with a black eschar on the dorsum of the right hand. There is extensive edema of surrounding tissues. The toxin causing edema around this patient's ulcer has a mechanism of action most similar to a different toxin produced by which of the following bacteria?",

    "en": "Bacillus anthracis edema factor is an adenylate cyclase that increases intracellular cyclic AMP, leading to neutrophil and macrophage dysfunction and tissue edema. This mechanism of action is similar to that of adenylate cyclase toxin, produced by Bordetella pertussis.\n\n(Choices B and C) Both Clostridium botulinum and C. difficile are sporulating bacteria whose vegetative forms generate exotoxins. However, the exotoxins produced by these bacteria operate by different mechanisms than edema factor or lethal factor. Botulinum toxin is an endopeptidase that blocks neuromuscular cholinergic transmission; toxins A and B (generated by C. difficile) inactivate Rho family proteins, leading to a derangement of cytoskeletal structure and guanosine triphosphate signal transduction.\n\n(Choice D) Shigella dysenteriae invades colonic mucosal cells and produces Shiga toxin, an exotoxin that cleaves a peptide off the 60S ribosomal subunit and causes irreversible inhibition of protein synthesis.\n\n(Choice E) Streptococcus pyogenes strains that have been exposed to a specific lysogenic bacteriophage produce pyrogenic exotoxins, which cause scarlet fever and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. These exotoxins are proteases that degrade host cell proteins or nonspecifically activate T cells (superantigens).\n\nEducational objective:\nBacillus anthracis edema factor is an adenylate cyclase that increases intracellular cyclic AMP, leading to neutrophil and macrophage dysfunction and tissue edema. This mechanism of action is similar to that of adenylate cyclase toxin, produced by Bordetella pertussis.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of bacterial toxins, specifically the mechanism of action of Bacillus anthracis edema factor and its similarity to the adenylate cyclase toxin produced by Bordetella pertussis. It requires understanding of how these toxins affect cellular function and cause edema.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the key finding of edema and recalling the mechanism of action of Bacillus anthracis edema factor. Then, one must identify which of the other bacterial toxins listed shares a similar mechanism, specifically the adenylate cyclase activity.",
