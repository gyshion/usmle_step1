    "en": "A 16-year-old girl comes to the office for a pre-participatory school sports examination. She plays on her high school soccer team and also frequently competes in local beauty pageants. The patient follows strict dietary limitations and exercises strenuously 2 hours a day. Onset of menses was at age 13, but her last menstrual period was 8 months ago. She otherwise feels well. Her height is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) and her weight is 45.3 kg (100 lb), with a BMI of 16.6 kg/m². Physical examination shows a pale and thin girl with fine hair around her trunk, but the remainder is otherwise normal. Urine pregnancy test is negative.",

    "en": "Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea {{exhibit_1}}\n\nAmenorrhea can be categorized as primary (failure of menarche prior to age 15) or secondary (cessation of menstruation in premenopausal women who previously have had menses). Secondary amenorrhea can be due to hypothalamic, pituitary, ovarian, uterine, or other endocrine (eg, thyroid) disorders.\n\nThis patient has secondary amenorrhea associated with low body weight, frequent strenuous exercise, and lanugo (fine hair indicating inadequate caloric intake), suggesting functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). FHA is commonly seen in competitive athletes, dancers, fashion models, and others who maintain very low body weights. The underlying pathophysiology of FHA is incompletely understood but appears to involve reduced circulating leptin levels as a result of diminished adipose tissue stores. The decrease in leptin levels inhibits pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release from the hypothalamus, causing decreased pituitary LH and FSH secretion, low circulating estrogen levels, and amenorrhea.\n\n(Choice A) Like FHA, hyperprolactinemia can cause secondary amenorrhea by suppressing normal GnRH release in the hypothalamus. Affected women may also develop galactorrhea. However, this patient's low body weight, caloric restriction, and strenuous exercise regimen are more consistent with FHA.\n\n(Choice B) Hyperthyroidism can cause irregular menses or amenorrhea, along with weight loss. However, this patient has no other features to suggest a thyroid disorder (eg, goiter, temperature intolerance, diarrhea, hair loss).\n\n(Choices D and E) The amenorrhea in patients with FHA stems from a deficiency in hypothalamic GnRH release, rather than a problem with the pituitary or ovaries; this patient has no other features of hypopituitarism.\n\nEducational objective:\nFunctional hypothalamic amenorrhea results from loss of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone release from the hypothalamus and is caused by weight loss, strenuous exercise, systemic illness, or abnormal eating habits. Loss of cyclic gonadotropin release leads to a decrease in LH and FSH secretion from the pituitary, which in turn causes low circulating estrogen levels.",
    "zh": "功能性下丘脑性闭经 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n闭经可分为原发性（15岁之前未初潮）或继发性（既往有月经的绝经前妇女月经停止）。继发性闭经可由下丘脑、垂体、卵巢、子宫或其他内分泌（如甲状腺）疾病引起。\n\n该患者有继发性闭经，伴有低体重、频繁剧烈运动和毳毛（细毛，表明摄入热量不足），提示功能性下丘脑性闭经（FHA）。FHA常见于竞技运动员、舞蹈演员、模特等保持非常低体重的人群。FHA的潜在病理生理学尚未完全了解，但似乎涉及由于脂肪组织储存减少而导致的循环瘦素水平降低。瘦素水平的降低抑制了下丘脑脉冲性促性腺激素释放激素 (GnRH) 的释放，导致垂体 LH 和 FSH 分泌减少，循环雌激素水平低，并导致闭经。\n\n(选项 A) 与FHA一样，高泌乳素血症也可通过抑制下丘脑中正常的 GnRH 释放引起继发性闭经。受影响的女性也可能出现溢乳。然而，该患者的低体重、热量限制和剧烈运动方案与FHA更一致。\n\n(选项 B) 甲状腺功能亢进可引起月经不规律或闭经，以及体重减轻。然而，该患者没有其他提示甲状腺疾病的特征（例如，甲状腺肿、对温度不耐受、腹泻、脱发）。\n\n(选项 D 和 E) FHA患者的闭经源于下丘脑 GnRH 释放不足，而不是垂体或卵巢的问题；该患者没有其他垂体功能减退症的特征。\n\n教育目标：\n功能性下丘脑性闭经是由于下丘脑脉冲性促性腺激素释放激素释放的丧失引起的，其病因是体重减轻、剧烈运动、全身性疾病或异常的饮食习惯。周期性促性腺激素释放的丧失导致垂体 LH 和 FSH 分泌减少，进而导致循环雌激素水平降低。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of secondary amenorrhea, specifically functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA), its causes, and underlying pathophysiology related to leptin and GnRH. It also tests the ability to differentiate FHA from other causes of amenorrhea based on clinical presentation.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the risk factors for FHA (low body weight, strenuous exercise, dietary restriction) and understand the hormonal mechanisms involved. Rule out other causes of amenorrhea by considering the absence of specific signs and symptoms associated with those conditions.",
    "zh": "此问题测试对继发性闭经的知识，特别是功能性下丘脑性闭经（FHA），其病因以及与瘦素和 GnRH 相关的潜在病理生理学。它还测试了根据临床表现将 FHA 与闭经的其他原因区分开来的能力。\n\n最佳方法是识别 FHA 的风险因素（低体重、剧烈运动、饮食限制）并了解所涉及的激素机制。通过考虑与这些情况相关的特定体征和症状的缺失来排除闭经的其他原因。"
