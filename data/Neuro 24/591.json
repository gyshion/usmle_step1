  "explanation": {
    "en": "Alzheimer disease has a strong genetic predisposition. About 30% of patients have a family history of the disease. According to age when symptoms begin, Alzheimer disease can be classified as early or late. The following three mutation sites have been associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer disease (onset <60 years old):\n\n1.  Amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21\n2.  Presenilin 1 gene on chromosome 14\n3.  Presenilin 2 gene on chromosome 1\n\nBoth APP and presenilin gene mutations are thought to promote the production of A β-amyloid.\n\nLate-onset familial Alzheimer disease is associated with the ε4 allele of Apolipoprotein E. The exact mechanism of its influence is not known. It is thought that the ApoE4 protein may be involved in the formation of senile plaques.\n\n(Choice A) Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder. It is associated with a defect in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. This defect leads to decreased hepatic LDL uptake and severe elevation in total cholesterol and LDL levels.\n\n(Choice B) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a familial disorder inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The most common mutation is of the β-myosin heavy chain.\n\n(Choice C) Genetic factors play an important role in diabetes mellitus type 2 (more important than in type 1). Genetic predisposition to increased insulin resistance and deranged insulin secretion by β-cells are important precursors to disease.\n\n(Choice D) Peptic ulcer disease is strongly associated with *H. pylori* infection, but not ApoE4.\n\n(Choice E) Polycystic kidney disease can be inherited as autosomal recessive (also called infantile form) or dominant trait (adult form). Neither of these conditions is associated with ApoE4.\n\nEducational Objective:\n\nEarly-onset familial Alzheimer disease is associated with three gene mutations: APP (chromosome 21), presenilin 1 and presenilin 2. Late-onset familial Alzheimer disease is associated with apolipoprotein E4 genotype.",
    "zh": "阿尔茨海默病具有很强的遗传易感性。大约30%的患者有家族史。根据症状开始的年龄，阿尔茨海默病可分为早发型或晚发型。以下三个突变位点与早发型家族性阿尔茨海默病（发病年龄<60岁）相关：\n\n1.  位于21号染色体上的淀粉样前体蛋白 (APP) 基因\n2.  位于14号染色体上的早老素1基因\n3.  位于1号染色体上的早老素2基因\n\nAPP和早老素基因突变都被认为会促进Aβ-淀粉样蛋白的产生。\n\n晚发型家族性阿尔茨海默病与载脂蛋白E的ε4等位基因相关。其影响的确切机制尚不清楚。有人认为，ApoE4蛋白可能参与老年斑的形成。\n\n(选项A) 家族性高胆固醇血症是一种常染色体显性遗传病。它与低密度脂蛋白 (LDL) 受体的缺陷有关。这种缺陷导致肝脏对LDL的摄取减少，并导致总胆固醇和LDL水平严重升高。\n\n(选项B) 肥厚型心肌病是一种家族性疾病，以常染色体显性遗传方式遗传。最常见的突变是β-肌球蛋白重链的突变。\n\n(选项C) 遗传因素在2型糖尿病中起重要作用（比1型更重要）。对胰岛素抵抗增加和β细胞胰岛素分泌异常的遗传易感性是该疾病的重要先兆。\n\n(选项D) 消化性溃疡病与幽门螺杆菌感染密切相关，但与ApoE4无关。\n\n(选项E) 多囊肾病可作为常染色体隐性遗传（也称为婴儿型）或显性遗传（成人型）性状遗传。这些情况均与ApoE4无关。\n\n教育目标：\n\n早发型家族性阿尔茨海默病与三个基因突变相关：APP (21号染色体)、早老素1和早老素2。晚发型家族性阿尔茨海默病与载脂蛋白E4基因型相关。"
