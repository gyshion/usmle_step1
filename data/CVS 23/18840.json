    "en": "A 56-year-old man comes to the hospital due to 24 hours of burning substernal chest pain. The most intense pain occurred approximately 6 hours ago, and it has started to subside. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus. ECG shows sinus rhythm with ST-segment elevation in leads V3 to V5. In the cardiac catheterization laboratory, he is found to have total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. Successful intervention is performed to restore blood flow in the artery. The next day, the patient's echocardiogram shows a normal-sized left ventricle with no evidence of hypertrophy; there is apical and anterior akinesia with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 38%. Which of the following is the most likely long-term effect of ACE inhibitor therapy in this patient?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (<45%) due to acute MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION; echocardiography shows akinesia of the anterior and apical segments, findings consistent with infarction in those locations. In the months following infarction, the affected myocardium undergoes fibroblastic proliferation and fibrosis to repair the necrotic region (ie, initial remodeling phase); disproportionate thinning of the infarcted area can lead to ballooning of affected segments and marked LV cavity enlargement. Although LV cavity enlargement is initially beneficial as it acts as a compensatory mechanism for LV volume overload, progressive cavity enlargement (eg, eccentric hypertrophy) leads to overwhelming wall stress and further worsening of LV contractile dysfunction. With progressive dilation, the LV begins to assume a spherical, rather than its normal elliptical, shape. Much of the deleterious remodeling that occurs following myocardial infarction is likely driven by neurohormonal signaling via angiotensin II. Accordingly, ACE inhibitors (eg, lisinopril) reduce the deleterious remodeling that takes place following myocardial infarction, minimizing LV dilation and helping preserve LV function. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices B and C) Angiotensin II enhances post-myocardial infarction collagen deposition to contribute to deleterious cardiac remodeling. This effect is especially prominent in peri-infarct cardiomyocytes (cardiomyocytes at the edge of an infarction), which have high angiotensin II levels. ACE inhibitors reduce deleterious cardiac remodeling at least in part via inhibition of myocardial collagen deposition and fibrosis.\n\n(Choice D) Noninfarcted cardiac segments (eg, the basal segments in this patient) are subject to postinfarction remodeling caused by LV hemodynamic influences (eg, pressure and volume changes). ACE inhibitors also reduce remodeling of these segments, further contributing to maintenance of the normal LV elliptical shape and preservation of LV contractile function.\n\n(Choice E) Stroke work is the work done by the left ventricle with each contraction and is estimated by the product of stroke volume and LV systolic pressure (ie, stroke volume × LV systolic pressure). ACE inhibitors reduce stroke work by causing peripheral vasodilation and reducing systemic blood pressure (ie, reducing the pressure the left ventricle must overcome during each contraction).",
    "zh": "该患者由于急性心肌梗死，左心室（LV）射血分数降低（<45%）；超声心动图显示前壁和心尖段失运动，这些发现与这些部位的梗死相符。在梗死后的几个月内，受影响的心肌会经历成纤维细胞增殖和纤维化，以修复坏死区域（即，初始重塑阶段）；梗死区域的不成比例的变薄可导致受影响段膨胀和明显的左心室腔扩大。尽管左心室腔扩大最初是有益的，因为它充当了左心室容量超负荷的代偿机制，但进行性腔扩大（例如，向心性肥大）会导致压倒性的壁应力并进一步恶化左心室收缩功能障碍。随着进行性扩张，左心室开始呈现球形，而不是其正常的椭圆形。心肌梗死后发生的大部分有害重塑可能由血管紧张素II介导的神经激素信号传导驱动。因此，ACE抑制剂（例如，赖诺普利）可减少心肌梗死后发生的有害重塑，从而最大限度地减少左心室扩张并帮助维持左心室功能。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项B和C）血管紧张素II增强心肌梗死后的胶原沉积，从而导致有害的心脏重塑。这种作用在梗死周围心肌细胞（梗死边缘的心肌细胞）中尤为突出，这些心肌细胞具有高水平的血管紧张素II。ACE抑制剂至少部分通过抑制心肌胶原沉积和纤维化来减少有害的心脏重塑。\n\n（选项D）非梗死性心脏节段（例如，该患者的基底部节段）受到左心室血流动力学影响（例如，压力和容量变化）引起的梗死后重塑。ACE抑制剂还可减少这些节段的重塑，从而进一步有助于维持正常的左心室椭圆形形状并保持左心室收缩功能。\n\n（选项E）每搏功是左心室每次收缩所做的工作，通过每搏输出量和左心室收缩压的乘积来估计（即，每搏输出量×左心室收缩压）。ACE抑制剂通过引起周围血管舒张和降低全身血压（即，降低左心室在每次收缩期间必须克服的压力）来减少每搏功。"
