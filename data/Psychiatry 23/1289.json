The boy has recently been hanging out with a new group of friends that he describes as \"really cool.\" He has also stopped attending family events and appears apathetic about his schoolwork. When asked in private, the boy admits smoking marijuana.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Marijuana (cannabis) is one of the most commonly used drugs in the United States. It is a cannabinoid that contains the active ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Smoking is the preferred route of delivery, and once inhaled, marijuana produces effects that last from 1-4 hours. THC stimulates cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2 receptors) to produce effects on mood, perception, and cognition.\n\nMarijuana produces a mild euphoria with inappropriate laughter, sedation, slowed reflexes, impaired motor coordination, distorted sensory perceptions, and cognitive impairment (decreased attention, concentration, short-term memory, and judgment). The most characteristic physiologic signs of marijuana intoxication are CONJUNCTIVAL INJECTION (red eyes), TACHYCARDIA, INCREASED APPETITE, and DRY MOUTH.\n\nMarijuana is metabolized in the liver, distributed and stored in lipophilic tissues, and slowly released. It remains in the body for a long time; depending on the amount and frequency of use, it can be detected in the urine up to 30 days after daily use has ceased.\n\n(Choices A and F) Cannabis intoxication results in tachycardia and does not cause respiratory depression. Bradycardia can occur with GHB (gamma hydroxybutyric acid), opiate, or benzodiazepine intoxication. In toxic doses, all three central nervous system depressants can cause respiratory depression.\n\n(Choice C) Miosis (constricted, pinpoint pupils) is commonly seen in opiate intoxication.\n\n(Choice D) Mydriasis (dilated pupils) occurs in cocaine intoxication and opiate withdrawal.\n\n(Choice E) Nystagmus is a rhythmic, regular oscillation of the eyes and is commonly seen with phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication.\n\nEducational objective:\nMarijuana contains tetrahydrocannabinol, which stimulates cannabinoid receptors to produce a mild euphoria with inappropriate laughter, increased appetite, slowed reaction time/motor speed, and cognitive impairment. Tachycardia and conjunctival injection are the 2 most immediate physical symptoms of marijuana use.",
    "zh": "大麻（cannabis）是美国最常用的药物之一。它是一种大麻素，含有活性成分四氢大麻酚（THC）。吸烟是首选的给药途径，一旦吸入，大麻会产生持续1-4小时的效应。THC刺激大麻素受体（CB1和CB2受体），对情绪、感知和认知产生影响。\n\n大麻会产生轻微的欣快感，伴有不合时宜的笑声、镇静、反射迟缓、运动协调受损、感觉扭曲和认知障碍（注意力、集中力、短期记忆和判断力下降）。大麻中毒最典型的生理体征是结膜充血（红眼）、心动过速、食欲增加和口干。\n\n大麻在肝脏中代谢，分布并储存在亲脂性组织中，并缓慢释放。它在体内停留很长时间；根据使用量和频率，在停止每日使用后，可以在尿液中检测到长达30天。\n\n（选项A和F）大麻中毒会导致心动过速，但不会引起呼吸抑制。心动过缓可发生在GHB（γ-羟基丁酸）、阿片类药物或苯二氮卓类药物中毒时。在高剂量下，所有三种中枢神经系统抑制剂都可引起呼吸抑制。\n\n（选项C）缩瞳（瞳孔收缩，针尖状）常见于阿片类药物中毒。\n\n（选项D）散瞳（瞳孔扩大）发生在可卡因中毒和阿片类药物戒断时。\n\n（选项E）眼球震颤是眼睛有节奏的、有规律的振荡，常见于苯环利定（PCP）中毒。\n\n教育目标：\n大麻含有四氢大麻酚，它刺激大麻素受体，产生轻微的欣快感，伴有不合时宜的笑声、食欲增加、反应时间/运动速度减慢和认知障碍。心动过速和结膜充血是大麻使用的两个最直接的身体症状。"
