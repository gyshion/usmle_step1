    "en": "The prevalence of severe aortic stenosis (AS) increases with age, and definitive management necessitates surgical correction of the stenotic valve. This often creates a complicated scenario because many elderly patients with severe AS have multiple other comorbidities, making them poor candidates for open surgical valve replacement due to unacceptably high operative risk. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) provides an alternative option for such patients; the catheter is advanced through the aorta to the aortic valve where a bioprosthetic valve is placed over the native aortic valve leaflets.\n\nThis patient's intraoperative pressure readings of decreased diastolic blood pressure and increased LVEDP (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure) are consistent with aortic regurgitation, a common complication of TAVI that results from improper sealing of the prosthetic valve to the native valve annulus, leading to paravalvular leak (blood leakage around the valve). Inappropriate valve size or improper valve positioning is often responsible.\n\nOther intraoperative complications of TAVI include stroke (due to embolization of native valve calcification) and myocardial infarction (due to obstruction of coronary artery ostia by the implanted valve).\n\n(Choice B) Worsening mitral stenosis can rarely occur following TAVI; such a disruption is expected to cause a decrease (rather than increase) in LVEDP due to obstructed diastolic filling.\n\n(Choice C) Prosthetic valve thrombosis usually causes valvular obstruction but may sometimes cause valvular regurgitation with similar pressure findings to this patient. However, valvular thrombus requires time to develop and is not typically an immediate intraoperative complication.\n\n(Choice D) Retroperitoneal bleeding can result from extension of a femoral artery hematoma and is a potential complication of any catheter-based procedure with femoral arterial access. The complication is likely to cause hemorrhagic shock with a drop in both systemic blood pressure and LVEDP.\n\n(Choice E) Ventricular septal perforation is a potential complication of TAVI but is unlikely to cause the large and abrupt increase in LVEDP that occurred in this patient. Large perforation may eventually lead to biventricular failure and increased LVEDP, but no change or a small decrease in LVEDP is expected initially.\n\nEducational objective:\nTranscatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) allows for minimally invasive management of severe aortic stenosis in elderly patients who are unable to tolerate open surgical valve replacement. Paravalvular aortic regurgitation is a common complication of TAVI, resulting from improper sealing of the prosthetic valve to the native valve annulus. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "严重主动脉瓣狭窄 (AS) 的患病率随年龄增长而增加，明确的治疗方案需要手术矫正狭窄的瓣膜。这通常会造成复杂的情况，因为许多患有严重 AS 的老年患者有多种其他合并症，由于手术风险过高，他们不适合接受开放式瓣膜置换术。经导管主动脉瓣植入术 (TAVI) 为此类患者提供了另一种选择；导管通过主动脉进入主动脉瓣，在那里将生物瓣膜放置在原主动脉瓣叶上。\n\n该患者的术中压力读数显示舒张压降低和 LVEDP（左心室舒张末期压力）升高，与主动脉瓣关闭不全一致，这是 TAVI 的常见并发症，由假体瓣膜与原生瓣环密封不严导致，导致瓣周渗漏（瓣膜周围的血液渗漏）。瓣膜尺寸不合适或瓣膜位置不当通常是原因。\n\nTAVI 的其他术中并发症包括卒中（由于原生瓣膜钙化栓塞）和心肌梗死（由于植入瓣膜阻塞冠状动脉口）。\n\n(选项 B) TAVI 后很少发生二尖瓣狭窄加重；这种破坏预计会导致 LVEDP 降低（而不是升高），因为舒张期充盈受阻。\n\n(选项 C) 瓣膜血栓形成通常会导致瓣膜阻塞，但有时也可能导致瓣膜关闭不全，其压力表现与该患者相似。然而，瓣膜血栓需要时间才能形成，通常不是即时发生的术中并发症。\n\n(选项 D) 腹膜后出血可能由股动脉血肿延伸引起，是任何以股动脉入路的导管介入手术的潜在并发症。该并发症可能导致出血性休克，并导致全身血压和 LVEDP 下降。\n\n(选项 E) 室间隔穿孔是 TAVI 的一种潜在并发症，但不太可能导致该患者发生 LVEDP 的大幅度和突然升高。大型穿孔最终可能导致双心室衰竭和 LVEDP 升高，但最初预计 LVEDP 无变化或略有下降。\n\n教育目标：\n经导管主动脉瓣植入术 (TAVI) 允许对无法耐受开放式手术瓣膜置换术的高龄患者进行微创治疗，以治疗严重的主动脉瓣狭窄。瓣周主动脉瓣关闭不全是 TAVI 的常见并发症，由假体瓣膜与原生瓣环密封不严导致。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of complications following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), specifically aortic regurgitation due to paravalvular leak. It requires understanding of hemodynamic changes associated with this complication.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the significance of decreased diastolic blood pressure and increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in the immediate post-TAVI period. This pattern is highly suggestive of aortic regurgitation due to improper valve sealing.",
