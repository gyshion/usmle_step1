    "en": "A 45-year-old man comes to the office due to progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough for the past several weeks. He has had no fever, chills, chest pain, or leg swelling. The patient is a former smoker with 5-pack-year history. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, pulse is 82/min, and respirations are 16/min. The patient is hypoxemic at rest, with an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Jugular venous pressure is normal. Lung auscultation shows scattered crackles. Heart sounds are normal. Chest x-ray reveals bilateral midalveolar and lower alveolar opacities. Transbronchial lung biopsy reveals lipoproteinaceous material that is positive on periodic acid–Schiff stain and fills up the terminal bronchioles and alveoli. Electron microscopy of the substance shows lamellar bodies. Impaired function of which of the following most likely caused excessive accumulation of the substance in this patient's alveoli?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's presentation is consistent with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), a rare condition characterized by progressive respiratory dysfunction due to the accumulation of surfactant debris within alveolar spaces. Surfactant is a lipoproteinaceous material that appears pink with periodic acid–Schiff staining; it forms concentrically laminated structures (ie, lamellar bodies) that can be seen on electron microscopy.\n\nPAP is caused by an imbalance between surfactant production and clearance. In healthy lungs, surfactant is secreted by type 2 pneumocytes and eventually cleared by alveolar macrophages. In PAP, surfactant removal is impaired due to compromised alveolar macrophage function (eg, usually because of defects in granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF] signaling).\n\nTreatment involves therapeutic whole-lung lavage to wash away surfactant and inhaled GM-CSF replacement therapy.\n\n(Choice B) Ciliated epithelial cells line the conducting airways and are responsible for mucociliary escalator function, a key process in airway clearance. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (eg, Kartagener syndrome) is characterized by impaired ciliary function and leads to mucostasis, recurrent pneumonia, and bronchiectasis.\n\n(Choice C) Club cells (bronchiolar cells) are located at the bronchoalveolar alveolar junction and protect and repair the distal airway (terminal bronchioles). Club cell dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD.\n\n(Choice D) Fibroblasts produce and maintain the connective tissue matrix of the lung, lending structural support and elasticity. Loss of fibroblast function contributes to degenerative airspace dilation in emphysema.\n\n(Choice E) Type 1 pneumocytes form the alveolar gas-exchanging surface. Rapid destruction and loss of type 1 pneumocytes occurs in early acute lung injury. It does not result in the abnormal accumulation of surfactant products.\n\nEducational objective:\nPulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a rare condition characterized by progressive respiratory dysfunction due to the accumulation of surfactant (periodic acid–Schiff positive material forming lamellar bodies) within the alveolar spaces. The condition occurs most often due to the impaired clearance of surfactant by alveolar macrophages (eg, decreased granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling).",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现与肺泡蛋白沉积症（PAP）一致，这是一种罕见病，其特征是由于肺泡腔内表面活性物质碎片的积累而导致进行性呼吸功能障碍。表面活性物质是一种脂蛋白样物质，用周期性酸-希夫染色呈现粉红色；它形成同心层状结构（即，层状小体），可在电子显微镜下观察到。\n\nPAP是由表面活性物质产生和清除之间的不平衡引起的。在健康的肺中，表面活性物质由II型肺细胞分泌，最终由肺泡巨噬细胞清除。在PAP中，由于肺泡巨噬细胞功能受损（例如，通常由于粒细胞-单核细胞集落刺激因子 [GM-CSF] 信号传导的缺陷），表面活性物质的清除受到损害。\n\n治疗包括治疗性全肺灌洗以洗掉表面活性物质和吸入GM-CSF替代疗法。\n\n（选项B）纤毛上皮细胞覆盖传导气道，负责纤毛运动功能，这是气道清除的关键过程。原发性纤毛运动障碍（例如，Kartagener综合征）的特征是纤毛功能受损，导致粘液停滞、反复性肺炎和支气管扩张。\n\n（选项C）Clara细胞（细支气管细胞）位于细支气管肺泡交界处，保护和修复远端气道（终末细支气管）。Clara细胞功能障碍与COPD的发病机制有关。\n\n（选项D）成纤维细胞产生并维持肺的结缔组织基质，提供结构支持和弹性。成纤维细胞功能的丧失导致肺气肿的退行性气腔扩张。\n\n（选项E）I型肺细胞形成肺泡气体交换表面。在早期急性肺损伤中，I型肺细胞迅速破坏和丧失。它不会导致表面活性物质产物的异常积累。\n\n教学目标：\n肺泡蛋白沉积症是一种罕见病，其特征是由于肺泡腔内表面活性物质（形成层状小体的周期性酸-希夫染色阳性物质）的积累而导致进行性呼吸功能障碍。这种情况最常由于肺泡巨噬细胞清除表面活性物质受损而发生（例如，粒细胞-单核细胞集落刺激因子信号传导减少）。"
