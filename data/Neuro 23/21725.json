    "en": "A 68-year-old woman comes to the emergency department for evaluation of stroke-like symptoms. The patient says her face appeared \"twisted\" this morning but was normal when she went to bed last night. Her brother recently had a stroke, and she was worried that she may also be having a stroke. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows facial asymmetry with drooping of the left corner of the mouth and loss of the left nasolabial fold. Which of the following additional examination findings on the affected side would be most suggestive of central nervous system involvement?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Voluntary facial movement is initiated by the motor cortex (located in the frontal lobe), which delivers input to the facial nerve (CN VII), a peripheral nerve that innervates the muscles of facial expression. Central or peripheral lesions can often be distinguished by assessing movement in the upper face.\n\n*   Central nervous system lesions (eg, stroke) typically affect the motor cortex or the descending tracts; this results in contralateral lower face weakness. However, the nuclei that innervate the upper face receive bilateral input from the motor cortices, so movement of the upper facial muscles (eg, forehead, brow) is often spared.\n*   Peripheral nerve lesions (eg, Bell palsy) affect the entire facial nerve. This results in unilateral weakness of half of the face; forehead movement is lost.\n\nThe most common cause of acute unilateral upper and lower facial weakness is Bell palsy, an acute peripheral neuropathy of CN VII. Common findings include an inability to raise the eyebrow or close the eye, drooping of the mouth corner (with the mouth drawn to the unaffected side), and disappearance of the nasolabial fold. For most patients, partial or complete recovery occurs within 3-4 months.\n\n(Choices A, C, and D) Patients with facial nerve lesions often have decreased tear production (due to loss of parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal gland), hyperacusis (due to weakness of the stapedius muscle), and decreased sensation of taste over the ipsilateral anterior two-thirds of the tongue (which is innervated by the chorda tympani nerve, a branch of the facial nerve).\n\n(Choice B) The platysma muscle, responsible for tensing the skin on the neck, is also innervated by the facial nerve. It would be affected in both central and peripheral lesions.\n\nEducational objective:\nBecause the upper face receives bilateral input from the motor cortices, central nervous system lesions typically cause lower facial weakness that spares the forehead on one side of the face. In contrast, peripheral lesions (eg, Bell palsy) cause weakness of the entire side of the face. Bell palsy may also result in decreased tear production, hyperacusis, and reduced taste sensation. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "随意面部运动由运动皮层（位于额叶）启动，运动皮层将信息传递给面神经（脑神经VII），面神经是支配面部表情肌的周围神经。通过评估上面部运动，通常可以区分中枢性或周围性病变。\n\n*   中枢神经系统病变（例如，卒中）通常影响运动皮层或下行束；这导致对侧下面部无力。然而，支配上面部的核团接收来自运动皮层的双侧输入，因此上面部肌肉（例如，额头、眉毛）的运动通常不受影响。\n*   周围神经病变（例如，贝尔麻痹）影响整个面神经。这导致半侧面部单侧无力；额部运动丧失。\n\n急性单侧上面部和下面部无力最常见的原因是贝尔麻痹，是脑神经VII的急性周围神经病变。常见发现包括无法抬眉或闭眼，嘴角下垂（嘴角向未受累侧倾斜）以及鼻唇沟消失。对于大多数患者，部分或完全恢复发生在3-4个月内。\n\n（选项A、C和D）面神经病变的患者通常有泪液分泌减少（由于支配泪腺的副交感神经支配丧失）、听觉过敏（由于镫骨肌无力）以及同侧舌前三分之二的味觉减退（由鼓索神经支配，鼓索神经是面神经的分支）。\n\n（选项B）负责绷紧颈部皮肤的颈阔肌也由面神经支配。在中枢性和周围性病变中都会受到影响。\n\n教育目标：\n由于上面部接收来自运动皮层的双侧输入，中枢神经系统病变通常会导致下面部无力，并保留面部一侧的额部。相反，周围病变（例如，贝尔麻痹）会导致整个面部侧面无力。贝尔麻痹也可能导致泪液分泌减少、听觉过敏和味觉减退。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to differentiate between central and peripheral causes of facial nerve palsy based on clinical findings. Specifically, it focuses on the concept of bilateral cortical innervation of the upper face and how this affects forehead muscle sparing in central lesions.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that central lesions (e.g., stroke) typically spare the forehead due to bilateral cortical input, while peripheral lesions (e.g., Bell palsy) affect the entire side of the face, including the forehead. Therefore, sparing of the forehead muscles suggests a central lesion.",
    "zh": "本题考察根据临床表现区分面神经麻痹的中枢性和周围性病因的能力。具体而言，它侧重于上面部双侧皮质支配的概念，以及这如何影响中枢性病变中额肌的保留。\n\n要解决这个问题，请记住，由于双侧皮质输入，中枢性病变（例如，卒中）通常会保留额部，而周围性病变（例如，贝尔麻痹）会影响整个面部侧面，包括额部。因此，额肌的保留提示中枢性病变。"
