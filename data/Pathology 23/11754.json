    "en": "A 68-year-old man comes to the office due to persistent back pain for the past several months. He is a retired veteran and has not seen a doctor for many years. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 36 years. His blood pressure is 145/85 mm Hg and pulse is 88/min and regular. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There is focal tenderness over the 10th rib and L1-L2 vertebral region. Neurologic examination is normal. Radionuclide bone imaging revealed increased activity in multiple vertebrae and ribs, corresponding to the patient's painful areas. Routine radiographs show sclerotic lesions matching the bone scan areas of increased uptake, which are highly suspicious for metastatic cancer. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be seen in this patient?",
    "zh": "一名68岁男性因过去几个月持续性背痛就诊。他是一名退伍老兵，多年未就医。他每天吸一包香烟，持续36年。他的血压为145/85 mmHg，脉搏为88次/分，规律。心肺检查无特殊。腹部柔软且无压痛。第10肋骨和L1-L2椎体区域有局部压痛。神经系统检查正常。放射性核素骨显像显示多个椎骨和肋骨活动增加，与患者的疼痛区域相对应。常规X光片显示硬化性病变，与骨扫描中摄取增加的区域相符，高度提示转移性癌症。以下哪项附加发现最有可能在该患者身上看到？"

    "en": "This patient with sclerotic bony metastases most likely has prostate cancer. Imaging of bone metastases assists in cancer diagnosis, as it allows the lesions to be characterized as: • Osteolytic (lucent): Due to osteoclast stimulation, tend to represent aggressive cancer • Osteoblastic (sclerotic): Due to osteoblasts, indicates a more indolent course Metastatic prostate cancer commonly has osteoblastic (sclerotic) bone lesions. Bone pain is a typical clinical presentation; other symptoms include cancer cachexia and urinary symptoms (which are not always present). Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in men, and African American men are at highest risk. An irregular prostate gland on digital rectal examination is suggestive of the diagnosis, which is then confirmed by biopsy. The prostate-specific antigen tumor marker is commonly elevated.\n(Choice A) Hematuria and polycythemia (due to erythropoietin release) are suggestive of renal cell cancer. Renal cell cancer bone metastases are commonly osteolytic.\n(Choice B) Monoclonal immunoglobulin spikes are found in multiple myeloma. Myeloma cells suppress osteoblasts and would cause osteolytic lesions, which are not present in this patient. Patients commonly have bone pain, recurrent infections, and symptoms of anemia.\n(Choice C) Elevated parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTH-rP) levels can occur with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are associated with symptoms of hypercalcemia (confusion, abdominal pain, bony pain). Osteolytic bone lesions would be seen in NSCLC.\n(Choice D) Lymphadenopathy and BCL-2 overexpression are found in lymphomas. BCL-2 is an anti-apoptosis factor, and overexpression plays a role in resistance to chemotherapy. Common manifestations of lymphoma also include night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue.\n(Choice F) A rapidly enlarging irregular mole is suggestive of a melanoma. The liver, bone, and brain are the most common metastatic sites. Melanoma causes lytic bone lesions.",
    "zh": "该患者出现硬化性骨转移，最有可能患有前列腺癌。骨转移的影像学检查有助于癌症诊断，因为它能够将病变特征描述为：• 溶骨性（透亮）：由于破骨细胞刺激，倾向于代表侵袭性癌症 • 成骨性（硬化性）：由于成骨细胞，提示病程较缓慢 转移性前列腺癌通常具有成骨性（硬化性）骨病变。骨痛是典型的临床表现；其他症状包括癌症恶病质和泌尿系统症状（并非总是存在）。前列腺癌是男性最常见的非皮肤癌，非裔美国人风险最高。直肠指检发现前列腺不规则提示该诊断，然后通过活检确认。前列腺特异性抗原肿瘤标志物通常升高。\n(选项A) 血尿和红细胞增多症（由于促红细胞生成素释放）提示肾细胞癌。肾细胞癌骨转移通常为溶骨性。\n(选项B) 单克隆免疫球蛋白峰见于多发性骨髓瘤。骨髓瘤细胞抑制成骨细胞，并会导致溶骨性病变，而该患者没有这种病变。患者通常有骨痛、反复感染和贫血症状。\n(选项C) 甲状旁腺激素相关肽（PTH-rP）水平升高可发生于非小细胞肺癌（NSCLC），并与高钙血症的症状相关（意识模糊、腹痛、骨痛）。在NSCLC中会看到溶骨性骨病变。\n(选项D) 淋巴结肿大和BCL-2过度表达见于淋巴瘤。BCL-2是一种抗凋亡因子，过度表达在化疗耐药中起作用。淋巴瘤的常见表现还包括盗汗、体重减轻和疲劳。\n(选项F) 快速增大的不规则痣提示黑色素瘤。肝脏、骨骼和大脑是最常见的转移部位。黑色素瘤会导致溶骨性骨病变。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation and common associated findings of metastatic prostate cancer, particularly the characteristics of its bone metastases.\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the most likely primary cancer based on the patient's presentation and the nature of the bone metastases (sclerotic). Then, consider the typical clinical manifestations and diagnostic markers associated with that specific cancer to determine the most probable additional finding.",
