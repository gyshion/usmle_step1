    "en": "During a genetic study, several members of a family are found to have an abnormality affecting a gene located on chromosome 21. The gene encodes a cell surface protein that is processed by proteolytic enzyme cleavage. In the affected individuals, there is an increased number of hydrophobic fragments of the protein, which are prone to aggregation into insoluble fibrils. Which of the following is the most likely result of the genetic abnormality in these individuals?",

    "en": "The amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene is located on chromosome 21 and encodes a cell-surface protein that is normally involved in synaptic formation and repair. APP is processed in 1 of 2 pathways by a series of secretases (proteolytic enzymes): processing via the alpha- and gamma-secretase pathway, which does not result in amyloidogenic products, or processing via the beta- and gamma-secretase pathway, which results in the production of beta amyloid. If beta amyloid is not sufficiently cleared by cellular processes, it can form INSOLUBLE FIBRILS and contribute to the generation of extracellular amyloid plaques that accumulate in the brain. These aggregates of beta amyloid are neurotoxic and associated with the development and progression of ALZHEIMER DEMENTIA, a disease characterized by ACCELERATED NEURODEGENERATION leading to progressive cognitive dysfunction. As a result, patients who have abnormal APP processing, impaired beta-amyloid clearance, or production of higher levels of APP (eg, trisomy 21 [Down syndrome]) are at increased risk of developing Alzheimer dementia.\n\n(Choice A) Patients with trisomy 21 have an increased risk of hematologic malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. This is thought to be related to the high susceptibility of megakaryocytic and B-cell precursors to increased dosage of chromosome 21 genes.\n(Choice C) Erythrocyte membrane distortion most often occurs with abnormalities affecting either the cytoskeleton (eg, spectrin/ankyrin in hereditary spherocytosis) or hemoglobin (eg, beta globin in sickle cell disease).\n(Choice D) Pulmonary elastic tissue loss can occur when there is excessive alveolar elastin degradation (eg, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency). Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a serine protease inhibitor that is synthesized in the liver and released into the systemic circulation.\n(Choice E) Skeletal myofiber disruption (eg, muscular & myotonic dystrophy) can occur with numerous mutations affecting the internal cytoskeletal system and contractile components (eg, sarcomere, costamere proteins). However, it is not typically related to impaired proteolytic cleavage and does not result in precipitation of insoluble fibrils.",
    "zh": "淀粉样前体蛋白 (APP) 基因位于 21 号染色体上，编码一种细胞表面蛋白，该蛋白通常参与突触形成和修复。APP 通过一系列分泌酶（蛋白水解酶）以 2 种途径之一进行加工：通过 α 和 γ 分泌酶途径加工，该途径不产生淀粉样蛋白原性产物，或者通过 β 和 γ 分泌酶途径加工，该途径产生 β 淀粉样蛋白。如果 β 淀粉样蛋白没有被细胞过程充分清除，它可以形成不溶性原纤维，并导致大脑中积累的细胞外淀粉样蛋白斑块的产生。这些 β 淀粉样蛋白聚集体具有神经毒性，与阿尔茨海默病（一种以加速神经退行性变导致进行性认知功能障碍为特征的疾病）的发生和进展相关。因此，APP 加工异常、β 淀粉样蛋白清除受损或 APP 产量较高（例如，21 三体综合征 [唐氏综合征]）的患者发生阿尔茨海默病的风险增加。\n\n(选项 A) 21 三体综合征患者发生血液系统恶性肿瘤的风险增加，如急性淋巴细胞白血病和急性巨核细胞白血病。这被认为与巨核细胞和 B 细胞前体对 21 号染色体基因剂量增加的高度易感性有关。\n(选项 C) 红细胞膜变形最常发生在影响细胞骨架（例如，遗传性球形红细胞病中的血影蛋白/锚蛋白）或血红蛋白（例如，镰状细胞病中的 β 球蛋白）的异常时。\n(选项 D) 肺弹性组织缺失可能发生在肺泡弹性蛋白过度降解时（例如，α-1 抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症）。α-1 抗胰蛋白酶是一种丝氨酸蛋白酶抑制剂，在肝脏中合成并释放到全身循环中。\n(选项 E) 骨骼肌纤维破坏（例如，肌肉和肌强直性营养不良）可能发生在影响内部细胞骨架系统和收缩成分（例如，肌节、肌节蛋白）的众多突变中。然而，它通常与蛋白水解切割受损无关，也不会导致不溶性原纤维的沉淀。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology of Alzheimer dementia, specifically the role of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and the formation of amyloid plaques leading to neurodegeneration.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify that the described genetic abnormality leads to the formation of insoluble protein fibrils, which are characteristic of amyloid deposition. Recognizing that APP processing abnormalities are linked to Alzheimer dementia and its associated neurodegeneration is key to selecting the correct answer.",
