    "en": "A 64-year-old man comes to the office due to progressive low back pain for the past several months that is beginning to interfere with his job. The patient describes pain in the lower back and buttocks, which worsens with prolonged standing or walking and improves with lying down. He also has occasional sharp, shooting pain that radiates down his right leg. The patient works as a greeter for a local supermarket and was recently given a written warning for taking too many breaks during his shift. He has a history of hypertension and osteoarthritis. Spine imaging reveals degenerative joint changes and a large osteophyte compressing the spinal nerve root exiting through the right neural foramen between the L5 and S1 vertebrae. Which of the following examination findings is most likely present in this patient due to the nerve lesion?",
    "zh": "一名64岁男性因过去几个月来进行性腰背痛就诊，该症状开始影响其工作。患者描述腰背部和臀部疼痛，站立或行走时间过长时加重，躺下时缓解。他还有偶尔的剧烈、放射至右腿的疼痛。该患者是当地一家超市的迎宾员，最近因在工作期间休息次数过多而受到书面警告。他有高血压和骨关节炎病史。脊柱影像学显示退行性关节改变以及一个大的骨赘压迫从L5和S1椎骨之间的右侧神经孔穿出的脊神经根。以下哪项检查结果最有可能出现在该患者身上，是由于神经损伤所致？"

    "en": "This patient has lumbosacral radiculopathy due to an osteophyte at the L5-S1 neural foramen resulting in compression of the L5 nerve root. Spinal nerves in the lumbosacral spine exit below their corresponding vertebral body level (eg, L5 nerve root exits between L5 and S1 vertebral bodies). However, because of the presence of multiple spinal nerve roots in the lumbosacral area (ie, cauda equina), nerve root compression can occur at different vertebral levels through 2 distinct mechanisms:\n\n*   **Spinal spondylosis:** Degenerative changes and osteophyte formation can narrow the neural foramina. This leads to nerve root compression as it passes through the neural foramina (in this patient, an osteophyte is compressing the exiting L5 nerve root).\n*   **Vertebral disc herniation:** A tear in the intervertebral disc annulus can lead to herniation of the nucleus pulposus. If this occurs laterally, it can compress the exiting nerve root as it passes through the neural foramen. However, if it occurs more centrally, it can protrude into the spinal canal and compress other nerves in the cauda equina that exit one or more levels below the area of herniation.\n\nL5 radiculopathy causes sensory loss and back pain that radiates down the leg in an L5 dermatomal distribution (eg, buttocks, lateral thigh and calf, dorsal foot). Weakness occurs in muscles innervated by fibers from the L5 spinal root, which include the tibialis anterior (foot dorsiflexion and inversion), peroneus (foot eversion), and extensor hallucis longus (great toe extension).\n\n(Choice A) The patellar (knee) reflex is mediated by the quadriceps muscle, which is innervated by L2-L4 nerve roots.\n\n(Choice B) Decreased rectal tone can be seen with damage to the pudendal nerve, which originates from the S2-S4 nerve roots.\n\n(Choice C) The skin overlying the inguinal region is innervated by fibers from the L1 spinal nerve root that travel in the ilioinguinal and genitofemoral nerves.\n\n(Choice E) Hip flexion occurs due to contraction of the iliopsoas, which is innervated by the L2-L4 nerve roots.\n\nEducational objective:\nSpinal nerves in the lumbosacral spine exit through the neural foramina that is below the corresponding vertebral body level (eg, L5 nerve root exits between L5 and S1 vertebral bodies) and can be compressed at the neural foramina due to osteophyte formation. In addition to back pain, L5 radiculopathy often presents with sensory loss over the lateral thigh, calf, and dorsal foot and weakness of great toe extension and foot dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion.",
    "zh": "该患者患有腰骶神经根病，是由于L5-S1神经孔的骨赘导致L5神经根受压。腰骶椎的脊神经从其相应椎体水平下方穿出（例如，L5神经根从L5和S1椎体之间穿出）。然而，由于腰骶区域存在多根脊神经根（即马尾），神经根受压可以通过2种不同的机制发生在不同的椎体水平：\n\n*   **脊柱椎骨病：**退行性变和骨赘形成可使神经孔变窄。这会导致神经根在穿过神经孔时受压（在该患者中，骨赘正在压迫穿出的L5神经根）。\n*   **椎间盘突出：**椎间盘环的撕裂可导致髓核突出。如果这种情况发生在侧方，它可以压迫穿出神经孔的神经根。但是，如果它发生在更靠中心的位置，它可以突出到椎管中，并压迫马尾中从突出区域下方一个或多个水平穿出的其他神经。\n\nL5神经根病导致感觉缺失和腰痛，放射到腿部，呈L5皮节分布（例如，臀部、大腿外侧和小腿、足背）。虚弱发生在由L5脊髓根的纤维支配的肌肉中，这些肌肉包括胫骨前肌（足背屈和内翻）、腓骨肌（足外翻）和拇长伸肌（大脚趾伸展）。\n\n（选项A）髌腱（膝）反射由股四头肌介导，股四头肌由L2-L4神经根支配。\n\n（选项B）直肠张力降低可见于阴部神经损伤，阴部神经起源于S2-S4神经根。\n\n（选项C）覆盖腹股沟区域的皮肤由来自L1脊神经根的纤维支配，这些纤维穿过髂腹股沟神经和股生殖神经。\n\n（选项E）髋屈发生在腰大肌收缩时，腰大肌由L2-L4神经根支配。\n\n教育目标：\n腰骶椎的脊神经穿过神经孔，该神经孔位于相应椎体水平的下方（例如，L5神经根从L5和S1椎体之间穿出），并且由于骨赘形成，可在神经孔处受压。除了腰痛外，L5神经根病常表现为大腿外侧、小腿和足背的感觉缺失，以及大脚趾伸展和足背屈、内翻和外翻无力。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of lumbosacral radiculopathy, specifically focusing on the clinical presentation of L5 nerve root compression due to spinal spondylosis and osteophyte formation. It requires correlating the anatomical location of nerve root compression with specific motor and sensory deficits.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the affected nerve root based on the imaging findings and the location of the osteophyte. Then, recall the muscles innervated by that specific nerve root to determine the most likely motor deficit. Additionally, understanding the dermatomal distribution of sensory deficits and the innervation of reflexes can help rule out other options.",
