    "en": "A 54-year-old man comes to the office for an initial appointment to evaluate lower back pain. The patient's medical record shows that he has seen several physicians for back pain treatment. He has been prescribed multiple pain medications and physical rehabilitation services but often stopped prematurely or did not follow through with recommendations. At the beginning of the visit the patient says, \"I'm tired of living with back pain, and I haven't been able to work in years. Nothing has helped me—at this point I might as well just give up and go on disability.\"",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This physician is confronted by a patient who has not experienced benefit from previous treatment and feels hopeless that his condition will improve. Such challenging patients can often cause the physician to feel defensive, manipulated, or hopeless as well, leading to premature referral to a specialist.\n\nAlthough strategies to improve treatment adherence will be important for improving outcomes, the best initial approach is to build the physician-patient relationship by empathizing with the patient's frustration and disappointment with past treatments. In this way, the patient will feel understood rather than blamed for past treatment failures, and he will be more willing to work with the physician to develop a collaborative plan focused on realistic goals.\n\n(Choice A) This patient requires a thorough history and physical examination to assess his condition. Referral to a pain specialist is premature.\n\n(Choice B) This statement is likely to be experienced as unsupportive because it challenges the patient's proposal regarding disability and does not offer any suggestions in its place.\n\n(Choice C) This statement attempts to point out the patient's help-rejecting pattern of behavior, but it would likely be perceived as judgmental, especially at this early stage of the physician-patient relationship.\n\n(Choice E) Although at some point the physician should address the importance of adherence to treatment in achieving a better outcome, this statement is critical and blames the patient for past treatment failures. Empathizing with the patient's frustration at this early stage would be more effective in developing a treatment alliance.\n\nEducational objective:\nPhysicians may become frustrated with a patient who is hopeless about treatment, often compelling the physician to refer the patient to a specialist prematurely. Empathizing with the patient's frustration over past treatment failures can help build the physician-patient relationship.",
    "zh": "这位医生面对的是一位之前未从治疗中获益，并且对自己的病情有所改善感到绝望的患者。 这种具有挑战性的患者通常也会导致医生感到防御、被操纵或绝望，从而导致过早地转诊给专家。\n\n尽管改善治疗依从性的策略对于改善结果非常重要，但最佳的初始方法是通过同情患者对过去治疗的挫败感和失望来建立医患关系。 通过这种方式，患者会感到被理解，而不是因为过去的治疗失败而受到指责，并且他将更愿意与医生合作制定一个侧重于现实目标的协作计划。\n\n（选项A）该患者需要进行全面的病史和体格检查以评估其病情。 转诊给疼痛专家为时过早。\n\n（选项B）这种说法可能被认为是不支持的，因为它挑战了患者关于残疾的提议，并且没有提出任何建议来代替。\n\n（选项C）这种说法试图指出患者的拒绝帮助的行为模式，但它很可能被认为是判断性的，尤其是在医患关系的早期阶段。\n\n（选项E）尽管在某个时候医生应该解决坚持治疗以取得更好结果的重要性，但这种说法是关键的，并指责患者过去治疗的失败。 在早期阶段同情患者的挫败感将有助于更有效地建立治疗联盟。\n\n教育目标：\n医生可能会对对治疗感到绝望的患者感到沮丧，这通常迫使医生过早地将患者转诊给专家。 同情患者对过去治疗失败的挫败感有助于建立医患关系。"
