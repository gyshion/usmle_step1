    "en": "Meckel diverticulum {{exhibit_2}}\n\nThis patient with painless rectal bleeding has imaging findings consistent with a Meckel diverticulum, a congenital intestinal abnormality that results from failed obliteration of the vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct. The vitelline duct is an embryologic remnant that connects the yolk sac to the primitive midgut, and duct closure normally occurs in early gestation. Incomplete closure results in an ileal outpouching with a fibrous connection to the umbilicus.\n\nMeckel diverticulum often contains heterotopic gastric mucosa. Secretion of hydrochloric acid by gastric parietal cells causes ulceration and bleeding of local small bowel, resulting in typical findings of painless lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and anemia, as seen in this patient. Less commonly, Meckel diverticulum can present with acute abdominal pain; for example, it can serve as a lead point for intussusception, causing colicky pain and current jelly stools. Although presentation of Meckel diverticulum is most common at age <2, it can occur at any age.\n\nDiagnosis is made with 99mTc-pertechnetate scan (ie, Meckel scan). The radioisotope 99mTc-pertechnetate has an affinity for parietal cells of gastric mucosa, and increased uptake of the tracer in the periumbilical/right lower quadrant area is characteristic.\n\n(Choice A) The hindgut, supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery, gives rise to the distal colon, rectum, and upper part of the anal canal. Arrest of hindgut descent in utero leads to an imperforate anus, which presents in neonates with failure to pass stool, not painless rectal bleeding.\n\n(Choices B and C) Failure of craniocaudal neural crest cell migration results in an aganglionic sigmoid colon/rectum that is narrow and inactive (ie, Hirschsprung disease), and disrupted vascular flow to the ileum results in ileal atresia. Both conditions typically manifest with signs of obstruction (eg, abdominal distension, bilious emesis, failure to pass meconium) in a neonate, not painless GI bleeding in a 4-year-old.\n\n(Choice E) Abnormal midgut rotation around the superior mesenteric artery describes intestinal malrotation. Patients may have hematochezia because the narrow mesenteric base seen in malrotation permits the small bowel to twist with subsequent ischemia (ie, volvulus). However, abdominal pain, vomiting, and signs of peritonitis are also typically present. Moreover, 99mTc-pertechnetate scintigraphy would not show abnormal uptake.\n\nEducational objective:\nMeckel diverticulum results from incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct and usually presents with painless lower gastrointestinal bleeding. 99mTc-pertechnetate localizes to heterotopic gastric mucosa that is often contained within a Meckel diverticulum, and uptake in the periumbilical area or right lower quadrant is diagnostic. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "麦克尔憩室 {{exhibit_2}}\n\n这位患有无痛性直肠出血的患者的影像学检查结果与麦克尔憩室一致，这是一种先天性肠道异常，是由于卵黄管（脐肠）闭锁失败所致。卵黄管是连接卵黄囊和原始中肠的胚胎残余物，并且在妊娠早期通常会发生导管闭合。闭合不完全导致回肠外突，并与脐部发生纤维连接。\n\n麦克尔憩室通常包含异位胃粘膜。胃壁细胞分泌盐酸会导致局部小肠溃疡和出血，导致典型的无痛性下消化道（GI）出血和贫血表现，如该患者所示。麦克尔憩室较少见地可表现为急性腹痛；例如，它可以作为肠套叠的先导点，导致绞痛和果酱样便。虽然麦克尔憩室最常见于<2岁时出现，但它可以在任何年龄发生。\n\n诊断是通过99mTc-高锝酸盐扫描（即，麦克尔扫描）进行的。放射性同位素99mTc-高锝酸盐对胃粘膜的壁细胞具有亲和力，并且示踪剂在脐周/右下象限区域的摄取增加是其特征。\n\n(选项A) 后肠由肠系膜下动脉供血，产生远端结肠、直肠和肛管上部。子宫内后肠下降受阻导致肛门闭锁，在新生儿中表现为无法排便，而不是无痛性直肠出血。\n\n(选项B和C) 头尾神经嵴细胞迁移失败导致无神经节细胞的乙状结肠/直肠变窄且无活性（即，先天性巨结肠），并且回肠血流中断导致回肠闭锁。这两种情况通常在新生儿中表现出梗阻迹象（例如，腹胀、胆汁性呕吐、胎便未排出），而不是4岁儿童的无痛性GI出血。\n\n(选项E) 中肠异常围绕肠系膜上动脉旋转描述了肠旋转不良。患者可能出现便血，因为在旋转不良中看到的狭窄肠系膜基底允许小肠扭转，随后发生缺血（即，肠扭转）。然而，通常也会出现腹痛、呕吐和腹膜炎的体征。此外，99mTc-高锝酸盐闪烁扫描不会显示异常摄取。\n\n教育目标：\n麦克尔憩室是由于卵黄管闭合不完全所致，通常表现为无痛性下消化道出血。99mTc-高锝酸盐定位于异位胃粘膜，异位胃粘膜通常包含在麦克尔憩室中，并且在脐周区域或右下象限的摄取具有诊断意义。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"
