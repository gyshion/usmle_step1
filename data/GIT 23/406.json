  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has abdominal pain, ileal inflammation, and a noncaseating granuloma on biopsy, all of which are consistent with Crohn disease (CD). Noncaseating granulomas are seen only in a minority of patients with CD but, when present, are highly suggestive of the diagnosis. Microscopically, granulomas contain a large number of epithelioid macrophages that may fuse together to form multinucleated cells (Langhans giant cells), surrounded by a band of lymphocytes.\n\nGranulomas are considered caseating or noncaseating:\n\n*   **Caseating.** Central necrosis is present and has a granular, cheesy appearance. Caseating granulomas are typically seen in infectious etiologies (eg, tuberculosis, leprosy, syphilis, cat scratch disease) due to cell death (both macrophage and bacterial) and the release of cellular contents.\n*   **Noncaseating.** No central necrosis is present. Noncaseating granulomas are typically seen in autoinflammatory conditions (eg, CD, sarcoidosis, common variable immune deficiency).\n\nGranuloma formation is a product of chronic T-lymphocyte and macrophage activation in response to a difficult-to-eradicate antigen (eg, mycobacterium, self-antigens). Macrophages release tumor necrosis factor-alpha and other proinflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-6, IL-1, IL-12) that promote macrophage migration and TH1 cell differentiation. Th1 cells are thought to be important in granuloma organization; they produce IL-2 and interferon-gamma, which promote further T-cell response, activation of macrophages, and differentiation of macrophages into giant cells. Th17 cells are a proinflammatory subset of Th1 cells and contribute to the cell injury seen in CD.\n\n(Choice A) B-lymphocytes differentiate into plasma cells and produce antibodies, thereby mediating the immune response to bacterial infection.\n\n(Choice B) Eosinophils mediate defense reactions against certain parasites. They are also implicated in the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n(Choice C) The main function of neutrophils is phagocytosis. They play an active role in nonspecific inflammatory processes.\n\n(Choice D) Natural killer (NK) cells provide a nonspecific defense against virus-infected and tumor cells. They are not known to play a role in CD.\n\n(Choice F) Th2 cells are involved in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. They produce IL-5 and IL-13, which contribute to inflammation and damage of the intestinal mucosa. Educational objective: Granulomas are characterized by a large number of epithelioid macrophages that may fuse together to form multinucleated cells (Langhans giant cells) surrounded by a band of lymphocytes. Granuloma formation involves chronic Th1 and macrophage activation in response to a difficult-to-eradicate antigen.",
    "zh": "该患者出现腹痛、回肠炎症和活检发现非干酪性肉芽肿，所有这些都与克罗恩病（CD）一致。非干酪性肉芽肿仅见于少数CD患者，但当出现时，高度提示该诊断。镜下，肉芽肿包含大量上皮样巨噬细胞，这些细胞可能融合在一起形成多核细胞（郎汉斯巨细胞），周围环绕着一圈淋巴细胞。\n\n肉芽肿被认为是干酪性或非干酪性的：\n\n*   **干酪性。** 存在中央坏死，外观呈颗粒状、干酪状。干酪性肉芽肿通常见于感染病因（例如，结核病、麻风病、梅毒、猫抓病），是由于细胞死亡（巨噬细胞和细菌）和细胞内容物的释放。\n*   **非干酪性。** 不存在中央坏死。非干酪性肉芽肿通常见于自身炎症性疾病（例如，CD、结节病、常见变异型免疫缺陷病）。\n\n肉芽肿形成是慢性T淋巴细胞和巨噬细胞活化的产物，以应对难以根除的抗原（例如，分枝杆菌、自身抗原）。巨噬细胞释放肿瘤坏死因子-α和其他促炎细胞因子（例如，IL-6、IL-1、IL-12），这些细胞因子促进巨噬细胞迁移和Th1细胞分化。Th1细胞被认为在肉芽肿组织中很重要；它们产生IL-2和干扰素-γ，从而促进进一步的T细胞反应、巨噬细胞活化和巨噬细胞分化为巨细胞。Th17细胞是Th1细胞的促炎性亚群，并导致CD中可见的细胞损伤。\n\n（选项A）B淋巴细胞分化为浆细胞并产生抗体，从而介导对细菌感染的免疫反应。\n\n（选项B）嗜酸性粒细胞介导针对某些寄生虫的防御反应。它们也参与超敏反应的发病机制。\n\n（选项C）中性粒细胞的主要功能是吞噬作用。它们在非特异性炎症过程中发挥积极作用。\n\n（选项D）自然杀伤（NK）细胞提供针对病毒感染细胞和肿瘤细胞的非特异性防御。众所周知，它们在CD中不起作用。\n\n（选项F）Th2细胞参与溃疡性结肠炎的发病机制。它们产生IL-5和IL-13，从而导致肠粘膜的炎症和损伤。教育目标：肉芽肿的特征是大量上皮样巨噬细胞，这些巨噬细胞可能融合在一起形成多核细胞（郎汉斯巨细胞），周围环绕着一圈淋巴细胞。肉芽肿的形成涉及慢性Th1和巨噬细胞活化，以应对难以根除的抗原。"
