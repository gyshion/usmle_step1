    "en": "A 62-year-old man is evaluated for worsening cough, shortness of breath, and episodic hemoptysis over the past 6 months. The patient has also had a 15-kg (33-lb) weight loss over the same period without any change in diet or activity level. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history and does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. BMI is 18 kg/m^2. The patient appears cachectic with temporal wasting and generalized loss of muscle mass. Chest x-ray reveals a large lung mass with mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion. Which of the following cellular processes is most likely responsible for this patient's muscle loss? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient who has a 50-pack-year smoking history and a mediastinal mass likely has muscle atrophy due to cancer-related cachexia. Cachexia is a hypermetabolic state driven by elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6), which stimulate the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to degrade skeletal muscle proteins (eg, actin, myosin). {{exhibit_2}} The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is the major eukaryotic mechanism for selective proteolysis (the destruction of targeted proteins). The addition of ubiquitin multimers to a target protein marks it for rapid destruction by the proteasome, whereby the protein is then unfolded within the proteasome core and chopped into small oligopeptides. These oligopeptides can be further degraded by cytosolic peptidases into individual amino acids. Other proteolytic pathways play a less prominent role in the degradation of muscle tissue. Lysosomes, membrane-bound organelles that contain proteases and other digestive enzymes, are primarily tasked with breaking down extracellular components that are brought into the cell via endocytosis and with slowly recycling obsolete cytosolic organelles and debris. {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者有50包年的吸烟史和纵隔肿块，很可能由于癌症相关的恶病质而出现肌肉萎缩。恶病质是一种高代谢状态，由促炎细胞因子（如肿瘤坏死因子-α、白介素-6）升高驱动，这些细胞因子刺激泛素-蛋白酶体途径降解骨骼肌蛋白（如肌动蛋白、肌球蛋白）。{{exhibit_2}} 泛素-蛋白酶体途径是选择性蛋白水解（靶向蛋白的破坏）的主要真核机制。将泛素多聚体添加到靶蛋白上，标志着它将被蛋白酶体迅速破坏，蛋白在蛋白酶体核心内展开并被切成小的寡肽。这些寡肽可以被细胞质肽酶进一步降解为单个氨基酸。其他蛋白水解途径在肌肉组织的降解中作用较小。溶酶体是含有蛋白酶和其他消化酶的膜结合细胞器，主要负责分解通过胞吞作用进入细胞的细胞外成分，并缓慢回收过时的细胞质细胞器和碎片。{{exhibit_3}}"
