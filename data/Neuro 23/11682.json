    "en": "A 45-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up. He was diagnosed with focal epilepsy 2 years ago and has been treated with several antiepileptic medications. Over the last 6 months, his seizure frequency has increased despite compliance with medical therapy. Neurologic examination and brain imaging are unremarkable. The patient is started on a new antiepileptic medication that selectively blocks voltage-gated calcium channels. This medication most likely affects which of the following steps of neurotransmission?",
    "zh": "一名45岁男性前来复诊。2年前他被诊断为局灶性癫痫，并接受了几种抗癫痫药物治疗。在过去的6个月里，尽管他坚持药物治疗，但癫痫发作的频率有所增加。神经系统检查和脑部影像学检查无特殊发现。患者开始服用一种新的抗癫痫药物，该药物选择性地阻断电压门控钙通道。这种药物最有可能影响神经递质传递的以下哪个步骤？"

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Neurons communicate with each other via synapses, regions where the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron transmits chemical signals to the dendrites of a postsynaptic neuron. Binding of an excitatory neurotransmitter (eg, glutamate) to a postsynaptic neuron causes opening of ligand-gated sodium channels, leading to sodium influx and membrane depolarization. This depolarization impulse is transmitted from the dendrites through the cell body to the axon hillock, which contains a large number of voltage-gated sodium channels. Once the axon hillock becomes sufficiently depolarized, an action potential is triggered and propagates along the axon via a steady influx of sodium ions. When the action potential reaches the axon terminal, VOLTAGE-GATED CALCIUM CHANNELS open and allow the influx of calcium, which is essential for the fusion and RELEASE of neurotransmitter vesicles into the synaptic cleft.\n\nSeizures occur due to abnormal, synchronized firing of hyperexcitable neurons in the brain, and many antiepileptic medications work by modifying electrochemical transmission between neurons. Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant that works by inhibiting presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, whereas levetiracetam acts downstream by disrupting vesicle fusion.\n\n(Choice A) Antiepileptic medications such as phenytoin and carbamazepine disrupt the generation and propagation of action potentials (in the axon hillock and axon proper, respectively) by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels.\n\n(Choices B and D) Neurotransmitters are synthesized in the presynaptic neuronal cell body and transported to the axon terminal (via kinesin motor proteins), where they are packaged in synaptic vesicles and primed for release.\n\n(Choice E) Although the endoplasmic reticulum contains calcium release channels, these do not directly participate in neurotransmission. Release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum is more important for skeletal muscle contraction.\n\nEducational objective:\nVoltage-gated sodium channels are important for the generation and propagation of action potentials. When the action potential reaches the axon terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open and allow the influx of calcium, which is essential for the fusion and release of neurotransmitter vesicles into the synaptic cleft.",
    "zh": "神经元通过突触相互通讯，突触是突触前神经元的轴突末梢将化学信号传递到突触后神经元的树突的区域。兴奋性神经递质（例如，谷氨酸）与突触后神经元的结合导致配体门控钠通道开放，从而导致钠内流和膜去极化。这种去极化冲动从树突传递到细胞体，再传递到轴丘，轴丘含有大量的电压门控钠通道。一旦轴丘充分去极化，就会触发动作电位并通过持续的钠离子内流沿轴突传播。当动作电位到达轴突末梢时，电压门控钙通道开放，允许钙内流，这对于神经递质囊泡融合和释放到突触间隙至关重要。\n\n癫痫发作是由于大脑中过度兴奋神经元的异常、同步放电引起的，许多抗癫痫药物通过改变神经元之间的电化学传递而起作用。加巴喷丁是一种抗惊厥药，通过抑制突触前电压门控钙通道而起作用，而左乙拉西坦通过干扰囊泡融合而向下游作用。\n\n（选项A）苯妥英钠和卡马西平等抗癫痫药物通过阻断电压门控钠通道来破坏动作电位的产生和传播（分别在轴丘和轴突中）。\n\n（选项B和D）神经递质在突触前神经元细胞体中合成，并被转运到轴突末梢（通过驱动蛋白马达蛋白），在那里它们被包装在突触囊泡中并为释放做好准备。\n\n（选项E）虽然内质网包含钙释放通道，但它们不直接参与神经递质传递。内质网释放钙对骨骼肌收缩更重要。\n\n教育目标：\n电压门控钠通道对于动作电位的产生和传播至关重要。当动作电位到达轴突末梢时，电压门控钙通道开放，允许钙内流，这对于神经递质囊泡融合和释放到突触间隙至关重要。"

It also tests understanding of how certain antiepileptic medications work by targeting these channels.\n\nTo solve this question, understand the sequence of events in neurotransmission, particularly the role of calcium influx in vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release.
