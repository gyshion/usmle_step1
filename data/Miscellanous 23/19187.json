  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is E. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 3. The VHL gene product is a tumor suppressor protein that promotes degradation of damaged proteins and aids in cell cycle regulation. Similar to other disorders affecting tumor suppressor genes (eg, familial retinoblastoma), a second, somatic mutation in this gene leads to the development of various benign and malignant tumors (eg, cerebellar and retinal hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytomas, renal cell carcinomas) with potentially serious complications.\n\nPheochromocytoma is a rare neoplasm arising from the adrenal medulla that can produce catecholamines (eg, epinephrine, norepinephrine). Patients may have hypertension, tachycardia, and sweating due to sympathetic overactivity; however, many are asymptomatic. As such, annual screening for increased urinary or plasma metanephrines (catecholamine breakdown products) is recommended. Likewise, screening for hemangioblastomas and renal cell carcinoma can be achieved with regular MRI and retinal examinations.\n\n(Choice A) The results of bone marrow evaluation would be abnormal in patients with leukemia, which is not associated with VHL disease.\n\n(Choice B) Chest radiography can identify lung metastases in a patient with a known malignancy. This patient requires evaluation for primary associated neoplasms before screening for metastases.\n\n(Choice C) Colonoscopy is performed in patients with an inherited predisposition to colorectal cancer, such as those with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (ie, Lynch syndrome) and familial adenomatous polyposis. VHL disease is not associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer in younger patients.\n\n(Choice D) Screening echocardiography is performed in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex to identify an associated cardiac rhabdomyoma. Cardiac tumors are not a significant feature of VHL disease.\n\nEducational objective: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene, which is associated with the development of pheochromocytomas, retinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas, and renal cell carcinomas. Because of the potential for serious complications from these tumors, patients with VHL should receive annual surveillance, including plasma metanephrines, ophthalmologic examination, and MRI of the brain and spine.",
    "zh": "正确答案是E。Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)病是一种常染色体显性遗传疾病，由3号染色体上VHL抑癌基因的突变引起。VHL基因产物是一种抑癌蛋白，促进受损蛋白质的降解并帮助细胞周期调节。与其他影响抑癌基因的疾病（例如，家族性视网膜母细胞瘤）类似，该基因的第二次体细胞突变会导致各种良性和恶性肿瘤的发展（例如，小脑和视网膜血管母细胞瘤、嗜铬细胞瘤、肾细胞癌），并可能导致严重的并发症。\n\n嗜铬细胞瘤是一种罕见的起源于肾上腺髓质的肿瘤，可产生儿茶酚胺（例如，肾上腺素、去甲肾上腺素）。患者可能因交感神经活性过度而出现高血压、心动过速和出汗；然而，许多患者无症状。因此，建议每年筛查尿液或血浆中甲氧基肾上腺素（儿茶酚胺分解产物）是否升高。同样，可以通过定期的MRI和视网膜检查来筛查血管母细胞瘤和肾细胞癌。\n\n(选项A) 白血病患者的骨髓评估结果异常，这与VHL病无关。\n\n(选项B) 胸部X线摄影可以识别已知恶性肿瘤患者的肺转移。该患者需要在筛查转移灶之前进行原发相关肿瘤的评估。\n\n(选项C) 结肠镜检查是在有结直肠癌遗传易感性的患者中进行的，例如，有遗传性非息肉病性结直肠癌（即，Lynch综合征）和家族性腺瘤性息肉病的患者。VHL病与年轻患者结直肠癌风险增加无关。\n\n(选项D) 对于有结节性硬化症的患者，进行筛查性超声心动图检查以识别相关的心脏横纹肌瘤。心脏肿瘤不是VHL病的重要特征。\n\n教育目标：Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)病是一种常染色体显性遗传疾病，由抑癌基因突变引起，这与嗜铬细胞瘤、视网膜和脑血管母细胞瘤以及肾细胞癌的发生有关。由于这些肿瘤可能导致严重的并发症，VHL患者应接受年度监测，包括血浆甲氧基肾上腺素、眼科检查以及脑和脊柱MRI。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the surveillance recommendations for patients with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, specifically focusing on the screening for associated neoplasms. It requires knowledge of the genetic basis of VHL disease and the common manifestations.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the key features of VHL disease, including the affected gene and the types of tumors that arise. Then, based on the known associations, determine which screening modality is most appropriate for early detection of a common and potentially serious complication.",
