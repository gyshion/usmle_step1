    "en": "A 45-year-old man is brought to a rural emergency department due to severe chest pain, sweating, and nausea. The symptoms began suddenly an hour ago. He has no significant medical history. His father died at age 50 after experiencing sudden-onset chest pain. The patient smokes a pack of cigarettes daily. He does not take any medications and has no known drug allergies. Examination shows normal heart sounds and breath sounds. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with ST segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Medical management for the patient's acute condition is initiated. After initial treatment, the chest pain decreases in intensity and a reperfusion complex ventricular arrhythmia emerges. The arrhythmia is asymptomatic and resolves spontaneously. Which of the following drugs is most likely responsible for rapid reperfusion in this patient? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient had an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and, following medical treatment, experienced symptomatic improvement and reperfusion-related arrhythmia; this is most likely the result of FIBRINOLYTIC (thrombolytic) therapy. Fibrinolytic agents (eg, alteplase) are indicated in patients with acute STEMI who cannot receive percutaneous coronary intervention in a timely manner. Administration of these agents leads to breakdown of fibrin clot and often restoration of myocardial perfusion; some patients develop a self-limiting reperfusion-related arrhythmia (most commonly an accelerated idioventricular rhythm).\n\nIn the fibrinolytic pathway, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is released by the endothelium and cleaves plasminogen to form plasmin. Plasmin then acts to both degrade individual fibrinogen molecules and break down fibrin clot that has already formed. The breakdown of fibrin clot leads to elevated levels of fibrin split products (eg, d-dimer) in the blood. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nPharmacologic fibrinolytic agents that are used clinically include streptokinase and recombinant forms of tPA (eg, alteplase, tenecteplase). All of these agents inherently increase bleeding risk and are contraindicated in patients with increased risk of bleeding complications (eg, recent hemorrhagic stroke).\n\n(Choices B and C) Apixaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor used in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism, and argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor used to treat heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Both of these drugs are anticoagulants; neither causes fibrinolysis or is typically used in the treatment of STEMI.\n\n(Choices D and F) Aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase to reduce thromboxane levels, and P2Y12 receptor blockers (eg, clopidogrel, prasugrel) prevent the binding of adenosine diphosphate to platelets; both actions lead to irreversible inhibition of platelet aggregation. These drugs are used together in acute STEMI to prevent the development of additional platelet thrombus; however, they do not cause lysis of existing thrombus.\n\n(Choice E) Heparin potentiates the activity of antithrombin III to inhibit thrombin and factor Xa and exert an anticoagulation effect. Heparin is used in acute STEMI to prevent further progression of clot formation, but it does not cause thrombolysis.\n\n(Choice G) Statins (eg, rosuvastatin) are used for acute STEMI as they may stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, reduce vascular inflammation, and promote long-term regression of atherosclerosis. However, they do not cause thrombolysis.",
    "zh": "该患者患有ST段抬高型心肌梗死（STEMI），在接受治疗后，症状有所改善并出现再灌注相关性心律失常；这很可能是溶纤（溶栓）治疗的结果。对于无法及时接受经皮冠状动脉介入治疗的急性STEMI患者，溶纤药物（如阿替普酶）是适用的。使用这些药物会导致纤维蛋白血栓分解，并经常恢复心肌灌注；一些患者会出现自限性再灌注相关性心律失常（最常见的是加速性室性自主心律）。\n\n在溶纤途径中，组织纤溶酶原激活剂 (tPA) 由内皮释放，并裂解纤溶酶原形成纤溶酶。然后，纤溶酶既降解单个纤维蛋白原分子，又分解已经形成的纤维蛋白血栓。纤维蛋白血栓的分解会导致血液中纤维蛋白降解产物（例如 D-二聚体）水平升高。 {{exhibit_2}}\n\n临床上使用的药理学溶纤药物包括链激酶和重组tPA（例如阿替普酶、替奈普酶）。所有这些药物都会固有地增加出血风险，并且禁用于有出血并发症风险增加的患者（例如，近期脑出血）。\n\n（选项 B 和 C）阿哌沙班是一种直接的 Xa 因子抑制剂，用于治疗和预防静脉血栓栓塞，而阿加曲班是一种直接的凝血酶抑制剂，用于治疗肝素诱导的血小板减少症。这两种药物都是抗凝剂；两者都不会引起纤维蛋白溶解，通常也不用于治疗STEMI。\n\n（选项 D 和 F）阿司匹林抑制环氧合酶以降低血栓烷水平，而 P2Y12 受体阻滞剂（例如氯吡格雷、普拉格雷）可防止二磷酸腺苷与血小板结合；这两种作用都会导致血小板聚集的不可逆抑制。这些药物在急性STEMI中联合使用，以防止形成额外的血小板血栓；然而，它们不会引起现有血栓的溶解。\n\n（选项 E）肝素增强抗凝血酶 III 的活性，以抑制凝血酶和 Xa 因子，并发挥抗凝作用。肝素用于急性STEMI，以防止血栓进一步进展，但它不会引起溶栓。\n\n（选项 G）他汀类药物（如瑞舒伐他汀）用于急性STEMI，因为它们可以稳定动脉粥样硬化斑块，减少血管炎症，并促进动脉粥样硬化的长期消退。但是，它们不会引起溶栓。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), specifically the use of fibrinolytic therapy to achieve rapid reperfusion.
