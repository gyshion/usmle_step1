Immediately after delivery of the placenta, the patient has a large amount of vaginal bleeding with passage of fist-sized clots, findings consistent with postpartum hemorrhage. A dose of tranexamic acid is administered. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of action of this drug?",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE (PPH). Following placental delivery, maternal HEMOSTASIS is typically achieved by UTERINE CONTRACTION, which constrict bleeding placental bed vessels, and ACTIVATION OF COAGULATION pathways and CLOT FORMATION at the former placental site. When either mechanism fails, patients may have PPH and life-threatening blood loss. Therefore, medications used to treat PPH commonly increase either uterine contractions or clot formation.\n\nAfter placental delivery, prothrombotic substances in the decidua (eg, tissue factor) activate the extrinsic coagulation cascade, generating thrombin that converts fibrinogen into fibrin, forming a fibrin clot. At the same time, the fibrinolytic pathway is also activated: tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is released by damaged endothelium and cleaves plasminogen to form plasmin, which promotes bleeding by breaking down fibrin clots into fibrin degradation products.\n\nTranexamic acid (TXA) stabilizes thrombi/clots by INHIBITING PLASMIN FORMATION; therefore, TXA is an ANTIFIBRINOLYTIC MEDICATION that provides more time for the uterine myometrium to contract and constrict the placental bed blood vessels. The use of TXA for PPH significantly decreases bleeding and is associated with improved maternal morbidity and mortality.\n\n(Choice A) Increasing vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor levels is the mechanism of action for prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), which contains factors II, IX, and X and variable amounts of factor VII. PCC is commonly used to reverse warfarin-induced anticoagulation or to treat bleeding due to congenital vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor deficiencies.\n\n(Choices B and E) Agents that cause uterine myometrial contractions are known as UTEROTONIC MEDICATIONS. Misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin analogue, induces prostaglandin-mediated smooth muscle contraction but has a slow onset of action. In contrast, oxytocin rapidly increases intracellular calcium levels in the uterine myometrium; because of its rapid onset, it is the most common uterotonic administered for PPH.\n\n(Choice D) Promotion of the endothelial release of von Willebrand factor is the mechanism of action for desmopressin, which also increases plasma levels of factor VIII. Desmopressin is used in patients with bleeding due to von Willebrand disease or mild hemophilia A.\n\nEducational objective: Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic medication that stabilizes blood clots in hemorrhaging patients. It inhibits plasmin formation, thereby preventing fibrin degradation and clot dissolution. TXA used for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage improves maternal morbidity and mortality.",
    "zh": "该患者患有产后出血(PPH)。胎盘娩出后，母体止血通常通过子宫收缩实现，收缩出血的胎盘床血管，并在原胎盘部位激活凝血途径和凝块形成。当任一机制失效时，患者可能出现PPH和危及生命的失血。因此，用于治疗PPH的药物通常会增加子宫收缩或凝块形成。\n\n胎盘娩出后，蜕膜中的促血栓形成物质(例如，组织因子)激活外源性凝血级联反应，产生凝血酶，将纤维蛋白原转化为纤维蛋白，形成纤维蛋白凝块。与此同时，纤维蛋白溶解途径也被激活：受损内皮细胞释放组织纤溶酶原激活物(t-PA)，并裂解纤溶酶原形成纤溶酶，通过将纤维蛋白凝块分解成纤维蛋白降解产物来促进出血。\n\n氨甲环酸(TXA)通过抑制纤溶酶形成来稳定血栓/凝块；因此，TXA是一种抗纤维蛋白溶解药物，为子宫肌层收缩和收缩胎盘床血管提供了更多的时间。TXA用于PPH可显著减少出血，并与改善孕产妇发病率和死亡率相关。\n\n(选项A)增加维生素K依赖性凝血因子水平是凝血酶原复合物浓缩物(PCC)的作用机制，PCC含有因子II、IX和X以及可变量的因子VII。PCC常用于逆转华法林引起的抗凝或治疗因先天性维生素K依赖性凝血因子缺乏引起的出血。\n\n(选项B和E)引起子宫肌层收缩的药物被称为宫缩剂。米索前列醇，一种合成的前列腺素类似物，诱导前列腺素介导的平滑肌收缩，但起效慢。相比之下，催产素可迅速增加子宫肌层细胞内钙水平；由于其起效迅速，它是PPH最常用的宫缩剂。\n\n(选项D)促进内皮细胞释放血管性血友病因子是去氨加压素的作用机制，它也增加血浆中因子VIII的水平。去氨加压素用于血管性血友病或轻度血友病A患者的出血。\n\n教育目标：氨甲环酸(TXA)是一种抗纤维蛋白溶解药物，可稳定出血患者的血凝块。它抑制纤溶酶的形成，从而防止纤维蛋白降解和凝块溶解。TXA用于治疗产后出血，可改善孕产妇发病率和死亡率。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the mechanism of action of tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic medication used in the management of postpartum hemorrhage. It assesses the knowledge of the fibrinolytic pathway and how tranexamic acid interferes with it to prevent clot breakdown.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify postpartum hemorrhage as a condition involving excessive bleeding due to failure of hemostasis. Recognizing tranexamic acid as an antifibrinolytic agent is key. Understanding that antifibrinolytics work by inhibiting plasmin formation, which is responsible for fibrin degradation, leads to the correct answer.",
