    "en": "A 9-year-old girl is brought to the office due to persistent nasal drainage. Over the past 2 weeks, the patient has had increasing nasal congestion and drainage. The discharge was initially clear but has become dark and foul smelling over the past few days. The patient has a history of multiple skin abscesses that developed when she was an infant, but they typically do not cause discomfort. She has also had atopic dermatitis since infancy. Temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F). On examination, the patient is interactive and talkative. Thick nasal discharge appears from both nares. Cardiopulmonary examination is normal. There are several diffuse areas of dry, excoriated skin along the trunk and upper extremities. Results of a complete blood count are as follows:\n\nHemoglobin 11 g/dL\nPlatelets 200,000/mm³\nLeukocytes 7,500/mm³",

    "en": "This patient with signs of a sinus infection (eg, thick, purulent nasal drainage) has a history of recurrent skin abscesses and chronic atopic dermatitis. Given her normal platelet count, which excludes Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, her findings are most consistent with HYPER-IgE SYNDROME (Job syndrome), an autosomal dominant, primary immunodeficiency disorder.\n\nHyper-IgE syndrome is characterized by impaired JAK-STAT signaling, leading to defective differentiation and function of T-helper cell type 17 (Th17). Th17 cells normally produce IL-17, which activates NEUTROPHILS to migrate to the site of infection. Without this cytokine, neutrophil function is impaired, causing recurrent skin and sinopulmonary infections most commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Neutrophil-induced inflammation is absent, so ABSCESSES are often nontender (ie, cold), and patients are typically afebrile with a normal leukocyte count, as opposed to the leukocytosis expected with infection.\n\nIn addition to immunodeficiency, CHRONIC ATOPIC DERMATITIS is a prominent feature of hyper-IgE syndrome and typically begins in early infancy. Colonization of S aureus and C albicans on the skin triggers mast cell histamine release, causing severe pruritus and an eczematous rash. Patients characteristically have EOSINOPHILIA and ELEVATED IgE related to the dermatitis, but other IMMUNOGLOBULIN LEVELS are usually normal. A low Th17 count supports the diagnosis, and molecular genetic testing is confirmatory.\n\n(Choice A) All immunoglobulin levels are decreased/absent in X-linked agammaglobulinemia due to impaired B-cell maturation. Severe sinopulmonary and invasive bacterial infections begin in infancy, and failure to thrive is typical. Without immunoglobulin replacement most children will have near fatal infections early in life.\n\n(Choice B) Chronic eczema without an underlying immunodeficiency can cause elevated IgE, and IgG may also be high if the rash is superinfected. However, the affected area would be erythematous and tender, unlike this patient's cold abscess, making isolated atopic disease unlikely.\n\n(Choice C) Hyper-IgM syndrome, in which immunoglobulin class-switching is impaired due to CD40 ligand deficiency, typically presents in infancy with sinopulmonary and opportunistic infections. Recurrent cold skin abscesses do not typically occur.\n\n(Choice E) Selective IgA deficiency can cause recurrent sinopulmonary infections and is associated with an increased risk for atopy. However, skin infections would not be expected.",
    "zh": "该患者表现出鼻窦感染的体征（例如，浓稠的、化脓性鼻涕引流），有反复皮肤脓肿和慢性特应性皮炎的病史。考虑到她的血小板计数正常，排除了Wiskott-Aldrich综合征，她的发现与高IgE综合征（Job综合征）最为一致，这是一种常染色体显性遗传的原发性免疫缺陷病。\n\n高IgE综合征的特征是JAK-STAT信号传导受损，导致T辅助细胞17型（Th17）的分化和功能缺陷。Th17细胞通常产生IL-17，激活中性粒细胞迁移到感染部位。如果没有这种细胞因子，中性粒细胞功能就会受损，导致反复的皮肤和鼻肺感染，最常见的是由金黄色葡萄球菌和白色念珠菌引起。中性粒细胞诱导的炎症缺失，因此脓肿通常无压痛（即冰冷），患者通常无发热，白细胞计数正常，这与感染时预期的白细胞增多症相反。\n\n除了免疫缺陷外，慢性特应性皮炎是高IgE综合征的一个突出特征，通常在婴儿早期开始。金黄色葡萄球菌和白色念珠菌在皮肤上的定植会触发肥大细胞组胺释放，引起严重的瘙痒和湿疹样皮疹。患者的特征是嗜酸性粒细胞增多和IgE升高，这与皮炎有关，但其他免疫球蛋白水平通常正常。Th17计数低支持诊断，分子遗传学检测可证实。\n\n（选项A）由于B细胞成熟受损，X连锁无丙种球蛋白血症中所有免疫球蛋白水平均降低/缺失。严重的鼻肺和侵袭性细菌感染始于婴儿期，生长迟缓是典型的。如果没有免疫球蛋白替代，大多数儿童将在生命早期患上近乎致命的感染。\n\n（选项B）没有潜在免疫缺陷的慢性湿疹可导致IgE升高，如果皮疹被继发感染，IgG也可能升高。然而，受影响的区域会发红且有压痛，这与该患者的冷脓肿不同，使得孤立的特应性疾病不太可能。\n\n（选项C）高IgM综合征，其中由于CD40配体缺乏而导致免疫球蛋白类别转换受损，通常在婴儿期表现为鼻肺和机会性感染。通常不会发生反复的冷皮肤脓肿。\n\n（选项E）选择性IgA缺乏可引起反复的鼻肺感染，并与特应性风险增加相关。然而，不应出现皮肤感染。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Hyper-IgE syndrome (Job syndrome), including its clinical presentation, underlying pathophysiology (JAK-STAT signaling, Th17 deficiency), and characteristic laboratory findings (elevated IgE, eosinophilia). It also requires differentiating this condition from other immunodeficiency disorders.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of Hyper-IgE syndrome: recurrent cold skin abscesses, chronic atopic dermatitis, and sinopulmonary infections.
