    "en": "A 2-month-old girl is brought to the office for a well-child visit. The patient was born at term with no complications. She is exclusively formula fed and gaining weight well. Examination is unremarkable today. The mother is informed that several vaccinations are due at this visit. She becomes upset and mentions that her older son, who did follow a standard vaccine schedule, had a \"bad reaction\" to his last set of shots and had a cough for weeks. She wants to defer immunizations for her daughter at this time. The mother says, \"I know you won't agree with me, but I have been reading that these reactions are actually very harmful to the immune system.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate response?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Vaccine hesitancy is the delay or refusal of immunization. Reasons typically include safety concerns, desire to express autonomy, distrust of medicine, or ethical/religious beliefs. Some parents also believe that natural infection is benign and/or the risk of infection is too low to warrant preventive measures. However, vaccination is critical on an individual and community level to decrease the incidence and severity of vaccine-preventable illness. \n\nThe first step in approaching parents who are vaccine-hesitant is to initiate an open and NONCONFRONTATIONAL dialogue. The conversation should include:\n\n*   relaying the shared goal of the parent and provider, which is the child's health and safety.\n*   acknowledging the parent's concern as well as the accessibility to vast amounts of vaccine information, both evidence-based and not, that can be overwhelming and confusing.\n*   dispelling specific misconceptions. For example, this patient's mother is concerned that vaccines can be harmful to the immune system, whereas vaccines in fact elicit an immune response to protect from future infection. In addition, some reported symptoms postvaccination (eg, prolonged cough) are often incorrectly attributed to the vaccination but are more likely secondary to a concomitant illness.\n*   explaining the risks, benefits, and limitations of vaccinations.\n\nIn this case, the first step is to establish trust by acknowledging the parent's concern and recognizing a common goal, the well-being of the child.\n\n(Choice B) Although proceeding with vaccination is the objective, this mother has expressed specific concerns that should be addressed first.\n\n(Choice C) Providing a list of evidence-based resources helps educate parents and is recommended when discussing immunizations. However, active dialogue with this parent who is vaccine-hesitant should be pursued first to discuss and correct misinformation.\n\n(Choice D) Reopening the conversation at visits after initial refusal is critical because up to half of vaccine-hesitant parents ultimately choose to vaccinate. However, every opportunity for open dialogue should be taken rather than immediately deferring the conversation to a later time.\n\n(Choice E) Discussing the risks of natural infection is essential in addressing vaccine benefits. However, this mother may perceive her fears about vaccination to be valid if the provider does not dispel her inaccurate beliefs but instead focuses only on the risks of natural infection.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe first step in approaching parents who are vaccine-hesitant is to initiate an open dialogue that begins with the shared goal of ensuring the child's health and safety. Discussion should also acknowledge parental concerns, correct misinformation, and explain the evidence-based risks and benefits of immunization.",
    "zh": "疫苗犹豫是指推迟或拒绝免疫接种。 原因通常包括安全顾虑、表达自主权的愿望、对医学的不信任或伦理/宗教信仰。 一些父母还认为自然感染是良性的，和/或感染风险太低而不足以采取预防措施。 然而，疫苗接种对于个体和社区层面都至关重要，以减少可预防疫苗疾病的发生率和严重程度。\n\n处理对疫苗犹豫不决的父母的第一步是发起公开且非对抗性的对话。 对话应包括：\n\n* 传达父母和提供者的共同目标，即孩子的健康和安全。\n* 承认父母的担忧以及大量疫苗信息的获取，包括基于证据的和非基于证据的信息，这些信息可能会让人不知所措和困惑。\n* 消除具体的误解。 例如，这位患者的母亲担心疫苗会对免疫系统造成损害，而实际上疫苗会引发免疫反应以防止未来感染。 此外，一些报告的接种后症状（例如，长期咳嗽）通常被错误地归因于疫苗接种，但更有可能是继发于伴随疾病。\n* 解释疫苗接种的风险、益处和局限性。\n\n在这种情况下，第一步是通过承认父母的担忧并认识到共同目标——孩子的福祉——来建立信任。\n\n(选项 B) 尽管接种疫苗是目标，但这位母亲表达了应该首先解决的具体担忧。\n\n(选项 C) 提供基于证据的资源列表有助于教育父母，并且在讨论免疫接种时建议这样做。 然而，应该首先与这位对疫苗犹豫不决的父母进行积极对话，以讨论和纠正错误信息。\n\n(选项 D) 在最初拒绝后在就诊时重新开始对话至关重要，因为多达一半对疫苗犹豫不决的父母最终选择了接种疫苗。 然而，应该抓住每一个公开对话的机会，而不是立即将对话推迟到以后的时间。\n\n(选项 E) 讨论自然感染的风险对于解决疫苗益处至关重要。 然而，如果提供者没有消除她对疫苗接种的不准确看法，而只是关注自然感染的风险，这位母亲可能会认为她对疫苗接种的恐惧是有效的。\n\n教育目标：\n处理对疫苗犹豫不决的父母的第一步是发起公开对话，从确保孩子的健康和安全的共同目标开始。 讨论还应承认父母的担忧，纠正错误信息，并解释基于证据的免疫接种的风险和益处。"
