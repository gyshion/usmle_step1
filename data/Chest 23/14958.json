    "en": "This patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has evidence of pulmonary hypertension complicated by right-sided heart failure. Hypoxic vasoconstriction is a physiologic mechanism unique to lung tissue that helps minimize ventilation-perfusion mismatch and increase overall gas exchange efficiency. However, sustained pulmonary vasoconstriction in advanced hypoxic lung disease (eg, COPD, interstitial lung disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome) can promote pulmonary hypertension (ie, increased right ventricular afterload).\n\nPulmonary hypertension typically presents with dyspnea and/or fatigue, and some patients may develop exertional angina or syncope due to reduced cardiac output. Physical examination can reveal left parasternal lift (due to right ventricular hypertrophy) and a loud pulmonic component of S2 due to high pulmonary artery pressure. Over time, the right ventricle may be unable to pump against the increased afterload and right-sided heart failure can develop, evidenced by jugular venous distension and prominent lower extremity edema.\n\n(Choices A, B, and D) The hemodynamic parameters in pulmonary hypertension secondary to hypoxic lung disease are similar to those in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Left ventricular preload and stroke volume (cardiac output) are decreased due to impaired pumping of blood through the lungs to the left atrium. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, an estimate of left atrial pressure and a representation of left-sided preload, is also decreased.\n\n(Choice C) Pulmonary arterial compliance decreases with pulmonary hypertension due to vascular remodeling and stiffening of the pulmonary arterial wall. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "这位患有慢性阻塞性肺病 (COPD) 的患者有肺动脉高压合并右心衰竭的证据。缺氧性血管收缩是肺组织特有的一种生理机制，有助于最大限度地减少通气-血流比例失调，并提高整体气体交换效率。然而，在晚期缺氧性肺病（如 COPD、间质性肺病、肥胖性低通气综合征）中，持续的肺血管收缩可促进肺动脉高压（即，右心室后负荷增加）。\n\n肺动脉高压通常表现为呼吸困难和/或疲劳，一些患者可能因心输出量减少而出现劳力性心绞痛或晕厥。体格检查可发现左侧胸骨旁抬举（由于右心室肥大）和 S2 的肺动脉成分响亮（由于肺动脉压力高）。随着时间的推移，右心室可能无法对抗增加的后负荷，并可能发生右心衰竭，表现为颈静脉扩张和明显的下肢水肿。\n\n（选项 A、B 和 D）缺氧性肺病继发性肺动脉高压的血流动力学参数与肺动脉高压的血流动力学参数相似。由于血液通过肺部泵入左心房受损，左心室前负荷和每搏输出量（心输出量）降低。肺毛细血管楔压是左心房压力的估计值，代表左侧前负荷，也降低。\n\n（选项 C）由于肺动脉血管壁的重塑和硬化，肺动脉顺应性随肺动脉高压而降低。{{exhibit_2}}"
