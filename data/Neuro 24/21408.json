    "en": "A 9-month-old boy is brought to the clinic by his parents for a well-child check. The mother says that he cannot roll over, sit without support, or crawl. The patient can reach for toys with his left hand but not with his right. He was born at 28 weeks gestation, and Apgar scores were 5 and 6 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The patient's birth weight was 1.2 kg (2 lb 10 oz), and he was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for 3 months. Head circumference and length are at the 50th percentile; weight is at the 15th percentile. Vital signs are normal. On examination, the patient keeps his right hand fisted shut. Muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes are increased in the right arm and leg.",

    "en": "The patient presents with delayed gross motor milestones, spastic hemiparesis (right arm fisted, unable to relax due to increased tone), hypertonia, and hyperreflexia, all concerning for cerebral palsy (CP). CP is a nonprogressive neurologic injury causing motor dysfunction. Spastic CP is the most common subtype and can affect the bilateral lower extremities (diplegia), unilateral arm and leg (hemiplegia), or all four extremities (quadriplegia). CP is more common in premature and low birthweight infants because they are susceptible to white matter loss (ie, periventricular leukomalacia) around the lateral ventricles. In contrast to term infants, in whom watershed injury of the cerebral cortex is more likely to occur with poor perfusion, premature infants have sparse vascularization of the periventricular cerebral white matter. Ischemia to this area disrupts normal myelination, leading to neuronal cell death and CYSTIC NECROSIS. In addition, prematurity is also associated with increased risk for intraventricular hemorrhage, which can further contribute to the development of CP. However, in some cases, no underlying cause is identified.\n\nDelayed gross motor milestones are often the first sign of CP in infancy, as seen in this patient (age 6 months when corrected for gestation) who cannot roll over or sit up. EARLY HAND PREFERENCE (age <1) is also common with spastic hemiplegia, as seen in this infant whose right hand remains fisted and unable to relax due to increased tone.\n\n(Choice A) Brachial plexus injuries are typically the result of birth trauma and present with arm weakness and low tone. Reflexes are usually diminished or absent in the affected upper extremity, and the lower extremities would not be affected.\n\n(Choice B) Diffuse cerebral atrophy can be seen in premature infants with cerebral palsy but would present with global neurologic deficits involving bilateral extremities. This patient's spastic hemiparesis is most likely due to a focal left-sided brain lesion.\n\n(Choice C) Holoprosencephaly is due to incomplete division of the forebrain during embryologic development. This brain abnormality can cause spasticity, but bilateral findings would be expected. In addition, a midfacial defect is typically present in these patients.\n\n(Choice D) Mesial temporal sclerosis is a characteristic MRI finding in patients with focal temporal lobe epilepsy and is not associated with CP. Moreover, the temporal lobe is responsible for sensory processing and memory formation, not motor function.\n\nEducational objective: Cerebral palsy is a nonprogressive neurologic injury that most commonly presents with delayed gross motor milestones, spasticity, and hyperreflexia. Premature infants are particularly susceptible due to periventricular leukomalacia (white matter necrosis).",
    "zh": "患者表现出 Gross motor milestones 延迟，痉挛性偏瘫（右臂紧握，由于肌张力增高而无法放松），肌张力增高和反射亢进，所有这些都与脑瘫 (CP) 相关。CP 是一种非进行性神经损伤，可引起运动功能障碍。痉挛性 CP 是最常见的亚型，可影响双下肢（双瘫）、单侧手臂和腿（偏瘫）或所有四肢（四肢瘫）。早产儿和低出生体重婴儿更容易发生 CP，因为他们容易出现侧脑室周围的白质丢失（即室周白质软化）。与足月儿相比，足月儿更容易因灌注不良而发生大脑皮质的灌注区损伤，而早产儿的室周脑白质血管化稀少。该区域的缺血会破坏正常的髓鞘形成，导致神经元死亡和囊性坏死。此外，早产也与室内出血的风险增加有关，这可能进一步促进 CP 的发展。然而，在某些情况下，无法确定根本原因。\n\nGross motor milestones 延迟通常是婴儿 CP 的第一个体征，如该患者（纠正孕龄后6个月）无法翻身或坐起。早期手偏好（<1岁）在痉挛性偏瘫中也很常见，如该婴儿，其右手仍然握拳且由于肌张力增高而无法放松。\n\n（选项 A）臂丛神经损伤通常是产伤的结果，表现为手臂无力和肌张力低下。受影响的上肢反射通常减弱或缺失，并且下肢不会受到影响。\n\n（选项 B）弥漫性脑萎缩可见于患有脑瘫的早产儿，但会出现涉及双侧肢体的全身性神经功能缺损。该患者的痉挛性偏瘫很可能由于局灶性左侧脑病变所致。\n\n（选项 C）前脑无裂畸形是由于胚胎发育过程中前脑分裂不完全所致。这种脑部异常可引起痉挛，但预计会出现双侧表现。此外，这些患者通常存在面中部缺陷。\n\n（选项 D）内侧颞叶硬化是局灶性颞叶癫痫患者的特征性 MRI 表现，与 CP 无关。此外，颞叶负责感觉处理和记忆形成，而不是运动功能。\n\n教育目标：脑瘫是一种非进行性神经损伤，最常表现为 gross motor milestones 延迟、痉挛和反射亢进。早产儿特别容易受到室周白质软化（白质坏死）的影响。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of cerebral palsy, its risk factors, clinical presentation, and common etiologies in premature infants. It requires differentiating CP from other neurological conditions that can present with motor deficits in infancy.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the key clinical features suggestive of cerebral palsy, such as delayed motor milestones, abnormal tone, and hyperreflexia, and then correlating these findings with the patient's history of prematurity and low birth weight to infer the most likely underlying cause, which is periventricular white matter injury.",
