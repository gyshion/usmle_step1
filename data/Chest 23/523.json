    "en": "This patient's presentation is concerning for Loeffler syndrome, a transient eosinophilic pneumonitis (eg, dry cough, dyspnea, wheezing) caused by migration of parasitic roundworm larva (eg, Ascaris suum from pigs) through the lungs. His peripheral smear {{exhibit_2}} shows numerous erythrocytes and a few scattered platelets accompanied by 2 larger cells with bilobed nuclei and eosinophilic granules; the 2 larger cells are eosinophils.\n\nEosinophils play a prominent role in allergic disease (eg, asthma, drug reactions) and in defense against parasitic infection. MAJOR BASIC PROTEIN is the predominant substance contained within eosinophilic granules, and it acts as a potent toxin against helminths (parasitic worms). Release of major basic protein by eosinophils causes damage to epithelial and endothelial cells and is a major mechanism of chronic lung damage in certain pulmonary conditions (eg, asthma, Ascaris infection).\n\n(Choice A) Plasma cells produce antibodies that opsonize bacteria to facilitate phagocytosis.\n\n(Choice C) Pattern recognition receptors (eg, dectin-1) on phagocytic cells allow for detection and destruction of fungi by the innate immune system.\n\n(Choice D) Virus-infected cells typically lack MHC class I proteins on their surface; these are identified and killed by natural killer cells.\n\n(Choice E) Macrophages secrete transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which stimulates fibroblasts to release collagen and form scar tissue.\n\nEducational objective:\nEosinophils have bilobed nuclei and numerous eosinophilic granules in the cytoplasm and are important in allergic disease and defense against parasitic infection. The eosinophilic granules predominantly contain major basic protein, which acts as a potent antihelminthic toxin. Major basic protein also damages epithelial and endothelial cells and is a major cause of chronic lung damage in asthma. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of eosinophil function, particularly in the context of parasitic infections and allergic reactions. It requires recognizing the clinical scenario of Loeffler syndrome and identifying eosinophils on a peripheral blood smear.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's risk factors (pig farming) and symptoms (cough, wheezing) suggestive of parasitic infection. Identify the cells on the smear as eosinophils based on their bilobed nuclei and granules, and recall their primary function in destroying helminths through major basic protein.",
