  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's grandiose ideas about his special mission, impulsive risk-taking behavior, and decreased need for sleep lasting >= 1 week are suggestive of a manic episode consistent with bipolar I disorder. Other features of mania include elevated/euphoric/irritable mood, increased energy, and hyperactivity. Increased production, volume, and rate of speech (ie, pressured speech) and a sense that one's thoughts are moving very quickly (ie, racing thoughts) are also common. Diagnosis of bipolar I disorder requires >= 1 manic episode, although most bipolar patients will experience both major depressive and manic episodes in their lifetime. Manic episodes can occur with or without psychotic features (eg, delusions, hallucinations). Pharmacotherapy for acute mania includes mood stabilizers such as lithium and valproate and second-generation antipsychotics (eg, risperidone).\n\n(Choices A, C, and G) Flat affect (ie, reduced emotional expressiveness), decreased attention to personal hygiene, and thought blocking (ie, sudden inability to finish a thought) are findings typical of schizophrenia. In contrast, patients with bipolar disorder exhibit intense and labile affect, increased thought productivity, and pressured speech. These patients may wear garish clothing and makeup but typically do not neglect their hygiene.\n\n(Choices B, E, and F) Low self-esteem, psychomotor slowing (ie, slow speech and movements), and social withdrawal are more typical of a major depressive episode. In a manic episode, patients are typically grandiose or overconfident, physically restless and hyperactive, and expansive (eg, overly friendly and eager to talk to strangers).\n\nEducational objective:\nManic episodes are characterized by euphoric/irritable mood, impulsivity, hyperactivity, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, racing thoughts, and grandiosity. They may occur with or without psychotic features.",
    "zh": "该患者对其特殊使命的夸大想法、冲动冒险行为以及睡眠需求减少（持续>=1周）提示躁狂发作，这与双相情感障碍I型一致。躁狂的其他特征包括情绪高涨/欣快/易怒、精力增加和活动过度。言语产量、音量和语速增加（即语速加快）以及感觉思维飞快（即思维奔逸）也很常见。双相情感障碍I型的诊断需要>=1次躁狂发作，尽管大多数双相情感障碍患者在其一生中会经历重度抑郁发作和躁狂发作。躁狂发作可能伴有或不伴有精神病性特征（例如，妄想、幻觉）。急性躁狂的药物治疗包括情绪稳定剂，如锂盐和丙戊酸盐，以及第二代抗精神病药（例如，利培酮）。\n\n（选项A、C和G）情感淡漠（即，情绪表达减少）、对个人卫生关注减少和思维阻滞（即，突然无法完成一个想法）是精神分裂症的典型表现。相比之下，双相情感障碍患者表现出强烈且不稳定的情感、增加的思维产生力和语速加快。这些患者可能穿着艳丽的衣服和化妆品，但通常不会忽视他们的个人卫生。\n\n（选项B、E和F）低自尊、精神运动迟缓（即，言语和动作缓慢）和社会退缩更像是重度抑郁发作的典型表现。在躁狂发作中，患者通常表现出夸大或过度自信、身体烦躁和活动过度以及外向（例如，过度友好且渴望与陌生人交谈）。\n\n教育目标：\n躁狂发作的特征是欣快/易怒情绪、冲动、活动过度、睡眠需求减少、语速加快、思维奔逸和夸大。它们可能伴有或不伴有精神病性特征。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical features of a manic episode, a core component of bipolar I disorder. It requires differentiating manic symptoms from those of other psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia and major depressive disorder.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully analyze the patient's reported behaviors and the roommate's observations, identifying key symptoms that align with the diagnostic criteria for mania. The process involves recognizing grandiose ideation, impulsivity, decreased need for sleep, and pressured speech, while ruling out features of other disorders.",
