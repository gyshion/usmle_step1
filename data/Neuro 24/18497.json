    "en": "A 72-year-old woman is brought to the office due to forgetfulness. Her family has noticed that the patient quickly forgets conversations and misplaces household items. The symptoms have progressively worsened over the past 2-3 years. A month ago, the patient became lost while driving in the neighborhood where she has lived most of her adult life. She has no significant medical history, and her only medication is a daily multivitamin. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs and lives with her son and his wife. Vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient has a short-term memory deficit with no other significant neurologic findings. After discussion, an oral cholinesterase inhibitor is prescribed.",

    "en": "This elderly patient presents with insidious onset of forgetfulness, misplacing objects, and getting lost, which are suggestive of ALZHEIMER DISEASE (AD). The degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain contributes to memory loss and executive dysfunction characteristic of AD. CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS (eg, donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) are used to treat AD by blocking acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft, thereby increasing acetylcholine levels and compensating for the loss of cholinergic transmission. Although these medications provide MODEST SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT in cognition and daily functioning, they DO NOT enhance neuron survival or alter the overall trajectory of the disease. Therefore, they are not considered NEUROPROTECTIVE and do not slow disease progression.\n\n(A) Neuroprotective agents, such as NMDA receptor antagonists (eg, memantine), inhibit glutamate NMDA signaling to prevent excitotoxicity and subsequent neuronal apoptosis, which may slow disease progression. Cholinesterase inhibitors do not have this effect.\n\n(B) This option accurately describes the primary benefit of cholinesterase inhibitors in AD: symptomatic improvement in cognitive function and daily living activities without altering the underlying disease course.\n\n(C) Cholinesterase inhibitors do provide symptomatic improvement in cognitive performance, so this option is incorrect.\n\n(D) Neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to reorganize, is most prominent in childhood. While reduced neuroplasticity is implicated in various neuropsychiatric conditions, current medications for AD cannot enhance neuroplasticity.\n\n(E) While placebo effects can contribute to perceived improvement, cholinesterase inhibitors have demonstrated statistically significant benefits beyond placebo in improving cognition and daily functioning in patients with AD.\n\nKEY PEARLS:\n- Cholinesterase inhibitors improve SYMPTOMS of Alzheimer disease but do NOT alter disease progression.\n- NMDA receptor antagonists may have NEUROPROTECTIVE effects and slow disease progression.",
    "zh": "这位老年患者表现出隐匿起病的健忘、放错物品和迷路，这些提示患有阿尔茨海默病 (AD)。基底前脑胆碱能神经元的变性导致AD的特征性记忆力丧失和执行功能障碍。胆碱酯酶抑制剂（如多奈哌齐、利斯的明、加兰他敏）通过阻断突触间隙中的乙酰胆碱酯酶来治疗AD，从而增加乙酰胆碱水平并代偿胆碱能神经传递的丧失。尽管这些药物在认知和日常功能方面提供了适度的症状改善，但它们并不能增强神经元的存活或改变疾病的整体轨迹。因此，它们不被认为是神经保护剂，也不会延缓疾病进展。\n\n(A) 神经保护剂，如 NMDA 受体拮抗剂（如美金刚），可抑制谷氨酸 NMDA 信号传导，以防止兴奋性毒性和随后的神经元凋亡，这可能会延缓疾病进展。胆碱酯酶抑制剂没有这种作用。\n\n(B) 这个选项准确地描述了胆碱酯酶抑制剂在 AD 中的主要益处：改善认知功能和日常生活活动的症状，而不会改变潜在的疾病进程。\n\n(C) 胆碱酯酶抑制剂确实提供了认知表现的症状改善，因此此选项不正确。\n\n(D) 神经可塑性，即大脑的重组能力，在儿童时期最为突出。虽然神经可塑性降低与各种神经精神疾病有关，但目前治疗 AD 的药物不能增强神经可塑性。\n\n(E) 虽然安慰剂效应可能会促成感知到的改善，但胆碱酯酶抑制剂已证明在改善 AD 患者的认知和日常功能方面具有统计学上的显著益处，超越了安慰剂效应。\n\n关键要点：\n- 胆碱酯酶抑制剂可改善阿尔茨海默病的症状，但不能改变疾病的进展。\n- NMDA 受体拮抗剂可能具有神经保护作用，并可延缓疾病进展。"

It specifically assesses the ability to differentiate between symptomatic improvement and disease-modifying effects.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the likely diagnosis based on the clinical vignette (Alzheimer disease). Recall the pharmacologic class of the prescribed medication (cholinesterase inhibitor) and its known effects on the disease pathophysiology and clinical presentation. Evaluate each option based on whether it aligns with the established benefits and limitations of cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer disease.",
