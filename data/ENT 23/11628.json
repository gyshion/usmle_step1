    "en": "A 48-year-old woman comes to the office due to an intermittent ear discharge over the last 2 years. She has also noticed decreased hearing in the right ear recently. Past medical history is significant for obesity, hyperlipidemia, seasonal allergies, and diet-controlled diabetes mellitus. Otoscopy shows a small perforation in the right tympanic membrane and a pearly mass behind the membrane. Conduction hearing loss is noted in the right ear. The remainder of the ear, nose, and throat examination is normal.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Cholesteatomas are collections of squamous cell debris that form a round, pearly mass behind the tympanic membrane in the middle ear. They can occur congenitally or may develop in adults as either an acquired primary lesion or secondary to infection, trauma, or surgery of the middle ear. Primary cholesteatomas are a result of chronic negative pressure in the middle ear causing retraction pockets in the tympanic membrane that become cystic; as the squamous cell debris accumulates, a cholesteatoma is formed. Secondary cholesteatomas occur after squamous epithelium migrates to or is implanted in the middle ear (\"skin in the wrong place\").\n\nCholesteatomas most commonly cause painless otorrhea. They also can produce lytic enzymes and are often discovered when they erode through the auditory ossicles, causing conductive hearing loss. If a mass grows sufficiently large, it can erode into the vestibular apparatus or facial nerve, causing vertigo or facial palsies.\n\n(Choice A) Cholesterol granulomas can form in the middle ear after hemorrhage but are much less common than cholesteatomas. They appear as bluish-black gelatinous material behind the tympanic membrane. Despite what the name implies, cholesteatomas do not contain any lipid or cholesterol components.\n\n(Choice B) A facial nerve neuroma can grow in the middle ear as the facial nerve courses through this territory. However, it would present with unilateral facial paralysis.\n\n(Choice C) Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the ear canal. It typically appears as an ulcerated plaque or nodule. The most common symptom is local or regional pain.\n\n(Choice D) Granulomatous disease of the ear can occur but is uncommon and usually develops in conjunction with a systemic disease, such as sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or Langerhans cell histiocytosis.\n\nEducational objective:\nCholesteatomas are collections of squamous cell debris that form a mass behind the tympanic membrane. Cholesteatomas can be congenital or may occur as an acquired primary lesion or following infection, trauma, or surgery of the middle ear. They can cause hearing loss due to erosion into auditory ossicles.",
    "zh": "胆脂瘤是鳞状细胞碎片的集合，在鼓膜后方的中耳中形成圆形、珍珠状肿块。它们可以先天发生，也可以在成人中发展，作为获得性原发性病变或继发于中耳感染、外伤或手术。原发性胆脂瘤是中耳慢性负压的结果，导致鼓膜内陷袋形成囊肿；随着鳞状细胞碎片的积累，形成胆脂瘤。继发性胆脂瘤发生在鳞状上皮迁移到中耳或植入中耳后（“皮肤在错误的地方”）。\n\n胆脂瘤最常引起无痛性耳溢。它们还可以产生溶性酶，并且通常在它们侵蚀听骨时被发现，导致传导性听力损失。如果肿块生长到足够大，它会侵蚀到前庭装置或面神经，引起眩晕或面瘫。\n\n（选项 A）胆固醇肉芽肿可在出血后在中耳形成，但远不如胆脂瘤常见。它们表现为鼓膜后方的蓝黑色胶状物质。尽管名称如此，但胆脂瘤不含任何脂质或胆固醇成分。\n\n（选项 B）面神经神经鞘瘤可以在面神经穿过该区域时在中耳生长。然而，它将表现为单侧面部麻痹。\n\n（选项 C）鳞状细胞癌是耳道最常见的恶性肿瘤。它通常表现为溃疡性斑块或结节。最常见的症状是局部或区域性疼痛。\n\n（选项 D）耳部的肉芽肿性疾病可以发生，但很少见，并且通常与全身性疾病有关，例如结节病、伴有血管炎的肉芽肿病或朗格汉斯细胞组织细胞增生症。\n\n教育目标：\n胆脂瘤是鳞状细胞碎片的集合，在鼓膜后方形成肿块。胆脂瘤可以是先天性的，也可以作为获得性原发性病变或在中耳感染、外伤或手术后发生。它们可能由于侵蚀听骨而导致听力损失。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cholesteatoma presentation, including risk factors, clinical findings, and pathophysiology. It also tests the ability to differentiate cholesteatoma from other causes of aural masses.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key findings of intermittent ear discharge, decreased hearing, pearly mass behind the tympanic membrane, and conductive hearing loss. These findings are highly suggestive of a cholesteatoma.",
