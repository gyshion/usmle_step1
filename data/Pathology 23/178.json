    "en": "A 65-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to acute-onset, severe right flank pain; nausea; and vomiting for the past hour. His medical conditions include prostate cancer and membranous nephropathy. Blood pressure is 148/60 mm Hg and pulse is 95/min. On physical examination, the patient appears to be in moderate distress due to pain and is diaphoretic. There is right costovertebral angle tenderness. Urinalysis shows hematuria. Contrast-enhanced CT scan reveals a wedge-shaped perfusion defect in the right kidney. The affected renal tissue is most likely to develop which of the following histologic changes over the next several days?",

    "en": "This patient presents with acute flank pain, hematuria, and a wedge-shaped perfusion defect in the kidney on CT scan, highly suggestive of ACUTE RENAL INFARCTION, likely due to a THROMBOEMBOLIC event given his history of prostate cancer (a hypercoagulable state) and membranous nephropathy. Renal infarction is a form of IRREVERSIBLE ISCHEMIC INJURY outside the CNS. In most organs, including the kidney, irreversible ischemic injury typically results in COAGULATIVE NECROSIS (Choice B). In coagulative necrosis, the cellular architecture is preserved due to denaturation of cellular proteins by enzymes, but the nuclei are lost. The necrotic tissue appears eosinophilic on histology.\n\n(Choice A) Caseous necrosis is characteristic of MYCOBACTERIAL infections (eg, tuberculosis) and fungal infections. It appears \"cheeselike\" and is composed of fragmented cells and amorphous proteinaceous debris, surrounded by granulomatous inflammation. This is not typical for renal infarction.\n\n(Choice C) Fat necrosis occurs in adipose tissue, typically due to acute pancreatitis or trauma. It involves the breakdown of triglycerides by lipases, leading to the formation of fatty acids that combine with calcium to form \"chalky white\" deposits (saponification). This is not the primary pattern of necrosis in renal infarction.\n\n(Choice D) Fibrinoid necrosis is seen in the walls of blood vessels affected by vasculitis or malignant hypertension. It is characterized by the deposition of eosinophilic, proteinaceous material (fibrin) within the vessel wall, leading to damage and leakage.\n\n(Choice E) Liquefactive necrosis is characterized by the digestion of tissue by hydrolytic enzymes, resulting in a viscous fluid or pus. This pattern is typical of bacterial infections (eg, abscesses) and CNS infarcts (eg, stroke), where the brain's high lipid content and enzymatic activity favor liquefaction. While some liquefaction may occur secondarily in an infarct, the primary pattern of necrosis in the kidney is coagulative.\n\n(Choice F) Tissue calcification is a secondary phenomenon that can occur in areas of necrosis over time as calcium salts deposit in the necrotic tissue. It is not the primary histologic change that develops immediately after the ischemic event.\n\nKey Pearls:\n- Renal infarcts typically undergo COAGULATIVE NECROSIS.\n- Liquefactive necrosis is characteristic of CNS infarcts and bacterial infections.\n- Caseous necrosis is associated with tuberculosis.\n- Fat necrosis occurs in adipose tissue.",
    "zh": "该患者出现急性腰痛、血尿，以及CT扫描显示肾脏楔形灌注缺损，高度提示急性肾梗死，这很可能是由于血栓栓塞事件引起的，考虑到他的前列腺癌病史（高凝状态）和膜性肾病。肾梗死是中枢神经系统外的一种不可逆缺血性损伤。在大多数器官（包括肾脏）中，不可逆的缺血性损伤通常会导致凝固性坏死（选项B）。在凝固性坏死中，由于酶使细胞蛋白质变性，细胞结构得以保留，但细胞核会丢失。坏死组织在组织学上呈嗜酸性。\n\n（选项A）干酪样坏死是分枝杆菌感染（例如，结核病）和真菌感染的特征。它呈现“奶酪状”，由碎片状的细胞和无定形蛋白质性碎屑组成，周围有肉芽肿性炎症。这并非肾梗死的典型特征。\n\n（选项C）脂肪坏死发生在脂肪组织中，通常是由于急性胰腺炎或外伤引起的。它涉及脂肪酶分解甘油三酯，导致形成与钙结合形成“粉笔状白色”沉积物（皂化）的脂肪酸。这并非肾梗死的主要坏死模式。\n\n（选项D）纤维素样坏死见于受血管炎或恶性高血压影响的血管壁。其特征是在血管壁内沉积嗜酸性蛋白质物质（纤维蛋白），导致损伤和渗漏。\n\n（选项E）液化性坏死的特征是组织被水解酶消化，导致形成粘稠液体或脓液。这种模式是细菌感染（例如，脓肿）和中枢神经系统梗死（例如，卒中）的典型特征，其中大脑的高脂质含量和酶活性有利于液化。虽然在梗死中可能会继发发生一些液化，但肾脏的主要坏死模式是凝固性坏死。\n\n（选项F）组织钙化是一种继发现象，随着时间的推移，钙盐沉积在坏死组织中，会发生在坏死区域。它不是在缺血事件发生后立即出现的主要组织学改变。\n\n关键要点：\n- 肾梗死通常会发生凝固性坏死。\n- 液化性坏死是中枢神经系统梗死和细菌感染的特征。\n- 干酪样坏死与结核病有关。\n- 脂肪坏死发生在脂肪组织中。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of different patterns of tissue necrosis and their etiologies, specifically in the context of renal infarction. It requires correlating clinical presentation and imaging findings with the expected microscopic changes in the affected tissue.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the most likely cause of tissue damage (renal infarction due to ischemia) and recall the characteristic pattern of necrosis associated with ischemic injury in solid organs like the kidney. Differentiate this from patterns seen in infections or other specific etiologies.",
