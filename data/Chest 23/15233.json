    "en": "This patient's presentation with progressive shortness of breath, significant smoking history, and hyperinflation on chest x-ray {{exhibit_2}} (flattened diaphragm, narrowed mediastinum) is consistent with CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD).\n\nCOPD causes air trapping and hyperinflation of the lungs, so these patients breathe at higher baseline lung volumes (higher functional residual capacity). The volume of air in the lungs that is not respired, the RESIDUAL VOLUME (RV), is substantially increased. The TOTAL LUNG CAPACITY (TLC) increases as well, but to a lesser extent than RV. Therefore, the fraction of air in the lungs that is not involved in respiration, the RV/TLC ratio, is also increased. A high RV/TLC ratio correlates with poor outcomes in patients with COPD.\n\n(Choice A) Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is decreased in COPD due to emphysematous destruction of the alveolar-arterial membrane.\n\n(Choices B, C, and D) Both forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) are decreased in COPD due to airway obstruction. Because FEV1 is decreased more than FVC, the FEV1/FVC ratio is also decreased (<0.7 in COPD).\n\nEducational objective:\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease causes air trapping and hyperinflation: consequently, these patients breathe at higher baseline lung volumes (higher functional residual capacity). The volume of air in the lungs that is not respired (residual volume) increases substantially, as does the fraction of air in the lungs that is not involved in respiration (residual volume/total lung capacity ratio).",
    "zh": "该患者表现为进行性呼吸困难、有吸烟史，胸片显示肺过度充气{{exhibit_2}}（膈肌变平、纵隔变窄），与慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD）一致。\n\nCOPD导致气道阻塞和肺过度充气，因此这些患者的呼吸基线肺容积更高（功能残气量更高）。肺中未参与呼吸的空气量，即残气量（RV），显著增加。肺总量（TLC）也会增加，但程度低于RV。因此，肺中未参与呼吸的空气分数，即RV/TLC比值，也会增加。RV/TLC比值高与COPD患者的不良预后相关。\n\n（选项A）COPD中，由于肺泡-动脉膜的肺气肿破坏，肺一氧化碳弥散量（DLCO）降低。\n\n（选项B、C和D）由于气道阻塞，COPD患者的用力肺活量（FVC）和第一秒用力呼气量（FEV1）均降低。由于FEV1的降低幅度大于FVC，FEV1/FVC比值也降低（COPD中<0.7）。\n\n教学目标：\n慢性阻塞性肺病导致气道阻塞和肺过度充气：因此，这些患者的呼吸基线肺容积更高（功能残气量更高）。肺中未参与呼吸的空气量（残气量）显著增加，肺中未参与呼吸的空气分数（残气量/肺总量比值）也是如此。"
