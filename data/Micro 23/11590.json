    "en": "A 43-year-old man comes to the office after a recent hospitalization for *Pneumocystis* pneumonia. The patient is taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and says that his pulmonary symptoms are better. He has a history of HIV and was on highly active antiretroviral therapy until self-discontinuing treatment 2 years ago. On physical examination, the patient appears to be in no acute distress. BMI is 20 kg/m². A few crackles are heard at the lung bases. His most recent CD4 count is 122/mm³. After discussing the need to resume antiretroviral therapy, HIV genotyping assay is performed. Additional testing for the HLA-B*57:01 allele yields positive results. Which of the following medications is contraindicated in this patient due to the risk of a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction?",
    "zh": "一名43岁男性因近期因肺孢子虫肺炎住院后前来就诊。患者正在服用复方磺胺甲噁唑，并表示其肺部症状有所好转。他有HIV病史，并在2年前自行停止了高效抗逆转录病毒治疗。体格检查显示患者无急性痛苦表现。BMI为20 kg/m²。在肺底部可听到少量啰音。他最近的CD4计数为122/mm³。在讨论恢复抗逆转录病毒治疗的必要性后，进行了HIV基因分型检测。HLA-B*57:01等位基因的附加检测结果呈阳性。由于存在潜在的致命性超敏反应风险，下列哪种药物不适用于该患者？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS that can provoke a hypersensitivity reaction in up to 8% of patients. Abacavir hypersensitivity is strongly associated with the HLA-B*57:01 allele of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system; abacavir interacts with the peptide binding groove of the HLA-B*57:01 protein, which alters the presentation of self-peptides to the immune system and results in a delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity reaction.\n\nManifestations are mediated by a cytotoxic T-cell response and typically include fever, malaise, gastrointestinal symptoms, and a delayed rash. Abacavir discontinuation results in rapid improvement. A negative test for the HLA-B*57:01 allele has almost a 100% negative predictive value for AHR. Therefore, genetic testing is usually done prior to administering the medication.\n\n(Choice B) Common side effects of protease inhibitors such as darunavir include metabolic abnormalities (hyperglycemia), gastrointestinal symptoms, and lipodystrophy.\n\n(Choices C and E) The non-NRTIs efavirenz and nevirapine may cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, but these conditions are not associated with HLA alleles. Liver function abnormalities can also occur with these 2 non-NRTIs.\n\n(Choice D) Emtricitabine, another NRTI, has been associated with an asymptomatic macular rash on the palms or soles; no genetic basis for this reaction has been identified.",
    "zh": "阿巴卡韦是一种用于治疗HIV/AIDS的核苷类逆转录酶抑制剂（NRTI），可引起高达8%的患者发生超敏反应。阿巴卡韦超敏反应与人白细胞抗原（HLA）系统的HLA-B*57:01等位基因密切相关；阿巴卡韦与HLA-B*57:01蛋白的肽结合槽相互作用，从而改变了自身肽向免疫系统的呈递，导致迟发型（IV型）超敏反应。\n\n表现由细胞毒性T细胞反应介导，通常包括发热、不适、胃肠道症状和迟发性皮疹。停用阿巴卡韦可迅速改善。HLA-B*57:01等位基因阴性检测对于AHR的阴性预测值接近100%。因此，通常在给药前进行基因检测。\n\n（选项B）蛋白酶抑制剂（如达芦那韦）的常见副作用包括代谢异常（高血糖）、胃肠道症状和脂肪营养不良。\n\n（选项C和E）非核苷类逆转录酶抑制剂依非韦伦和奈韦拉平可引起史蒂文斯-约翰逊综合征和中毒性表皮坏死松解症，但这些情况与HLA等位基因无关。这些非核苷类逆转录酶抑制剂也可能发生肝功能异常。\n\n（选项D）恩曲他滨是另一种NRTI，与手掌或足底无症状性斑丘疹相关；尚未确定这种反应的遗传基础。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction and its association with the HLA-B*57:01 allele. It also tests understanding of contraindications for antiretroviral medications in HIV-positive patients.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's risk factors (HIV, positive HLA-B*57:01) and identify the medication with a known association to hypersensitivity reactions linked to that allele. Rule out other medications based on their different side effect profiles.",
    "zh": "本题考察对阿巴卡韦超敏反应及其与HLA-B*57:01等位基因相关性的了解。同时也考察对HIV阳性患者抗逆转录病毒药物禁忌症的理解。\n\n解决此问题，需要识别患者的危险因素（HIV、HLA-B*57:01阳性），并确定与该等位基因相关的超敏反应相关的药物。根据其他药物不同的副作用特征排除其他药物。"
