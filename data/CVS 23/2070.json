He also reports abdominal distension and decreased appetite. The patient has gained 4.5 kg (9.9 lb) over the last 2 months. Medical history is significant for hypertension and recurrent lung infections requiring prolonged antibiotic therapy. The patient has no history of coronary artery disease. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 15 years. The patient undergoes noninvasive cardiac testing, followed by cardiac catheterization. A jugular venous pressure tracing is shown in the image below: {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "The jugular venous pulsation (JVP) waveform is representative of pressure changes in the right atrium throughout the cardiac cycle; the normal waveform consists of 3 peaks (A, C, and V) and 2 descents (x and y).\n\nThe A wave is caused by atrial contraction at the end of right ventricular diastole, which occurs just before tricuspid valve closure (indicated by S1). (Choice D) The C wave then occurs due to right ventricular contraction (Choice C) against a closed tricuspid valve, which bulges into the right atrium. There is an ensuing decrease in pressure (x descent) as the emptied right atrium relaxes, followed by an uptrend as the right atrium refills with blood from the vena cava. This uptrend culminates in the V wave at the peak of right atrial filling. The pulmonic valve closes (indicated by S2) and the tricuspid valve opens (Choice E) to mark the beginning of passive right atrial emptying into the right ventricle (y descent).\n\nThe A wave is absent in patients with atrial fibrillation because no organized atrial contraction takes place.\n\n(Choice B) Pressure changes in the systemic arterial circulation (eg, carotid pulse upstroke) are not represented on the JVP waveform. However, because both the right ventricle and the left ventricle contract simultaneously, the carotid pulse upstroke should occur right around the time of the C wave on the JVP waveform. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "颈静脉搏动 (JVP) 波形代表整个心动周期中右心房的压力变化；正常波形由 3 个峰（A、C 和 V）和 2 个下降（x 和 y）组成。\n\nA 波是由心房收缩引起的，发生在右心室舒张末期，就在三尖瓣关闭（由 S1 指示）之前。（选项 D）然后，由于右心室收缩（选项 C）对抗闭合的三尖瓣，三尖瓣膨胀进入右心房，出现 C 波。随着排空的右心房松弛，压力随之下降（x 下降），随后随着右心房从腔静脉重新充盈血液而上升。这种上升趋势在右心房充盈的峰值时达到 V 波。肺动脉瓣关闭（由 S2 指示），三尖瓣打开（选项 E），标志着被动右心房排空进入右心室的开始（y 下降）。\n\n患有心房颤动（房颤）的患者不存在 A 波，因为没有有组织的心房收缩发生。\n\n（选项 B）全身动脉循环中的压力变化（例如，颈动脉搏动上升）未在 JVP 波形上显示。然而，由于右心室和左心室同时收缩，颈动脉搏动上升应该发生在 JVP 波形上的 C 波附近。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the jugular venous pressure (JVP) waveform and its components, specifically the A wave, which represents atrial contraction. It requires understanding the cardiac cycle and how it relates to the JVP waveform.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the A wave on the JVP corresponds to atrial contraction.
