    "en": "This younger patient with abdominal pain, heme-positive stool, and noncaseating granulomas (NCGs, pictured in {{exhibit_2}}) on microscopy has Crohn disease (CD). CD is an inflammatory bowel disease that can cause patchy inflammation throughout the gastrointestinal tract, interspersed with areas of normal bowel ({{exhibit_3}}). NCGs are often seen in CD and are considered a hallmark of the disease. NCGs are characterized by an accumulation of epithelioid macrophages that frequently form multinucleated giant cells without central necrosis (noncaseating), surrounded by a cuff of lymphocytes. Granulomas are formed in an attempt to wall off an offending agent; in the case of CD, this is likely due to an unregulated immune response to gut flora or self-antigens. They can be found in {{exhibit_4}} any layer of the intestinal wall, and may also be present in other tissues such as the lymph nodes and skin. Other characteristic histopathologic findings in CD include inflammation involving the entire thickness of the intestinal wall ({{exhibit_5}} transmural inflammation), distortion of normal mucosal architecture, and Paneth cell metaplasia. (Choice A) Acute appendicitis presents with periumbilical or right lower quadrant pain and fever. Microscopy shows a dense neutrophilic infiltrate and necrosis of the appendix. (Choice B) Collagenous (microscopic) colitis typically presents with frequent diarrhea in older women and histology demonstrates thickening of the subepithelial collagen band. (Choice D) Ischemic colitis is most common in older patients and presents with abdominal pain and bleeding; microscopy shows necrosis, thrombus formation, and hemorrhage. (Choice E) Pseudomembranous colitis is due to Clostridioides difficile infection and presents with watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. Microscopy shows mucopurulent exudates composed of fibrin, bacteria, and neutrophils. (Choice F) Ulcerative colitis is another cause of inflammatory bowel disease; histology demonstrates a continuous superficial inflammation affecting the mucosa and submucosa with crypt abscesses (neutrophil collections within glandular lumen) and crypt atrophy. Granulomas do not occur. {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}",
    "zh": "这位出现腹痛、大便潜血试验阳性，且镜下可见非干酪性肉芽肿（NCGs，见{{exhibit_2}}）的年轻患者患有克罗恩病（CD）。CD是一种炎症性肠病，可引起整个胃肠道的斑片状炎症，并散布正常肠道区域（{{exhibit_3}}）。NCGs常在CD中出现，被认为是该疾病的标志。NCGs的特征是上皮样巨噬细胞的聚集，这些巨噬细胞经常形成无中心坏死（非干酪性）的多核巨细胞，周围环绕着淋巴细胞。肉芽肿的形成是为了隔离有害物质；在CD的情况下，这很可能是由于对肠道菌群或自身抗原的免疫反应失调所致。它们可以在{{exhibit_4}}肠壁的任何层中发现，也可能存在于其他组织中，如淋巴结和皮肤。CD的其他特征性组织病理学发现包括涉及整个肠壁厚度的炎症（{{exhibit_5}}全层炎症）、正常黏膜结构的扭曲以及潘氏细胞化生。（选项A）急性阑尾炎表现为脐周或右下腹疼痛和发热。镜下显示阑尾有密集的嗜中性粒细胞浸润和坏死。（选项B）胶原性（镜下）结肠炎通常表现为老年女性频繁腹泻，组织学显示上皮下胶原带增厚。（选项D）缺血性结肠炎最常见于老年患者，表现为腹痛和出血；镜下显示坏死、血栓形成和出血。（选项E）假膜性结肠炎是由于艰难梭菌感染引起的，表现为水样腹泻、腹痛和发热。镜下显示由纤维蛋白、细菌和中性粒细胞组成的黏液脓性渗出物。（选项F）溃疡性结肠炎是炎症性肠病的另一种病因；组织学显示影响黏膜和黏膜下层的持续性浅表炎症，伴有隐窝脓肿（腺腔内的中性粒细胞聚集）和隐窝萎缩。不发生肉芽肿。{{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}"
