    "en": "A 43-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to a 3-day history of persistent headaches. The patient has a history of hypertension and has had poor medical follow-up. Blood pressure is 224/115 mm Hg and pulse is 67/min. He appears mildly confused during the physical examination, but no focal neurologic deficits are noted. Funduscopic examination shows bilateral papilledema. Serum creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL. An intravenous medication is initiated that causes arteriolar dilation while also improving renal perfusion and increasing natriuresis.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has severe hypertension. In addition, he has clinical evidence of secondary end-organ damage, including encephalopathy (eg, confusion), papilledema, and acute kidney injury (eg, elevated creatinine). This presentation is consistent with hypertensive emergency and requires aggressive treatment with immediate but controlled blood pressure reduction to minimize organ damage. Intravenous agents are preferred in hypertensive emergency due to their rapid action and dose titration ability.\n\nFenoldopam is a short-acting, selective, peripheral dopamine-1 receptor agonist with little to no effect on alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors. Dopamine-1 receptor stimulation activates adenylyl cyclase and raises intracellular cyclic AMP, resulting in vasodilation of most arterial beds with a corresponding decrease in systemic blood pressure. Renal vasodilation is particularly prominent and leads to increased renal perfusion, increased urine output, and natriuresis (ie, sodium excretion). This makes fenoldopam especially beneficial in patients with hypertensive emergency and renal insufficiency.\n\n(Choice A) Esmolol is a short-acting, cardioselective beta-1 receptor antagonist. It works by reducing heart rate and myocardial contractility. Esmolol is not a vasodilator and does not increase renal perfusion.\n\n(Choice C) Hydralazine is a direct arteriolar vasodilator; however, it does not dilate renal arterioles and may decrease renal perfusion and encourage sodium and fluid retention. It is not often used in hypertensive emergency because it is associated with reflex sympathetic activation, resulting in increased heart rate and contractility.\n\n(Choice D) Nitroglycerin is a rapid-acting venodilator that decreases preload and cardiac output. It causes only minimal arterial dilation and does not improve renal perfusion. Nitroglycerin is primarily used to reduce myocardial oxygen demand in acute coronary syndrome.\n\n(Choice E) Phenylephrine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist that causes an increase in systemic vascular resistance due to arterial vasoconstriction. It is used in patients with hypotension or shock and is contraindicated in hypertensive emergency.\n\nEducational objective:\nFenoldopam is a selective peripheral dopamine-1 receptor agonist. It causes vasodilation of systemic and renal arterioles to lower blood pressure while also increasing renal perfusion, urine output, and natriuresis, making it useful in the treatment of hypertensive emergency in patients with renal insufficiency.",
    "zh": "该患者患有严重的高血压。此外，他有继发性靶器官损伤的临床证据，包括脑病（如意识模糊）、视乳头水肿和急性肾损伤（如肌酐升高）。这种表现与高血压急症一致，需要积极治疗，立即但受控地降低血压，以最大限度地减少器官损伤。静脉注射药物在高血压急症中更受欢迎，因为它们起效快且能进行剂量滴定。\n\n非诺多泮是一种短效、选择性的外周多巴胺-1受体激动剂，对α或β肾上腺素能受体的影响很小或没有影响。多巴胺-1受体刺激激活腺苷酸环化酶并升高细胞内环磷酸腺苷（cAMP），导致大多数动脉床血管扩张，从而降低全身血压。肾血管扩张尤为显著，导致肾灌注增加、尿量增加和钠尿（即钠排泄）。这使得非诺多泮对高血压急症和肾功能不全的患者特别有益。\n\n（选项A）艾司洛尔是一种短效、心脏选择性的β-1受体拮抗剂。它通过降低心率和心肌收缩力起作用。艾司洛尔不是血管扩张剂，也不会增加肾灌注。\n\n（选项C）肼苯哒嗪是一种直接的动脉扩张剂；然而，它不会扩张肾小动脉，反而可能降低肾灌注并促进钠和体液潴留。它通常不用于高血压急症，因为它与反射性交感神经激活有关，导致心率和收缩力增加。\n\n（选项D）硝酸甘油是一种速效的静脉扩张剂，可降低前负荷和心输出量。它仅引起轻微的动脉扩张，并且不能改善肾灌注。硝酸甘油主要用于降低急性冠状动脉综合征中的心肌耗氧量。\n\n（选项E）去氧肾上腺素是一种α-肾上腺素能受体激动剂，由于动脉血管收缩而导致全身血管阻力增加。它用于低血压或休克的患者，在高血压急症中禁忌。\n\n教育目标：\n非诺多泮是一种选择性的外周多巴胺-1受体激动剂。它引起全身和肾小动脉扩张以降低血压，同时也增加肾灌注、尿量和钠尿，使其可用于治疗肾功能不全患者的高血压急症。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hypertensive emergency and the appropriate selection of intravenous antihypertensive agents, specifically focusing on agents that improve renal perfusion. The key is to recognize the signs of end-organ damage (encephalopathy, papilledema, acute kidney injury) and select a medication that addresses both hypertension and renal function.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the patient's condition as hypertensive emergency with end-organ damage. Then, consider the mechanism of action of each medication, focusing on those that cause arteriolar dilation and improve renal perfusion. Fenoldopam is the only option that meets both criteria.",
