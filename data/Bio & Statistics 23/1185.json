He has read in the newspaper that decreased consumption of yellow and orange fruits and vegetables has been associated with Alzheimer disease and would like to know how likely he is to develop the disease. A medical literature review uncovers a recent cohort study that evaluated the association between blood carotene concentration and Alzheimer disease. The development of the disease was evaluated in a 20-year follow-up study of 200 middle-aged subjects who have a first-degree relative with Alzheimer disease.

    "en": "Risk is the probability of developing a disease or other health outcome over the study period. In this example, it represents the probability of developing Alzheimer disease over a 20-year period among middle-aged subjects who have a first-degree relative with the disease. To calculate this probability in subjects with low carotene levels. divide the number of subjects who develop Alzheimer disease in the low carotene group (18) by the overall number of subjects in the low carotene group (18 + 27 = 45).\n\nRisk of developing Alzheimer disease among subjects with low carotene = 18 / (18 + 27)\n= 18 / 45 = 0.40\n\nThis means that, among subjects with low carotene levels, there is a 40% probability of developing Alzheimer disease in 20 years.\n\nNote that this is different from the relative risk (RR) of Alzheimer disease in subjects with low carotene levels compared to those with normal carotene groups:\n\nRR = risk of developing Alzheimer disease among subjects with low carotene levels / risk of developing Alzheimer disease among subjects with normal carotene levels = 0.4 / [42 / (42 + 113)] = 0.4 / 0.27 = 1.48\n\nAs the data is not presented in the standard 2 × 2 (contingency) table format, care must be taken to perform the calculations without relying on memorized formulas.\n\n(Choices A and D) The prevalence of low carotene (exposure) among subjects who do not develop Alzheimer disease is 27 / (27 + 113) = 27 / 140 = 0.19 (19%). The prevalence of low carotene (exposure) among subjects who develop Alzheimer disease is 18 / (18 + 42) = 18 / 60 = 0.3 (30%).\n\n(Choice B) The prevalence of low carotene in the entire cohort is (18 + 27) / (18 + 42 + 27 + 113) = 45 / 200 = 0.23 (23%).\n\n(Choice C) As noted in the RR calculation above, the 20-year risk of developing Alzheimer disease among subjects with normal carotene levels is 42 / (42 + 113) = 42 / 155 = 0.27 (27%).",
    "zh": "风险是在研究期间患上疾病或其他健康结果的概率。在这个例子中，它代表了在中年受试者中，有阿尔茨海默病直系亲属的受试者在20年内患上阿尔茨海默病的概率。要计算低胡萝卜素水平受试者的这种概率，将低胡萝卜素组中患上阿尔茨海默病的受试者人数（18）除以低胡萝卜素组的受试者总数（18 + 27 = 45）。\n\n低胡萝卜素水平受试者患上阿尔茨海默病的风险 = 18 / (18 + 27)\n= 18 / 45 = 0.40\n\n这意味着，在低胡萝卜素水平的受试者中，在20年内患上阿尔茨海默病的概率为40%。\n\n请注意，这与低胡萝卜素水平的受试者与正常胡萝卜素水平的受试者相比，患阿尔茨海默病的相对风险 (RR) 不同：\n\nRR = 低胡萝卜素水平受试者患阿尔茨海默病的风险 / 正常胡萝卜素水平受试者患阿尔茨海默病的风险 = 0.4 / [42 / (42 + 113)] = 0.4 / 0.27 = 1.48\n\n由于数据未以标准的2 × 2（列联）表格式呈现，因此必须注意在不依赖于记忆公式的情况下执行计算。\n\n（选项A和D）未患上阿尔茨海默病的受试者中低胡萝卜素（暴露）的患病率为27 / (27 + 113) = 27 / 140 = 0.19 (19%)。患上阿尔茨海默病的受试者中低胡萝卜素（暴露）的患病率为18 / (18 + 42) = 18 / 60 = 0.3 (30%)。\n\n（选项B）整个队列中低胡萝卜素的患病率为 (18 + 27) / (18 + 42 + 27 + 113) = 45 / 200 = 0.23 (23%)。\n\n（选项C）如上所述的RR计算，正常胡萝卜素水平受试者在20年内患上阿尔茨海默病的风险为42 / (42 + 113) = 42 / 155 = 0.27 (27%)。"
