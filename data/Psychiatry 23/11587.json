    "en": "A 29-year-old woman comes to the office due to depression. Since breaking up with her boyfriend last month, she has been extremely sad and has difficulty getting out of bed. She describes sleeping 16 hours a day, increased appetite, a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight gain, low energy, decreased concentration, and loss of interest in socializing with her friends and family. The patient had 2 similar episodes at age 23 and 27. She also describes brief periods in the past, lasting several days, when she was uncharacteristically confident and optimistic, successfully juggled 3 part-time jobs, and felt well rested and energetic despite sleeping only 3-4 hours a night. The patient drinks a glass of wine several times a week but does not use tobacco or illicit drugs.",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's current major depressive episode (≥2 weeks, depressed mood, low energy, hypersomnia, increased appetite, decreased concentration, loss of interest) and history suggestive of a hypomanic episode (increased activity, energy and confidence, decreased need for sleep) are consistent with a diagnosis of BIPOLAR II DISORDER. Patients with bipolar II disorder have a history of HYPOMANIC (not manic) episodes and one or more major DEPRESSIVE episodes. Hypomania is differentiated from mania by a lesser degree of severity and functional impairment and the absence of psychosis. As in this patient, those experiencing hypomania exhibit a noticeable change in behavior but are often very productive despite requiring less sleep. In contrast to manic patients, those who are hypomanic are often able to work and are rarely hospitalized.\n\n(Choice A) Adjustment disorders develop in response to an identifiable stressor but are not diagnosed if the patient has sufficient symptoms to meet the criteria for another disorder.\n(Choice B) Bipolar I disorder is diagnosed in patients who experience MANIC episodes (severe symptoms causing marked impairment, possible psychotic features). Major depressive episodes are common but not required for diagnosis.\n(Choice D) Patients diagnosed with cyclothymic disorder experience at least 2 years of numerous periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for hypomanic or major depressive episodes.\n(Choice E) This patient's history of a distinct change in behavior (elevated mood, excess energy, hyperactivity, decreased need for sleep, inflated self-esteem) is consistent with hypomania, ruling out unipolar major depressive disorder.",
    "zh": "该患者目前的重度抑郁发作（≥2周，情绪低落，精力不足，嗜睡，食欲增加，注意力下降，失去兴趣）以及提示轻躁狂发作的病史（活动增加，精力充沛和自信，睡眠需求减少）与双相II型障碍的诊断一致。双相II型障碍患者有轻躁狂（而非躁狂）发作史和一次或多次重度抑郁发作。轻躁狂与躁狂的区别在于严重程度和功能损害较轻，且无精神病。正如该患者一样，经历轻躁狂的人表现出行为的明显变化，但即使睡眠减少，也通常富有成效。与躁狂患者相比，轻躁狂患者通常能够工作，并且很少住院。\n\n（选项A）适应障碍是对可识别的应激源的反应而发生的，但如果患者有足够的症状来满足另一种障碍的标准，则不诊断为适应障碍。\n（选项B）双相I型障碍诊断于经历躁狂发作（严重症状导致明显损害，可能有精神病特征）的患者。重度抑郁发作很常见，但不是诊断所必需的。\n（选项D）被诊断患有环性心境障碍的患者会经历至少2年，有许多轻躁狂和抑郁症状的时期，这些症状不符合轻躁狂或重度抑郁发作的标准。\n（选项E）该患者的行为发生了明显的改变（情绪高涨，精力过剩，活动过度，睡眠需求减少，自尊心膨胀）与轻躁狂一致，排除了单相重度抑郁症。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the diagnostic criteria for bipolar and related disorders, specifically differentiating between Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Cyclothymic disorder, and Adjustment disorder with depressed mood.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully evaluating the patient's current depressive symptoms and past history of mood disturbances, paying close attention to the presence and characteristics of both depressive and hypomanic/manic episodes to apply the correct diagnostic criteria.",
    "zh": "本题考察对双相情感障碍及相关障碍诊断标准的理解，特别是区分双相I型障碍、双相II型障碍、环性心境障碍和伴抑郁情绪的适应障碍。\n\n解决此问题的方法包括仔细评估患者目前的抑郁症状和既往的情绪障碍病史，密切关注抑郁发作和轻躁狂/躁狂发作的存在和特征，以便应用正确的诊断标准。"
