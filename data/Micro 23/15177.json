She has no medical history and received the complete hepatitis B vaccination series prior to her hospital employment a year ago. She is closely monitored over the next 6 months with repeat hepatitis B serologies and does not develop clinical or laboratory evidence of infection.",

    "en": "Serologic evidence of **hepatitis B virus** (HBV) exposure is present in approximately 2 billion people worldwide. Nearly 250 million of these individuals have chronic infection and can transmit the virus to others. Perinatal transmission is most common in high prevalence countries (eg, sub-Saharan Africa); unprotected sex or intravenous drug use causes most infections in low-incidence countries (eg, United States). **Health care providers** are at **high risk** for infection due to potential exposure to the blood of infected patients.\n\n**HBV vaccination** is recommended for all health care providers and other high-risk individuals (eg, intravenous drug users). The vaccine utilizes **recombinant HBsAg** to generate protective immunity against the virus. HBsAg is a collection of envelope glycoproteins found on the surface of HBV; these glycoproteins mediate attachment of the virus to hepatocytes and subsequent viral entry. Patients who adequately respond to the HBV vaccine generate **anti-HBs antibodies**, which bind to circulating viral particles and prevent attachment to and penetration of hepatocytes.\n\nPatients who have been immunized against HBV as well as those who have cleared the virus after acute infection will have anti-HBs antibodies. These 2 populations are distinguished by the presence of anti-HBc antibodies, which are seen only in those who have been exposed to the virus (not in immunized patients).\n\n(Choice A) The immunity conferred by the hepatitis B vaccination is mediated by protective antibodies against HBsAg; the protective effects are not due to activation of cytotoxic T cells. However, in patients exposed to HBV, the resolution of acute infection is mediated primarily by a vigorous, polyclonal cytotoxic T-cell response that destroys infected hepatocytes.\n\n(Choice B) HIV treatment often includes nucleotide and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, which disrupt viral genome replication. Hepatitis C virus is often treated with similar medications (eg, sofosbuvir) that target viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Immunization against HBV does not interfere with replication of the HBV genome.\n\n(Choice C) HBV is considered a stealth virus because it possesses virulence factors that block portions of the innate immune system, including the release of interferon-gamma from infected cells. However, HBV immunization does not significantly affect the innate immune system.\n\n(Choice E) NS5A inhibitors (eg, ledipasvir) are thought to block hepatitis C virus replication and assembly. HBV immunization generates protective antibodies against the HBsAg; it does not affect viral assembly.\n\nEducational objective:\nImmunization against hepatitis B virus uses recombinant HBsAg to generate anti-HBs antibodies. These antibodies prevent infection by binding to the envelope of circulating virus and inhibiting viral entry.",
    "zh": "全世界约有20亿人存在**乙型肝炎病毒**（HBV）暴露的血清学证据。其中近2.5亿人患有慢性感染，并能将病毒传播给其他人。围产期传播在高流行国家（例如撒哈拉以南非洲）最常见；无保护的性行为或静脉注射吸毒是低发病率国家（例如美国）大多数感染的原因。由于可能暴露于感染患者的血液中，**医疗保健提供者**感染的**风险很高**。\n\n**建议所有医疗保健提供者和其他高危人群（例如，静脉吸毒者）接种HBV疫苗**。该疫苗利用**重组HBsAg**来产生针对该病毒的保护性免疫力。HBsAg是在HBV表面发现的一组包膜糖蛋白；这些糖蛋白介导病毒与肝细胞的附着以及随后的病毒进入。对HBV疫苗有足够反应的患者会产生**抗-HBs抗体**，这些抗体与循环病毒颗粒结合，并阻止其与肝细胞的附着和穿透。\n\n接种过HBV疫苗以及在急性感染后清除病毒的患者都会产生抗-HBs抗体。这2类人群的区别在于是否存在抗-HBc抗体，后者仅在那些接触过病毒的人中可见（未在接种疫苗的患者中）。\n\n（选项A）乙型肝炎疫苗接种所赋予的免疫力是由针对HBsAg的保护性抗体介导的；保护作用并非由于细胞毒性T细胞的激活。然而，在接触HBV的患者中，急性感染的消退主要由强大的、多克隆的细胞毒性T细胞反应介导，该反应会破坏受感染的肝细胞。\n\n（选项B）HIV治疗通常包括核苷和非核苷逆转录酶抑制剂，这些药物会破坏病毒基因组的复制。丙型肝炎病毒通常使用类似的药物（例如，索磷布韦）治疗，这些药物靶向病毒RNA依赖性RNA聚合酶。针对HBV的免疫接种不会干扰HBV基因组的复制。\n\n（选项C）HBV被认为是一种隐形病毒，因为它具有毒力因子，可以阻断部分先天免疫系统，包括受感染细胞释放干扰素-γ。然而，HBV免疫接种不会显着影响先天免疫系统。\n\n（选项E）NS5A抑制剂（例如，雷地帕韦）被认为可以阻断丙型肝炎病毒的复制和组装。HBV免疫接种会产生针对HBsAg的保护性抗体；它不会影响病毒组装。\n\n教育目标：\n针对乙型肝炎病毒的免疫接种使用重组HBsAg产生抗-HBs抗体。这些抗体通过与循环病毒的包膜结合并抑制病毒进入来预防感染。"
