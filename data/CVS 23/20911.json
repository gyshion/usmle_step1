    "en": "A full-term newborn is evaluated in the delivery room due to mild tachypnea and cyanosis immediately after birth. Fetal ultrasonography performed during pregnancy revealed transposition of the great arteries. Heart rate and blood pressure are normal. Oxygen saturation is 72%. Cyanosis is apparent in the hands, feet, lips, and tongue. Peripheral pulses are strong. Bedside echocardiography confirms the prenatal diagnosis; there is also a small patent foramen ovale and a small patent ductus arteriosus. Definitive surgical correction of the main congenital abnormality is planned. Pending definitive repair, which of the following temporary measures would be most likely to improve this patient's condition?",

    "en": "Transposition of the great arteries {{exhibit_1}}\n\nTransposition of the great arteries (TGA) is caused by impaired spiraling of the conotruncal septum (divides the truncus arteriosus into the aorta and the pulmonary artery), resulting in reversed connections between the ventricles and great arteries:\n\n*   The right ventricle empties into the aorta, causing deoxygenated mixed venous blood to be pumped directly into the systemic circulation (bypassing the lungs), leading to neonatal cyanosis\n*   The left ventricle ejects blood into the pulmonary artery, causing the pulmonary venous return to be pumped back into the lungs, trapping oxygenated blood in the pulmonary circulation\n\nThe parallel (ie, separate) circulations in TGA are incompatible with life unless a mixing shunt (eg, patent ductus arteriosus, patent foramen ovale, ventricular septal defect) is present to provide a path for partially oxygenated blood to enter the systemic circulation. Therefore, initial management of TGA involves ensuring adequate mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. For example, administration of prostaglandin E to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus or surgical procedures to open or widen the foramen ovale.\n\n(Choice A) Sinoatrial node ablation is sometimes used for treating tachyarrhythmias involving the sinoatrial node.\n\n(Choice B) Because deoxygenated blood bypasses the pulmonary circulation and is delivered directly to the systemic circulation in TGA, supplemental oxygen administration does not significantly improve hypoxemia or cyanosis.\n\n(Choice C) Digoxin is a positive inotropic agent that can treat heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (a finding not present on this patient's echocardiogram). Increased myocyte contractility would not improve this patient's oxygenation.\n\n(Choice E) Ligating a patent ductus arteriosus in a patient with TGA would decrease mixing of blood between the parallel systemic and pulmonary circulations, worsening hypoxemia and cyanosis.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nTransposition of the great arteries is characterized by parallel circulations of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood. Initial management includes maintaining a mixing shunt (eg, patent ductus arteriosus, patent foramen ovale) to provide the systemic circulation with partially oxygenated blood. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "大动脉转位 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n大动脉转位 (TGA) 是由干圆锥间隔 (将动脉干分为主动脉和肺动脉) 螺旋异常引起的，导致心室和大动脉之间的连接颠倒：\n\n*   右心室排空到主动脉，导致静脉混合的脱氧血直接泵入体循环（绕过肺），导致新生儿发绀\n*   左心室将血液射入肺动脉，导致肺静脉回流泵回肺部，将含氧血困在肺循环中\n\nTGA 中的平行（即独立）循环与生命不相容，除非存在混合分流（例如，动脉导管未闭、卵圆孔未闭、室间隔缺损）以提供部分含氧血进入体循环的途径。因此，TGA 的初始治疗包括确保含氧血和脱氧血的充分混合。例如，给予前列腺素 E 以维持动脉导管的开放，或通过手术打开或扩大卵圆孔。\n\n（选项 A）消融窦房结有时用于治疗涉及窦房结的快速性心律失常。\n\n（选项 B）由于脱氧血绕过肺循环并直接输送到 TGA 的体循环，补充氧气并不能显着改善低氧血症或发绀。\n\n（选项 C）地高辛是一种正性肌力药，可以治疗因左心室收缩功能障碍引起的心力衰竭（此患者的超声心动图中未发现此结果）。增加心肌细胞收缩力并不能改善该患者的氧合。\n\n（选项 E）在 TGA 患者中结扎动脉导管未闭会减少平行体循环和肺循环之间的血液混合，从而加重低氧血症和发绀。\n\n教育目标：\n\n大动脉转位的特征是脱氧血和含氧血的平行循环。初始治疗包括维持混合分流（例如，动脉导管未闭、卵圆孔未闭）以向体循环提供部分含氧血。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of transposition of the great arteries (TGA) and its initial management. TGA involves parallel systemic and pulmonary circulations, requiring a mixing shunt for survival. Initial management focuses on maintaining or creating a mixing shunt to improve oxygenation.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the pathophysiology of TGA and the importance of a mixing shunt. Identify the option that promotes mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, such as enlarging the patent foramen ovale or maintaining the patency of the ductus arteriosus.",
