    "en": "A 10-week-old boy is brought to the office for a follow-up visit. As part of his routine immunization schedule, the patient received the first dose of the *Haemophilus influenzae* type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine when he was 8 weeks old. However, following vaccine administration, he developed anaphylaxis, requiring epinephrine administration and hospitalization. As a result, the decision was made not to administer additional doses of the Hib vaccine. The patient was born full-term by uncomplicated vaginal delivery and has otherwise been healthy. Physical examination is unremarkable. His older brother has completed the full vaccination course. This patient is at highest risk of which of the following infections compared to his brother?",
    "zh": "一名10周大的男孩因复诊来到诊所。作为其常规免疫接种计划的一部分，该患者在8周大时接种了第一剂b型流感嗜血杆菌（Hib）结合疫苗。然而，在疫苗接种后，他出现了过敏反应，需要注射肾上腺素并住院治疗。因此，决定不再接种Hib疫苗。该患者足月顺产，此前身体健康。体格检查无特殊发现。他的哥哥已经完成了全程疫苗接种。与他哥哥相比，该患者最有可能感染以下哪种疾病？"

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "*Haemophilus influenzae* is a gram-negative coccobacillus that can be either encapsulated (serotypes a-f) or unencapsulated (nontypeable). *H. influenzae* type b (Hib) is the most invasive strain due to its polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) capsule, which inhibits complement-mediated phagocytosis and allows it to invade tissues and survive in the bloodstream.\n\nDuring the first months of life, transient immunity to Hib is accomplished by IgG antibodies acquired transplacentally from the mother while in utero. The Hib vaccine is administered beginning at age 2 months to provide continued immunity. The immunization is composed of PRP conjugated with a protein toxoid (eg, tetanus, diphtheria), which induces a T cell–dependent immune response. The production of opsonizing anticapsular antibodies by B-lymphocytes allows for efficient phagocytosis of the bacterium. Without the protection from the vaccine, this child is at risk for invasive disease caused by Hib, such as MENINGITIS, bacteremia, pneumonia, and epiglottitis.\n\n(Choice A) Bronchiolitis is a lower respiratory infection that is almost always viral in etiology. Respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza are commonly implicated, but not *H influenzae*.\n\n(Choices B, D, and E) Most cases of bacterial conjunctivitis, acute otitis media, and sinusitis in childhood are due to *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, nontypeable *H influenzae*, and *Moraxella catarrhalis*. The Hib vaccine (which has no effect on nontypeable *H influenzae*) will not protect a child from these infections.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe *Haemophilus influenzae* type b (Hib) vaccine induces anticapsular antibodies that facilitate complement-mediated phagocytosis of the bacterium. The vaccination series has drastically reduced the incidence of invasive disease caused by Hib, such as meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and epiglottitis.",
    "zh": "流感嗜血杆菌是一种革兰氏阴性球杆菌，可被包膜（血清型a-f）或无包膜（不可分型）。由于其多核糖基核糖醇磷酸盐（PRP）荚膜，b型流感嗜血杆菌（Hib）是最具侵袭性的菌株，该荚膜抑制补体介导的吞噬作用，使其能够侵入组织并在血流中存活。\n\n在出生后的头几个月，通过从母亲在子宫内经胎盘获得的IgG抗体实现对Hib的短暂免疫。Hib疫苗从2个月大开始接种，以提供持续的免疫力。该免疫接种由PRP与蛋白质类毒素（例如破伤风、白喉）结合而成，可诱导T细胞依赖性免疫反应。B淋巴细胞产生调理性抗荚膜抗体，从而实现对细菌的有效吞噬。如果没有疫苗提供的保护，该儿童就有感染Hib引起的侵袭性疾病的风险，如脑膜炎、菌血症、肺炎和会厌炎。\n\n(选项A) 细支气管炎是一种下呼吸道感染，几乎总是病毒病原体引起的。呼吸道合胞病毒、鼻病毒、流感和副流感通常与此有关，但与流感嗜血杆菌无关。\n\n(选项B、D和E) 儿童的大多数细菌性结膜炎、急性中耳炎和鼻窦炎病例是由于肺炎链球菌、不可分型的流感嗜血杆菌和卡他莫拉菌引起的。Hib疫苗（对不可分型的流感嗜血杆菌无效）不能保护儿童免受这些感染。\n\n教育目标：\n b型流感嗜血杆菌（Hib）疫苗诱导抗荚膜抗体，促进补体介导的细菌吞噬作用。疫苗接种系列已大大降低了由Hib引起的侵袭性疾病（如脑膜炎、菌血症、肺炎和会厌炎）的发生率。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of vaccine-preventable diseases, specifically the complications of *Haemophilus influenzae* type b (Hib) infection and the mechanism of protection conferred by the Hib vaccine. It also tests understanding of why a patient who experienced anaphylaxis after the first dose of the Hib vaccine is at increased risk for Hib infections.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the patient cannot receive further Hib vaccinations due to anaphylaxis. This leaves the patient susceptible to invasive Hib infections, such as meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and epiglottitis, which are prevented by the Hib vaccine.",
    "zh": "此问题测试对疫苗可预防疾病的知识，特别是b型流感嗜血杆菌（Hib）感染的并发症以及Hib疫苗提供的保护机制。它还测试对为什么在接种第一剂Hib疫苗后出现过敏反应的患者感染Hib的风险增加的理解。\n\n要解决此问题，请认识到由于过敏反应，患者无法接种进一步的Hib疫苗。这使得患者易受侵袭性Hib感染的影响，如脑膜炎、菌血症、肺炎和会厌炎，这些感染可由Hib疫苗预防。"
