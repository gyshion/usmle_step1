    "en": "A 42-year-old man comes to the office due to numbness and tingling in both legs and difficulty walking for the past several months. He has also noticed that he tires more easily with physical activity. Temperature is 36.8 C (98.2 F), blood pressure is 122/86 mm Hg, pulse is 76 /min, and respirations are 14/min. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor and loss of vibration and position sensation in the bilateral lower extremities with associated gait ataxia. The remainder of the examination is within normal limits. Which of the following findings is most likely to be present on further questioning of the patient?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient most likely has deficiency of vitamin B₁₂ (cobalamin), a water-soluble vitamin obtained solely from the diet, specifically animal products such as meat, dairy, and fish. Vitamin B₁₂ cannot be obtained directly from plant products, placing strict vegans at risk for dietary deficiency, particularly those who do not eat vitamin B₁₂-fortified foods; without supplementation, patients with impaired intrinsic factor production (eg, pernicious anemia, total gastrectomy) also inevitably develop deficiency.\n\nThe liver can store approximately 1,000 times the daily vitamin B₁₂ requirement; deficiency develops only after the complete absence of intake or absorption for 3-4 years, making a long-standing (ie, 6 years) vegan diet consistent with this patient's presentation, in contrast to a recent (ie, 8 months) gastrectomy (Choice C). {{exhibit_1}}\n\nDevelopment of anemia and severe, potentially irreversible neurologic damage can result from vitamin B₁₂ deficiency. Red blood cell synthesis relies on vitamin B₁₂-dependent recycling of folate; deficiency of either vitamin results in megaloblastic anemia. Impaired myelin synthesis, specifically in the dorsal and lateral columns, results in subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. This condition is progressive and begins as a symmetric neuropathy consisting of paresthesia and weakness. Ongoing deficiency leads to loss of vibration and position sensation with development of an ataxic gait. The longer the deficiency is untreated, the less likely the neurologic deficits can be reversed.\n\n(Choice A) Isoniazid is often used to treat latent tuberculosis infection. It impairs the availability of vitamin B₆, which can result in peripheral neuropathy in high risk patients (eg, pregnancy, HIV, diabetes mellitus); anemia (eg, conjunctival pallor) would be unexpected.\n\n(Choice D) Phenytoin, an antiepileptic drug used to treat focal and generalized seizures, may result in folate deficiency and development of megaloblastic anemia. Phenytoin can also cause peripheral neuropathy, but this adverse effect usually occurs only with chronic therapy (>1 year).\n\n(Choice E) Vitamin D deficiency can develop over several months due to inadequate dietary intake and minimal sunlight exposure. This deficiency presents as rickets in children and osteomalacia or osteoporosis in adults.\n\nEducational objective:\nVitamin B₁₂ is obtained through the diet solely from animal sources, which places strict vegans at risk for dietary deficiency. This deficiency takes years to develop due to the large hepatic vitamin B₁₂ reserve, and presents with megaloblastic anemia and potentially irreversible neurologic deficits (eg, paresthesia, weakness, ataxic gait). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有维生素B₁₂（钴胺素）缺乏症，维生素B₁₂是一种水溶性维生素，仅从膳食中获得，特别是动物产品，如肉类、奶制品和鱼类。维生素B₁₂不能直接从植物产品中获得，这使得严格素食者面临膳食缺乏的风险，尤其是那些不食用维生素B₁₂强化食品的人；如果没有补充，内在因子产生受损的患者（例如，恶性贫血，全胃切除术）也必然会发生缺乏症。\n\n肝脏可以储存大约1000倍的每日维生素B₁₂需求量；只有在完全停止摄入或吸收3-4年后才会发生缺乏症，这使得长期（即6年）的素食饮食与该患者的症状相符，而近期（即8个月）的胃切除术（选项C）则不然。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n维生素B₁₂缺乏可导致贫血和严重的、可能不可逆的神经系统损伤。红细胞合成依赖于维生素B₁₂依赖性的叶酸再循环；任一维生素的缺乏都会导致巨幼细胞性贫血。髓鞘合成受损，特别是在背柱和侧柱中，导致脊髓亚急性联合变性。这种情况是进行性的，开始时表现为对称性神经病变，包括感觉异常和无力。持续的缺乏导致振动和位置感觉丧失，并出现共济失调步态。缺乏症未治疗的时间越长，神经功能缺损逆转的可能性就越小。\n\n（选项A）异烟肼常用于治疗潜伏性结核感染。它会损害维生素B₆的利用，这可能导致高危患者（例如，妊娠、HIV、糖尿病）出现周围神经病变；贫血（例如，结膜苍白）是不常见的。\n\n（选项D）苯妥英，一种用于治疗局灶性和全身性癫痫发作的抗癫痫药物，可能导致叶酸缺乏和巨幼细胞性贫血的发生。苯妥英也可引起周围神经病变，但这种不良反应通常仅发生在长期治疗（>1年）时。\n\n（选项E）由于膳食摄入不足和日照最少，维生素D缺乏症可在几个月内发生。这种缺乏症表现为儿童佝偻病和成人骨软化症或骨质疏松症。\n\n教育目标：\n维生素B₁₂仅从膳食中的动物来源获得，这使得严格素食者面临膳食缺乏的风险。这种缺乏症需要数年时间才会发展，这是由于肝脏中大量的维生素B₁₂储备，并表现为巨幼细胞性贫血和可能不可逆的神经功能缺损（例如，感觉异常、无力、共济失调步态）。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

It also tests the ability to differentiate vitamin B12 deficiency from other causes of neuropathy and anemia.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the symptoms of subacute combined degeneration (paresthesia, weakness, loss of vibration/position sense, ataxia) and associate them with potential causes of vitamin B12 deficiency, such as strict vegan diet.
