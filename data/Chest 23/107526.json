    "en": "This patient with cough and hemoptysis has endobronchial biopsy findings consistent with Kaposi sarcoma (KS), a vascular tumor strongly associated with human herpesvirus 8 infection. KS often occurs in patients who are immunosuppressed (ie, impaired T-cell control of the virus). Risk factors include HIV infection and immunosuppressive therapy following transplant. Corticosteroid use (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations) can also precipitate or worsen KS.\n\nAlthough skin involvement is a characteristic initial finding (eg, purple papules on the lower extremities), some patients may present with pulmonary disease. Depending on the location of the tumor, patients may have dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis (due to tumor bleeding), airway obstruction, and/or pleural effusions. Chest imaging often reveals reticular opacities or nodular densities. Bronchoscopy may show endobronchial macules and papules that are classically cherry-red or violaceous.\n\nHistopathology of KS characteristically shows a proliferation of spindle-shaped endothelial cells forming slit-like vascular spaces with inflammation. The abnormal vascular spaces are leaky, allowing red blood cell extravasation.\n\n{{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) Pulmonary adenocarcinoma noma often presents with cough, hemoptysis, and weight loss. However, it tends to be located peripherally and would be less likely to form an endobronchial lesion. Histopathology often shows infiltrative glands lined by malignant mucin-producing epithelial cells.\n\n(Choice B) Pulmonary carcinoid tumor is a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor that often arises in the proximal airways and grows endobronchially, causing cough and hemoptysis. However, histopathology shows uniform, polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and granular (ie, salt and pepper) chromatin.\n\n(Choice C) Pulmonary cytomegalovirus infection typically occurs in immunocompromised patients and may cause cough, shortness of breath, and fever. However, histopathology of infected cells shows viral cytopathic effect, including cell enlargement and nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions.\n\n(Choice E) *Pneumocystis jirovecii* is a fungus that causes pulmonary infection in immunocompromised patients and may lead to cough, dyspnea, and fatigue. However, histopathology shows intraalveolar exudate and cup- or crescent-shaped organisms that can be highlighted with a silver stain.\n\n(Choice F) Squamous cell lung carcinoma often arises in the proximal airways and can cause cough and hemoptysis. However, histopathology shows infiltrative nests of malignant cells with squamous differentiation (eg, intercellular bridges, keratin production).\n\nEducational objective:\nKaposi sarcoma (KS), a vascular tumor associated with human herpesvirus 8, often arises in immunosuppressed patients (eg, HIV infection). KS typically involves the skin but can also affect the viscera, including the gastrointestinal tract (eg, abdominal pain) and pulmonary system (eg, cough, hemoptysis). Biopsy shows spindle-shaped endothelial cells forming slit-like vascular spaces, extravasated red blood cells, and inflammation.",
