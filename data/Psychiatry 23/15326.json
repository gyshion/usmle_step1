    "en": "A 32-year-old man with schizophrenia comes to the office for follow-up. The patient has been stable on his antipsychotic medication for many years. He has infrequent auditory hallucinations and says that the medication \"has helped a lot to turn down the volume of the voices.\" The patient works stocking grocery shelves part-time and lives with his parents, who are supportive. His symptoms first developed gradually at age 14 when he exhibited nonspecific anxiety and became increasingly paranoid that others were talking about him behind his back; he also became preoccupied with finding special meanings in certain numbers. A year later he was hospitalized for a psychotic episode characterized by paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations that responded rapidly to antipsychotic medication. The patient was able to finish high school. He was hospitalized again briefly at age 22 but has remained out of the hospital since then. Which of the following factors is most predictive of a favorable prognosis for this patient?",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is E. Patients with predominantly POSITIVE PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS (eg, hallucinations, delusions), such as this patient, tend to have a more favorable prognosis than patients with predominantly NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS (eg, flat affect, loss of motivation, anhedonia). This is because ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS are more effective for treating positive psychotic symptoms than negative symptoms. Early intervention with antipsychotic medication to decrease the duration of active psychosis also improves the course of illness.\n\n(Choices A and B) Most primary thought disorders (eg, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder) are chronic, insidious disorders with a gradual onset (prodrome) of weeks to months. In contrast, the presence of sudden onset of symptoms from a precipitating event suggests an underlying cause that may allow for treatment and symptom improvement when the precipitant is addressed.\n\n(Choice C) Although unclear, possible reasons for poorer outcomes in men include biological (ie, genetic influences, changes in brain structure, hormones) and psychosocial (ie, social support deficits, substance use, vocational pressures/expectations) differences.\n\n(Choice D) Patients with childhood or adolescent onset typically have a more severe form of the illness and a worse prognosis; the early onset may be due to a neurodevelopmental process with a deteriorating course.\n\nEducational objective: Favorable prognostic factors in schizophrenia include predominantly positive psychotic symptoms, acute onset (shorter prodrome) with an identifiable precipitant, and older age at onset.",
    "zh": "正确答案是E。与主要表现为阴性症状（如，情感淡漠、缺乏动机、快感缺失）的患者相比，主要表现为阳性精神病性症状（如，幻觉、妄想）的患者，例如本例患者，往往预后更好。这是因为抗精神病药物对治疗阳性精神病性症状比阴性症状更有效。早期使用抗精神病药物来缩短活动性精神病的持续时间，也能改善疾病的病程。\n\n（选项A和B）大多数原发性思维障碍（如，精神分裂症、分裂情感性障碍）是慢性、隐匿性疾病，起病呈渐进性（前驱期），持续数周至数月。相比之下，有诱发事件引起的症状突然起病提示潜在原因，当处理诱因时，可能允许治疗和症状改善。\n\n（选项C）尽管尚不清楚，但男性预后较差的可能原因包括生物学因素（即，遗传影响、脑结构变化、激素）和社会心理学因素（即，社会支持不足、物质滥用、职业压力/期望）的差异。\n\n（选项D）儿童或青少年起病的患者通常患有更严重的疾病形式，预后更差；早发可能与神经发育过程恶化有关。\n\n教育目标：精神分裂症的良好预后因素包括主要表现为阳性精神病性症状、急性起病（前驱期较短）伴有可识别的诱因以及起病年龄较大。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of prognostic factors in schizophrenia, specifically identifying characteristics associated with a more favorable outcome. It requires knowledge of how symptom type, age of onset, and the nature of symptom development influence the long-term course of the illness.\n\nTo solve this question, one must analyze the patient's presentation in the context of known prognostic indicators for schizophrenia. Comparing the patient's characteristics (gradual onset, early age of onset, male sex, predominantly positive symptoms) against established lists of good and poor prognostic factors is crucial. The option that aligns with favorable prognosis, as detailed in the provided table and explanation, is the correct answer.",
