    "en": "A 78-year-old man is brought to the emergency department from a nursing home due to abdominal pain and discomfort. The patient has advanced dementia and is only partially able to describe his symptoms. He has had intermittent abdominal discomfort for years with no other related symptoms. The patient is in bed most of the time and can participate in minimal activity with the help of nurses and physical therapists. Prior screening colonoscopies have shown only benign lesions. Abdominal examination is notable for fullness but does not show tenderness, masses, or hepatosplenomegaly. Polyethylene glycol is administered and produces a bowel movement 18 hours later. The mechanism of action of this medication most closely resembles the underlying cause of diarrhea in which of the following conditions?",
    "zh": "一名78岁男性被从疗养院送往急诊科，原因是腹痛和不适。患者患有晚期痴呆症，只能部分描述症状。多年来，他一直有间歇性腹部不适，没有其他相关症状。患者大部分时间卧床，在护士和物理治疗师的帮助下，只能参与最少的活动。之前的筛查性结肠镜检查仅显示良性病变。腹部检查显示腹部饱满，但没有压痛、肿块或肝脾肿大。给予聚乙二醇后，18小时后出现排便。该药物的作用机制与以下哪种情况下的腹泻的根本原因最为相似？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Osmotic laxatives (eg, polyethylene glycol) are poorly absorbable substances that draw water (and subsequently electrolytes) into the intestinal lumen. The increased fluid load distends the intestinal wall, stimulating intestinal peristalsis to create a bowel movement.\n\nOsmotic substances can also accumulate in the intestinal lumen in patients with LACTOSE INTOLERANCE. Undigested lactose is a nonabsorbable osmotic substance; accumulation in the small intestine leads to an increase in the secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen, causing osmotic diarrhea. Bacteria in the distal intestine can also ferment the lactose, producing fatty acids and gasses that cause additional abdominal distension, pain, and flatulence. Symptoms resolve when milk-containing products are eliminated from the diet.\n\n(Choice A) Diarrhea in CARCINOID SYNDROME is secretory and high in electrolytes. High amounts of circulating serotonin stimulate 5-HT4 receptors in the colon, increasing fluid secretion.\n\n(Choice B) In CROHN DISEASE, intestinal inflammation leads to dysregulated ion transport and impaired epithelial barrier function. Consequently, colonic fluid secretion outweighs fluid reabsorption, resulting in diarrhea that is secretory, bloody, and leukocytic (inflammatory diarrhea).\n\n(Choice C) IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME is a functional intestinal disorder that presents with diarrhea alternating with constipation, abdominal pain, and distension without organic cause. Fecal water and electrolyte content are normal.\n\n(Choice E) RECTAL PROLAPSE is a protrusion of rectal mucosa through the anus associated with pregnancy and constipation; the risk is also increased in patients with chronic diarrhea.\n\nEducational objective:\nPolyethylene glycol is an osmotic laxative. Primary lactose intolerance is associated with the inability to digest lactose. The high osmotic load from intraluminal accumulation of lactose can lead to watery diarrhea.",
    "zh": "渗透性泻药（例如，聚乙二醇）是难以吸收的物质，可将水（以及随后的电解质）吸入肠腔。增加的液体负荷会使肠壁膨胀，刺激肠蠕动以产生排便。\n\n渗透性物质也可能在乳糖不耐受患者的肠腔内积聚。未消化的乳糖是一种不可吸收的渗透性物质；在小肠中的积聚会导致水和电解质向肠腔内分泌增加，从而导致渗透性腹泻。远端肠道的细菌也可以发酵乳糖，产生脂肪酸和气体，导致额外的腹胀、疼痛和胀气。当从饮食中消除含乳制品时，症状会消失。\n\n(选项 A) 类癌综合征的腹泻是分泌性的，并且电解质含量高。高浓度的血清素刺激结肠中的 5-HT4 受体，增加液体分泌。\n\n(选项 B) 在克罗恩病中，肠道炎症导致离子转运失调和上皮屏障功能受损。因此，结肠液的分泌超过了液体再吸收，导致腹泻，这种腹泻是分泌性的、血性的和白细胞性的（炎症性腹泻）。\n\n(选项 C) 肠易激综合征是一种功能性肠病，表现为腹泻与便秘交替出现、腹痛和腹胀，无器质性病因。粪便中的水和电解质含量正常。\n\n(选项 E) 直肠脱垂是指直肠黏膜通过肛门突出，与妊娠和便秘有关；慢性腹泻患者的风险也会增加。\n\n教育目标：\n聚乙二醇是一种渗透性泻药。原发性乳糖不耐受与无法消化乳糖有关。来自肠腔内乳糖积聚的高渗透负荷可导致水样腹泻。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of osmotic laxatives and their mechanism of action, as well as the pathophysiology of lactose intolerance and how it leads to diarrhea. It requires knowledge of the underlying causes of diarrhea in different conditions.\n\nTo solve this question, one must understand that polyethylene glycol is an osmotic laxative that draws water into the intestinal lumen. Then, one must identify the condition where a similar mechanism causes diarrhea, which is lactose intolerance due to undigested lactose acting as an osmotic substance.",
    "zh": "此问题考察对渗透性泻药及其作用机制的理解，以及乳糖不耐受的病理生理学及其如何导致腹泻。它需要了解不同情况下腹泻的根本原因。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须了解聚乙二醇是一种渗透性泻药，可将水吸入肠腔。然后，必须确定哪种情况下的类似机制会导致腹泻，即乳糖不耐受，这是由于未消化的乳糖充当渗透性物质。"
