    "en": "This young patient has both clinical (eg, polyuria, polydipsia, volume depletion) and biochemical (eg, hyperglycemia, low bicarbonate, high anion gap, decreased serum sodium levels) signs of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is often precipitated by infections, including urinary tract infections (likely in this patient). Patients with DKA lose significant amounts of potassium in the urine, primarily via glycosuria-induced osmotic diuresis and hypovolemia-mediated increase in aldosterone secretion. This results in a total body potassium deficit that is reflected by decreased intracellular potassium stores (since 98% of the body's potassium is stored intracellularly). Despite the low intracellular potassium levels, extracellular potassium concentrations are normal or increased due to the following mechanisms:\n\n1.  Loss of intracellular free water caused by increased plasma osmolality leads to extracellular movement of potassium secondary to increasing intracellular potassium concentration\n2.  Lack of insulin also causes extracellular shifting of potassium as insulin normally promotes cellular uptake of potassium\n\nClinicians must be careful when giving insulin and intravenous fluids during resuscitation of dehydrated, hyperglycemic patients. These interventions force potassium back into the cells, causing a precipitous drop in serum potassium due to the total body deficit. Despite normal or elevated serum potassium, timely administration of potassium supplementation is essential when treating a patient with DKA.\n\n(Choice A) A decrease in both intra- and extracellular potassium levels is seen with mineralocorticoids excess, diuretic use, and chronic gastrointestinal losses.\n\n(Choice B) Extracellular potassium concentration decreases following glucose and insulin administration as potassium moves into the intracellular compartment. Stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors also causes increased transfer of potassium to the intracellular compartment.\n\n(Choice D) Renal excretion of potassium is impaired in most patients with chronic renal failure, resulting in increased total body potassium storage and hyperkalemia.\n\n(Choice E) Normal extracellular potassium levels are common in patients with DKA as the extracellular potassium shift is often mitigated by increased urinary potassium losses. However, intracellular potassium levels are always decreased in DKA.",
    "zh": "这位年轻患者同时具有糖尿病酮症酸中毒（DKA）的临床表现（例如，多尿、烦渴、容量不足）和生化表现（例如，高血糖、低碳酸氢盐、高阴离子间隙、血清钠水平降低）。DKA 常常由感染诱发，包括尿路感染（在这种患者中很可能发生）。DKA 患者会通过尿液丢失大量的钾，这主要通过葡萄糖尿诱导的渗透性利尿和低血容量介导的醛固酮分泌增加来实现。这导致了全身钾的不足，这反映为细胞内钾的储存量减少（因为人体内98%的钾储存在细胞内）。尽管细胞内钾水平较低，但细胞外钾浓度是正常或升高的，这归因于以下机制：\n\n1.  由于血浆渗透压升高导致细胞内自由水流失，继发于细胞内钾浓度升高导致钾向细胞外移动\n2.  缺乏胰岛素也会导致钾向细胞外转移，因为胰岛素通常促进钾的细胞摄取\n\n在对脱水、高血糖患者进行复苏时，临床医生必须谨慎使用胰岛素和静脉输液。这些干预措施迫使钾回到细胞内，由于全身钾的不足，导致血清钾骤降。尽管血清钾正常或升高，但在治疗 DKA 患者时，及时补充钾是至关重要的。\n\n（选项 A）细胞内和细胞外钾水平均降低可见于盐皮质激素过量、利尿剂使用和慢性胃肠道损失。\n\n（选项 B）在给予葡萄糖和胰岛素后，细胞外钾浓度降低，因为钾移入细胞内。β-肾上腺素能受体的刺激也会导致钾更多地转移到细胞内。\n\n（选项 D）大多数慢性肾衰竭患者的肾脏排钾功能受损，导致全身钾储存量增加和高钾血症。\n\n（选项 E）DKA 患者的细胞外钾水平通常正常，因为细胞外钾的转移常常被尿钾排泄的增加所减轻。但是，DKA 中细胞内钾水平总是降低的。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of electrolyte imbalances in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), specifically focusing on potassium levels and their distribution between intracellular and extracellular compartments. It requires understanding the pathophysiology of DKA and its impact on potassium balance.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical and laboratory findings consistent with DKA. Understand that DKA leads to a total body potassium deficit due to urinary losses, but extracellular potassium levels may be normal or elevated due to shifts from intracellular to extracellular space. Therefore, the correct answer reflects increased extracellular potassium and decreased intracellular potassium.",
