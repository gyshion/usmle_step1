    "en": "Two genetic loci are said to be in linkage disequilibrium when their respective alleles are inherited together in the same gamete (haplotype) more or less often than expected by chance alone given their corresponding allele frequencies. Although linkage disequilibrium is often the result of physical proximity of genes on the same chromosome, it does not always imply physical linkage between the allelic loci.\n\nTo estimate the expected probability of 2 alleles from separate loci appearing together, multiply their occurrence rates. Note that the Hardy-Weinberg principle (2pq) is not applicable when considering alleles at different loci.\n\nDQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 haplotype = [Frequency of DQA1*0501] x [Frequency frequency of DQB1*0201]\n\n= 0.3 x 0.2\n\n= 0.06\n\nIn this example, the observed frequency of both alleles being inherited together is 0.2, which is greater than the expected frequency of 0.06; therefore, the population is said to be in linkage disequilibrium. This disequilibrium is explained by the close proximity of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 loci that code for α and β chains of class II major histocompatibility complex. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Heteroplasmy describes the presence of different mitochondrial genomes (eg, mutated and wild type) within a single cell. The severity of mitochondrial diseases is often related to the proportion of abnormal to normal mitochondria.\n\n(Choice B) Penetrance is the proportion of people with a given genotype who express its associated phenotype. If all individuals with a given gene express its phenotype, that gene is said to have full penetrance.\n\n(Choice D) Pleiotropy is the occurrence of multiple phenotypic manifestations, often in different organ systems, which result from a mutation in a single gene.\n\n(Choice E) The law of segregation describes the phenomenon in which gametogenesis results in the separation of paired chromosomes so that the offspring inherit only half of each parent's genetic composition.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nTwo allele loci are said to be in linkage disequilibrium when a pair of alleles are inherited together in the same gamete (haplotype) more often or less often than would be expected given random pairing. This most often occurs when the genes are in close physical proximity on the same chromosome.",
    "zh": "当两个基因座的相应等位基因在同一配子（单倍型）中一起遗传的频率，比仅根据它们各自的等位基因频率按偶然性预期的频率更高或更低时，这两个基因座就被认为处于连锁不平衡状态。虽然连锁不平衡通常是基因在同一染色体上物理位置接近的结果，但它并不总是意味着等位基因座之间的物理连锁。\n\n为了估计来自不同基因座的2个等位基因一起出现的预期概率，将它们的出现率相乘。请注意，当考虑不同基因座的等位基因时，哈迪-温伯格定律（2pq）不适用。\n\nDQA1*0501-DQB1*0201单倍型 = [DQA1*0501的频率] x [DQB1*0201的频率]\n\n= 0.3 x 0.2\n\n= 0.06\n\n在本例中，两个等位基因一起遗传的观察频率为0.2，大于预期频率0.06；因此，该人群被认为处于连锁不平衡状态。这种不平衡可以用编码II类主要组织相容性复合体α和β链的HLA-DQA1和HLA-DQB1基因座的紧密邻近性来解释。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项 A）异质体描述了单个细胞内存在不同的线粒体基因组（例如，突变型和野生型）。线粒体疾病的严重程度通常与异常线粒体与正常线粒体的比例有关。\n\n（选项 B）外显率是指具有特定基因型的人表达其相关表型的比例。如果具有特定基因的所有个体都表达其表型，则该基因被称为具有完全外显率。\n\n（选项 D）多效性是指多种表型表现，通常在不同的器官系统中，是由单个基因的突变引起的。\n\n（选项 E）分离定律描述了配子发生导致成对染色体分离的现象，使得后代仅继承每个亲本遗传组成的二分之一。\n\n教育目标：\n\n当一对等位基因在同一配子（单倍型）中一起遗传的频率，比在随机配对的情况下预期的频率更高或更低时，这两个等位基因就被认为处于连锁不平衡状态。这种情况最常发生在基因在同一染色体上物理位置非常接近时。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of linkage disequilibrium, a concept in population genetics where alleles at two loci are inherited together more or less often than expected by chance. It also tests the ability to calculate expected haplotype frequencies and compare them to observed frequencies to determine if linkage disequilibrium exists.\n\nTo solve this question, calculate the expected haplotype frequency by multiplying the individual allele frequencies. Compare this expected frequency to the observed frequency. If the observed frequency is significantly different from the expected frequency, linkage disequilibrium is present.",
