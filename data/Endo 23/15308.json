    "en": "A 36-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus comes to the office due to recurrent hypoglycemic episodes. He previously had difficulty controlling his high blood glucose levels, but over the past several weeks his blood glucose has intermittently dropped to <50 mg/dL with accompanying symptoms of tremulousness and headache. There have been no recent changes in his diet, activity level, insulin dosage, or other medical therapy. The patient's other medical conditions include chronic kidney disease from diabetic nephropathy. His estimated glomerular filtration rate has declined to 20 mL/min in recent months, and he is under consideration for initiation of hemodialysis. Physical examination findings are unchanged from the previous office visit 3 months ago.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Insulin is a peptide hormone that has both renal and hepatic clearance. Degradation of circulating insulin in the kidneys is dependent on an adequate glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which allows for delivery of insulin to the proximal tubule cells where it is broken down. CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD) causes decreased GFR, which impairs insulin clearance.\n\nIn patients with normal pancreatic function, hypoglycemia is avoided because pancreatic insulin production decreases and circulating insulin levels rapidly return to baseline. However, patients taking EXOGENOUS INSULIN are at increased risk of hypoglycemia if there is no decrease in dosage to compensate for renal failure.\n\nIn light of this patient's worsening CKD, his symptomatic hypoglycemia is likely due to reduced renal insulin clearance.\n\n(Choice A) Advanced CKD leads to reduced gluconeogenesis in the kidney, not the liver. Hepatic gluconeogenesis is inhibited by inflammatory cytokine release (eg, sepsis), heavy alcohol use, and beta blockers.\n\n(Choice C) Patients with type 1 diabetes typically have minimal to no secretory reserve and cannot increase insulin in response to physiologic stimuli.\n\n(Choice D) Increased renal glucose excretion can cause glucosuria; however, this occurs in the setting of significant hyperglycemia (not hypoglycemia). In addition, this patient's low glomerular filtration rate would be expected to reduce renal glucose excretion.\n\n(Choice E) Insulin sensitivity is decreased (not increased) in CKD due to the accumulation of urea and other metabolic toxins.",
    "zh": "胰岛素是一种肽类激素，具有肾脏和肝脏清除能力。肾脏中循环胰岛素的降解取决于足够的肾小球滤过率 (GFR)，这使得胰岛素能够输送到近曲小管细胞中，在那里被分解。慢性肾脏病 (CKD) 导致 GFR 降低，从而损害胰岛素清除。\n\n在胰腺功能正常的患者中，由于胰腺胰岛素产生减少，循环胰岛素水平迅速恢复到基线，因此避免了低血糖。然而，如果剂量没有减少以补偿肾功能衰竭，服用外源性胰岛素的患者发生低血糖的风险会增加。\n\n鉴于该患者的 CKD 恶化，他的症状性低血糖可能由于肾脏胰岛素清除率降低所致。\n\n（选项 A）晚期 CKD 导致肾脏而不是肝脏的糖异生减少。肝脏糖异生受到炎症细胞因子释放（例如，脓毒症）、大量饮酒和 β 受体阻滞剂的抑制。\n\n（选项 C）1 型糖尿病患者通常分泌储备极少或没有，无法响应生理刺激而增加胰岛素。\n\n（选项 D）肾脏葡萄糖排泄增加可导致糖尿；然而，这种情况发生在明显的血糖过高（而非低血糖）的情况下。此外，该患者的低肾小球滤过率预计会减少肾脏葡萄糖排泄。\n\n（选项 E）由于尿素和其他代谢毒素的积累，CKD 患者的胰岛素敏感性降低（而非增加）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of insulin metabolism and the impact of chronic kidney disease on insulin clearance, specifically in a patient with type 1 diabetes. It requires understanding how renal function affects insulin degradation and the subsequent risk of hypoglycemia when renal clearance is impaired.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that insulin is cleared by both the liver and kidneys. In patients with CKD, renal clearance is reduced, leading to increased insulin levels and a higher risk of hypoglycemia. Therefore, the correct answer is decreased renal insulin clearance.",
    "zh": "本题考察了胰岛素代谢的知识以及慢性肾脏病对胰岛素清除的影响，特别是对于 1 型糖尿病患者。它需要了解肾功能如何影响胰岛素降解以及肾脏清除受损时随之而来的低血糖风险。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要认识到胰岛素由肝脏和肾脏清除。在 CKD 患者中，肾脏清除率降低，导致胰岛素水平升高和低血糖风险增加。因此，正确的答案是肾脏胰岛素清除率降低。"
