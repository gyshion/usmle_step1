    "en": "High-output heart failure {{exhibit_2}}\nThis patient with dyspnea and chest x-ray showing an enlarged heart and pulmonary edema likely has HIGH-OUTPUT HEART FAILURE due to excessive flow through her ARTERIOVENOUS FISTULA. A surgically created arteriovenous fistula forms an enlarged vein that serves as an access point for hemodialysis (which requires a vessel with high blood flow rates); however, if the fistula becomes too large, it can lead to hemodynamic complications.\n\nA large arteriovenous fistula allows a high proportion of blood flow to bypass the resistance of the systemic arterioles, causing markedly DECREASED SYSTEMIC VASCULAR RESISTANCE (SVR) (ie, reduced afterload). Blood passing through the low peripheral resistance returns to the right atrium quickly and easily, resulting in INCREASED VENOUS RETURN (ie, increased preload). Both the reduced afterload and increased preload facilitate increased stroke volume (ie, INCREASED CARDIAC OUTPUT). A baroreceptor reflex-mediated increase in contractility and heart rate in response to hypotension may also contribute to increased cardiac output.\n\nWith excessively large fistulas, the left ventricle becomes unable to keep up with the increased venous return despite a persistent increase in cardiac output; left ventricular diastolic pressure gradually increases, and decompensated heart failure develops. Other common causes of high-output heart failure also involve decreased SVR as the initial disturbance.\n\n(Choice A) Hypovolemia (eg, severe dehydration) involves a marked reduction in blood volume. Venous return is decreased, leading to reduced cardiac output and a compensatory increase in SVR.\n\n(Choice B) Low-output heart failure (the typical cause of cardiogenic shock) involves left ventricular dysfunction as the initial disturbance, which leads to decreased cardiac output and a compensatory increase in SVR. Increased pressure is transmitted backward from the left ventricle, causing elevated central venous pressure (ie, increased venous return [preload]).\n\n(Choice C) The pathophysiology of sepsis is similar to high-output heart failure in that reduced SVR is the initial disturbance and is followed by a compensatory increase in cardiac output. However, in sepsis the leaky vasculature reduces intravascular volume to decrease venous return, preventing volume overload of the left ventricle.\n\n(Choice E) Stimulation of both alpha-1 and beta-1 adrenergic receptors (eg, with norepinephrine) causes arteriolar constriction to increase SVR, venoconstriction to increase venous return, and increased heart rate and contractility to increase cardiac output.\n\nEducational objective:\nHigh-output heart failure results from markedly decreased systemic vascular resistance (eg, large arteriovenous fistula) that leads to increased venous return and increased cardiac output. Despite a sustained increase in cardiac output, the left ventricle is unable to keep up with the increased venous return, and decompensated heart failure develops.",
    "zh": "高输出量心力衰竭 {{exhibit_2}}\n这位出现呼吸困难和胸部X光片显示心脏增大和肺水肿的患者，很可能由于她的动静脉瘘管血流量过大而患有高输出量心力衰竭。手术创建的动静脉瘘形成一个扩大的静脉，用作血液透析的进入点（这需要一个具有高血流速率的血管）；但是，如果瘘管变得太大，则可能导致血流动力学并发症。\n\n大的动静脉瘘允许大部分血流绕过全身小动脉的阻力，从而导致全身血管阻力（SVR）显着降低（即，后负荷降低）。通过低外周阻力的血液会迅速而容易地回流到右心房，导致静脉回流增加（即，前负荷增加）。降低的后负荷和增加的前负荷均促进心搏量增加（即，心输出量增加）。针对低血压的压力感受器反射介导的收缩力和心率增加也可能有助于增加心输出量。\n\n对于过大的瘘管，尽管心输出量持续增加，但左心室无法跟上增加的静脉回流；左心室舒张压逐渐增加，并出现失代偿性心力衰竭。高输出量心力衰竭的其他常见原因也涉及SVR降低作为最初的紊乱。\n\n(选项 A) 低血容量（例如，严重脱水）涉及血容量的显着减少。静脉回流减少，导致心输出量减少和 SVR 代偿性增加。\n\n(选项 B) 低输出量心力衰竭（心源性休克的典型原因）涉及左心室功能障碍作为最初的紊乱，这导致心输出量减少和 SVR 代偿性增加。压力从左心室向后传递，导致中心静脉压升高（即，静脉回流 [前负荷] 增加）。\n\n(选项 C) 脓毒症的病理生理学与高输出量心力衰竭相似，SVR 降低是最初的紊乱，随后是心输出量的代偿性增加。然而，在脓毒症中，渗漏的脉管系统会减少血管内容量以减少静脉回流，从而防止左心室的容量超负荷。\n\n(选项 E) 同时刺激α-1和β-1肾上腺素能受体（例如，使用去甲肾上腺素）会导致小动脉收缩以增加 SVR、静脉收缩以增加静脉回流以及心率和收缩力增加以增加心输出量。\n\n教育目标：\n高输出量心力衰竭是由全身血管阻力显着降低（例如，大的动静脉瘘）引起的，这会导致静脉回流增加和心输出量增加。尽管心输出量持续增加，但左心室无法跟上增加的静脉回流，并发生失代偿性心力衰竭。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the hemodynamic changes associated with high-output heart failure, specifically in the context of an arteriovenous fistula. It requires knowledge of how arteriovenous fistulas affect systemic vascular resistance, venous return, and cardiac output. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that an arteriovenous fistula causes decreased systemic vascular resistance due to bypassing the arterioles, increased venous return due to blood shunting, and increased cardiac output as a compensatory mechanism. Understanding the relationship between preload, afterload, and cardiac output is crucial.",
