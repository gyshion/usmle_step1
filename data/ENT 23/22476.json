    "en": "A 47-year-old man comes to the office due to a white patch on the inside of his lower lip. It is painless and does not bleed. The patient has used smokeless tobacco for the past 20 years. He drinks on average 5 beers a week. On physical examination, a 3.5-cm flat, white patch is seen on the inside of the lower lip, reflecting onto the gingival surface of the lower teeth. There is no cervical adenopathy. Biopsy of the mucosal lesion is shown in the image below: {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient with a history of tobacco and alcohol use has persistent LEUKOPLAKIA (white mucosal lesion) on the buccal and gingival mucosa. Biopsy shows full-thickness dysplasia characterized by abnormal cytology (eg, squamous cells with pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei, dyskeratosis) and architecture (eg, loss of normal squamous maturation). These findings are consistent with SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA in situ. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nMost cancers of the head and neck arise from squamous epithelial cells that undergo stepwise, premalignant changes that progress to carcinoma (ie, hyperplasia → dysplasia → carcinoma in situ → invasive carcinoma). Premalignant lesions may initially manifest in the oral cavity as hyperplastic or dysplastic, white (leukoplakia) or red (erythroplakia) patches. The likelihood of progression to invasive cancer (which has a propensity to spread first to the cervical lymph nodes) depends on the degree of dysplasia, with severe dysplasia having a HIGH likelihood of developing into invasive carcinoma. For this reason, oral leukoplakic lesions with severe dysplasia are typically surgically removed.\n\n(Choice A) Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus can have painless oral plaques or ulcerations. Histopathology typically shows hyperkeratosis and degeneration of the basal epithelial cells with perivascular inflammation, not dysplasia.\n\n(Choice B) Lichen planus can present with lesions in the oral mucous membranes: pruritic, purple/pink, polygonal papules and plaques often develop on the flexural surfaces of the wrists and ankles. Histology usually shows a band of lymphocytic inflammation, degeneration of the basal epithelium with apoptotic cells (ie, Civatte or colloid bodies), saw-toothed rete ridges, hyperkeratosis, and hypergranulosis. Dysplasia would not be seen. {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(Choice D) Oral hairy leukoplakia has a distinct, corrugated appearance and is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It occurs almost exclusively in patients with significant immunosuppression (eg, HIV) and often resolves with antiretroviral treatment; it is not premalignant. Pathology usually shows hyperparakeratosis and hyperplastic epithelium with viral cytopathic effect (not dysplasia). {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choice E) Leukoplakia that shows benign hyperkeratosis and epithelial hyperplasia or even mild dysplasia may regress, especially if risk factors are modified (eg, cessation of tobacco and alcohol use). When severe or full-thickness dysplasia is present (as in this case), it is unlikely to spontaneously regress. {{exhibit_5}}\n\nEducational objective:\nOral leukoplakia is a potentially premalignant lesion; the risk for progression to invasive carcinoma is related to the degree of dysplasia.",
    "zh": "该患者有烟草和酒精使用史，其颊粘膜和牙龈粘膜持续存在白斑（白色粘膜病变）。活检显示全层异型增生，其特征是细胞学异常（例如，具有多形性和高度染色质核的鳞状细胞，角化不良）和结构异常（例如，丧失正常的鳞状细胞成熟）。这些发现与原位鳞状细胞癌一致。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n大多数头颈部癌症源于鳞状上皮细胞，这些细胞经历逐步的癌前改变，进展为癌（即，增生→异型增生→原位癌→浸润癌）。癌前病变最初可在口腔中表现为增生性或异型增生的白色（白斑）或红色（红斑）斑块。进展为浸润性癌（其倾向于首先扩散到颈淋巴结）的可能性取决于异型增生的程度，严重异型增生发展为浸润性癌的可能性很高。因此，通常通过手术切除具有严重异型增生的口腔白斑病变。\n\n（选项A）系统性红斑狼疮患者可出现无痛性口腔斑块或溃疡。组织病理学通常显示角化过度和基底上皮细胞变性伴血管周围炎症，而不是异型增生。\n\n（选项B）扁平苔藓可表现为口腔粘膜病变：瘙痒性、紫色/粉红色、多边形丘疹和斑块常发生于手腕和脚踝的屈侧。组织学通常显示淋巴细胞性炎症带、基底上皮细胞变性伴凋亡细胞（即，Civatte 或胶样小体）、锯齿状钉突、角化过度和颗粒增生。不会观察到异型增生。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n（选项D）毛状白斑具有独特的波状外观，由EB病毒（EBV）引起。它几乎仅发生于免疫功能严重抑制的患者（例如，HIV），并且通常通过抗逆转录病毒治疗而消退；它不是癌前病变。病理学通常显示副角化过度和增生性上皮伴病毒细胞病变效应（不是异型增生）。{{exhibit_4}}\n\n（选项E）显示良性角化过度和上皮增生甚至轻度异型增生的白斑可能会消退，尤其是在改变危险因素后（例如，停止使用烟草和酒精）。当存在严重或全层异型增生时（如本例），它不太可能自发消退。{{exhibit_5}}\n\n教育目标：\n口腔白斑是一种潜在的癌前病变；进展为浸润性癌的风险与异型增生的程度有关。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of oral leukoplakia, its association with tobacco and alcohol use, and the risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma, particularly when dysplasia is present. It also tests the ability to differentiate leukoplakia from other oral lesions based on clinical presentation and histopathology. \n\nThe best approach is to recognize the risk factors (tobacco, alcohol), identify the lesion as leukoplakia, understand the significance of dysplasia, and know that severe dysplasia has a high risk of progressing to invasive carcinoma with potential for cervical lymph node metastasis.",
