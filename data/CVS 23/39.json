    "en": "A 69-year-old man comes to the clinic due to a squeezing pressure in his midline chest and neck that occurs when walking. He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient is an ex-smoker with a 20-pack-year history. Coronary angiography shows extensive atherosclerosis and near-total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. Further testing shows normal resting left ventricular ejection fraction with no regional wall motion abnormalities. The absence of myocardial necrosis and scarring despite vessel occlusion in this patient can be best explained by which of the following features of the occluding plaque?",

    "en": "In response to progressive reductions in blood flow caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, ISCHEMIC myocardium may release growth factors (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor) to stimulate the formation and maturation of collateral vessels. In this patient, the slow development of a stable atherosclerotic plaque in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) likely allowed collateral vessels from the right coronary artery to supply the ischemic myocardium located distal to the LAD occlusion. Because there is low hydrostatic pressure distal to the LAD occlusion, a pressure gradient is created that facilitates blood flow through the small collateral vessels. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nAn unstable atherosclerotic plaque is less likely to allow the development of viable collateral vessels, as it is more likely to rupture before it becomes large enough to cause significant chronic ischemia; rupture leads to overlying thrombus and abrupt arterial occlusion with acute myocardial ischemia/infarction and cellular necrosis. The rapid development of ischemia allows insufficient time for collateral vessels to develop and mature.\n\n(Choices A, B, and F) Atherosclerotic plaques with active inflammation (containing activated macrophages that secrete metalloproteinases and degrade collagen), high core concentration of lipids, and/or a thin fibrous cap are unstable and more likely to rupture. All of these properties are less likely in an atherosclerotic lesion that has grown to create near-total occlusion without rupturing.\n\n(Choice C) A patient's total coronary artery calcium content correlates with the total atherosclerotic plaque burden, and calcium scoring by cardiac CT scan is sometimes used to estimate the severity of coronary artery disease. However, low calcium content (or immature calcification) within an individual plaque may decrease stability of that plaque and increase the likelihood of rupture.\n\n(Choice D) Ostial atherosclerotic plaques (those located at a branch point of 2 arteries) are more likely to occlude blood flow to multiple areas of myocardium, thereby limiting the availability of nearby well-perfused arteries from which viable collateral vessels can develop.\n\nEducational objective:\nGradually developing myocardial ischemia encourages the formation and maturation of collateral vessels and is most likely to occur in the setting of a slow-growing, stable atherosclerotic plaque. An unstable atherosclerotic plaque (eg, that with active inflammation, a lipid-rich core, and/or a thin fibrous cap) is more likely to rupture, resulting in the abrupt onset of ischemia/infarction that precludes the development of viable collateral vessels.",
    "zh": "为了应对动脉粥样硬化性冠心病引起的进行性血流减少，缺血性心肌可能会释放生长因子（例如，血管内皮生长因子）以刺激侧支血管的形成和成熟。在该患者中，左前降支动脉（LAD）中稳定动脉粥样硬化斑块的缓慢发展很可能使来自右冠状动脉的侧支血管能够为位于LAD闭塞远端的缺血性心肌供血。由于LAD闭塞远端存在低静水压，因此会产生压力梯度，从而促进血液流过小的侧支血管。{{exhibit_1}} \n\n 不稳定的动脉粥样硬化斑块不太可能促进有活力的侧支血管的发育，因为它更有可能在变得足够大以引起显着的慢性缺血之前破裂；破裂会导致血栓形成并突然出现动脉闭塞，伴有急性心肌缺血/梗死和细胞坏死。缺血的快速发展使得侧支血管没有足够的时间发育和成熟。\n\n（选项A、B和F）具有活动性炎症（包含分泌金属蛋白酶并降解胶原蛋白的活化巨噬细胞）、高核心脂质浓度和/或薄纤维帽的动脉粥样硬化斑块不稳定，更容易破裂。在未破裂的情况下生长以产生近乎完全闭塞的动脉粥样硬化病变中，所有这些特性都不太可能发生。\n\n（选项C）患者的冠状动脉总钙含量与动脉粥样硬化斑块的总负荷相关，有时通过心脏CT扫描进行的钙评分用于评估冠状动脉疾病的严重程度。然而，单个斑块内低钙含量（或不成熟钙化）可能会降低该斑块的稳定性并增加破裂的可能性。\n\n（选项D）开口处动脉粥样硬化斑块（位于2条动脉分叉点）更容易阻断流向多个心肌区域的血流，从而限制了附近血供良好的动脉（可从中形成有活力的侧支血管）的可用性。\n\n教育目标：\n逐渐发展的心肌缺血促进侧支血管的形成和成熟，并且最有可能发生在缓慢生长的稳定动脉粥样硬化斑块的环境中。不稳定的动脉粥样硬化斑块（例如，具有活动性炎症、富含脂质的核心和/或薄纤维帽的斑块）更有可能破裂，导致突然发作的缺血/梗死，从而妨碍有活力的侧支血管的发育。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of coronary artery disease pathophysiology, specifically the development of collateral circulation in response to chronic ischemia. It assesses understanding of plaque characteristics that promote stability and allow for collateral vessel formation. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the absence of myocardial necrosis despite a near-total occlusion suggests the presence of collateral circulation. This implies a slow-growing, stable plaque that allowed time for collateral vessels to develop, providing alternative blood supply to the ischemic myocardium.",
