    "en": "A 21-year-old man comes to the emergency department following an episode of syncope. The syncopal episode was not provoked by any activity or circumstance, nor was it preceded by lightheadedness. The patient has no significant past medical history and he is not taking any medications. An ECG obtained in the ER reveals QT-interval prolongation but is otherwise unremarkable. Assuming this is an inherited condition, the relevant mutation most likely affects which of the following structures?",

    "en": "This patient's sudden-onset syncopal episode suggests a sudden cardiac arrhythmia. QT prolongation in an otherwise healthy young individual is usually congenital. The mutation most likely to cause QT-interval prolongation can be determined based on an understanding of cardiac electrophysiology. On an ECG tracing, the QT interval begins at the start of the QRS complex and ends at the end of the T wave. Therefore, the QT-interval reflects the cardiac myocyte action potential duration, which is determined in part by potassium (K+) currents through channel proteins. The mutations listed in the other answer choices would be less likely to directly affect the cardiac cell action potential duration.\n\nThere are two important congenital syndromes that cause QT prolongation:\n\nJervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (autosomal recessive, with neurosensory deafness)\nRomano-Ward syndrome (more common, autosomal dominant, no deafness)\nBoth may predispose to torsades de pointes (a ventricular tachyarrhythmia) at a young age, causing syncopal episodes and possible sudden cardiac death.\n\n(Choices A and C) Mutations affecting cardiac cell cytoskeletal proteins or the mitochondrial enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation are thought to cause the genetic form of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). DCM usually presents with gradual onset of left-sided heart failure (with symptoms like dyspnea on exertion initially), as opposed to the sudden syncopal episode in a previously asymptomatic patient described above.\n\n(Choice B) Mutations in cardiac cell sarcomere proteins (e.g. beta-myosin heavy chain) underlie hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Although HCM may present as syncope in a previously asymptomatic young person, the syncope of HCM is typically provoked by exertion. Additionally, QT prolongation is not generally found in HCM.\n\n(Choice D) Mutations of a calcium-binding sarcoplasmic reticulum protein might underlie some cases of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a progressive fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricular myocardium of uncertain pathogenesis. QT prolongation is not generally seen with ARVC.\n\nEducational objective:\nUnprovoked syncope in a previously asymptomatic young person may result from a congenital QT prolongation syndrome. The two most important congenital syndromes with QT prolongation, Romano-Ward syndrome and Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, are thought to result from mutations in a K+ channel protein that contributes to the delayed rectifier current (Ikr) of the cardiac action potential.",
    "zh": "该患者的突发性晕厥提示存在突发性心律失常。一个健康年轻个体出现QT间期延长通常是先天性的。最有可能导致QT间期延长的突变可以根据对心脏电生理学的理解来确定。在心电图描记中，QT间期从QRS波群开始到T波结束。因此，QT间期反映了心肌细胞动作电位的持续时间，这部分由通过通道蛋白的钾离子(K+)电流决定。其他选项中列出的突变不太可能直接影响心肌细胞动作电位的持续时间。\n\n有两种重要的先天性综合征可导致QT间期延长：\n\nJervell和Lange-Nielsen综合征（常染色体隐性遗传，伴有神经感觉性耳聋）\nRomano-Ward综合征（更常见，常染色体显性遗传，无耳聋）\n两者都可能使年轻患者易患尖端扭转型室性心动过速（一种室性心律失常），引起晕厥发作，并可能导致猝死。\n\n（选项A和C）影响心肌细胞细胞骨架蛋白或氧化磷酸化相关的线粒体酶的突变被认为可导致扩张型心肌病(DCM)的遗传形式。DCM通常表现为左心衰竭的逐渐发生（最初出现劳力性呼吸困难等症状），这与上述之前无症状患者的突发性晕厥发作相反。\n\n（选项B）心肌细胞肌节蛋白（如β-肌球蛋白重链）的突变是肥厚型心肌病（HCM）的基础。虽然HCM可能表现为之前无症状年轻人的晕厥，但HCM的晕厥通常由劳力诱发。此外，通常在HCM中未发现QT间期延长。\n\n（选项D）钙结合型肌浆网蛋白的突变可能是一些致心律失常性右室心肌病（ARVC）病例的基础，ARVC是右心室心肌进行性纤维脂肪替代，其发病机制尚不明确。通常在ARVC中未发现QT间期延长。\n\n教育目标：\n既往无症状的年轻人的无诱发性晕厥可能由先天性QT间期延长综合征引起。认为导致QT间期延长的两个最重要的先天性综合征Romano-Ward综合征和Jervell和Lange-Nielsen综合征是由K+通道蛋白的突变引起的，该蛋白有助于心脏动作电位的延迟整流电流(Ikr)。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of congenital long QT syndrome, its genetic basis, and the underlying cardiac electrophysiology. It requires understanding how mutations in ion channel proteins can disrupt the cardiac action potential and lead to arrhythmias.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the association between unprovoked syncope and congenital QT prolongation. Recall that potassium channels play a crucial role in repolarization and the duration of the QT interval. Eliminate options that are more closely associated with other cardiomyopathies.",
