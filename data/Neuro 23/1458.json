    "en": "A 23-year-old man comes to the physician at his girlfriend's insistence. She says that the patient's frequent snoring keeps her up at night and that in the last 4 months he has twice fallen asleep while they were talking. In this same period, the patient says that he has regularly fallen asleep in the afternoon while reading or watching television but typically feels refreshed after a brief nap. When asked whether he experiences any other symptoms, the patient hesitantly reveals that he sometimes hears a voice call his name prior to falling asleep. He also reports uncharacteristic episodes of clumsiness in which he has suddenly dropped objects or fallen to his knees. Examination shows no abnormalities.",

    "en": "Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder characterized by frequent, overwhelming urges to sleep. It is commonly associated with cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone that occurs in response to intense (usually positive) emotions. Narcolepsy results from the depletion of hypocretin (also known as orexin)-secreting neurons in the lateral hypothalamus that are involved in maintaining wakefulness.\n\nPatients with narcolepsy experience shortened sleep latency and typically enter rapid eye movement (REM) sleep almost immediately. They commonly experience intrusions of REM sleep phenomena during sleep-wake transitions, including hypnagogic (upon falling asleep) and hypnopompic (upon awakening) hallucinations and sleep paralysis (inability to move immediately after awakening). The clinical diagnosis of narcolepsy can be confirmed by low cerebrospinal fluid levels of hypocretin-1 or shortened REM sleep latency on polysomnography.\n\n(Choice A) This patient is experiencing hypnagogic hallucinations, which are characteristic of narcolepsy. Brief psychotic disorder is diagnosed when one or more positive psychotic symptoms are present for less than a month in the absence of another medical disorder or substance use.\n\n(Choice B) Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder most often presents in adolescence and is characterized by intact duration and quality of sleep that is shifted to a later bedtime and wake time.\n\n(Choice C) Idiopathic hypersomnia is diagnosed when excessive and impairing daytime sleepiness cannot be explained by another sleep disorder. Patients with idiopathic hypersomnia have persistent daytime sleepiness rather than \"sleep attacks.\" Unlike patients with narcolepsy, they typically do not feel refreshed after naps.\n\n(Choice D) Insufficient sleep may result in excessive daytime sleepiness, napping, and quicker REM onset, but it is not associated with cataplexy or sleep-related hallucinations.\n\n(Choice F) Obstructive sleep apnea, the most common cause of excessive daytime sleepiness, is characterized by loud snoring, gasping, and apneas during sleep. It is caused by upper airway obstruction and is not associated with cataplexy, sleep-related hallucinations, or sleep paralysis.\n\n(Choice G) Patients with REM sleep behavior disorder lose normal sleep paralysis during REM sleep and, as a result, act out the content of their dreams (eg, punching, kicking).\n\nEducational objective:\nNarcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and REM sleep-related phenomena (ie, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis).",
    "zh": "发作性睡病是一种慢性睡眠障碍，其特征是频繁且无法控制的睡眠冲动。它通常与猝倒症相关，猝倒症是指对强烈（通常是积极的）情绪的反应而突然丧失肌张力。发作性睡病是由于侧脑下丘脑中分泌下丘脑素（也称为食欲素）的神经元耗竭所致，这些神经元参与维持清醒。\n\n发作性睡病患者的睡眠潜伏期缩短，并且通常几乎立即进入快速眼动（REM）睡眠。他们通常会在睡眠-觉醒转换期间经历REM睡眠现象的侵扰，包括入睡幻觉（入睡时）和觉醒幻觉（觉醒时）以及睡眠麻痹（觉醒后无法立即移动）。发作性睡病的临床诊断可以通过脑脊液中下丘脑素-1水平低或多导睡眠图上REM睡眠潜伏期缩短来确认。\n\n（选项A）该患者正在经历入睡幻觉，这是发作性睡病的特征。当存在一种或多种阳性精神病症状，且持续时间不到一个月，且不存在其他医学疾病或物质使用时，诊断为短暂性精神病障碍。\n\n（选项B）睡眠-觉醒时相延迟障碍最常出现在青春期，其特征是睡眠的持续时间和质量完整，但睡眠时间推迟到较晚的就寝时间和觉醒时间。\n\n（选项C）当无法用另一种睡眠障碍解释过度的、损害性的白天嗜睡时，诊断为特发性嗜睡。特发性嗜睡患者持续存在白天嗜睡，而不是“睡眠发作”。与发作性睡病患者不同，他们在小睡后通常不会感到神清气爽。\n\n（选项D）睡眠不足可能导致白天过度嗜睡、小睡和更快的REM睡眠启动，但它与猝倒症或睡眠相关幻觉无关。\n\n（选项F）阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停是最常见的白天过度嗜睡的原因，其特征是睡眠期间大声打鼾、喘息和呼吸暂停。它是由上呼吸道阻塞引起的，与猝倒症、睡眠相关幻觉或睡眠麻痹无关。\n\n（选项G）REM睡眠行为障碍患者在REM睡眠期间失去正常的睡眠麻痹，因此会表现出他们的梦境内容（例如，拳打脚踢）。\n\n教育目标：\n发作性睡病是一种慢性睡眠障碍，其特征是白天过度嗜睡、猝倒症和REM睡眠相关现象（即，入睡/觉醒幻觉，睡眠麻痹）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of narcolepsy, including its clinical presentation with excessive daytime sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations, and potential association with cataplexy. It also requires differentiating narcolepsy from other sleep disorders and psychiatric conditions.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations (hearing voices while falling asleep), and sudden loss of muscle tone (clumsiness). These findings are highly suggestive of narcolepsy, making it the most likely diagnosis.",
