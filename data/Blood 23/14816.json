  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and teardrop cells on peripheral blood smear likely has primary myelofibrosis, a hematopoietic stem cell malignancy associated with the clonal expansion of megakaryocytes. Neoplastic megakaryocytes secrete the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta, which stimulates bone marrow fibroblasts to fill the medullary space with collagen. Subsequent bone marrow fibrosis usually leads to the following:\n\n•\tExtramedullary hematopoiesis – Because the bone marrow is destroyed by fibrotic tissue, hematopoiesis occurs in secondary hematopoietic tissue such as the spleen and liver. This typically results in marked splenomegaly and a palpable liver edge on examination.\n\n•\tCytopenias – Extramedullary hematopoiesis is much less efficient than medullary hematopoiesis. Therefore, patients often have deficits in 1 or more cell lines (eg, anemia, pancytopenia).\n\n•\tDacrocytes on peripheral blood smear – The red cell membrane is damaged when squeezing out of the fibrotic bone marrow or passing through the enlarged spleen, which leads to the formation of teardrop-shaped red cells.\n\nThe diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis requires bone marrow examination. Bone marrow aspiration frequently results in a dry tap (no marrow) due to significant bone marrow fibrosis. Therefore, bone marrow biopsy is usually required: the presence of a diffusely fibrotic marrow with occasional clusters of atypical megakaryocytes confirms the diagnosis.\n\n(Choice B) Multiple myeloma, a clonal disorder of plasma cells, is marked by a monoclonal spike (M-spike) on protein electrophoresis. Patients typically have anemia, hypercalcemia, bone pain (osteolytic lesions), and renal insufficiency. Bone marrow biopsy usually shows a clusters of monoclonal plasma cells.\n\n(Choice C) Anemia of chronic disease is associated with hepcidin-induced changes in iron metabolism that cause iron trapping within macrophages. Bone marrow biopsy with Prussian blue stain demonstrates increased iron within macrophages. Hepatosplenomegaly and teardrop cells would be unexpected.\n\n(Choice D) Myelodysplastic syndrome is a malignant stem cell cancer associated with the production of dysplastic, atypical blood cells. Although most patients with myelodysplasia have cytopenias, the bone marrow is usually hypercellular with multi-lineage dysplasia.\n\n(Choice E) Aplastic anemia results from injury (eg, drugs, radiation, viruses) to multipotent hematologic stem cells. It is usually associated with pancytopenia and a profoundly hypocellular bone marrow predominantly composed of adipose tissue. Extramedullary hematopoiesis is minimal and hepatosplenomegaly and dacrocytes are not typically present.\n\nEducational objective:\nPrimary myelofibrosis is a myeloproliferative disorder associated with the clonal expansion of megakaryocytes. Bone marrow fibrosis accounts for most of the major manifestations, including hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, and blood smear evidence of dacrocytes. Bone marrow aspiration is usually dry, but bone marrow biopsy will show marked fibrosis with occasional clusters of atypical megakaryocytes.",
    "zh": "该患者出现全血细胞减少、肝脾肿大以及外周血涂片中的泪滴状细胞，提示可能患有原发性骨髓纤维化，这是一种与巨核细胞克隆性增殖相关的造血干细胞恶性肿瘤。肿瘤性巨核细胞分泌细胞因子转化生长因子-β，刺激骨髓成纤维细胞用胶原蛋白填充髓腔。随后的骨髓纤维化通常会导致以下情况：\n\n•\t髓外造血——由于骨髓被纤维化组织破坏，造血发生在继发性造血组织中，如脾脏和肝脏。这通常导致显著的脾肿大和体格检查中可触及的肝边缘。\n\n•\t细胞减少——髓外造血效率远低于骨髓造血。因此，患者通常存在一个或多个细胞系的缺陷（例如，贫血、全血细胞减少）。\n\n•\t外周血涂片中的泪滴状细胞——当红细胞膜从纤维化骨髓中挤出或通过肿大的脾脏时会受到损伤，从而导致形成泪滴状红细胞。\n\n原发性骨髓纤维化的诊断需要进行骨髓检查。由于严重的骨髓纤维化，骨髓穿刺经常导致干抽（无骨髓）。因此，通常需要进行骨髓活检：存在弥漫性纤维化骨髓，伴有散在的异型巨核细胞簇，可确诊。\n\n（选项B）多发性骨髓瘤是一种浆细胞克隆性疾病，其特征是在蛋白电泳上出现单克隆峰（M峰）。患者通常会出现贫血、高钙血症、骨痛（溶骨性病变）和肾功能不全。骨髓活检通常显示单克隆浆细胞簇。\n\n（选项C）慢性病贫血与调铁素诱导的铁代谢变化有关，这些变化导致铁被困在巨噬细胞内。普鲁士蓝染色的骨髓活检显示巨噬细胞内铁含量增加。肝脾肿大和泪滴状细胞通常不会出现。\n\n（选项D）骨髓增生异常综合征是一种恶性干细胞癌，与产生发育不良、非典型血细胞有关。尽管大多数骨髓增生异常综合征患者会出现细胞减少，但骨髓通常是高细胞性的，伴有多谱系发育异常。\n\n（选项E）再生障碍性贫血是由于多潜能造血干细胞受到损伤（例如，药物、放射线、病毒）所致。它通常与全血细胞减少和以脂肪组织为主的严重低细胞性骨髓有关。髓外造血极少，通常不存在肝脾肿大和泪滴状细胞。\n\n教学目标：原发性骨髓纤维化是一种骨髓增殖性疾病，与巨核细胞的克隆性增殖相关。骨髓纤维化是大多数主要表现的基础，包括肝脾肿大、细胞减少和外周血涂片中泪滴状细胞的证据。骨髓穿刺通常是干抽的，但骨髓活检将显示明显的纤维化，伴有散在的异型巨核细胞簇。"
