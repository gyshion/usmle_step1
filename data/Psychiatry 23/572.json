    "en": "A 34-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to a severe headache and blurry vision. His symptoms began suddenly after having lunch at a new Italian deli in his neighborhood. The patient says he \"ate a sandwich with lots of fancy meats and cheeses\" and drank an iced tea. His medical history is significant for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. He has no known medication or food allergies. Blood pressure is 210/130 mm Hg and heart rate is 110/min. On physical examination, he appears tremulous and diaphoretic. The medication used to treat this patient's depression most likely affects which of the following steps of monoamine neurotransmission? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient is presenting with symptoms of a hypertensive crisis, likely due to consuming tyramine-containing foods while on a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) for treatment-resistant depression. MAOIs work by inhibiting monoamine oxidase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down monoamines (like dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin). This inhibition leads to increased levels of these neurotransmitters. Tyramine, found in aged cheeses, cured meats, and draft beer, is normally broken down by MAO in the gut. When MAO is inhibited, tyramine enters the systemic circulation and causes a release of norepinephrine, leading to a hypertensive crisis. Therefore, the medication used to treat the patient's depression most likely affects monoamine breakdown.",
    "zh": "患者出现高血压危象的症状，这很可能是由于在服用单胺氧化酶抑制剂(MAOI)治疗难治性抑郁症时食用了含酪胺的食物。MAOI通过抑制单胺氧化酶起作用，单胺氧化酶是一种负责分解单胺（如多巴胺、去甲肾上腺素和血清素）的酶。这种抑制作用导致这些神经递质的水平升高。酪胺存在于陈年奶酪、腌制肉类和生啤中，通常在肠道中被MAO分解。当MAO被抑制时，酪胺进入全身循环并引起去甲肾上腺素的释放，从而导致高血压危象。因此，用于治疗患者抑郁症的药物最有可能影响单胺分解。"
