  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's symptomatic anemia (lethargy, exertional dyspnea, mucosal pallor, ejection murmur) and bone marrow biopsy showing decreased erythropoiesis (reduced erythrocyte precursors) raise suspicion for TRANSIENT APLASTIC CRISIS due to acute PARVOVIRUS B19 infection. \n\nParvovirus is a small, nonenveloped, DNA virus transmitted via the respiratory route that primarily attacks erythroid progenitor cells due to tropism for an erythrocyte cell surface receptor (P blood group antigen). Infection of erythroid progenitor cells prevents red blood cell maturation, leading to formation of abnormal giant pronormoblasts (several times larger than surrounding red blood cells) with glassy, intranuclear viral inclusions. The drop in red cell production often leads to a transient (1-2 week) drop in hematocrit. Although many patients are asymptomatic, individuals with underlying hemoglobin disorders (eg, SICKLE CELL ANEMIA) sometimes develop symptomatic anemia.\n\n(Choice B) Folate deficiency can be seen in patients with sickle cell disease due to increased erythropoiesis in response to chronic anemia. However, folate deficiency is characterized by macrocytic anemia and hypersegmented neutrophils; giant pronormoblasts with inclusions would not be seen.\n\n(Choice C) Hydroxyurea can sometimes interfere with normal erythropoiesis and result in macrocytic anemia. However, it is not associated with giant pronormoblasts with intranuclear inclusions.\n\n(Choice D) Patients with sickle cell disease who require repeated blood transfusion can sometimes develop secondary iron overload. Bone marrow biopsy would show increased iron stores.\n\n(Choice E) Exposure to toxic chemicals (eg, industrial solvents/chemicals, insecticides) can lead to aplastic anemia. However, bone marrow biopsy would show hypocellular marrow with a decrease in all cell types; the remaining hematopoietic cells would be morphologically normal.\n\nEducational objective:\nParvovirus B19 infection can cause transient aplastic crisis, particularly in those with underlying hemoglobin disorders such as sickle cell anemia. Patients develop symptomatic anemia (eg, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, low hematocrit) due to inhibition of erythropoiesis by the virus. Bone marrow examination will show giant pronormoblasts with glassy, intranuclear viral inclusions.",
    "zh": "该患者的症状性贫血（嗜睡、劳力性呼吸困难、黏膜苍白、喷射性杂音）和骨髓活检显示红细胞生成减少（红细胞前体细胞减少）提示可能因急性B19型细小病毒感染引起的短暂性再生障碍性危象。\n\n细小病毒是一种小型、无包膜的DNA病毒，通过呼吸道传播，由于对红细胞表面受体（P血型抗原）的嗜性，主要攻击红系祖细胞。红系祖细胞感染会阻止红细胞成熟，导致形成异常的巨幼红细胞原（比周围的红细胞大几倍），并具有玻璃样、核内病毒包涵体。红细胞生成的下降通常会导致血细胞比容的短暂（1-2周）下降。虽然许多患者无症状，但患有潜在血红蛋白疾病的个体（例如，镰状细胞性贫血）有时会发生症状性贫血。\n\n(选项B) 叶酸缺乏症可见于镰状细胞病患者，这是由于对慢性贫血的反应性红细胞生成增加。然而，叶酸缺乏症的特征是巨幼细胞性贫血和多分叶中性粒细胞；不会看到带有包涵体的巨幼红细胞原。\n\n(选项C) 羟基脲有时会干扰正常的红细胞生成，并导致巨幼细胞性贫血。然而，它与带有核内包涵体的巨幼红细胞原无关。\n\n(选项D) 需要反复输血的镰状细胞病患者有时会发生继发性铁超载。骨髓活检将显示铁储存增加。\n\n(选项E) 暴露于有毒化学物质（例如，工业溶剂/化学品、杀虫剂）可导致再生障碍性贫血。然而，骨髓活检将显示骨髓细胞减少，所有细胞类型均减少；剩余的造血细胞在形态学上是正常的。\n\n教育目标：\nB19型细小病毒感染可引起短暂性再生障碍性危象，尤其是在患有镰状细胞性贫血等潜在血红蛋白疾病的患者中。患者由于病毒对红细胞生成的抑制而出现症状性贫血（例如，劳力性呼吸困难、疲劳、血细胞比容低）。骨髓检查将显示带有玻璃样、核内病毒包涵体的巨幼红细胞原。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of transient aplastic crisis in patients with sickle cell disease, specifically caused by parvovirus B19 infection. It assesses the ability to recognize the clinical presentation and bone marrow findings associated with this condition.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the patient's sickle cell disease, the acute worsening of anemia, and the presence of giant pronormoblasts with inclusions on bone marrow biopsy. These findings are highly suggestive of parvovirus B19-induced transient aplastic crisis.",
