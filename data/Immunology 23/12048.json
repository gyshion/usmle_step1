    "en": "A 68-year-old man comes to the office for a follow-up appointment. He has a history of advanced melanoma that is unresectable and resistant to adjuvant regimens. The patient recently began receiving monoclonal antibody infusions for advanced melanoma. The monoclonal antibodies block a specific cell surface receptor found on T lymphocytes. As a result, T cells capable of recognizing tumor antigens have improved ability to destroy cancer cells.",

Pieces of these proteins (neoantigens) are displayed on the cell surface and may be recognized by cytotoxic T-cells as “non-self” (leading to cellular apoptosis). However, neoplastic cells can blunt the cytotoxic T-cell response through a variety of mechanisms including the overexpression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which binds to the PD-1 receptor on cytotoxic T cells and inhibits their ability to induce apoptosis (T-cell exhaustion).\n\nTreatment with monoclonal antibodies against PD-1 (eg, pembrolizumab, nivolumab) or PD-L1 (eg, atezolizumab) results in T-cell disinhibition and a restoration of the cytotoxic response (thereby increasing cancer cell apoptosis). Anti-PD-1 therapy is currently used in advanced melanoma, certain types of lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma but is being explored for many other cancer types.\n\n(Choices A and B) HIV uses chemokine coreceptor 5 (CCR5) to bind to CD4 cells. Antagonists to CCR5 have been developed for the management of patients with HIV. CCR5 also appears to promote CD4 cell anti-tumor responses, so antibodies blocking its function may downregulate immune-mediated tumor destruction. Blockade of CD4 itself would inhibit helper T-cell activation and reduce tumor cell destruction.\n\n(Choice C) CD19 is expressed primarily on B cells (not T cells) and is important for B-cell signaling and activation.\n\n(Choice D) CD28 is a T cell–specific surface protein that interacts with B7 on antigen-presenting cells, providing a costimulatory signal necessary for T-cell activation. Therefore, antibodies blocking CD28 would inhibit T-cell activation. CTLA-4 also binds to B7 but has an inhibitory function on activated T cells.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe binding of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) to one of its ligands (programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) downregulates the immune response by inhibiting cytotoxic T cells. Many types of cancers evade immunodetection by increasing expression of PD-L1 on their surface. Monoclonal antibodies against PD-1 upregulate the T-cell response and promote tumor cell apoptosis.\n\nReferences\n\n•\tEvolving concepts: immunity in oncology from targets to treatments. {{exhibit_2}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cancer immunotherapy, specifically the mechanism of action of anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies in treating advanced melanoma. It requires understanding how these antibodies block the PD-1 receptor on T cells, thereby enhancing the cytotoxic T-cell response against tumor cells.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the information provided about monoclonal antibodies targeting T lymphocytes. Recognize that the treatment aims to enhance T-cell activity against cancer cells, which points to blocking an inhibitory receptor like PD-1 rather than activating or targeting other cell types.",
