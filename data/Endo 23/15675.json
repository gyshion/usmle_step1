    "en": "A 58-year-old man comes to the office for evaluation of a foot wound. The patient noticed a small ulcer on the bottom of his right foot a week ago but recalls no significant foot injury. He has been applying antiseptics, but the wound has failed to heal. The patient has a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is nonadherent to medical therapy. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. Temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F), blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 72/min. Right lower extremity examination shows a 1-cm (0.39-in) plantar ulcer under the first metatarsal head. There are no other lesions, and the tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses are normal. {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a plantar ulcer under the first metatarsal head. In a patient with chronic, poorly controlled DIABETES MELLITUS, this is likely a NEUROPATHIC ULCER due to underlying peripheral SENSORY NEUROPATHY. Chronic hyperglycemia promotes nerve injury and impairs nerve repair in distal sensory fibers, causing decreased sensation of pain, pressure, and proprioception.\n\nLoss of these protective senses can cause individuals to not recognize an injury due to minor trauma, friction, or pressure. Areas that are particularly susceptible are points of localized pressure created by a shoe or weight-bearing bones of the foot (eg, plantar surface of the first metatarsal head). A wound in this area often goes unnoticed (due to lack of pain sensation and being hidden by socks or shoes) and can develop into a nonhealing foot ulcer.\n\nLoss of proprioception and an increase in ligamentous laxity can also cause chronic pressure-induced joint/skin damage in the feet of patients with diabetic neuropathy, which can lead to calluses or foot deformities (eg, Charcot foot, hammer toe). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}\n\n(Choice A) Although diabetic patients (especially those who smoke) often have comorbid arterial insufficiency, arterial ulcers are typically painful, sharply demarcated, and located at the tips of the toes. This patient has full distal pulses, which makes clinically significant atherosclerotic disease unlikely to be the primary cause of the ulcer.\n\n(Choice B) Bacterial infection may delay ulcer healing, especially if there is underlying osteomyelitis, but it is not the inciting cause of neuropathic ulcers. In addition, although diabetic ulcers are often colonized by bacteria, this patient has no fever, erythema, or purulent drainage to suggest serious infection.\n\n(Choice C) Irritant contact dermatitis presents with pruritic or painful erythema in areas of exposed skin (eg, hands). It can occasionally cause small vesicles or fissures, but ulcers are not typical.\n\n(Choice E) Systemic vasculitic disorders (eg, polyarteritis nodosa) are an uncommon cause of skin ulcers. Vasculitic ulcers are usually painful and associated with other skin (eg, purpura, nodules) and systemic (eg, fever, fatigue) symptoms.\n\n(Choice F) Ulcers caused by venous insufficiency are most common over the tibias or proximal to the medial malleolus. They present as irregular ulcerations in the setting of stasis dermatitis and/or varicose veins.\n\nEducational objective:\nNeuropathic foot ulcers can occur in diabetic patients when loss of pain sensation and proprioception delays recognition of injury due to trauma, friction, or sustained pressure (on plantar surface of foot bones). The risk is greatest in patients with longstanding diabetes who have poor glycemic control.",
    "zh": "该患者第一跖骨头下有跖骨溃疡。在患有慢性、控制不佳的糖尿病的患者中，这很可能是神经病变性溃疡，是由于潜在的周围感觉神经病变所致。慢性高血糖会促进神经损伤，并损害远端感觉纤维的神经修复，从而导致疼痛、压力和本体感觉的降低。\n\n这些保护性感觉的丧失会导致个体无法识别由轻微创伤、摩擦或压力引起的损伤。特别容易受到影响的区域是由鞋子或足部承重骨产生的局部压力点（例如，第一跖骨头的跖侧面）。该区域的伤口常常未被发现（由于缺乏疼痛感，且被袜子或鞋子遮盖），并可能发展为不愈合的足部溃疡。\n\n本体感觉的丧失和韧带松弛的增加也会导致糖尿病神经病变患者的足部发生慢性压力引起的关节/皮肤损伤，从而导致老茧或足部畸形（例如，夏科足、锤状趾）。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}\n\n（选项A）尽管糖尿病患者（特别是吸烟者）通常合并有动脉功能不全，但动脉溃疡通常会引起疼痛，边界清楚，且位于脚趾尖端。该患者远端脉搏饱满，这使得具有临床意义的动脉粥样硬化性疾病不太可能是溃疡的主要原因。\n\n（选项B）细菌感染可能会延迟溃疡愈合，特别是在存在潜在的骨髓炎时，但它不是神经病变性溃疡的诱因。此外，尽管糖尿病溃疡通常会被细菌定植，但该患者没有发烧、红斑或脓性引流，表明没有严重感染。\n\n（选项C）刺激性接触性皮炎表现为暴露皮肤区域（例如，手）出现瘙痒或疼痛性红斑。它偶尔会导致小的水疱或裂隙，但溃疡并不常见。\n\n（选项E）全身性血管炎疾病（例如，结节性多动脉炎）是皮肤溃疡的罕见原因。血管炎性溃疡通常会引起疼痛，并与其他皮肤（例如，紫癜、结节）和全身性（例如，发烧、疲劳）症状相关。\n\n（选项F）由静脉功能不全引起的溃疡最常见于胫骨上方或内踝近端。它们表现为在淤滞性皮炎和/或静脉曲张背景下的不规则溃疡。\n\n教育目的：\n当糖尿病患者的疼痛感和本体感觉丧失延迟了由于创伤、摩擦或持续压力（在足骨的跖侧面）导致的损伤的识别时，神经病变性足部溃疡可发生。长期患有糖尿病且血糖控制不佳的患者的风险最高。"
