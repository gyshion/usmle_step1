  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Patients commonly use herbal preparations and dietary supplements. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates dietary supplements, the regulations are less strict than those for prescription and over-the-counter medications. Some herbal products have established safety and/or efficacy, but there are few quality assurances regarding the content and purity of many herbal supplements, and unknown toxic ingredients may cause adverse effects and dangerous drug interactions. For example, the herbal supplement ephedra, marketed as a diet pill and energy booster, was banned by the FDA in 2004 due to the risk of cardiovascular complications (eg, increased blood pressure, myocardial infarction, stroke). However, ephedra-containing products are still readily available through the Internet.\n\nIt is important for physicians to routinely inquire about the use of these products, both to understand why patients are using them and to evaluate the risks and benefits of continued use. This patient should be supported in her weight-loss efforts and her use of supplements should not be immediately dismissed. The physician should instead assess the ingredients for contraindications or drug interactions and then provide counsel regarding the potential risks, especially given her medical history.\n\n(Choice A) Although the physician should work with the patient to develop a comprehensive weight-loss plan, including behavioral approaches to weight loss, this response is dismissive and does not take into account the use of supplements, which this patient is likely to continue taking.\n\n(Choices B and E) Supporting the patient's continued use of the supplement or merely cautioning her to avoid additional caffeine, without assessing the supplement for dangerous ingredients such as ephedra, does not adequately address safety concerns.\n\n(Choice C) The patient may interpret this response as discouraging her efforts to lose weight, negatively impacting rapport with the physician. In addition, it does not address the risks or benefits of the supplement itself.",
    "zh": "患者通常使用草药制剂和膳食补充剂。虽然美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）监管膳食补充剂，但其法规不如处方药和非处方药严格。一些草药产品已确立安全性和/或有效性，但对于许多草药补充剂的成分和纯度，几乎没有质量保证，未知的有毒成分可能会导致不良反应和危险的药物相互作用。例如，草药补充剂麻黄，作为减肥药和能量增强剂销售，于2004年被FDA禁止，原因是存在心血管并发症的风险（如血压升高、心肌梗死、中风）。然而，含麻黄的产品仍然可以通过互联网轻松获得。\n\n对于医生来说，定期询问这些产品的使用情况非常重要，既要了解患者使用它们的原因，又要评估持续使用的风险和益处。应该支持患者的减肥努力，不应立即否定她使用补充剂的行为。医生应评估其成分是否存在禁忌症或药物相互作用，然后就潜在风险提供建议，特别是考虑到她的病史。\n\n（选项A）尽管医生应该与患者合作制定全面的减肥计划，包括行为方法来减肥，但这种回应是轻视的，并且没有考虑到补充剂的使用，而患者很可能继续服用这些补充剂。\n\n（选项B和E）支持患者继续使用该补充剂或仅警告她避免摄入额外的咖啡因，而没有评估该补充剂是否存在麻黄等危险成分，并没有充分解决安全问题。\n\n（选项C）患者可能会将此回应解读为阻碍她减肥的努力，从而对医生产生负面影响。此外，它也没有解决补充剂本身的风险或益处。"
