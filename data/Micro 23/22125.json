    "en": "This patient's immigration history, new seizure, and brain calcifications indicate NEUROCYSTICERCOSIS, an infection caused by *Taenia solium* (pork tapeworm) eggs. Although rare in the United States, cases are common in rural regions of the developing world (eg, South and Central America, sub-Saharan Africa, Asia) where pigs roam freely in human waste.\n\nHumans develop *T solium* tapeworm infection following ingestion of larvae in undercooked pork. The larvae mature into adult worms in the gastrointestinal tract and shed thousands of eggs in the stool. Cysticercosis occurs when humans ingest *T solium* eggs in contaminated food or water. The eggs hatch in the small intestine, invade the bowel wall, and lodge in tissue (eg, muscle, brain, eyes). Symptoms are rarely initially but may develop months or years later when the cysts degrade.\n\nMost cases present with adult-onset seizure due to an intraparenchymal cyst in the brain. Examination, laboratory evaluation, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis tend to be normal. However, imaging usually reveals ≥1 cysts in various stages of viability, as follows:\n\n*   Viable cysts are round, hypodense, and nonenhancing.\n*   Degenerating cysts are enhancing with surrounding tissue edema.\n*   Nonviable cysts are small, solid, and calcified.\n\nA scolex, the anterior portion of the worm with suckers and hooks, is sometimes visible and is pathognomonic for the condition.\n\n(Choice A) Cryptococcal meningitis, a yeast infection common in patients with AIDS, usually presents with subacute fever, malaise, and headache. CSF evaluation usually shows increased pressure, mildly elevated leukocyte count, and low glucose level. Imaging may reveal hydrocephalus, but focal lesions (eg, calcifications) indicate an alternate diagnosis.\n\n(Choice B) Tuberculosis can spread to the CNS and form a tuberculoma. Although patients may develop seizure, CSF usually shows lymphocyte-predominant pleocytosis and elevated protein. In addition, neuroimaging will show ring-enhancing lesions.\n\n(Choice D) Neurosyphilis can cause meningovascular disease early after infection and tabes dorsalis or general paresis years later. However, seizures are fairly uncommon, and CSF evaluation typically shows lymphocyte-predominant pleocytosis and elevated protein.\n\n(Choice E) Toxoplasmosis is most common in patients with AIDS. Although seizure may occur, neuroimaging usually reveals ring-enhancing lesions, not calcifications. Patients also typically have fever. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者的移民史、新发癫痫发作和脑钙化提示神经囊尾蚴病，这是一种由猪带绦虫（*Taenia solium*）卵引起的感染。尽管在美国很少见，但在发展中国家（例如，南美洲和中美洲、撒哈拉以南非洲、亚洲）的农村地区，猪可以在人类粪便中自由游荡，这种情况很常见。\n\n人类在摄入未煮熟的猪肉中的幼虫后会发生*T solium*绦虫感染。幼虫在胃肠道中发育为成虫，并在粪便中排出数千个卵。当人类摄入被污染的食物或水中的*T solium*卵时，就会发生囊尾蚴病。卵在小肠中孵化，侵入肠壁，并进入组织（例如，肌肉、大脑、眼睛）。最初很少有症状，但囊肿退化后数月或数年可能会出现症状。\n\n大多数病例表现为成人起病的癫痫发作，这是由于脑内实质囊肿引起的。检查、实验室评估和脑脊液（CSF）分析通常是正常的。然而，影像学检查通常显示≥1个处于不同存活阶段的囊肿，如下所示：\n\n*   活囊肿呈圆形，低密度，无强化。\n*   退化囊肿有强化，伴有周围组织水肿。\n*   不可存活的囊肿较小、实性且钙化。\n\n虫体的前端部分，带有吸盘和钩，有时可见，并且是该疾病的特征性表现。\n\n（选项A）隐球菌性脑膜炎，这是一种在艾滋病患者中常见的酵母菌感染，通常表现为亚急性发热、不适和头痛。脑脊液评估通常显示压力升高、轻度白细胞计数升高和葡萄糖水平降低。影像学检查可能显示脑积水，但局灶性病变（例如，钙化）表明另一种诊断。\n\n（选项B）结核病可以扩散到中枢神经系统并形成结核瘤。虽然患者可能会出现癫痫发作，但脑脊液通常显示淋巴细胞占优势的细胞增多和蛋白质升高。此外，神经影像学检查将显示环状强化病灶。\n\n（选项D）神经梅毒可在感染早期引起脑膜血管疾病，并在多年后引起脊髓痨或全身性麻痹。然而，癫痫发作相当罕见，脑脊液评估通常显示淋巴细胞占优势的细胞增多和蛋白质升高。\n\n（选项E）弓形虫病在艾滋病患者中最常见。虽然可能发生癫痫发作，但神经影像学检查通常显示环状强化病灶，而不是钙化。患者通常也有发热。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of neurocysticercosis, its etiology, presentation, diagnosis, and association with immigration history. It also tests the ability to differentiate it from other infectious causes of seizures and brain lesions. \n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's immigration history, the presence of seizures, and the CT scan findings. Recognize that neurocysticercosis is common in certain regions and presents with calcified lesions on imaging, while other options have different CSF findings or imaging characteristics.",
