    "en": "This patient with fever, pulmonary symptoms, and a lobar consolidation on chest X-ray has pneumonia. The presence of gram-positive diplococci in the sputum indicates the underlying pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Over 90 strains of S pneumoniae have been identified; they are distinguished based on antigenic variations in the capsular polysaccharide, the major virulence factor of the bacteria. Antibodies against the polysaccharide capsule are generated during infection and provide long-lasting immunity against that strain.\n\nThe pneumococcal vaccine contains polysaccharide antigens from the most common disease-causing serotypes leading to the generation of protective antibodies against these strains. In the United States, 2 types of pneumococcal vaccinations are available:\n\n1.  Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine contains capsular material from 23 serotypes. Because polysaccharides cannot be displayed by the major histocompatibility complex of antigen-presenting cells (only peptides can), immunogenicity to this vaccine is T-cell independent and generates a mild antibody response with no memory cells. Although polysaccharide vaccines are fairly effective for most adult patients, they are not useful for infants (age <2).\n\n2.  Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine consists of capsular polysaccharides from 13 serotypes that have been covalently attached to recombinant, inactivated diphtheria toxin. Protein conjugation allows the polysaccharide to be displayed by the major histocompatibility complex and induces a much stronger immunogenic response that involves T-cell–mediated B-lymphocyte activation. This generates high- affinity IgG antibodies and memory B-cells and also creates mucosal IgA antibodies, which reduce colonization rates.\n\nPneumococcal vaccination significantly reduces the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease. Routine vaccination is recommended for all children as part of their childhood immunization series. Adults age >65 and those at high risk for invasive disease (eg, HIV, asplenia, other immunosuppressed states) should also be vaccinated.\n\n(Choice A) Histoplasma is a fungal infection that is primarily transmitted by inhalation of particles from soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings. Diagnosis is usually made by urine or serum antigen testing, but yeasts can sometimes be identified on histology/culture using specialized stains.\n\n(Choice B) Close contacts of patients who have pertussis should be given antibiotic chemoprophylaxis. Pertussis is a gram-negative encapsulated coccobacillus; infected adults usually develop a few weeks of malaise and rhinorrhea followed by several weeks of severe, paroxysmal cough.\n\n(Choice C) The influenza vaccine contains 3 or 4 strains of inactivated influenza virus. Influenza usually causes abrupt-onset fever, headache, myalgia, and malaise and would not appear on Gram stain.\n\n(Choice D) Legionella is a common cause of atypical pneumonia and is usually transmitted by contaminated water systems. However, Legionella is a gram-negative bacterium (not a gram-positive diplococcus) and is usually diagnosed with urine antigen testing.\n\nEducational objective:\nStreptococcus pneumoniae vaccination reduces the risk of invasive disease and is recommended for young patients and the elderly. The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is an unconjugated vaccine that induces a T- cell–independent humoral immune response. In contrast, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine contains polysaccharide material attached to a protein antigen, which creates a robust T-cell–mediated humoral immune response.",
    "zh": "该患者出现发热、肺部症状和胸部X光片上的肺叶实变，患有肺炎。痰液中存在革兰阳性双球菌表明潜在的病原体是肺炎链球菌，这是社区获得性肺炎的主要病因。已经鉴定了90多种肺炎链球菌菌株；它们是根据荚膜多糖（细菌的主要毒力因子）的抗原变异进行区分的。针对多糖荚膜的抗体在感染期间产生，并提供针对该菌株的持久免疫力。\n\n肺炎球菌疫苗含有来自最常见致病血清型的多糖抗原，从而产生针对这些菌株的保护性抗体。在美国，有两种类型的肺炎球菌疫苗可用：\n\n1. 肺炎球菌多糖疫苗包含来自23种血清型的荚膜物质。由于多糖不能被抗原呈递细胞的主要组织相容性复合物（只有肽可以）呈递，因此这种疫苗的免疫原性是T细胞非依赖性的，并产生轻度的抗体反应，没有记忆细胞。虽然多糖疫苗对大多数成年患者相当有效，但对婴儿（<2岁）无效。\n\n2. 肺炎球菌结合疫苗由来自13种血清型的荚膜多糖组成，这些多糖已共价连接到重组、灭活的白喉毒素上。蛋白质偶联允许多糖被主要组织相容性复合物呈递，并诱导更强的免疫原性反应，其中涉及T细胞介导的B淋巴细胞活化。这会产生高亲和力的IgG抗体和记忆B细胞，并产生粘膜IgA抗体，从而降低定植率。\n\n肺炎球菌疫苗接种可显著降低侵袭性肺炎球菌疾病的风险。建议所有儿童将其作为儿童免疫接种系列的一部分进行常规接种。年龄>65岁的成年人和患有侵袭性疾病高风险的人群（例如，HIV、无脾、其他免疫抑制状态）也应接种疫苗。\n\n（选项A）组织胞浆菌病是一种真菌感染，主要通过吸入受鸟类或蝙蝠粪便污染的土壤中的颗粒传播。通常通过尿液或血清抗原检测进行诊断，但有时可以使用特殊染色在组织学/培养物中识别酵母菌。\n\n（选项B）应给予百日咳患者的密切接触者抗生素化学预防。百日咳是一种革兰阴性荚膜球杆菌；感染的成年人通常会出现几周的乏力、鼻溢，然后是几周的严重阵发性咳嗽。\n\n（选项C）流感疫苗包含3或4种灭活的流感病毒毒株。流感通常会导致突发性发热、头痛、肌痛和不适，并且不会出现在革兰染色上。\n\n（选项D）军团菌是异型肺炎的常见病因，通常通过受污染的水系统传播。但是，军团菌是一种革兰阴性菌（不是革兰阳性双球菌），通常通过尿液抗原检测进行诊断。\n\n教育目标：\n肺炎链球菌疫苗接种可降低侵袭性疾病的风险，建议年轻人和老年人接种。肺炎球菌多糖疫苗是一种未结合疫苗，可诱导T细胞非依赖性体液免疫反应。相比之下，肺炎球菌结合疫苗含有连接到蛋白质抗原的多糖物质，从而产生强大的T细胞介导的体液免疫反应。"

It assesses understanding of the different types of pneumococcal vaccines and their mechanisms of action. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the gram-positive diplococci in the sputum, which points to Streptococcus pneumoniae.
