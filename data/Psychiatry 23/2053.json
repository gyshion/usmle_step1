    "en": "A 48-year-old man begins psychotherapy due to depression and escalating conflicts with his boss. He makes progress in the therapy sessions and reports feeling less depressed. The patient has also gained insight into how his father was rarely available to him while growing up and recently told his father, \"I am angry that you were never there for me.\" The following week, the psychiatrist unexpectedly cancels a session to attend to an emergency. At the next appointment, the patient says, \"I feel as if you are not interested in listening to me, like I am not your priority.\"",

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Transference is the unconscious shifting of emotions or desires associated with a person from the past to another person in the present. Transference emotions often originate from feelings toward early significant figures, particularly parents. When the psychiatrist cancels the session unexpectedly, the patient's negative childhood experiences with his unavailable father are activated and unconsciously brought into the present with the psychiatrist.\n\nTransference can be positive or negative and frequently affects doctor-patient relationships (both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric). Positive transference plays a role in patients trusting their physicians as many patients have a positive expectation that doctors are compassionate caregivers (similar to their parents). Patients who were abused as children sometimes have difficulty seeking care or complying with the care they receive due to negative expectations of being taken advantage of or being harmed by a caregiving figure.\n\n(Choice A) Acting out, unconscious feelings or impulses are expressed through actions (eg, if this patient had impulsively broken items in the psychiatrist's office due to rage at his perceived abandonment).\n\n(Choice B) In displacement, a person expresses unacceptable feelings intended for one person to a more neutral person or object (eg, if this patient did not express his anger to his father and instead berated the psychiatrist). Because the patient disclosed his anger to his father directly, he would not be using displacement.\n\n(Choice C) Projection involves misattributing one's own unacceptable feelings to another person (eg, if the patient were unable to acknowledge his disappointment toward his psychiatrist about canceling and instead perceived his psychiatrist as being upset with him).\n\n(Choice D) In reaction formation, uncomfortable feelings are transformed into their opposites (eg, if this patient expressed deep appreciation for the psychiatrist's care rather than acknowledging his disappointment).\n\n(Choice E) Regression is a defense mechanism in which an individual returns to an earlier level of functioning to alleviate psychological distress (eg, if the patient sulked and refused to speak rather than maturely discussing his feelings with the psychiatrist).\n\nEducational objective: Transference is the unconscious shifting of emotions associated with a significant person from one's past to a person in the present.",
    "zh": "移情是将与过去某人相关的感受或欲望无意识地转移到现在的另一个人身上。移情情绪通常源于对早期重要人物，特别是父母的感受。当精神科医生意外取消会诊时，患者与无法陪伴他的父亲的负面童年经历被激活，并无意识地带入到与精神科医生的互动中。\n\n移情可以是积极的或消极的，并且经常影响医患关系（包括精神病学和非精神病学）。积极的移情在患者信任他们的医生方面起着作用，因为许多患者对医生是富有同情心的护理人员（类似于他们的父母）抱有积极的期望。童年遭受虐待的患者有时会由于对被占便宜或被护理者伤害的负面期望而难以寻求护理或遵守他们接受的护理。\n\n（选项A）行动化，无意识的感觉或冲动通过行动表达（例如，如果该患者由于对他的被抛弃的愤怒而冲动地打破了精神科医生的办公室里的物品）。\n\n（选项B）在移置中，一个人将针对一个人的不可接受的感受表达给一个更中立的人或物体（例如，如果该患者没有向他的父亲表达愤怒，而是斥责了精神科医生）。因为患者直接向他的父亲表达了他的愤怒，所以他不会使用移置。\n\n（选项C）投射涉及将自己不可接受的感受归因于另一个人（例如，如果患者无法承认他对精神科医生取消会诊的失望，而是认为精神科医生对他感到不安）。\n\n（选项D）在反向形成中，不舒服的感觉转化为它们的对立面（例如，如果该患者对精神科医生的关怀表示深深的感谢，而不是承认他的失望）。\n\n（选项E）退行是一种防御机制，在这种机制中，个体恢复到早期水平的功能以减轻心理困扰（例如，如果患者闷闷不乐，拒绝说话，而不是成熟地与精神科医生讨论他的感受）。\n\n教育目标：移情是将与过去重要人物相关的感受无意识地转移到现在的人身上。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of defense mechanisms in psychotherapy, specifically identifying transference as a response to a therapist's actions. It requires differentiating transference from other defense mechanisms like acting out, displacement, projection, reaction formation, and regression based on the patient's stated feelings and the clinical scenario.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully analyze the patient's statement in the context of his past experiences and the therapist's actions. Identify the core emotion being expressed and consider how it relates to his relationship with his father. Then, evaluate each defense mechanism to determine which best describes the patient's unconscious redirection of feelings from his father to his psychiatrist.",
    "zh": "本题测试对心理治疗中防御机制的理解，特别是将移情识别为对治疗师行为的反应。它要求根据患者陈述的感受和临床情况，区分移情与其他防御机制，如行动化、移置、投射、反向形成和退行。\n\n要解决这个问题，请仔细分析患者的陈述，结合他的过去经历和治疗师的行为。确定正在表达的核心情感，并考虑它与他与父亲的关系有何关系。然后，评估每种防御机制，以确定哪一种最能描述患者将感觉从父亲无意识地转移到精神科医生身上的情况。"
