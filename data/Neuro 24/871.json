On arrival of emergency medical services, she is found to have no pulse or spontaneous respirations and is declared dead. Autopsy shows a large thrombus occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery. Additional cerebral findings are shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}. Which of the following most accurately describes the pathogenesis of this patient's brain lesion?",

    "en": "The autopsy findings of a large thrombus occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery, coupled with cerebral findings consistent with an old cerebral infarct {{exhibit_2}}, explain the patient's neurologic symptoms. Interruption in blood supply to an area of the brain (eg, thrombosis, embolism) induces irreversible ischemic changes in neurons. Release of LYSOSOMAL ENZYMES from ischemic neurons and responding inflammatory cells (eg, neutrophils, macrophages) results in tissue degradation in the affected region (LIQUEFACTIVE NECROSIS). Over time, phagocytic cells remove the necrotic tissue, leaving a cavity, while astrocytes proliferate around the periphery to form a scar (gliosis).\n\nLiquefactive necrosis is characteristic of irreversible CNS injury because of the brain's high cholesterol content and lack of supporting architecture. It also occurs in other body tissues in the setting of severe infection/inflammation (eg, bacterial abscess) due to massive release of hydrolytic enzymes from reacting inflammatory cells.\n\n(Choice A) Early fibroblast migration to an area of injury occurs outside of the CNS and results in the formation of granulation tissue and fibrous scarring. In the CNS, tissue repair and scar formation are performed by astrocytes.\n\n(Choice B) A granulomatous reaction against parasites within the CNS occurs in neurocysticercosis. However, multiple cystic lesions or residual calcified granulomas would be expected.\n\n(Choice C) Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease characterized grossly by multiple periventricular lesions (ie, demyelinating plaques). Cystic cavity formation does not occur.\n\n(Choice D) Although glioblastoma can present with areas of cystic necrosis on gross examination, these areas classically are part of a diffuse, poorly delineated, heterogeneous mass with midline shift away from the affected tissue.\n\nEducational objective:\nLIQUEFACTIVE NECROSIS is characterized by complete digestion and removal of necrotic tissue with formation of a cystic cavity. Irreversible ischemic CNS injury is typically followed by liquefactive necrosis due to the release of lysosomal enzymes from inflammatory cells and damaged neurons.",
    "zh": "尸检结果显示，左前降冠状动脉被大血栓阻塞，加上与旧脑梗死相符的脑部发现{{exhibit_2}}，解释了患者的神经系统症状。大脑某区域的血液供应中断（例如，血栓形成，栓塞）会导致神经元发生不可逆的缺血性改变。缺血神经元和反应性炎性细胞（例如，中性粒细胞，巨噬细胞）释放溶酶体酶会导致受影响区域的组织降解（液化性坏死）。随着时间的推移，吞噬细胞清除坏死组织，留下一个空腔，而星形胶质细胞在周围增生形成瘢痕（神经胶质增生）。\n\n液化性坏死是不可逆的 CNS 损伤的特征，因为它的大脑胆固醇含量高且缺乏支撑结构。它也发生在其他身体组织中，在严重感染/炎症（例如，细菌性脓肿）的情况下，由于反应性炎性细胞大量释放水解酶。\n\n（选项 A）成纤维细胞早期迁移到损伤区域发生在 CNS 之外，导致肉芽组织和纤维瘢痕的形成。在 CNS 中，组织修复和瘢痕形成由星形胶质细胞完成。\n\n（选项 B）针对 CNS 内寄生虫的肉芽肿反应发生在神经囊尾蚴病中。然而，预计会出现多个囊性病变或残余钙化肉芽肿。\n\n（选项 C）多发性硬化症是一种慢性炎症性脱髓鞘疾病，其特征是在大体上表现为多个室周病变（即，脱髓鞘斑块）。不会发生囊性空腔形成。\n\n（选项 D）虽然胶质母细胞瘤在大体检查中可表现为囊性坏死区域，但这些区域通常是弥漫性、界限不清、异质性肿块的一部分，中线偏离受影响的组织。\n\n教育目标：\n液化性坏死的特征是完全消化和清除坏死组织，形成囊性空腔。不可逆的缺血性 CNS 损伤通常会继发液化性坏死，这归因于炎性细胞和受损神经元释放溶酶体酶。"
