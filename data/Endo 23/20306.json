    "en": "A 28-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 1, comes to the office for a follow-up appointment 4 months after giving birth to a healthy boy. For the past 3 weeks the patient has had progressive fatigue associated with loss of interest in day-to-day activities, irritability, and poor concentration. In the 2 weeks prior to the onset of fatigue, she experienced excessive sweating and palpitations. Blood pressure is 140/74 mm Hg and pulse is 60/min. The thyroid gland is firm, diffusely enlarged, and nontender. Laboratory results show elevated serum TSH and low free T4. {{exhibit_1}} Which of the following pathological processes is likely responsible for this patient's condition?",

    "en": "This patient has primary hypothyroidism, presenting with a low serum thyroxine level and elevated TSH, associated with fatigue and neurocognitive symptoms. Immediately preceding this, she had symptoms suggesting hyperthyroidism (ie, palpitation, diaphoresis). In light of her recent childbirth, this phase of thyroid dysfunction is most consistent with postpartum thyroiditis.\n\nPostpartum thyroiditis {{exhibit_2}} occurs within 12 months of pregnancy and is characterized by AUTOIMMUNE DESTRUCTION of thyroid follicles similar to that seen in chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. It typically begins with a hyperthyroid phase due to RELEASE OF PREFORMED THYROID HORMONE, followed by a transient hypothyroid phase due to depletion of thyroid hormone and an eventual return to a euthyroid state.\n\nPostpartum thyroiditis is associated with high titers of antithyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin autoantibodies. Histologic inspection demonstrates lymphocytic infiltration, sometimes with formation of germinal centers. Breakdown of follicle margins and loss of colloid may also be seen.\n\n(Choice A) Riedel thyroiditis is a rare disorder characterized by extensive fibrosis of the thyroid that extends into surrounding tissues. The thyroid gland is hard and fixed. Hypothyroidism is common but is not typically preceded by a hyperthyroid phase.\n\n(Choices B and E) Granulomatous inflammation in the pituitary can occur as a primary phenomenon or secondary to systemic granulomatous disorders (eg, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis). Lymphocytic hypophysitis is an uncommon disorder that also occurs with increased frequency in postpartum women. Both of these disorders can cause secondary/central hypothyroidism due to loss of pituitary trophs, which leads to low (not elevated) TSH.\n\n(Choice C) Like postpartum thyroiditis, subacute (postviral, granulomatous, De Quervain) thyroiditis also follows a phasic course with initial hyperthyroidism due to release of preformed hormone followed by a hypothyroid phase. However, the thyroid is painful and tender, and fever is common because it is believed to be a postviral inflammatory process. {{exhibit_3}}\n\nEducational objective:\nPostpartum thyroiditis occurs within 12 months of pregnancy and is characterized by autoimmune destruction of thyroid follicles. It begins with a hyperthyroid phase due to release of preformed thyroid hormone, followed by a transient hypothyroid phase due to depletion of thyroid hormone and formation of germinal centers.",
    "zh": "该患者患有原发性甲状腺功能减退症，表现为血清甲状腺素水平低和TSH升高，并伴有疲劳和神经认知症状。在此之前，她有提示甲状腺功能亢进的症状（即，心悸、出汗）。鉴于她最近分娩，这种甲状腺功能障碍的阶段最符合产后甲状腺炎。\n\n产后甲状腺炎{{exhibit_2}} 发生在妊娠后12个月内，其特征是甲状腺滤泡的自身免疫破坏，类似于慢性淋巴细胞性（桥本）甲状腺炎。它通常以甲状腺功能亢进期开始，这是由于释放预先形成的甲状腺激素，然后是由于甲状腺激素耗竭和最终恢复甲状腺功能正常的短暂性甲状腺功能减退期。\n\n产后甲状腺炎与高滴度的抗甲状腺过氧化物酶和抗甲状腺球蛋白自身抗体相关。组织学检查显示淋巴细胞浸润，有时形成生发中心。也可能看到滤泡边缘的破坏和胶体流失。\n\n（选项A）Riedel甲状腺炎是一种罕见疾病，其特征是甲状腺广泛纤维化并延伸到周围组织。甲状腺坚硬且固定。甲状腺功能减退症很常见，但通常不会先出现甲状腺功能亢进期。\n\n（选项B和E）垂体中的肉芽肿性炎症可作为原发性现象或继发于全身性肉芽肿性疾病（如结节病、结核病）。淋巴细胞性垂体炎是一种不常见疾病，也更多地发生在产后妇女中。这两种疾病都可能由于垂体滋养细胞的丧失而导致继发性/中枢性甲状腺功能减退症，从而导致TSH低（而不是升高）。\n\n（选项C）与产后甲状腺炎一样，亚急性（病毒后、肉芽肿性、De Quervain）甲状腺炎也遵循一个分相过程，最初由于释放预先形成的激素而出现甲状腺功能亢进，然后是甲状腺功能减退期。然而，甲状腺是疼痛和触痛的，并且发烧很常见，因为它被认为是病毒后炎症过程。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n教育目标：\n产后甲状腺炎发生在妊娠后12个月内，其特征是甲状腺滤泡的自身免疫破坏。它始于甲状腺功能亢进期，这是由于释放预先形成的甲状腺激素，然后是由于甲状腺激素耗竭和生发中心的形成而产生的短暂甲状腺功能减退期。"

It requires differentiating it from other thyroid disorders based on the patient's history, physical exam findings, and laboratory results. \n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's postpartum status, the presence of both hyperthyroid and hypothyroid symptoms, and the nontender, enlarged thyroid gland.
