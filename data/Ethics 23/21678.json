She has no chronic medical conditions and has had no surgeries. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin. The patient's prior pregnancy ended in a spontaneous vaginal delivery at 38 weeks gestation. BMI is 32 kg/m². Physical examination is unremarkable. Ultrasound confirms an 8-week intrauterine pregnancy with normal cardiac activity. Although the patient's last delivery was at a hospital, she is now considering a planned home birth. Which of the following is the most appropriate statement to this patient?",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Although most births in the United States occur in a hospital, the number of planned home births has steadily increased. Common reasons for choosing home birth include desires to avoid labor interventions (eg, artificial rupture of membranes), have greater personal control in the birth process, and deliver in a familiar home environment.\n\nNotably, most patients who have a planned home birth are multiparous and have had a prior in-hospital delivery. In some cases, desiring a planned home birth for the current pregnancy may reflect low satisfaction or negative experience with the prior in-hospital delivery. Therefore, providers should seek to understand what, if any, aspects of the prior in-hospital birth experience were concerning to the patient. This is also an opportunity to review the risks (eg, increased neonatal mortality, lack of access to emergency medical interventions) and benefits (eg, higher vaginal delivery rate, fewer obstetric interventions) of home birth. Patients determined to proceed with a home birth require counseling on the indications for transfer to a hospital (eg, abnormal fetal heart rate, arrest of labor).\n\n(Choice A) Although home births are associated with increased neonatal mortality, stating that home birth is risky (ie, \"I don't think we should consider this option\") does not allow the patient to express her concerns and is paternalistic.\n\n(Choice B) Safe home births require more than a good support system (eg, partner, family, doula). Ideally, an experienced home birth provider with appropriate resources (eg, neonatal resuscitation kit) is present, and there is a backup plan for transfer to a hospital if needed. In addition, this statement shifts responsibility for this patient's care to another (nonmedical) provider, which is inappropriate.\n\n(Choice D) This patient's prior vaginal delivery and absence of chronic medical conditions are favorable for home birth. However, the caveat \"as long as your pregnancy remains uncomplicated\" may set the patient up for disappointment if obstetric complications arise. In addition, it may discourage her from disclosing symptoms (eg, vaginal bleeding, persistent headache) of serious obstetric complications.\n\n(Choice E) Delaying the conversation about home birth dismisses the patient's concerns, which will likely harm the physician-patient relationship. Exploring her reasons for wanting a planned home birth is a more patient-centered approach.\n\nEducational objective:\nDesiring a planned home birth may reflect low satisfaction or negative experiences with a prior in-hospital delivery. Therefore, providers should assess what, if any, aspects of the prior in-hospital delivery were concerning to the patient.",
    "zh": "虽然在美国，大多数分娩发生在医院，但计划中的家庭分娩数量一直在稳步增加。选择家庭分娩的常见原因包括希望避免分娩干预（例如，人工破膜），在分娩过程中拥有更大的个人控制权，并在熟悉的环境中分娩。\n\n值得注意的是，大多数计划家庭分娩的患者是经产妇，并且之前在医院分娩过。在某些情况下，希望在本次妊娠中进行计划的家庭分娩可能反映出对之前的医院分娩不满意或负面体验。因此，医护人员应设法了解患者在之前的医院分娩经历中是否存在令其担忧的方面。这也是一个审查家庭分娩的风险（例如，新生儿死亡率增加、无法获得紧急医疗干预）和益处（例如，阴道分娩率更高、产科干预较少）的机会。确定要进行家庭分娩的患者需要在转诊到医院的指征方面进行咨询（例如，胎心率异常、停滞性分娩）。\n\n（选项A）虽然家庭分娩与新生儿死亡率增加有关，但声明家庭分娩有风险（即，“我认为我们不应该考虑这个选择”）不允许患者表达她的担忧，而且带有家长式作风。\n\n（选项B）安全的家庭分娩需要的不仅仅是一个良好的支持系统（例如，伴侣、家人、导乐）。理想情况下，应有一位经验丰富的家庭分娩提供者，并配备适当的资源（例如，新生儿复苏包），并且需要有备用计划，以便在需要时转诊到医院。此外，这种说法将患者护理的责任转移给另一个（非医疗）提供者，这是不合适的。\n\n（选项D）该患者之前的阴道分娩和没有慢性病史对家庭分娩是有利的。然而，“只要你的怀孕没有并发症”这一警告可能会让患者在出现产科并发症时感到失望。此外，这可能会阻止她透露严重产科并发症的症状（例如，阴道出血、持续性头痛）。\n\n（选项E）推迟关于家庭分娩的对话会忽视患者的担忧，这可能会损害医患关系。探索她希望计划家庭分娩的原因是一种更以患者为中心的方法。\n\n教育目标：\n希望计划家庭分娩可能反映出对之前的医院分娩不满意或负面体验。因此，医护人员应评估患者在之前的医院分娩经历中是否存在令其担忧的方面。"
