    "en": "A 43-year-old man comes to the clinic for evaluation of a healed forehead laceration. Six weeks prior, the patient sustained the laceration when he slipped on an icy sidewalk and struck his forehead against a mailbox. The laceration was promptly irrigated and repaired in the emergency department and has since healed without complication. The patient is concerned about the appearance of the scar; he feels it \"stands out\" when he gives public presentations for his job. On examination, the scar is pink, firm, and mildly raised, without surrounding erythema or edema; it does not extend beyond the initial wound borders. The patient is reassured that the scar should flatten over the following months. The process by which this occurs relies mostly on enhanced cellular production of which of the following?",
    "zh": "一名43岁男性来到诊所，评估其已愈合的前额撕裂伤。六周前，患者在结冰的人行道上滑倒，前额撞到了邮箱上，导致撕裂伤。撕裂伤在急诊科被及时冲洗和修复，此后未出现并发症。患者担心疤痕的外观；他觉得在工作中进行公开演讲时，疤痕“很显眼”。体格检查显示，疤痕呈粉红色、质地坚硬，轻微隆起，周围无红斑或水肿；它没有超出最初的伤口边界。患者被告知，疤痕应在接下来的几个月内变平。发生这种情况的过程主要依赖于以下哪种细胞产物的增强产生？"

    "en": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a pivotal role in the wound-remodeling phase. Secreted by several different cell types (eg, fibroblasts, macrophages, neutrophils, some epithelial cells), MMPs facilitate the degradation of collagen and other proteins in the extracellular matrix in a highly regulated fashion. This occurs so that type III collagen laid down in a rapid, disorganized manner during the proliferative phase can be replaced by type I collagen, now arranged in well-organized, parallel bundles with extensive cross-linking. The result is both increased tensile strength and decreased thickness (ie, flattening) of the scar. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice B) Plasminogen activators (eg, tissue plasminogen activator released by damaged endothelium) catalyze the activation of plasmin, an important enzyme in the fibrinolytic pathway. Fibrinolysis occurs concomitantly with activation of the coagulation cascade to help control clot propagation; however, this happens immediately after tissue injury during the hemostasis phase.\n\n(Choices C and D) Reactive oxygen species are part of the oxidative burst by which phagocytic cells such as neutrophils destroy engulfed pathogens during the inflammation phase of wound healing. During this phase, neutrophils, as well as macrophages, produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a proinflammatory cytokine that leads to increased vascular permeability and further immune cell recruitment. There is often moderate edema, redness, and/or warmth of the wound during this phase.\n\n(Choice E) Vascular endothelial growth factor stimulates endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, leading to the formation of new capillaries (ie, angiogenesis). Angiogenesis occurs predominantly during the proliferative phase of wound healing; the resulting increased blood flow often causes the healing wound to be pink and slightly warm. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "基质金属蛋白酶 (MMPs) 在伤口重塑阶段起着关键作用。MMPs 由几种不同的细胞类型（如成纤维细胞、巨噬细胞、中性粒细胞、一些上皮细胞）分泌，以高度受控的方式促进细胞外基质中胶原蛋白和其他蛋白质的降解。这是为了使在增殖阶段以快速、无序方式沉积的 III 型胶原蛋白可以被 I 型胶原蛋白取代，后者现在以组织良好、平行的束排列，并具有广泛的交联。结果是疤痕的抗张强度增加和厚度减少（即变平）。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项 B) 纤溶酶原激活物（例如，由受损内皮释放的组织纤溶酶原激活物）催化纤溶酶的激活，纤溶酶是纤溶途径中的一种重要酶。纤维蛋白溶解与凝血级联反应的激活同时发生，以帮助控制凝块的扩散；然而，这种情况发生在止血阶段的组织损伤后。\n\n(选项 C 和 D) 活性氧是吞噬细胞（如中性粒细胞）在伤口愈合的炎症阶段破坏吞噬病原体的氧化爆发的一部分。在此阶段，中性粒细胞和巨噬细胞都会产生肿瘤坏死因子-α，这是一种促炎细胞因子，会导致血管通透性增加和进一步的免疫细胞募集。在此阶段，伤口通常有中度水肿、发红和/或发热。\n\n(选项 E) 血管内皮生长因子刺激内皮细胞增殖、迁移和分化，从而导致新毛细血管的形成（即血管生成）。血管生成主要发生在伤口愈合的增殖阶段；由此产生的血流量增加通常会导致愈合的伤口呈现粉红色并略微发热。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the wound healing process, specifically the remodeling phase and the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in scar flattening. It assesses the understanding of collagen turnover and the transition from type III to type I collagen.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the patient is in the remodeling phase of wound healing. Understanding that MMPs are responsible for collagen degradation and scar flattening during this phase is crucial for selecting the correct answer.",
