    "en": "This patient likely has Reye syndrome, a rapidly progressive disorder characterized by acute liver failure (eg, hepatomegaly, elevated transaminases, coagulopathy) and encephalopathy.\n\nReye syndrome most commonly occurs in children who are given salicylates (eg, aspirin) during a viral infection (eg, influenza). In susceptible patients, salicylates can damage mitochondria within hepatocytes and inhibit enzymes involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation, the primary metabolic pathway hepatocytes depend on to maintain normal cellular function. Salicylate-induced hepatic injury prevents the liver from keeping up with metabolic demands, which often increase in the setting of a viral infection and predisposes patients to the development of acute liver failure.\n\nPatients with Reye syndrome typically have vomiting and encephalopathy (eg, lethargy, altered mental status) related to the buildup of ammonia from liver failure. Seizures and coma may also occur. In addition to hyperammonemia, laboratory analysis typically shows markedly elevated aminotransferases, as seen in this patient. In addition, PT and PTT are often prolonged due to impaired hepatic synthetic function, but bilirubin is normally to slightly elevated. There is no specific treatment for Reye syndrome other than supportive care.\n\n(Choice A) Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1A) deficiency causes abnormal A1A protein folding and accumulation within hepatocytes. Although it can cause chronic liver disease in childhood, this patient's acute hepatic dysfunction and encephalopathy after salicylate exposure is more characteristic of Reye syndrome.\n\n(Choice B) Viral hepatitis induces a robust CD8+ T-cell response against infected hepatocytes, which typically leads to elevations in aminotransferases. Although viral hepatitis may cause acute liver failure, it would be associated with increased bilirubin and jaundice (especially with marked AST/ALT elevation).\n\n(Choice C) Acetaminophen overdose can cause acute liver failure through the depletion of intracellular glutathione, leading to an overabundance of hepatotoxic metabolites (eg, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine). Salicylates do not deplete intracellular glutathione like acetaminophen does.\n\n(Choice D) Reperfusion after ischemic insult to the liver can create hepatotoxic reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide. Reperfusion injury occurs in the setting of profound hypotension (eg, septic shock), which is not present in this patient.\n\nEducational objective:\nReye syndrome is characterized by acute liver failure (eg, hepatomegaly, elevated aminotransferases, coagulopathy) and rapidly progressive encephalopathy related to hyperammonemia. It usually develops in susceptible children during a viral infection after administration of salicylates (eg, aspirin), which cause damage to the mitochondria and impair fatty acid beta-oxidation within hepatocytes.",
    "zh": "该患者可能患有瑞氏综合征，这是一种快速进展的疾病，其特征是急性肝功能衰竭（如肝肿大、转氨酶升高、凝血功能障碍）和脑病。\n\n瑞氏综合征最常发生在儿童在病毒感染（如流感）期间服用水杨酸盐（如阿司匹林）时。在易感患者中，水杨酸盐会损伤肝细胞内的线粒体，并抑制参与脂肪酸β-氧化的酶，脂肪酸β-氧化是肝细胞维持正常细胞功能所依赖的主要代谢途径。水杨酸盐引起的肝损伤阻止肝脏满足代谢需求，这些需求通常在病毒感染的情况下增加，并使患者易于发生急性肝功能衰竭。\n\n瑞氏综合征患者通常会出现呕吐和脑病（如嗜睡、精神状态改变），这与肝功能衰竭引起的氨的积聚有关。也可能发生癫痫发作和昏迷。除了高氨血症外，实验室分析通常显示转氨酶显着升高，如该患者所见。此外，由于肝脏合成功能受损，PT和PTT通常会延长，但胆红素通常正常或略有升高。除了支持治疗外，瑞氏综合征没有特定的治疗方法。\n\n(选项A) α-1 抗胰蛋白酶 (A1A) 缺乏症会导致肝细胞内 A1A 蛋白异常折叠和积聚。尽管它可能导致儿童慢性肝病，但该患者在接触水杨酸盐后的急性肝功能障碍和脑病更符合瑞氏综合征的特征。\n\n(选项B) 病毒性肝炎诱导针对受感染肝细胞的强烈的 CD8+ T 细胞反应，这通常会导致转氨酶升高。虽然病毒性肝炎可能导致急性肝功能衰竭，但它与胆红素升高和黄疸有关（尤其是AST/ALT明显升高）。\n\n(选项C) 对乙酰氨基酚过量可导致急性肝功能衰竭，原因是细胞内谷胱甘肽耗竭，导致肝毒性代谢物（如 N-乙酰对苯醌亚胺）过量。水杨酸盐不像对乙酰氨基酚那样会耗尽细胞内谷胱甘肽。\n\n(选项D) 肝脏缺血性损伤后的再灌注可产生肝毒性活性氧，如超氧化物。再灌注损伤发生在严重低血压（如感染性休克）的情况下，而该患者没有这种症状。\n\n教育目标：\n瑞氏综合征的特征是急性肝功能衰竭（如肝肿大、转氨酶升高、凝血功能障碍）和与高氨血症相关的快速进展性脑病。它通常发生在易感儿童在病毒感染期间服用水杨酸盐（如阿司匹林）后，水杨酸盐会损害线粒体并损害肝细胞内的脂肪酸β-氧化。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Reye syndrome, its etiology (aspirin use during viral infection), pathophysiology (mitochondrial damage and impaired fatty acid beta-oxidation), and clinical presentation (acute liver failure and encephalopathy). It also tests the ability to interpret laboratory findings associated with Reye syndrome, such as elevated aminotransferases, prolonged PT/PTT, and hyperammonemia. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of Reye syndrome: recent viral infection, aspirin use, acute liver failure, and encephalopathy. Consider the mechanism by which aspirin causes liver damage in this context (mitochondrial toxicity). Rule out other causes of acute liver failure based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings.",
