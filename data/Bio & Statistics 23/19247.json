    "en": "Research studies are broadly classified as having an observational design or an experimental design depending on the control the researchers have over the independent variables.\n\n•\tIn observational studies (eg, case series, case-control studies, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies), the researchers have no control over the independent variables (eg, exposure to risk factors, treatments).\n•\tIn experimental studies (eg, crossover design, randomized controlled trials), the researchers control and randomly assign the independent variables (eg, exposure to risk factors, treatments).\n\nCase series is a descriptive observational study design in which a (generally small) group of patients with a similar diagnosis or treatment is described at a point in time or followed over a certain time period. Contrary to other observational designs (eg, cohort, case-control), a case series has no comparison group (Choices A and D). For this reason, a case series cannot establish associations between risk factors (eg, treatments) and outcomes (eg, diseases).\n\nIn this example, the CT scan findings of 11 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are being studied. The study has no control group; therefore, it can only describe COVID-19 manifestations on imaging studies.\n\n(Choice C) A clinical trial is an experimental study in which patients are prospectively assigned to ≥2 interventions (often including a placebo or control treatment) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on outcomes of interest.\n\n(Choice E) A cross-sectional study is an observational study that assesses a population of interest (eg, all women of reproductive age) at a single point in time; it can be used to estimate disease prevalence and association with risk factors of interest. However, it is not used to characterize disease findings because subjects are not selected based on the presence of disease.\n\nEducational objective:\nA case series is a descriptive observational study design in which a group of patients with a similar diagnosis or treatment is described at a point in time or followed over a certain time period. This study design has no comparison group; therefore, it cannot establish associations between risk factors (eg, treatments) and outcomes (eg, diseases).",
    "zh": "研究根据研究人员对自变量的控制程度，大致可分为观察性设计或实验性设计。\n\n•\t在观察性研究（例如，病例系列、病例对照研究、队列研究、横断面研究）中，研究人员无法控制自变量（例如，接触危险因素、治疗）。\n•\t在实验性研究（例如，交叉设计、随机对照试验）中，研究人员控制并随机分配自变量（例如，接触危险因素、治疗）。\n\n病例系列是一种描述性观察性研究设计，其中描述了一组（通常很小）具有相似诊断或治疗的患者在某个时间点或在某个时间段内的表现。与其他观察性设计（例如，队列、病例对照）相反，病例系列没有对照组（选项A和D）。因此，病例系列无法建立风险因素（例如，治疗）与结果（例如，疾病）之间的关联。\n\n在本例中，正在研究11例2019冠状病毒病（COVID-19）患者的CT扫描结果。该研究没有对照组；因此，它只能描述COVID-19在影像学研究中的表现。\n\n（选项C）临床试验是一种实验性研究，其中患者被前瞻性地分配到≥2种干预措施（通常包括安慰剂或对照治疗），以评估这些干预措施对感兴趣结果的影响。\n\n（选项E）横断面研究是一种观察性研究，它评估感兴趣的人群（例如，所有育龄妇女）在单个时间点的情况；它可用于估计疾病的患病率以及与感兴趣的风险因素的关联。然而，它不用于描述疾病的发现，因为受试者不是根据疾病的存在而选择的。\n\n教育目标：\n病例系列是一种描述性观察性研究设计，其中描述了一组具有相似诊断或治疗的患者在某个时间点或在某个时间段内的表现。这种研究设计没有对照组；因此，它无法建立风险因素（例如，治疗）与结果（例如，疾病）之间的关联。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of different types of research study designs, specifically focusing on the characteristics of a case series study. It assesses the ability to differentiate between observational and experimental studies and to recognize the absence of a comparison group in a case series.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to identify the study design based on the description provided. Recognizing that the study involves a small group of patients with COVID-19 and focuses on describing their CT scan findings without a comparison group leads to the correct answer.",
