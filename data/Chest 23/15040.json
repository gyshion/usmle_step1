    "en": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with the accumulation of thick, viscous secretions in multiple organ systems. In the lungs, secretions clog the airways, leading to the colonization of the lower respiratory tract with pathogenic bacteria early in the course of disease. *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Haemophilus influenzae* are most commonly isolated in children, but *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, a ubiquitous gram-negative bacillus, is the leading cause of respiratory tract colonization and infection in adults with CF.\n\n*P. aeruginosa* has several adaptations that make it well suited to the pulmonic environment of patients with CF including the ability to directly bind mucus, which shields the organism from phagocytosis. Persistent colonization/infection is then primarily mediated by the following:\n\n*   Biofilm formation – The bacteria clump together within an extracellular matrix of polysaccharides, proteins, and DNA, which prevents phagocytosis and antibiotic-mediated destruction\n*   Conversion to a mucoid phenotype that produces an alginate polysaccharide, which strengthens biofilm structure and aids in the inhibition of opsonization and phagocytosis\n*   Downregulation of virulence factors (eg, flagella, pili, lipopolysaccharide components) reduces antigenic targets, which promotes persistent colonization\n\nNeutrophils respond to the chronic infection by releasing elastase, myeloperoxidase, and other digestive enzymes. However, these compounds fail to eliminate *P. aeruginosa* and ultimately cause progressive destruction of the airway wall (ie, bronchiectasis) and a steady decline in pulmonary function.\n\n(Choices A and D) Pathogenic strains of *H influenzae* are able to form biofilms but do not convert to mucoid phenotype. *S aureus* can generate a biofilm and convert to mucoid growth. Although *H influenzae* and *S aureus* are the leading respiratory pathogens in children with CF, neither is as common as *Pseudomonas* in adult patients with CF.\n\n(Choice B) *Klebsiella pneumoniae* can generate a thick biofilm and grows in mucoid colonies on blood agar. Although colonization with *K pneumoniae* can occur in patients with CF, this pathogen is far less common than *Pseudomonas*.\n\n(Choice E) *Streptococcus pneumoniae* can form a biofilm and grow in mucoid colonies but is not a common colonizing pathogen in the airways of patients with CF.\n\nEducational objective:\n*Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is the leading respiratory pathogen in adult patients with cystic fibrosis. Persistent colonization is promoted by biofilm formation, conversion to a mucoid phenotype with alginate production, and downregulation of virulence factors.\n\n{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the common respiratory pathogens in cystic fibrosis patients, specifically how the prevalence of different organisms varies with age. It also assesses understanding of the mechanisms by which Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonizes and persists in the lungs of CF patients.\n\nTo answer this question, analyze the provided graph to determine the most prevalent pathogen in the older age groups. Recognize that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common pathogen in adult CF patients due to its ability to form biofilms and convert to a mucoid phenotype.",
