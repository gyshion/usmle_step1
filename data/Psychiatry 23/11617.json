    "en": "This patient's presentation is consistent with MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) WITH PSYCHOTIC FEATURES. This disorder is a severe subtype of MDD in which the patient develops PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS exclusively during a DEPRESSIVE EPISODE. This patient's ≥2 weeks of depressed mood, impaired concentration, decreased appetite/weight loss, sleep disturbance, and suicidal ideation meet criteria for MDD, and his psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions of causing evil, auditory hallucinations) specify the psychotic features subtype. Delusions and hallucinations are commonly mood congruent and have depressive themes (eg, deserved punishment, worthlessness, nihilism), although mood-incongruent psychotic symptoms (unrelated to depressive themes) can also occur.\n\nDifferentiating MDD with psychotic features from MDD without psychotic features is important as treatment differs. Patients with MDD with psychotic features require combined treatment with an ANTIDEPRESSANT and ANTIPSYCHOTIC or ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY.\n\n(Choice A) This patient has no history of mania or hypomania, thereby ruling out bipolar disorder.\n(Choice B) In delusional disorder, patients experience delusions but no other psychotic symptoms for at least a month. Mood symptoms, if present, are brief and not a prominent part of the illness.\n(Choice D) Patients with schizoaffective disorder also experience both mood and psychotic symptoms. Schizoaffective disorder is differentiated from MDD with psychotic features by the presence of delusions and/or hallucinations for ≥2 weeks in the absence of MDD mood symptomatology. There is no evidence that this patient has experienced psychotic symptoms outside of his MDD episode.\n(Choices E and F) Patients with schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia experience psychotic symptoms in the absence of an identifiable mood disorder. In schizophreniform disorder, symptoms last ≥1 month but <6 months; in schizophrenia, symptoms persist for ≥6 months.\n\nEducational objective:\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) with psychotic features is a severe subtype of unipolar major depression characterized by symptoms meeting the criteria for MDD and the presence of delusions and/or hallucinations.",
    "zh": "该患者的表现与伴有精神病性症状的重度抑郁症 (MDD) 相符。这种疾病是MDD的一种严重亚型，患者仅在抑郁发作期间出现精神病性症状。该患者≥2周的抑郁情绪、注意力受损、食欲下降/体重减轻、睡眠障碍和自杀意念符合MDD的诊断标准，而他的精神病性症状（如，导致邪恶的妄想、幻听）表明为精神病性特征亚型。妄想和幻觉通常与情绪相符，并具有抑郁主题（如，应得的惩罚、无价值感、虚无主义），尽管也可能出现与情绪不符的精神病性症状（与抑郁主题无关）。\n\n区分伴有精神病性症状的MDD与不伴有精神病性症状的MDD很重要，因为治疗方法不同。伴有精神病性症状的MDD患者需要联合使用抗抑郁药和抗精神病药或电抽搐疗法。\n\n（选项A）该患者无躁狂或轻躁狂病史，从而排除了双相情感障碍。\n（选项B）在妄想症中，患者会经历妄想，但至少一个月内无其他精神病性症状。如果存在情绪症状，通常短暂且并非疾病的主要部分。\n（选项D）伴有分裂情感性障碍的患者也会经历情绪和精神病性症状。分裂情感性障碍与伴有精神病性症状的MDD的区别在于，在无MDD情绪症状的情况下，存在≥2周的妄想和/或幻觉。没有证据表明该患者在其MDD发作之外经历过精神病性症状。\n（选项E和F）伴有分裂样精神障碍和精神分裂症的患者在没有可识别的情绪障碍的情况下经历精神病性症状。在分裂样精神障碍中，症状持续≥1个月但<6个月；在精神分裂症中，症状持续≥6个月。\n\n教育目标：\n伴有精神病性症状的重度抑郁症 (MDD) 是单相重度抑郁症的一种严重亚型，其特征是符合MDD诊断标准，并存在妄想和/或幻觉。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder with psychotic features and its differentiation from other psychotic and mood disorders. It requires the clinician to identify the presence of both depressive symptoms and psychotic symptoms and determine if the psychotic symptoms are exclusively associated with the depressive episode.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully evaluate the patient's symptoms, noting the duration and nature of both mood and psychotic disturbances. The key is to determine if the psychotic symptoms occur only during a depressive episode, which is characteristic of MDD with psychotic features, and to rule out other diagnoses based on the presence or absence of mania/hypomania, the timing of psychotic symptoms relative to mood symptoms, and the duration of symptoms.",
    "zh": "此题考察对伴有精神病性症状的重度抑郁症的诊断标准及其与其他精神病性和情绪障碍的区别的理解。它要求临床医生识别抑郁症状和精神病性症状的存在，并确定精神病性症状是否仅与抑郁发作相关。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须仔细评估患者的症状，注意情绪和精神病性紊乱的持续时间和性质。关键是要确定精神病性症状是否仅在抑郁发作期间发生，这是伴有精神病性症状的MDD的特征，并根据是否存在躁狂/轻躁狂、精神病性症状与情绪症状的关系以及症状的持续时间来排除其他诊断。"
