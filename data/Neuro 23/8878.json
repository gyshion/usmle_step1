    "en": "A 24-year-old man comes to the physician due to excessive daytime sleepiness. The patient is a college student whose symptoms started around age 12, when he began needing more sleep than his peers to feel refreshed. Two years later, he started having daily episodes of sudden weakness, consistently triggered by laughter or crying, in which his head would nod or his knees would buckle for about 30 seconds. The patient also describes times when he was unable to move for several minutes after awakening from sleep. He mentions nightly dreams that seem very real, often featuring activities that he had been engaged in during the preceding day.",

    "en": "This patient's excessive daytime sleepiness, episodic loss of motor tone triggered by emotion (cataplexy), and inability to move on awakening (sleep paralysis) are highly suggestive of NARCOLEPSY. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is most often caused by the lack of 2 related neuropeptides: HYPOCRETIN-1 (orexin-A) and HYPOCRETIN-2 (orexin-B), which are produced in neurons located in the lateral hypothalamus. These neuropeptides promote wakefulness and inhibit REM sleep-related phenomena. Hypocretin-1 levels are low to absent in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients who have narcolepsy with cataplexy.\n\n(Choice A) Low CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (a metabolite of serotonin) concentration has been associated with impulsive, destructive behaviors, particularly aggression, suicide, and violence.\n\n(Choice B) Detection of elevated amounts of 14-3-3 protein in CSF is helpful in diagnosing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a neurodegenerative disease caused by prions.\n\n(Choice C) Altered levels of the primary dopamine metabolite, homovanillic acid, have been linked to many psychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders, psychosis, and mood disorders. CSF concentrations of homovanillic acid are also decreased in patients with Parkinson disease.\n\n(Choice E) The level of melatonin in CSF has been shown to decrease with the progression of Alzheimer disease.\n\nEducational objective: Hypocretin-1 (orexin-A) and hypocretin-2 (orexin-B) are neuropeptides produced in the lateral hypothalamus that promote wakefulness and inhibit REM sleep-related phenomena. Most patients who have narcolepsy with cataplexy have undetectable levels of hypocretin-1 in their cerebrospinal fluid.",
    "zh": "该患者的白天过度嗜睡、情绪触发的阵发性肌张力丧失（猝倒症）以及醒后无法动弹（睡眠瘫痪）高度提示患有发作性睡病。伴有猝倒症的发作性睡病最常由缺乏两种相关的神经肽引起：下丘脑分泌素-1（orexin-A）和下丘脑分泌素-2（orexin-B），这两种神经肽是在位于下丘脑外侧的神经元中产生的。这些神经肽促进觉醒并抑制REM睡眠相关现象。在患有伴有猝倒症的发作性睡病的患者的脑脊液（CSF）中，下丘脑分泌素-1水平较低甚至不存在。\n\n（选项A）脑脊液中5-羟吲哚乙酸（血清素的代谢物）浓度低与冲动、破坏性行为有关，尤其是攻击、自杀和暴力。\n\n（选项B）在脑脊液中检测到14-3-3蛋白含量升高有助于诊断克雅病，这是一种由朊病毒引起的神经退行性疾病。\n\n（选项C）主要的多巴胺代谢物高香草酸的水平改变与许多精神疾病有关，包括物质使用障碍、精神病和情绪障碍。帕金森病患者的脑脊液中高香草酸的浓度也会降低。\n\n（选项E）已证明脑脊液中褪黑激素的水平会随着阿尔茨海默病的进展而降低。\n\n教育目标：下丘脑分泌素-1（orexin-A）和下丘脑分泌素-2（orexin-B）是在下丘脑外侧产生的神经肽，可促进觉醒并抑制REM睡眠相关现象。大多数患有伴有猝倒症的发作性睡病的患者的脑脊液中下丘脑分泌素-1水平无法检测到。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of narcolepsy, its clinical presentation, and the underlying neurochemical abnormalities. Specifically, it assesses the knowledge of the role of hypocretin-1 deficiency in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy with cataplexy.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the classic symptoms of narcolepsy, including excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. Then, recall the neurobiological basis of narcolepsy, which involves a deficiency in hypocretin-1, and identify this compound as the likely abnormal substance in the CSF.",
