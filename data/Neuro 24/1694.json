    "en": "A 35-year-old, right-handed mechanic comes to the clinic due to progressive right hand weakness. The patient frequently uses a screwdriver at work. Neurologic examination shows preserved sensation in the upper limbs. There is weakness on extension of the fingers and thumb in the right hand. Strength is otherwise intact. Triceps reflexes are 2+ and bilaterally symmetric. The nerve affected in this patient was most likely injured at which of the following locations?",

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is F. The radial nerve innervates the muscles responsible for wrist and finger extension. It enters the arm by passing through the quadrangular space and then runs in the spiral groove of the humerus before piercing the lateral intermuscular septum to enter the anterior compartment of the forearm. In the forearm, it divides into a deep branch (posterior interosseous nerve) and a superficial branch. The deep branch innervates the extensor muscles of the forearm, including those responsible for finger and thumb extension. The superficial branch provides sensory innervation to the dorsal aspect of the hand. The patient's presentation of weakness in finger and thumb extension with preserved sensation in the upper limbs and intact triceps reflexes points to an injury affecting the deep branch of the radial nerve distal to the elbow, specifically at or near the supinator muscle, which is where the deep branch passes through. Repetitive pronation/supination of the forearm, as seen in screwdriver use, can lead to compression of the radial nerve at the supinator muscle, causing 'supinator syndrome' or 'posterior interosseous nerve syndrome'. This typically results in finger drop (weakness of finger extension) without wrist drop (as extensor carpi radialis longus is spared) or sensory deficits. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choices A and E) Injury to the radial nerve at the axilla (eg, crutch palsy) typically causes weakness of the forearm, hand, and finger extensor muscles (eg, wrist drop) with absent triceps reflex and sensory loss over the posterior arm, forearm, and dorsolateral hand. Injury to the nerve at the humeral midshaft along the spiral groove usually causes similar forearm/hand deficits with sparing of the triceps muscle. {{exhibit_5}}\n\n(Choice B) Carpal tunnel syndrome can result from any condition that reduces the size of the carpal tunnel and compresses the median nerve (eg, pregnancy, hypothyroidism). Patients typically have pain/paresthesia affecting the first 3 and a half digits along with thenar atrophy and thumb abduction/opposition weakness as the disease progresses.\n\n(Choice C) The coracobrachialis muscle lies deep to the biceps brachii and is innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve. Injury to the musculocutaneous nerve may result in decreased strength on forearm flexion and sensory loss over the lateral forearm.\n\n(Choice D) In the wrist, the ulnar nerve passes between the hook of hamate and the pisiform bone in the Guyon canal. Ulnar nerve injury at this site can cause weakness on finger abduction/adduction and clawing of the fourth and fifth digits.",
    "zh": "正确答案是F。桡神经支配负责腕和手指伸展的肌肉。它进入手臂，通过四边孔，然后沿着肱骨的螺旋沟走行，然后穿过外侧肌间隔进入前臂前间室。在前臂，它分为深支（骨间后神经）和浅支。深支支配前臂的伸肌，包括负责手指和拇指伸展的肌肉。浅支为手背提供感觉神经支配。患者表现为手指和拇指伸展无力，上肢感觉保留，肱三头肌反射完整，表明损伤影响肘部远端桡神经的深支，特别是在旋后肌附近，深支正是在此处通过。重复性的前臂旋前/旋后，如使用螺丝刀时，可导致桡神经在旋后肌处受压，引起“旋后肌综合征”或“骨间后神经综合征”。这通常导致手指下垂（手指伸展无力），而无腕下垂（因为桡侧腕长伸肌得以保留）或感觉缺失。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n（选项A和E）腋窝处桡神经损伤（例如，拄拐杖性麻痹）通常会导致前臂、手和手指伸肌无力（例如，腕下垂），伴有肱三头肌反射消失和上臂后侧、前臂和手背外侧感觉丧失。肱骨中段螺旋沟处神经损伤通常会导致类似的前臂/手缺陷，但肱三头肌得以保留。{{exhibit_5}}\n\n（选项B）腕管综合征可由任何减小腕管大小并压迫正中神经的病症引起（例如，妊娠、甲状腺功能减退症）。患者通常会出现影响前3个半手指的疼痛/感觉异常，以及大鱼际萎缩和拇指外展/对掌无力，随着疾病的进展。 \n\n（选项C）喙肱肌位于肱二头肌深面，由肌皮神经支配。肌皮神经损伤可能导致前臂屈曲力量下降和前臂外侧感觉丧失。\n\n（选项D）在腕部，尺神经通过钩骨和豌豆骨之间的Guyon管。尺神经在该部位损伤可导致手指外展/内收无力和第四、第五个手指的爪形手。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of radial nerve anatomy and the clinical presentation of injuries at different locations along its course. It requires correlating specific motor deficits (weakness in finger and thumb extension) with the anatomical innervation of the radial nerve and its branches.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the nerve responsible for the observed motor deficits. Then, consider the anatomical pathways of that nerve and the typical clinical syndromes associated with injury at various points. The pattern of weakness and preserved sensation is key to localizing the injury.",
