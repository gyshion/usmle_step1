    "en": "Researchers are developing a new glycopeptide antibiotic similar to vancomycin. Susceptibility testing reveals that the new drug is bactericidal against gram-positive organisms at serum concentrations above 15 µg/mL. Two different dosage regimens are developed to achieve a target serum trough concentration of 15-20 µg/mL: one administered as 1 gram every 6 hours and the other as 2 grams every 12 hours. The two regimens are tested in healthy volunteers during an early-phase clinical trial, and the following pharmacokinetic profiles are obtained. {{exhibit_1}} Compared to the 12-hour dosing regimen, the 6-hour regimen is most likely to exhibit which of the following features?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Drug dosing regimens are typically designed to maximize drug effectiveness and minimize toxicity. The above graph is comparing two different regimens with the same total dose (ie, 4 grams/24 hr) but with different dosing intervals (ie, 6 hr, 12 hr). Both regimens have similar trough levels (ie, lowest concentration level before next dose) and maintain plasma levels above the bactericidal cutoff (eg, 15-20 µg/mL). As such, both regimens are likely to exhibit similar efficacy. However, peak and average drug levels are substantially higher with the 12-hour dosing regimen. Because drug toxicity most often correlates with peak or average plasma drug levels, the 6-hour regimen is likely to have lower toxicity.\n\n(Choice A) Clearance (hepatic or renal) of a substance depends on the intrinsic properties of the agent. It is defined as the amount of plasma that is cleared of the drug over a given period (eg, mL/min). Drug clearance is typically the same regardless of the dosing schedule.\n\n(Choice B) Average plasma drug levels are lower when a fixed amount of drug is given in more divided doses. In this example, 4 grams are administered every 24 hours, either in 2 doses (12-hr regimen) or 4 doses (6-hr regimen). Therefore, the more frequent 6-hour regimen would result in lower average plasma drug levels.\n\n(Choice C) Patient compliance is increased when the frequency of dosing is minimized. Only 2 doses per day are needed with the 12-hour regimen; however, the 6-hour regimen needs 4 doses and is likely to be more disruptive to the patient's schedule.\n\n(Choice E) The therapeutic window refers to the range of drug dosages that have an appropriate clinical effect. It begins at the lowest dose at which the drug is effective and ends at the highest dose without significant toxic effects. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic window are often dosed more frequently to prevent large swings in plasma concentration.",
    "zh": "药物给药方案通常旨在最大限度地提高药物疗效并最大限度地减少毒性。上图比较了两种不同的方案，总剂量相同（即，4克/24小时），但给药间隔不同（即，6小时，12小时）。两种方案都有相似的谷浓度（即，下次给药前的最低浓度水平）并维持血浆浓度高于杀菌截点（例如，15-20 µg/mL）。因此，两种方案都可能表现出相似的疗效。然而，12小时给药方案的峰值和平均药物水平显着高于6小时方案。由于药物毒性通常与峰值或平均血浆药物水平相关，因此6小时方案可能具有较低的毒性。\n\n（选项A）物质的清除率（肝或肾）取决于该物质的内在特性。它定义为在给定时间内被清除的药物的血浆量（例如，mL/min）。药物清除率通常在给药时间表变化时保持不变。\n\n（选项B）当以更分散的剂量给予固定量的药物时，平均血浆药物水平较低。在本例中，每24小时给予4克，分为2次给药（12小时方案）或4次给药（6小时方案）。因此，更频繁的6小时方案将导致平均血浆药物水平较低。\n\n（选项C）当给药频率最小化时，患者依从性会提高。12小时方案每天只需要2次给药；然而，6小时方案需要4次给药，并且可能更容易干扰患者的日程安排。\n\n（选项E）治疗窗是指具有适当临床效果的药物剂量的范围。它从药物有效的最低剂量开始，到没有明显毒性作用的最高剂量结束。治疗窗狭窄的药物通常给药更频繁，以防止血浆浓度的大幅波动。"
