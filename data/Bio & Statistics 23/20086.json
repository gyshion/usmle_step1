    "en": "A population pyramid displays the percentage of individuals in each age cohort to describe the current population profile, and to project how the population will increase/decrease in the future. Every population pyramid is unique, but most fit into one of three general categories.\n\n*   Expansive populations have high birth and mortality rates and short life expectancies. Therefore, they show a larger percentage of people in younger cohorts (ie, graph has a broad bottom and narrow top). These populations are young and growing, and their pyramids characterize many developing countries.\n*   Stationary populations have declining birth rates, low mortality rates, and long life expectancies. Therefore, they show a somewhat equal percentage of people in each age cohort (ie, graph has a somewhat rectangular shape). These populations are stable (ie, neither growing nor shrinking), and their pyramids are characteristic of many developed countries.\n*   Constrictive populations have significantly low birth and mortality rates, and long life expectancies. Therefore, they show a smaller percentage of people in younger cohorts (ie, graph has a narrower bottom). These populations are shrinking, and their pyramids are characteristic of very advanced countries with a high level of literacy, easy access to birth control measures, and exceptional health and medical resources.\n\nIn this question, the population pyramid has a broad bottom, indicating a high birth rate, and a narrow top, indicating a higher mortality rate that results in a short life expectancy (Choices B and C). Populations with high birth rates are populations that are young and growing (Choices D and E). Therefore, the population pyramid is characteristic of many developing countries. {{exhibit_2}}",

    "en": "This question tests the ability to interpret population pyramids and relate their shapes to demographic characteristics such as birth rates, mortality rates, and life expectancy.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves analyzing the shape of the population pyramid (broad base, narrow top) and associating it with the corresponding demographic characteristics (high birth rate, high mortality rate, short life expectancy).",
