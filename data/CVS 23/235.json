    "en": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the office due to progressive exertional dyspnea and easy fatigability. She immigrated to the United States from India several years ago and reports a history of rheumatic fever during her childhood. Cardiac auscultation reveals a diastolic high-frequency sound and a rumbling diastolic murmur heard best in the left fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Cardiac catheterization is performed for hemodynamic evaluation, and the results are represented below {{exhibit_1}}. Timing of the high-frequency sound heard during cardiac auscultation of this patient best corresponds to which of the following letters?",

    "en": "This patient with a history of rheumatic fever now presenting with exertional dyspnea and a diastolic murmur at the cardiac apex most likely has MITRAL STENOSIS. In comparison to normal tracings, hemodynamic tracings in patients with mitral stenosis typically reveal an elevated pressure gradient between the left atrial and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.\n\nClassic physical examination findings include a loud first heart sound (S1), an early diastolic high-frequency opening snap after the second heart sound (S2), and a low-pitched diastolic rumble. These findings are best heard at the cardiac apex using the bell of the stethoscope with the patient lying on the left side in held expiration.\n\nLeft ventricular pressure falls rapidly during isovolumetric relaxation. The opening snap is caused by the sudden opening of the mitral valve leaflets when the left ventricular diastolic pressure falls below the left atrial pressure at the beginning of diastole. As mitral stenosis becomes more severe, the opening snap occurs earlier after S2.\n\n{{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) This point corresponds to the opening of the aortic valve at the end of isovolumetric ventricular contraction in early systole when the left ventricular pressure exceeds the central aortic pressure. This correlates with the timing of an aortic ejection murmur that may be heard in patients with aortic stenosis (eg, due to a calcified bicuspid aortic valve).\n\n(Choice B) This point corresponds to the closure of the aortic valve at the end of systole, producing the aortic component of S2. The aortic valve closes as soon as left ventricular pressure drops below the aortic pressure.\n\n(Choice D) This is a random point in diastole when the mitral valve is already maximally open and there is passive filling of the left ventricular cavity (diastasis). In patients with mitral stenosis, the elevated pressure gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle during diastole causes the mid-diastolic rumble.\n\n(Choice E) This point roughly corresponds to the onset of atrial contraction during late ventricular diastole. In patients in sinus rhythm, atrial contraction causes an increase in the intensity of the diastolic murmur just before S1, a phenomenon termed \"presystolic accentuation.\"\n\nEducational objective:\nCardiac auscultation in patients with mitral stenosis reveals a loud first heart sound, an early diastolic opening snap after the second heart sound, and a low-pitched diastolic rumble best heard at the cardiac apex. The opening snap is caused by the sudden opening of the mitral valve leaflets when the left ventricular pressure falls below the left atrial pressure at the beginning of diastole.",
    "zh": "该患者有风湿热病史，目前出现劳力性呼吸困难和心尖部舒张期杂音，最有可能患有二尖瓣狭窄。与正常描记图相比，二尖瓣狭窄患者的血流动力学描记图通常显示左心房和左心室舒张末压之间存在升高的压力梯度。\n\n典型的体格检查结果包括响亮的第一个心音 (S1)、在第二个心音 (S2) 之后出现的早期舒张期高频开放拍击音和低沉的舒张期隆隆声。这些发现最好用听诊器的钟形部分在心尖部听诊，患者左侧卧位并屏住呼气。\n\n左心室压力在等容舒张期间迅速下降。开放拍击音是由二尖瓣瓣叶突然打开引起的，当左心室舒张压降至舒张开始时左心房压力以下时。随着二尖瓣狭窄变得更严重，开放拍击音发生在 S2 后更早的时间。\n\n{{exhibit_2}}\n\n(选项 A) 此点对应于主动脉瓣在等容性心室收缩结束时在早期收缩期开放，此时左心室压力超过中心主动脉压力。这与主动脉喷射杂音的时间相关，这种杂音可能在患有主动脉瓣狭窄的患者中听到（例如，由于钙化二叶主动脉瓣）。\n\n(选项 B) 此点对应于主动脉瓣在收缩末期的关闭，产生 S2 的主动脉成分。一旦左心室压力降至主动脉压力以下，主动脉瓣就会关闭。\n\n(选项 D) 这是舒张期的一个随机点，此时二尖瓣已最大程度地打开，并且左心室腔被动充盈（舒张停顿）。在二尖瓣狭窄患者中，舒张期左心房和左心室之间升高的压力梯度会导致中舒张期隆隆声。\n\n(选项 E) 此点大致对应于心房在心室舒张晚期收缩的开始。在窦性心律的患者中，心房收缩会导致舒张期杂音在 S1 之前强度增加，这种现象称为“收缩前增强”。\n\n教育目标：\n二尖瓣狭窄患者的心脏听诊显示响亮的第一个心音、第二个心音后的早期舒张期开放拍击音和在心尖部听诊最清楚的低沉舒张期隆隆声。开放拍击音是由二尖瓣瓣叶突然打开引起的，当左心室压力降至舒张开始时左心房压力以下时。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize the hemodynamic findings and auscultatory findings associated with mitral stenosis. Specifically, it asks about the timing of the opening snap in relation to the aortic and left ventricular pressure curves.\n\nTo solve this question, one must understand the pathophysiology of mitral stenosis and how it affects the pressure gradients between the left atrium and left ventricle. Recognizing the opening snap as an early diastolic sound and correlating it with the hemodynamic tracing is key.",
