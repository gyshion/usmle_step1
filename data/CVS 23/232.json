    "en": "A 42-year-old woman is brought to the hospital due to right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. She has a longstanding history of a diastolic murmur, but her medical follow-up has been poor. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. A CT scan of the brain reveals a large ischemic stroke involving the left middle cerebral artery distribution. The patient dies 2 days later due to progressive neurologic deterioration. At autopsy, exploration of the left atrium shows diffuse fibrous thickening and distortion of the mitral valve leaflets, commissural fusion at the leaflet edges, and narrowing of the mitral valve orifice. This finding is most likely the result of which of the following conditions?",

    "en": "This patient's presentation suggests MITRAL STENOSIS (MS) due to rheumatic heart disease. Fibrous thickening and fusion of the valve leaflets in chronic rheumatic heart disease following acute RHEUMATIC FEVER is the most common cause of MS, accounting for up to 99% of cases. There is often a latency period of 10-20 years between the initial episode of rheumatic fever and symptomatic MS, with most patients manifesting during the fourth or fifth decade of life.\n\nMitral stenosis can cause atrial enlargement, which may lead to ATRIAL FIBRILLATION and/or atrial MURAL THROMBOSES. Thrombi dislodged from the wall of the left atrium may later cause an embolic stroke, which likely occurred in this patient. Cardiac auscultation in mitral stenosis often reveals a loud first heart sound (S1), an early diastolic sound (opening snap), followed by a MID-DIASTOLIC MURMUR from turbulent flow across the mitral valve.\n\n(Choice A) Congenital endocardial cushion defects can result in mitral regurgitation. However, congenital mitral valve stenosis is rare and untreated newborns and infants typically have a grim prognosis.\n\n(Choice B) Degenerative calcific deposits most commonly develop in the mitral valve annulus in women over age 60 and generally do not impair valve function. This patient's autopsy did not show any peripherally located nodular calcific deposits.\n\n(Choice C) Embolization of vegetations due to infective endocarditis can cause a stroke or septic infarct resulting in a brain abscess. However, infective endocarditis is usually associated with large friable vegetations on the valve cusps along with destruction (rather than fibrosis) of the valve leaflets.\n\n(Choice D) Tertiary syphilis may result in aortitis, aortic aneurysm, and/or aortic regurgitation. Mitral valve lesions are not commonly observed.\n\n(Choice F) Although cardiac involvement is uncommon in rheumatoid arthritis, patients can develop pericarditis and myocarditis. Rheumatoid nodules can also develop in the cardiac tissues (including valvular structures), but these are rarely symptomatic.\n\n(Choice G) Rupture of papillary muscle (whether due to bacterial endocarditis, a connective tissue disease, or myocardial infarction) leads to prolapse of the valve leaflets and mitral regurgitation (holosystolic or early systolic murmur).\n\nEducational objective:\nRheumatic mitral stenosis is characterized by diffuse fibrous thickening and distortion of the mitral valve leaflets along with commissural fusion at the leaflet edges. Patients often present with a diastolic murmur, dyspnea, and fatigue and are at increased risk of atrial fibrillation and thromboembolism (eg, stroke).",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现提示由风湿性心脏病引起的二尖瓣狭窄（MS）。在急性风湿热后，慢性风湿性心脏病中瓣膜叶纤维增厚和融合是MS最常见的原因，占病例的99%。风湿热的最初发作和有症状的MS之间通常有10-20年的潜伏期，大多数患者在第四或第五个十年发病。\n\n二尖瓣狭窄可引起心房扩大，这可能导致房颤和/或心房壁血栓形成。从左心房壁上脱落的血栓随后可能导致栓塞性卒中，这很可能发生在该患者身上。二尖瓣狭窄的听诊通常显示响亮的第一个心音（S1），早舒张期声音（开放性喀喇音），然后是来自二尖瓣湍流的舒张中期杂音。\n\n（选项A）先天性心内膜垫缺损可导致二尖瓣反流。然而，先天性二尖瓣狭窄很少见，未经治疗的新生儿和婴儿通常预后不佳。\n\n（选项B）退行性钙化沉积物最常见于60岁以上女性的二尖瓣环，通常不会损害瓣膜功能。该患者的尸检未显示任何位于外周的结节性钙化沉积。\n\n（选项C）感染性心内膜炎引起的赘生物栓塞可导致卒中或败血性梗死，导致脑脓肿。然而，感染性心内膜炎通常与瓣叶上大的脆弱赘生物相关，以及瓣叶的破坏（而不是纤维化）。\n\n（选项D）三期梅毒可导致主动脉炎、主动脉瘤和/或主动脉瓣关闭不全。通常不常见二尖瓣病变。\n\n（选项F）尽管类风湿关节炎中很少有心脏受累，但患者可能会出现心包炎和心肌炎。类风湿结节也可以在心脏组织（包括瓣膜结构）中形成，但这些很少有症状。\n\n（选项G）乳头肌断裂（无论是由于细菌性心内膜炎、结缔组织疾病还是心肌梗死）都会导致瓣叶脱垂和二尖瓣反流（全收缩期或早期收缩期杂音）。\n\n教育目标：\n风湿性二尖瓣狭窄的特征是二尖瓣瓣叶弥漫性纤维增厚和变形，以及瓣叶边缘的交界融合。患者通常表现为舒张期杂音、呼吸困难和疲劳，并有房颤和血栓栓塞（如卒中）的风险增加。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the etiology and pathophysiology of mitral stenosis, specifically its association with rheumatic fever and the long-term complications such as stroke. It also requires understanding of the typical auscultatory findings associated with mitral stenosis.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key findings of mitral stenosis at autopsy (fibrous thickening, commissural fusion, narrowing) and link them to the patient's history of a diastolic murmur and the eventual stroke.
