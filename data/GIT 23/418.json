    "en": "Inguinal hernias {{exhibit_1}} are located above the inguinal ligament and are much more common in men. The Inferior epigastric vessels are clearly visible on the anterior abdominal wall during laparoscopic hernia repair and can be used as a landmark to distinguish between direct and indirect inguinal hernias.\n\nIndirect inguinal hernias occur due to failure of the processus vaginalis to obliterate, allowing abdominal contents to protrude lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels through the deep (internal) inguinal ring. The abdominal contents follow the path of the inguinal canal and may exit through the superficial (external) inguinal ring into the scrotum.\n\nDirect inguinal hernias occur due to weakness in the transversalis fascia that allows abdominal contents to protrude medial to the inferior epigastric vessels into the Hesselbach triangle. Compared to indirect inguinal hernias, direct hernias are less prone to incarceration due to their wide neck. It is also uncommon for them to descend into the scrotum as there is no direct path through the abdominal fascia.\n\n(Choice A) The femoral vein runs directly lateral to femoral hernias, which protrude below the inguinal ligament into the femoral canal.\n\n(Choice C) The pectineal ligament (inguinal ligament of Cooper) forms the posterior border of the femoral ring and would be located behind a femoral hernia that protrudes through the ring.\n\n(Choice D) The rectus abdominis muscle sheath forms the most medial aspect of the Hesselbach triangle, which is the site of protrusion for direct inguinal hernias. Because both direct and indirect inguinal hernias lie lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle sheath, it would not be useful for distinguishing these two types of hernia.\n\n(Choice E) Indirect inguinal hernias follow the path of the spermatic cord (or uterine round ligament) as it courses through the deep (internal) inguinal ring.\n\n(Choice F) The transversalis fascia is the site of weakness in a direct inguinal hernia and lies posterior to indirect inguinal hernias as they extend through the inguinal canal.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe inferior epigastric vessels are useful as a landmark during laparoscopic hernia repair to classify the type of inguinal hernia. Indirect inguinal hernias protrude through the deep inguinal ring into the inguinal canal lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels. In contrast, direct inguinal hernias protrude through Hesselbach's triangle medial to the inferior epigastric vessels. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "腹股沟疝{{exhibit_1}}位于腹股沟韧带上方，在男性中更为常见。腹壁下动脉在腹腔镜疝修补术中清晰可见于腹前壁，可用作区分斜疝和直疝的标志物。\n\n斜疝是由于鞘状突闭锁不全，导致腹腔内容物向腹壁下动脉外侧突出，穿过腹深（内）环。腹腔内容物沿腹股沟管走行，并可能通过腹浅（外）环进入阴囊。\n\n直疝是由于腹横筋膜薄弱，导致腹腔内容物向腹壁下动脉内侧突出到Hesselbach三角。与斜疝相比，直疝由于其颈部较宽，不易发生嵌顿。它们也不太可能下降到阴囊中，因为没有直接穿过腹部筋膜的通道。\n\n(选项 A) 股静脉位于股疝的正外侧，股疝通过腹股沟韧带下方突入股管。\n\n(选项 C) 耻骨梳韧带（Cooper 韧带）形成股环的后缘，位于穿过环的股疝的后方。\n\n(选项 D) 腹直肌鞘构成了Hesselbach三角的最内侧部分，是直疝突出的部位。由于斜疝和直疝都位于腹直肌鞘的外侧，因此它对于区分这两种类型的疝气没有用处。\n\n(选项 E) 斜疝沿精索（或子宫圆韧带）的路径走行，穿过腹深（内）环。\n\n(选项 F) 腹横筋膜是直疝的薄弱部位，位于斜疝穿过腹股沟管的后方。\n\n教育目标：\n腹壁下动脉在腹腔镜疝修补术中可用作区分腹股沟疝类型的标志。斜疝通过腹深环突入腹股沟管，位于腹壁下动脉的外侧。相比之下，直疝通过Hesselbach三角突入，位于腹壁下动脉的内侧。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of inguinal hernia anatomy and the ability to differentiate between direct and indirect inguinal hernias during laparoscopic repair. It focuses on the anatomical landmarks used to distinguish between these two types of hernias.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the anatomical relationships of the inguinal canal, Hesselbach's triangle, and the inferior epigastric vessels. Understanding that indirect hernias are lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels and direct hernias are medial is key to selecting the correct landmark.",
