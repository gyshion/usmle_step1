    "en": "A 33-year-old man is hospitalized after neighbors called the police to report that he has been singing loudly and playing the piano \"nonstop\" all day and night for the last month. The patient says his mood is \"terrific,\" claims he is related to the President, and hears voices telling him he is going to be a famous entertainer. While in the hospital, he makes inappropriate sexual advances toward some of the female nurses. He has a history of 9 psychiatric hospitalizations starting at age 22 for mood and psychotic symptoms. In between hospitalizations, the patient has heard voices commenting on his appearance and has believed that secret cameras have been monitoring him, but he has had no mood symptoms.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's current symptoms and psychiatric history are consistent with SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER. In addition to currently exhibiting symptoms of MANIA (eg, elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, hypersexuality, grandiose delusions), he also has a history of DELUSIONS and HALLUCINATIONS occurring IN THE ABSENCE OF a major MOOD EPISODE (ie, psychotic symptoms without mood symptoms in between hospitalizations). A lifetime history of at least 2 weeks of psychotic symptoms in the absence of a mood episode is a key requirement for the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis.\n\nDifferentiating schizoaffective disorder from bipolar disorder with psychotic features or major depression with psychotic features requires determining the temporal relationship between psychotic symptoms and mood symptoms. In bipolar disorder and major depression with psychotic features, psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during manic or depressive episodes (Choices A and C); there are no psychotic symptoms outside of mood episodes.\n\nUnlike schizoaffective disorder, a diagnosis of schizophrenia does not include prominent mood symptoms that meet the criteria for manic and/or depressive episodes (Choice E).\n\n(Choice B) Delusional disorder involves \\u22651 delusions for at least 1 month in the absence of other psychotic symptoms (eg, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior).\n\n(Choice F) Schizophreniform disorder has the same symptoms as schizophrenia (eg, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior, negative symptoms), but the duration is \\u22651 month and <6 months.\n\nEducational objective:\nFor diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, psychosis must occur in the absence of major mood episodes, but mood episodes must be present for a majority of this lifelong illness. In bipolar disorder and major depression with psychotic features, psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during mood episodes.",
    "zh": "该患者目前的症状和精神病史与分裂情感性障碍一致。除了目前表现出躁狂的症状（例如，情绪高涨、睡眠需求减少、性欲亢进、夸大妄想），他还有妄想和幻觉史，发生在主要的[情绪发作](https://www.medsci.cn/article/show_article.do?id=12953de6e60b)之外（即，在住院期间没有情绪症状的精神病症状）。一生中至少有2周的[精神病](https://www.medsci.cn/article/show_article.do?id=1f662589e472)症状，没有情绪发作史，是分裂情感性障碍诊断的关键要求。\n\n将分裂情感性障碍与伴有精神病特征的双相情感障碍或伴有精神病特征的重度抑郁症区分开来，需要确定精神病症状与情绪症状之间的时间关系。在伴有精神病特征的双相情感障碍和伴有精神病特征的重度抑郁症中，精神病症状仅在躁狂或抑郁发作期间发生（选项A和C）；在情绪发作之外没有精神病症状。\n\n与分裂情感性障碍不同的是，精神分裂症的诊断不包括符合躁狂和/或抑郁发作标准的突出情绪症状（选项E）。\n\n（选项B）妄想症涉及至少1个月内有\\u22651个妄想，没有其他精神病症状（例如，幻觉、思维混乱和行为混乱）。\n\n（选项F）分裂样精神病具有与精神分裂症相同的症状（例如，妄想、幻觉、思维混乱和行为混乱、阴性症状），但病程为\\u22651个月且<6个月。\n\n教育目标：\n对于分裂情感性障碍的诊断，精神病必须在没有主要情绪发作的情况下发生，但情绪发作必须存在于这种终身疾病的大部分时间里。在伴有精神病特征的双相情感障碍和伴有精神病特征的重度抑郁症中，精神病症状仅在情绪发作期间发生。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to differentiate between psychotic disorders, specifically schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, and major depression with psychotic features, based on the temporal relationship between mood episodes and psychotic symptoms.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully evaluate the patient's current symptoms and past psychiatric history, paying close attention to the presence and timing of mood symptoms (mania or depression) in relation to psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations). The key is to determine if psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during mood episodes or also independently.",
