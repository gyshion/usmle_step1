One of her siblings recently started having similar symptoms. As part of a research study, genetic analysis is performed on the patient and the affected sibling. The results show a loss-of-function mutation that leads to accumulation of misfolded proteins. Which of the following biochemical processes is most likely defective in this patient?",

    "en": "Ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism {{exhibit_1}}\n\nUbiquitin is a protein found in eukaryotic cells that is attached to other substrate proteins in a highly regulated process termed ubiquitination. The proteasome recognizes ubiquitinated proteins and uses ATP energy to drive the proteins through its tubular structure, degrading them into small peptides; attachment of 4 or more ubiquitin monomers is typically required before proteasomal degradation can take place. Ubiquitination plays a role in many cell functions requiring the breakdown of specific proteins, including antigen processing, muscle wasting, cell cycle regulation, and disposal of misfolded proteins.\n\nImpairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease). Failure to properly degrade abnormal proteins can cause aggregation of misfolded proteins and eventual obstruction of intracellular molecular traffic, leading to cell death. Mutations in genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (eg, *Parkin, PINK1*, and *Dj-1*) are associated with autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson disease that have an early age of onset (age <50).\n\n(Choice A) Heterochromatin refers to condensed DNA that has a low level of transcriptional activity, whereas euchromatin (loosely arranged) has high levels of transcriptional activity. Histone acetylation promotes the formation of euchromatin; this process is impaired in Huntington disease, but is unrelated to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease.\n\n(Choice B) Vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation is critical for the functioning of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X and of anticoagulative proteins C and S. Warfarin inhibits reduction of vitamin K to its active form, which in turn prevents carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.\n\n(Choice C) One step in the hepatic processing of bilirubin includes bilirubin conjugation with glucuronic acid in the endoplasmic reticulum. Patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome lack the enzyme needed to catalyze bilirubin glucuronidation, causing severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\n\n(Choice D) Phosphorylation, or the addition of a phosphate group (PO₄³⁻) to a protein or other organic molecule, is commonly involved in the regulation of enzymatic activity. Hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins can contribute to abnormal protein aggregation in Alzheimer disease, not Parkinson disease.\n\nEducational objective: Ubiquitin is a protein that undergoes attachment to other proteins, labeling them for degradation by proteasomes. Impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Parkinson disease). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "泛素依赖性蛋白质分解代谢 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n泛素是一种在真核细胞中发现的蛋白质，它通过高度调节的过程附着于其他底物蛋白，称为泛素化。蛋白酶体识别泛素化蛋白，并利用ATP能量驱动蛋白质穿过其管状结构，将其降解为小肽；在发生蛋白酶体降解之前，通常需要连接4个或更多泛素单体。泛素化在许多细胞功能中发挥作用，这些功能需要分解特定蛋白质，包括抗原加工、肌肉萎缩、细胞周期调节和处理错误折叠蛋白。\n\n泛素-蛋白酶体系统的损伤可导致神经退行性疾病（例如，帕金森病、阿尔茨海默病）的发展。未能正确降解异常蛋白质会导致错误折叠蛋白的聚集，并最终阻碍细胞内分子交通，导致细胞死亡。参与泛素-蛋白酶体系统的基因（例如，*Parkin、PINK1* 和 *Dj-1*）的突变与早发型（年龄<50岁）常染色体隐性遗传形式的帕金森病有关。\n\n(选项A) 异染色质是指转录活性较低的浓缩DNA，而常染色质（松散排列）具有高水平的转录活性。组蛋白乙酰化促进常染色质的形成；该过程在亨廷顿病中受损，但与帕金森病的病理生理学无关。\n\n(选项B) 维生素K依赖性γ-羧化对于凝血因子II、VII、IX和X以及抗凝蛋白C和S的功能至关重要。华法林抑制维生素K还原为活性形式，进而阻止维生素K依赖性凝血因子的羧化。\n\n(选项C) 胆红素的肝脏处理的一个步骤包括胆红素与内质网中的葡萄糖醛酸结合。患有Crigler-Najjar综合征的患者缺乏催化胆红素葡萄糖醛酸化的酶，导致严重的非结合性高胆红素血症。\n\n(选项D) 磷酸化，或将磷酸基团（PO₄³⁻）添加到蛋白质或其他有机分子中，通常参与酶活性的调节。Tau蛋白的过度磷酸化可导致阿尔茨海默病中异常的蛋白质聚集，而非帕金森病。\n\n教育目标：泛素是一种蛋白质，其附着于其他蛋白质，将其标记为被蛋白酶体降解。泛素-蛋白酶体系统的损伤导致错误折叠蛋白的积累，这可能导致神经退行性疾病（例如，帕金森病）的发展。 {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"
