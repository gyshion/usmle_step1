  "correct_answer": "B",

    "en": "This scenario describes a typical case-control study design. People with the disease of interest (ie, **cases** [women who have just delivered babies with neural tube defects]) and people without this disease (ie, **controls** [women who delivered apparently healthy babies]) are asked about **previous exposure** to the risk factor being studied (eg, acetaminophen use during the first 3 months of pregnancy). The main measure of association is the **odds ratio (OR)**. The OR can be calculated as follows:\n\nOR = (odds of exposure in cases) / (odds of exposure in controls)\n\n(Choice A) Median survival is calculated in cohort studies or clinical trials, and is usually used to compare the median survival times in ≥2 groups of patients (eg, those receiving a new treatment and those receiving a placebo).\n\n(Choice C) Prevalence ratio is a ratio of 2 probabilities (ie, prevalence) commonly used in cross-sectional studies to compare the prevalence of disease among exposed and unexposed groups of people. In case-control studies, cases and controls are selected from a pool of potential cases and controls that do not represent the real frequency (ie, prevalence) of disease in the population. Therefore, estimating the prevalence of disease in case-control studies would be biased.\n\n(Choices D and E) Incidence measures (eg, relative risk or relative rate) cannot be directly measured in case-control studies because cases, by definition, already have the disease (ie, the study does not follow a cohort for development of a disease). Relative risk and relative rate are calculated in prospective and retrospective cohort studies, where risk factor assessment occurs **first** and then exposed and unexposed groups are followed over time and assessed for development of disease.\n\nEducational objective: A case-control study is used to compare the exposure status of people with the disease (ie, cases) to the exposure status of people without the disease (ie, controls). The main measure of association is the odds ratio.",
    "zh": "这种情况描述了一种典型的病例对照研究设计。询问患有目标疾病的人（即，**病例** [刚分娩出患有神经管缺陷婴儿的妇女]）和未患有此病的人（即，**对照组** [分娩出健康婴儿的妇女]）关于**先前暴露于**正在研究的危险因素（例如，怀孕前3个月期间使用对乙酰氨基酚）的情况。主要的关联指标是**比值比（OR）**。OR 可以按如下方式计算：\n\nOR = （病例中暴露的比值）/（对照组中暴露的比值）\n\n（选项A）中位生存期是在队列研究或临床试验中计算的，通常用于比较≥2组患者的中位生存时间（例如，接受新治疗的患者和接受安慰剂的患者）。\n\n（选项C）患病率比是两个概率（即，患病率）的比率，常用于横断面研究，以比较人群中暴露组和未暴露组的疾病患病率。在病例对照研究中，从潜在的病例和对照组中选择病例和对照组，这些病例和对照组并不能代表该人群中疾病的真实频率（即，患病率）。因此，在病例对照研究中估算疾病患病率会存在偏差。\n\n（选项D和E）发病率指标（例如，相对风险或相对率）无法在病例对照研究中直接测量，因为根据定义，病例已经患有该疾病（即，该研究不会跟踪队列以发展疾病）。相对风险和相对率是在前瞻性和回顾性队列研究中计算的，其中首先进行危险因素评估，然后随时间推移跟踪暴露组和未暴露组，并评估其疾病发展情况。\n\n教育目标：病例对照研究用于比较患有疾病的人（即病例）与未患有疾病的人（即对照组）的暴露状态。主要的关联指标是比值比。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of study designs, specifically case-control studies, and the appropriate measure of association used in such studies. It assesses the ability to differentiate between odds ratio, prevalence ratio, relative risk, and median survival in the context of a case-control study.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the study design as a case-control study, where groups with and without a disease are compared for prior exposure. In case-control studies, the odds ratio is the appropriate measure of association.",
