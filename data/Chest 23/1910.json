    "en": "A 44-year-old man comes to the emergency department with a 3-day history of fever, chills, malaise, dyspnea, and a cough productive of \"greenish\" sputum. The patient has no prior medical problems and has never been hospitalized. He has a 25-pack-year smoking history and drinks 4-5 beers a week. His temperature is 39.4 C (103 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, dullness to percussion, crackles, and egophony are present at the right lung base. The remainder of the examination is normal. Chest x-ray shows a dense infiltrate occupying the entire right lower lobe {{exhibit_1}}.",

    "en": "This middle-aged man presenting with new-onset fevers, productive cough, and a dense lobar infiltrate likely has community-acquired PNEUMONIA (CAP). CAP in otherwise healthy individuals is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common bacterial etiology worldwide. Tobacco use further increases its risk. In nonelderly patients, pneumococcal pneumonia presents with abrupt-onset fevers, rigors, tachypnea, and productive cough with consolidation in one lobe of the lungs.\n\nNeutrophil myeloperoxidase is responsible for the green color of pus and sputum in bacterial infections. It is a blue-green heme-based pigmented molecule contained within the azurophilic granules of neutrophils and catalyzes the production of hypochlorous acid from chloride and hydrogen peroxide during the phagocytic respiratory burst.\n\n(Choices A and B) Both the \"currant jelly\" sputum seen in pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and the \"rusty\" color occasionally seen in pneumococcal pneumonia are due to extravasation of red blood cells and hemoglobin into the sputum caused by extensive inflammation and necrosis.\n\n(Choice C) Pseudomonas pneumonia can cause a blue-green pigment due to the production of pyocyanin, but Pseudomonas is not a common cause of CAP in otherwise healthy adults.\n\n(Choice D) Respiratory epithelium sloughing and mucopolysaccharide production can contribute to the formation of sputum in patients with respiratory infection but does not contribute to sputum's green color.\n\nEducational objective: The green discoloration of pus or sputum seen during common bacterial infections is due to the presence of myeloperoxidase, a blue-green heme-based enzyme that is released from neutrophil azurophilic granules and forms hypochlorous acid (bleach).",
    "zh": "这位中年男性出现新发热、咳痰和致密的肺叶浸润，很可能患有社区获得性肺炎（CAP）。在其他方面健康的个体中，CAP最常见的病因是肺炎链球菌，这是全球最常见的细菌病原体。吸烟会进一步增加其风险。在非老年患者中，肺炎球菌性肺炎表现为突发性发热、寒战、呼吸急促和咳痰，伴有肺部一个叶的实变。\n\n中性粒细胞髓过氧化物酶是导致细菌感染中脓液和痰呈现绿色的原因。它是一种蓝绿色的血红素基色素分子，存在于中性粒细胞的嗜天青颗粒中，并在吞噬呼吸爆发过程中催化次氯酸从氯化物和过氧化氢中产生。\n\n（选项A和B）由肺炎克雷伯菌引起的肺炎中出现的“果酱状”痰和偶尔在肺炎球菌性肺炎中出现的“铁锈色”是由于广泛的炎症和坏死导致红细胞和血红蛋白外渗到痰中。\n\n（选项C）铜绿假单胞菌性肺炎可因产生绿脓菌素而引起蓝绿色色素沉着，但铜绿假单胞菌不是其他健康成年人中CAP的常见原因。\n\n（选项D）呼吸道上皮脱落和粘多糖的产生可导致呼吸道感染患者痰的形成，但不会导致痰的绿色。\n\n教育目标：在常见细菌感染期间看到的脓液或痰的绿色变色是由于髓过氧化物酶的存在，髓过氧化物酶是一种蓝绿色的血红素基酶，从嗜中性粒细胞嗜天青颗粒中释放出来，形成次氯酸（漂白剂）。"
