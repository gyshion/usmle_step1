    "en": "Many progressive neurologic diseases may be associated with cystic degeneration of the putamen, but Wilson's disease is the most likely of these to be emphasized on the USMLE.\n\nThe putamen (Choice B) can be identified on coronal sections (either in gross specimens as above or on imaging studies) in a location immediately deep (medial) to the insula and lateral to the globus pallidus and internal capsule. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) The globus pallidus is the orange-colored structure on the above image immediately medial to the degenerated putamen. It is considered part of the basal ganglia along with the caudate and putamen.\n\n(Choice C) The internal capsule is the white matter structure that separates the globus pallidus and putamen from the caudate nucleus anteriorly and from the thalamus posteriorly on coronal sections.\n\n(Choice D) In its full three dimensional structure, the caudate nucleus is a curved or \"C-shaped\" structure that can be identified in the inferolateral walls of the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles. However, only a small cross-section is visible in the image above next to the lateral ventricles. This structure is affected in Huntington's disease.\n\n(Choice E) The amygdala is a group of neurons in the medial temporal lobe located adjacent to the hippocampus that plays a role in the limbic system. The amygdala can be identified on the image above as the circular grey matter structures in the medial temporal lobe immediately inferior to the globus pallidus and putamen. The amygdala mediates fear and some sympathetic stimulation in humans.\n\nEducational Objective:\nWilson's disease can cause cystic degeneration of the putamen as well as damage to other basal ganglia structures. The putamen is located medial to the insula and lateral to the globus pallidus on coronal sections.",
    "zh": "许多进行性神经系统疾病可能与壳核的囊性变性有关，但威尔逊病最有可能在 USMLE 中被强调。\n\n壳核（选项 B）可以在冠状切面（如上图所示的标本或影像学研究中）中被识别，其位置紧邻脑岛深处（内侧）且位于苍白球和内囊的外侧。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n（选项 A）苍白球是上图中位于变性壳核正内侧的橙色结构。它与尾状核和壳核一起被认为是基底神经节的一部分。\n\n（选项 C）内囊是将苍白球和壳核与尾状核从前部分开，并在冠状切面上与丘脑从后部分开的白质结构。\n\n（选项 D）在它的完整三维结构中，尾状核是一个弯曲的或“C 形”结构，可以在侧脑室前角的下外侧壁中被识别。但是，在上图中，只有一小部分横截面可见于侧脑室旁边。亨廷顿氏病会影响这种结构。\n\n（选项 E）杏仁核是位于内侧颞叶中靠近海马体的一组神经元，在边缘系统中起作用。杏仁核可以在上图中被识别为内侧颞叶中位于苍白球和壳核正下方的圆形灰质结构。杏仁核调节人类的恐惧和一些交感神经刺激。\n\n教育目标：\n威尔逊病可导致壳核囊性变性以及对其他基底神经节结构的损害。壳核位于冠状切面上的脑岛内侧和苍白球外侧。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the identification of specific brain structures on a coronal section, particularly the putamen, and its association with neurological diseases like Wilson's disease. It assesses knowledge of neuroanatomy and the localization of basal ganglia components.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully examine the provided image of the brain section, identify the structure indicated by the black arrow, and correlate its anatomical position with the given options. Understanding the relative locations of the globus pallidus, putamen, internal capsule, caudate nucleus, and amygdala on a coronal view is crucial for accurate identification.",
