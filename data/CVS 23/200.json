  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's presentation with fatigue, progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, pulmonary crackles, and an S3 heart sound is consistent with decompensated heart failure. Appropriate treatment with diuretics and vasodilators resulted in symptomatic improvement and disappearance of the apical holosystolic murmur, which was most likely due to secondary (functional) mitral valve regurgitation (MR).\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\nWhereas primary MR is caused by an intrinsic defect of the mitral valve apparatus (eg, cleft in a valve cusp, myxomatous degeneration of the chordae tendineae), secondary MR occurs due to other factors. Decompensated heart failure is a common cause of secondary MR because it leads to an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), or preload, with dilation of the mitral valve annulus (the tissue on which the mitral valve cusps are mounted) and taut stretching of the chordae tendineae. The dilated annulus and restricted movement of the chordae tendineae can cause insufficient closure of an intrinsically normal mitral valve, resulting in MR. Systemic hypertension can also contribute to secondary MR by favoring relatively lower-resistance regurgitant flow.\n\nTreatment with diuretics to reduce LVEDV and vasodilators to reduce blood pressure can lead to resolution of heart failure-induced MR.\n\n(Choice A) Calcification of the mitral valve annulus may occur with aging, and can be accelerated by hypertension or advanced kidney disease. It is usually an incidental finding that does not affect mitral valve function.\n\n(Choice B) Increased flow velocity through the aortic valve occurs with aortic valve stenosis. The resulting murmur is crescendo-decrescendo and best heard at the right second intercostal space (rather than holosystolic and best heard at the apex).\n\n(Choice C) Chordae tendineae rupture is a potential cause of primary MR that can occur in the setting of bacterial endocarditis, connective tissue disease (eg, Marfan syndrome), or acute myocardial infarction. The resulting murmur does not resolve with diuretics and vasodilators; surgical repair is typically required.\n\n(Choice E) Thickened and deformed mitral valve cusps can occur in rheumatic heart disease and are a potential cause of primary MR. Such a murmur does not resolve with treatment of decompensated heart failure. In addition, mitral stenosis (evidenced by an opening snap and mid-diastolic rumble) is more likely than MR to occur with rheumatic heart disease.\n\nEducational objective:\nDecompensated heart failure is a common cause of secondary (functional) mitral valve regurgitation. Increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume causes dilation of the mitral valve annulus and restricted movement of the chordae tendineae with subsequent regurgitation. Treatment with diuretics and vasodilators can improve heart failure-induced MR.",
    "zh": "患者的临床表现包括疲劳、进行性呼吸困难、端坐呼吸、肺部啰音和S3心音，与失代偿性心力衰竭一致。使用利尿剂和血管扩张剂进行适当的治疗，症状得到了改善，心尖部全收缩期杂音消失，这很可能归因于继发性（功能性）二尖瓣反流（MR）。\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\n原发性MR是由二尖瓣装置的内在缺陷引起的（例如，瓣叶裂隙、腱索的粘液样变性），而继发性MR则由其他因素引起。失代偿性心力衰竭是继发性MR的常见原因，因为它会导致左心室舒张末期容积（LVEDV）或前负荷增加，伴有二尖瓣环（二尖瓣瓣叶附着的组织）扩张和腱索的紧张拉伸。扩张的瓣环和腱索的受限运动会导致内在正常的二尖瓣关闭不全，从而导致MR。全身性高血压也可导致继发性MR，因为它有利于相对低阻力的反流。\n\n使用利尿剂减少LVEDV和血管扩张剂降低血压可以导致心力衰竭引起的MR缓解。\n\n（选项A）二尖瓣环钙化可能随着年龄增长而发生，并可因高血压或晚期肾脏疾病而加速。这通常是一个偶然的发现，不会影响二尖瓣功能。\n\n（选项B）主动脉瓣血流速度增加发生在主动脉瓣狭窄时。由此产生的杂音呈渐强-减弱型，最好在右侧第二肋间隙听到（而不是全收缩期杂音，最好在心尖部听到）。\n\n（选项C）腱索断裂是原发性MR的潜在原因，可能发生在细菌性心内膜炎、结缔组织疾病（例如，马凡综合征）或急性心肌梗死的情况下。由此产生的杂音不会随着利尿剂和血管扩张剂的治疗而消失；通常需要手术修复。\n\n（选项E）二尖瓣瓣叶增厚和变形可发生在风湿性心脏病中，是原发性MR的潜在原因。这种杂音不会随着失代偿性心力衰竭的治疗而消失。此外，风湿性心脏病更可能发生二尖瓣狭窄（表现为开放拍和中舒张期隆隆声），而不是MR。\n\n教育目标：\n失代偿性心力衰竭是继发性（功能性）二尖瓣反流的常见原因。左心室舒张末期容积增加导致二尖瓣环扩张和腱索的受限运动，进而导致反流。使用利尿剂和血管扩张剂可以改善心力衰竭引起的MR。"
