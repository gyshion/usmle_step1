    "en": "A 52-year-old woman comes to the office due to a hand tremor that has been present for several months. It is most prominent while she is carrying out simple daily activities such as drinking from a glass or pouring from a tea kettle. When asked if anything improves the tremor, the patient mentions that it subsides somewhat when she drinks small amounts of alcohol. Family history is significant for similar problems in her mother. Vital signs are normal. Neurologic examination shows bilateral tremor in the upper extremities. ",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has ESSENTIAL TREMOR, the most commonly diagnosed movement disorder. Essential tremor is also referred to as familial tremor as it often follows autosomal dominant inheritance. A positive family history of tremor can sometimes assist in making the diagnosis. Essential tremor classically worsens while maintaining a particular posture (eg, when holding an object). Patients commonly report that their symptoms improve with alcohol consumption. Propranolol is the first-line treatment for essential tremor. This nonselective β-adrenergic antagonist is thought to lessen the tremor via central nervous system effects.\n\n(Choice A) Benztropine is an anticholinergic agent that can be used to treat Parkinson disease and to counteract the extrapyramidal side effects of neuroleptic medications such as haloperidol.\n\n(Choices B and D) Haloperidol is most commonly used to treat the positive symptoms of psychosis (eg, delusions, hallucinations). Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that blocks D₂ (dopamine) and 5HT₂ (serotonin) receptors in the CNS.\n\n(Choice C) Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that is effective for treatment of seizures and alcohol withdrawal. This patient has intention tremor for several months and family history is positive for essential tremor; these findings would make alcohol withdrawal very unlikely.\n\n(Choice E) L-DOPA, or levodopa, is used in combination with the DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa to treat Parkinson disease. Patients with Parkinson disease have a resting tremor.",
    "zh": "该患者患有原发性震颤，这是最常见的被诊断出的运动障碍。原发性震颤也被称为家族性震颤，因为它通常遵循常染色体显性遗传。震颤的阳性家族史有时可以帮助诊断。原发性震颤在保持特定姿势（例如，握住物体时）时会加重。患者通常报告饮酒后症状有所改善。普萘洛尔是原发性震颤的一线治疗药物。这种非选择性β-肾上腺素能受体拮抗剂被认为通过中枢神经系统作用减轻震颤。\n\n（选项A）苯托品是一种抗胆碱能药物，可用于治疗帕金森病并对抗神经安定剂（如氟哌啶醇）的锥体外系副作用。\n\n（选项B和D）氟哌啶醇最常用于治疗精神病的阳性症状（例如，妄想、幻觉）。氯氮平是一种非典型抗精神病药，可阻断中枢神经系统中的D₂（多巴胺）和5HT₂（血清素）受体。\n\n（选项C）地西泮是一种苯二氮卓类药物，可有效治疗癫痫发作和酒精戒断。该患者有数月意向性震颤，并且家族史对原发性震颤呈阳性；这些发现使得酒精戒断的可能性非常小。\n\n（选项E）左旋多巴与多巴脱羧酶抑制剂卡比多巴联合使用，用于治疗帕金森病。帕金森病患者有静止性震颤。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of essential tremor, its clinical presentation, and first-line treatment options. It requires differentiating essential tremor from other tremor disorders like Parkinson's disease and understanding the pharmacology of medications used to treat movement disorders.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the classic features of essential tremor (action tremor, family history, improvement with alcohol) and recall the first-line treatment, which is a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist like propranolol.",
    "zh": "此题考察了对原发性震颤、其临床表现以及一线治疗方案的认识。它需要将原发性震颤与其他震颤障碍（如帕金森病）区分开来，并了解用于治疗运动障碍的药物的药理学。\n\n最佳方法是识别原发性震颤的典型特征（动作性震颤、家族史、饮酒后改善）并回忆起一线治疗方法，即非选择性β-肾上腺素能受体拮抗剂，如普萘洛尔。"
