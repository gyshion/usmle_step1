    "en": "A 44-year-old man who was recently diagnosed with idiopathic membranous nephropathy after developing edema comes to the office due to a sudden onset of left flank pain and gross hematuria. The patient has no other medical problems. He is taking furosemide and ramipril. Blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg and pulse is 88/min. On examination, there is left flank tenderness. The patient's edema has improved from the previous visit. There is a left-sided varicocele that the patient has not noticed before. Urinalysis shows increased proteinuria and new hematuria. Serum lactate dehydrogenase is elevated. Urinary loss of which of the following substances most likely predisposed this patient to his acute condition?",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with membranous nephropathy, flank pain, hematuria, and left varicocele likely has renal vein thrombosis (RVT) as a result of nephrotic syndrome. Due to increased glomerular capillary wall permeability in nephrotic syndrome, many important substances are lost in the urine, causing a number of complications. Loss of anticoagulation factors, especially antithrombin III, leads to a hypercoagulable state, of which RVT can be a manifestation. Patients with RVT can develop sudden-onset abdominal or flank pain and gross hematuria with elevated lactate dehydrogenase as a result of renal infarction.\n\nLeft-sided varicoceles are relatively common in healthy pubertal men as the aorta and superior mesenteric artery can compress the left renal vein (\"nutcracker effect\"), resulting in increased intravascular pressure in the left gonadal vein with retrograde blood flow and varicocele formation. However, a new-onset left varicocele associated with ipsilateral flank pain and hematuria should raise suspicion for RVT causing impaired left gonadal venous drainage.\n\n(Choice A) Albumin is also lost in massive quantities in urine in nephrotic syndrome, leading to hypoproteinemia, decreased intravascular oncotic pressure, and fluid shifts into the interstitium. Albuminuria explains the patient's edema (improved from his previous visit) but not his acute flank pain, hematuria, and left-sided varicocele, which are more likely due to thrombosis. Protein loss also results in a negative nitrogen balance.\n\n(Choice B) Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited condition that results in early emphysema and liver cirrhosis.\n\n(Choice D) Serum ceruloplasmin is decreased in Wilson disease (hepatolenticular degeneration), which is clinically characterized by liver disease, motor abnormalities, and psychiatric symptoms. Ceruloplasmin has no role in the pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome.\n\n(Choice E) The loss of immunoglobulins and low-molecular-weight components of complement (such as factor B) makes patients with nephrotic syndrome vulnerable to infections, especially pneumococcal infections.\n\n(Choice F) Lipiduria is common in nephrotic syndrome as a result of increased lipoprotein synthesis by the liver and increased glomerular capillary wall permeability, leading to lipid loss in the urine in the form of free fat and oval fat bodies (with characteristic Maltese cross appearance under polarized light). However, lipiduria does not contribute to the hypercoagulable state.\n\nEducational objective:\nNephrotic syndrome is a hypercoagulable state. Sudden-onset abdominal or flank pain, hematuria, and left-sided varicoceles suggest renal vein thrombosis, a well-known complication of nephrotic syndrome. Loss of anticoagulation factors, especially ANTITHROMBIN III, is responsible for the thrombotic and thromboembolic complications of nephrotic syndrome.",
    "zh": "该患者患有膜性肾病、腰痛、血尿和左侧精索静脉曲张，很可能由于肾病综合征而发生肾静脉血栓形成（RVT）。由于肾病综合征时肾小球毛细血管壁通透性增加，尿液中会丢失许多重要物质，从而引起多种并发症。抗凝血因子的丢失，特别是抗凝血酶III的丢失，会导致高凝状态，而RVT可以是其表现之一。RVT患者可出现突发性腹部或腰痛和肉眼血尿，并伴有乳酸脱氢酶升高，这是肾梗死的表现。\n\n左侧精索静脉曲张在健康的青春期男性中相对常见，因为主动脉和肠系膜上动脉可以压迫左肾静脉（“胡桃夹效应”），导致左侧性腺静脉内压力升高，血液逆流并形成精索静脉曲张。然而，新发左侧精索静脉曲张，伴有同侧腰痛和血尿，应怀疑RVT导致左侧性腺静脉引流受损。\n\n(选项A) 白蛋白也会在肾病综合征时大量丢失在尿液中，导致低蛋白血症，血管内胶体渗透压降低，液体向间质转移。白蛋白尿可以解释患者的水肿（与上次就诊相比有所改善），但不能解释他的急性腰痛、血尿和左侧精索静脉曲张，这些更可能是由于血栓形成引起的。蛋白质的丢失也会导致负氮平衡。\n\n(选项B) α-1抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症是一种遗传性疾病，会导致早期肺气肿和肝硬化。\n\n(选项D) 血清铜蓝蛋白在威尔逊病（肝豆状核变性）中降低，其临床特征为肝病、运动异常和精神症状。铜蓝蛋白在肾病综合征的发病机制中没有作用。\n\n(选项E) 免疫球蛋白和补体低分子量成分（如因子B）的丢失使肾病综合征患者容易感染，特别是肺炎球菌感染。\n\n(选项F) 脂尿在肾病综合征中很常见，这是由于肝脏脂蛋白合成增加和肾小球毛细血管壁通透性增加所致，导致尿液中以游离脂肪和卵圆脂肪体的形式出现脂质丢失（在偏振光下具有特征性的马耳他十字外观）。然而，脂尿不会导致高凝状态。\n\n教育目标：\n肾病综合征是一种高凝状态。突发性腹部或腰痛、血尿和左侧精索静脉曲张提示肾静脉血栓形成，这是肾病综合征的常见并发症。抗凝血因子的丢失，特别是抗凝血酶III的丢失，是导致肾病综合征血栓形成和血栓栓塞并发症的原因。"
