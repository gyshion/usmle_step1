    "en": "{{exhibit_1}}A 56-year-old man comes to the office for evaluation of right leg pain and numbness. The pain started 2 days ago during an 8-hour car ride during which the patient was a backseat passenger in a small car. Midway through the car ride, he began to have numbness and burning pain over the lateral aspect of the right thigh. {{exhibit_2}}The patient has tried stretching to relieve the pain, but it has only worsened and he is now unable to wear a belt due to the discomfort. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and has gained 11.3 kg (25 lb) over the past year. BMI is 42 kg/m². On examination, lower extremity strength is 5/5 bilaterally. The right leg has a large area of numbness over the upper lateral thigh. Straight leg raise is negative. Reflexes are symmetrical and intact. {{exhibit_3}}Compression of which of the following nerves is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation? {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve & meralgia paresthetica\n\nThis patient has pain and decreased sensation in the distribution of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN), consistent with meralgia paresthetica (MP). The LFCN is a branch of the lumbar plexus, originating from L2-L3. It runs lateral to the psoas muscle and exits the abdomen beneath the inguinal ligament. MP is a compression mononeuropathy of the LFCN at the inguinal ligament, typically caused by tight clothing (eg, belts) or by injury during surgery (eg, hip arthroplasty). Those with obesity, increased lumbar lordosis (eg, pregnancy), or diabetes mellitus are at increased risk.\n\nMP presents with pain, paresthesia, and numbness in the lateral thigh above the knee. However, strength is normal because the LFCN does not contain motor fibers. The diagnosis is usually based on clinical findings. Most patients are managed with weight loss and avoidance of tight clothing.\n\n(Choice A) The ilioinguinal nerve primarily provides sensory innervation to the upper medial thigh and genital region. It accompanies the spermatic cord through the superficial inguinal ring; injury during pelvic or hernia surgery can lead to chronic suprapubic or groin pain.\n\n(Choice C) The obturator nerve is typically injured in anterior hip dislocation or pelvic surgery. Sensory symptoms occur in the medial thigh and are often associated with weakness in the adductor muscles.\n\n(Choice D) The pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2-S4) provide parasympathetic innervation to the hindgut, bladder, and urinary sphincters and regulate peristalsis, bladder emptying, and defecation. They are commonly involved in cauda equina syndrome (eg, lumbar epidural metastasis) but are not vulnerable to external compression and would not cause lateral thigh symptoms.\n\n(Choice E) The sciatic nerve arises from the L4-S3 nerve roots. Compression of the nerve (or contributing nerve roots) can occur at the spine (eg, herniated disc), piriformis muscle, greater sciatic foramen, or posterior thigh. Sciatica is a classic (though nonspecific) syndrome characterized by back and buttock pain that radiates down the posterior thigh to the foot; associated features include lower extremity weakness and a positive straight leg raise test.",
    "zh": "股外侧皮神经和股外侧皮神经感觉异常\n\n该患者在股外侧皮神经（LFCN）的分布区域出现疼痛和感觉减退，这与股外侧皮神经感觉异常（MP）一致。LFCN是腰丛的分支，起源于L2-L3。它位于腰大肌的外侧，并从腹股沟韧带下方穿出腹部。MP是LFCN在腹股沟韧带处的压迫性单神经病变，通常由紧身衣物（例如，腰带）或手术（例如，髋关节置换术）中的损伤引起。肥胖、腰椎前凸增加（例如，妊娠）或糖尿病患者的风险增加。\n\nMP表现为膝盖上方大腿外侧疼痛、感觉异常和麻木。然而，力量是正常的，因为LFCN不包含运动纤维。诊断通常基于临床发现。大多数患者通过减轻体重和避免穿紧身衣物来治疗。\n\n(选项 A) 髂腹股沟神经主要为大腿内侧上部和生殖器区域提供感觉神经支配。它与精索一起穿过腹股沟浅环；在盆腔或疝气手术中的损伤可导致慢性耻骨上或腹股沟疼痛。\n\n(选项 C) 闭孔神经通常在髋关节前脱位或盆腔手术中受损。感觉症状发生在大腿内侧，并且通常与内收肌无力有关。\n\n(选项 D) 盆内脏神经（S2-S4）为后肠、膀胱和尿道括约肌提供副交感神经支配，并调节蠕动、膀胱排空和排便。它们通常参与马尾综合征（例如，腰椎硬膜外转移瘤），但不容易受到外部压迫，也不会引起大腿外侧的症状。\n\n(选项 E) 坐骨神经起源于L4-S3神经根。神经（或相关神经根）的压迫可发生在脊柱（例如，椎间盘突出）、梨状肌、坐骨大孔或大腿后部。坐骨神经痛是一种经典的（尽管非特异性的）综合征，其特征是背部和臀部疼痛放射到大腿后部到足部；相关特征包括下肢无力和直腿抬高试验阳性。"
