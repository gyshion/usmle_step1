    "en": "A 68-year-old man comes to the office due to worsening back pain. The patient has a history of severe lumbar degenerative disc disease that limits his daily activities. He declined surgery, and treatment with nonpharmacologic interventions and nonopioid analgesics have not adequately controlled the pain. The patient began taking long-acting oxycodone 5 months ago with good pain control. Over the past 2 months, he reports progressive worsening of the pain despite a modest increase in dose. The patient also takes acetaminophen for breakthrough pain and an osmotic laxative for constipation. Physical examination shows lower paraspinal tenderness but no lower extremity neurologic deficits. Spine imaging shows no significant changes from previous studies.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient is receiving chronic opioid therapy for nonspecific low back pain due to lumbar osteoarthritis. He reports worsening pain despite an increased drug dose. No new structural explanation for increased pain was revealed on medical evaluation (ie, unchanged spine imaging and physical examination). Therefore, the loss of opioid analgesic efficacy is likely due to DRUG TOLERANCE: higher doses of drugs are required to achieve the same clinical effect.\n\nA distinction is drawn between pharmacokinetic versus pharmacodynamic tolerance:\n\n*   Pharmacokinetic tolerance (ADME): The plasma level of the active drug is decreased due to impaired Absorption (eg, short bowel syndrome), increased Tissue Distribution (eg, plasma protein binding, adiposity), increased Metabolism (eg, P450 cytochrome induction), or increased Excretion.\n*   Pharmacodynamic tolerance: The plasma level of the active drug is unchanged (ie, normal pharmacokinetics). However, the action of the drug on target cells is blunted (eg, RECEPTOR DOWNREGULATION, decreased intracellular signaling), reducing the overall pharmacologic effect.\n\nIn both cases, tolerance can be innate or acquired. Innate tolerance refers to inborn differences in genes coding for enzymes involved in drug metabolism (pharmacokinetic) or receptor structure/expression (pharmacodynamic). Innate tolerance is apparent from the first dose, which elicits an unexpectedly weak effect. This patient experienced a good analgesic response initially, arguing against the presence of innate tolerance (Choice A).\n\nAcquired tolerance is defined as a decreased pharmacologic response following prolonged drug exposure. ACQUIRED PHARMACODYNAMIC TOLERANCE is the primary form of chronic opioid tolerance, characterized by downregulation and decreased responsiveness of the mu opioid receptor system compared to the opioid-naïve state.\n\n(Choice C) The kappa and delta opioid receptors bind to endogenous opioid-like neuropeptides (dynorphin and enkephalins, respectively) to mediate analgesia. Like mu receptors, they are also downregulated by chronic opioid administration, contributing further to acquired pharmacodynamic tolerance.\n\n(Choice D) In acquired pharmacokinetic tolerance, altered ADME results in lower plasma drug levels. Higher rates of metabolism (eg, P450 enzyme autoinduction) can accelerate the inactivation/elimination of many medications (eg, methadone, carbamazepine). However, lower rates of excretion (eg, renal or hepatic insufficiency) would raise the plasma drug concentration, leading to potential overdose rather than tolerance.\n\n(Choice E) Adiposity (eg, increasing obesity) can contribute to pharmacokinetic tolerance by raising the apparent volume of distribution, thereby lowering the plasma drug concentration. However, equilibration between plasma and extravascular compartments is complete within 3 days half-lives, occurring long before this patient's development of tolerance after 3 months. Furthermore, adipose partitioning is primarily a concern for highly lipophilic drugs (eg, fentanyl, not oxycodone).\n\nEducational objective:\nChronic opioid therapy leads to the development of acquired pharmacokinetic tolerance via downregulation and decreased responsiveness of opioid receptor systems.",
    "zh": "该患者正在接受慢性阿片类药物治疗，以治疗因腰椎骨关节炎引起的非特异性腰痛。他报告说，尽管增加了药物剂量，但疼痛却加重了。在医学评估中（即脊柱影像学检查和体格检查未改变），未发现疼痛加重的新结构性解释。因此，阿片类药物镇痛疗效的丧失很可能归因于药物耐受性：需要更高剂量的药物才能达到相同的临床效果。\n\n需要区分药代动力学耐受性和药效学耐受性：\n\n*   药代动力学耐受性 (ADME)：活性药物的血浆水平降低，原因是吸收受损（例如，短肠综合征）、组织分布增加（例如，血浆蛋白结合、肥胖）、代谢增加（例如，P450细胞色素诱导）或排泄增加。\n*   药效学耐受性：活性药物的血浆水平未改变（即，正常的药代动力学）。然而，药物对靶细胞的作用减弱（例如，受体下调、细胞内信号传导减少），从而降低了整体药理效应。\n\n在这两种情况下，耐受性可以是先天的或获得的。先天性耐受性是指参与药物代谢（药代动力学）或受体结构/表达（药效学）的酶的基因的先天差异。先天性耐受性从第一剂开始就很明显，会引起出乎意料的弱效应。该患者最初经历了良好的镇痛反应，这与存在先天性耐受性（选项 A）相反。\n\n获得性耐受性定义为长期药物暴露后药理反应降低。获得性药效学耐受性是慢性阿片类药物耐受性的主要形式，其特征是与未用过阿片类药物的状态相比，mu阿片受体系统的下调和反应性降低。\n\n（选项 C）kappa和delta阿片受体分别与内源性类阿片肽（强啡肽和脑啡肽）结合，以介导镇痛作用。与mu受体一样，它们也会因慢性阿片类药物的给药而下调，从而进一步促成获得性药效学耐受性。\n\n（选项 D）在获得性药代动力学耐受性中，改变的 ADME 会导致血浆药物水平降低。较高的代谢率（例如，P450酶的自身诱导）可以加速许多药物的失活/消除（例如，美沙酮、卡马西平）。然而，较低的排泄率（例如，肾或肝功能不全）会升高血浆药物浓度，从而导致潜在的药物过量而非耐受性。\n\n（选项 E）肥胖（例如，肥胖增加）可以通过提高表观分布容积，从而降低血浆药物浓度，从而促成药代动力学耐受性。然而，血浆和血管外隔室之间的平衡在3天的半衰期内完成，这远早于该患者在3个月后出现的耐受性。此外，脂肪分布主要与高亲脂性药物（例如，芬太尼，而非羟考酮）有关。\n\n教育目标：\n慢性阿片类药物治疗会导致获得性药代动力学耐受性的发展，这要通过阿片受体系统的下调和反应性降低来实现。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of opioid tolerance, specifically differentiating between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms, and innate versus acquired tolerance. It assesses the ability to apply these concepts to a clinical scenario of worsening pain despite increased opioid dosage.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the clinical presentation suggestive of opioid tolerance. Then, one must differentiate between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms based on the information provided, and consider whether the tolerance is innate or acquired. Finally, the most likely mechanism fitting the patient's history and presentation should be selected.",
