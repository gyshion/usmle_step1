    "en": "A 28-year-old man comes to the clinic due to cough and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of intermittent asthma controlled with an as-needed albuterol inhaler. Over the last month, he has noticed increased severity and frequency of his symptoms. The patient occasionally wakes up at night with coughing spells and has had to use his albuterol inhaler several times per week due to shortness of breath. An inhaled corticosteroid is prescribed to achieve better symptom control. In addition to an anti-inflammatory effect, which of the following effects also directly occurs as a result of this therapy?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Asthma is a complex disease involving both chronic inflammation and airway hyperreactivity. **Inhaled corticosteroids** (eg, fluticasone, budesonide) are a mainstay of asthma therapy. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation by inhibiting nuclear transcription of inflammatory genes (in part leading to downregulation of the enzyme phospholipase A2) to decrease the production of leukotrienes and other inflammatory mediators.\n\nAlthough corticosteroids have no direct effect on bronchodilation, these drugs provide an additional benefit in asthma by **potentiating the bronchodilatory effect** of beta-2 agonists (eg, albuterol). This is accomplished by stimulating the **upregulation of beta-2 receptors** in bronchial smooth muscle, increasing cellular responsiveness to adrenergic stimuli. This medication effect is similar to the permissive effect of endogenous cortisol on blood pressure, which involves upregulation of alpha-1 receptors and increased responsiveness of vascular smooth muscle cells to epinephrine.\n\n(Choice A) Corticosteroids increase, rather than decrease, the production of lung surfactants and may be used to help prevent infant respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants.\n\n(Choice B) Guaifenesin reduces the viscosity (ie, thickness) of respiratory tract mucus and is often used in the symptomatic management of viral upper respiratory tract infections. Decreased mucus viscosity is not a direct effect of corticosteroids.\n\n(Choice C) Theophylline provides benefit in asthma by stimulating bronchodilation via inhibition of phosphodiesterase-3 and may also create an anti-inflammatory effect via inhibition of phosphodiesterase-4. Corticosteroids may somewhat decrease phosphodiesterase activity but likely do not have a significant effect.\n\n(Choice D) Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that treats asthma by binding to free IgE to decrease IgE binding to surface receptors on mast cells and basophils. This inhibits the degranulation of inflammatory mediators. The anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids may also contribute to a decrease, rather than an increase, in surface-bound IgE.",
    "zh": "哮喘是一种复杂的疾病，涉及慢性炎症和气道高反应性。**吸入性皮质类固醇**（例如，氟替卡松、布地奈德）是哮喘治疗的主要方法。皮质类固醇通过抑制炎症基因的核转录（部分导致磷脂酶A2酶的下调）来减少炎症，从而减少白三烯和其他炎症介质的产生。\n\n尽管皮质类固醇对支气管扩张没有直接影响，但这些药物通过**增强β-2受体激动剂的支气管扩张作用**（例如，沙丁胺醇）在哮喘中提供了额外的益处。这是通过刺激支气管平滑肌中**β-2受体的上调**来实现的，从而增加了细胞对肾上腺素能刺激的反应性。这种药物作用类似于内源性皮质醇对血压的允许作用，涉及α-1受体的上调和血管平滑肌细胞对肾上腺素的反应性增加。\n\n(选项A) 皮质类固醇增加而非减少肺表面活性物质的产生，并且可用于帮助预防早产儿的婴儿呼吸窘迫综合征。\n\n(选项B) 愈创甘油醚可降低呼吸道粘液的粘度（即厚度），常用于病毒性上呼吸道感染的对症治疗。粘液粘度降低不是皮质类固醇的直接作用。\n\n(选项C) 茶碱通过抑制磷酸二酯酶-3来刺激支气管扩张，从而在哮喘中发挥作用，并且还可以通过抑制磷酸二酯酶-4产生抗炎作用。皮质类固醇可能在一定程度上降低磷酸二酯酶活性，但可能没有显著影响。\n\n(选项D) 奥马珠单抗是一种单克隆抗体，通过与游离IgE结合来治疗哮喘，从而减少IgE与肥大细胞和嗜碱性粒细胞表面受体的结合。这抑制了炎症介质的脱颗粒。皮质类固醇的抗炎作用也可能有助于减少而非增加表面结合的IgE。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of inhaled corticosteroids in asthma management, specifically their effect on beta-2 receptor responsiveness. It also requires understanding of other asthma medications and their mechanisms.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that corticosteroids, in addition to their anti-inflammatory effects, upregulate beta-2 receptors, thereby potentiating the bronchodilatory effect of beta-2 agonists like albuterol.",
    "zh": "此问题考察了吸入性皮质类固醇在哮喘管理中的作用机制，特别是它们对β-2受体反应性的影响。它还需要了解其他哮喘药物及其机制。\n\n解决此问题的关键是认识到皮质类固醇除了其抗炎作用外，还会上调β-2受体，从而增强β-2受体激动剂（如沙丁胺醇）的支气管扩张作用。"
