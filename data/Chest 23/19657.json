    "en": "A 9-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department due to fever and cough. Her symptoms began approximately 2 days ago and have been worsening. The patient is otherwise healthy except for an episode of acute otitis media 3 weeks ago that resolved following a course of oral amoxicillin. She lives with her mother, father, and grandmother who have been in good health. Her mother smokes cigarettes. Temperature is 38.5 C (101.3 F) and respirations are 34/min. Pulse oximetry is 95% on room air. Pulmonary examination reveals mild subcostal retractions and focal crackles in the left lower lobe. Which of the following underlying factors is most likely contributing to this patient's current condition?",

    "en": "This patient has fever, cough, and focal crackles, which are findings consistent with pneumonia. Transmission typically occurs via droplet spread of a bacterium (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae) with subsequent colonization of the nasopharynx and microaspiration into the lungs.\n\nRespiratory defense mechanisms often prevent infection of the lower respiratory tract, and the first line of defense is the ciliated epithelium and mucus-producing cells that line the respiratory tract. Pathogens become entrapped in mucus and are transported upward and out of the nasopharynx by the sweeping cilia. Other defense mechanisms include binding by immunoglobulin (eg, secretory IgA, opsonizing IgG and IgM), phagocytosis by alveolar and interstitial macrophages, and cell-mediated cytotoxic activity.\n\nSecondhand smoke exposure disrupts natural host defenses and increases the risk of pneumonia, particularly in infants who have a parent that smokes. Cigarette smoke induces mucus overproduction and impairs ciliary function, leading to delayed clearance of pathogens and respiratory secretions. In addition to respiratory infections, children with secondhand smoke exposure are also at increased risk for asthma and wheezing and are more likely to have recurrent otitis media. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) A decreased number of monocytes may occur with bone marrow dysfunction, which would typically cause severe, disseminated infections (not seen in this patient). In addition, although the phagocytic function of alveolar macrophages (differentiated type of monocyte) is impaired in patients with cigarette smoke exposure, these cells are typically present in increased (not decreased) numbers.\n\n(Choice B) Although cigarette smoke exposure is associated with increased risk of asthma, airway hyperreactivity causes bronchoconstriction and wheezing, not pneumonia as seen in this patient.\n\n(Choice D) Inhibited B cell maturation, as seen with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, typically presents with recurrent sinopulmonary infections in young boys, not girls. In addition, cigarette smoke can increase (not decrease) IgE production due to allergic sensitization.\n\n(Choice E) Reduced alveolar surface area occurs with emphysema, which is a late lung finding in patients who smoke. Emphysema would not be present in infancy and does not cause pneumonia.\n\nEducational objective:\nInfants with secondhand smoke exposure are at increased risk for pneumonia because cigarette smoke affects alveolar macrophage function and impairs mucociliary clearance.",
    "zh": "该患者有发烧、咳嗽和局灶性啰音，这些表现与肺炎一致。 肺炎通常通过细菌（例如，肺炎链球菌）的飞沫传播发生，随后定植于鼻咽部并微吸入肺部。\n\n呼吸防御机制通常可防止下呼吸道感染，第一道防线是覆盖呼吸道的纤毛上皮和产黏液细胞。 病原体被困在黏液中，并通过扫动纤毛向上运输并移出鼻咽部。 其他防御机制包括免疫球蛋白（例如，分泌性 IgA、调理 opsonizing IgG 和 IgM）的结合、肺泡和间质巨噬细胞的吞噬作用以及细胞介导的细胞毒活性。\n\n二手烟暴露会破坏自然的宿主防御，并增加患肺炎的风险，尤其是在有吸烟父母的婴儿中。 香烟烟雾会诱导黏液过度产生并损害纤毛功能，导致病原体和呼吸道分泌物清除延迟。 除了呼吸道感染外，接触二手烟的儿童患哮喘和喘息的风险也增加，并且更有可能复发性中耳炎。 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项 A）单核细胞数量减少可能发生在骨髓功能障碍时，这通常会导致严重的播散性感染（在此患者中未见）。 此外，尽管接触香烟烟雾的患者的肺泡巨噬细胞（分化的单核细胞）的吞噬功能受损，但这些细胞通常以增加（而非减少）的数量存在。\n\n（选项 B）尽管接触香烟烟雾与哮喘风险增加相关，但气道高反应性会导致支气管收缩和喘息，而不是像该患者那样患肺炎。\n\n（选项 D）B 细胞成熟受抑制，如 X 连锁无丙种球蛋白血症所示，通常表现为年轻男孩复发性鼻窦肺部感染，而不是女孩。 此外，由于过敏致敏，香烟烟雾会增加（而非减少）IgE 的产生。\n\n（选项 E）肺泡表面积减少发生在肺气肿中，这是吸烟患者的晚期肺部表现。 肺气肿不会出现在婴儿期，也不会引起肺炎。\n\n教育目标：\n接触二手烟的婴儿患肺炎的风险增加，因为香烟烟雾会影响肺泡巨噬细胞的功能并损害纤毛黏液清除。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of risk factors for pneumonia in infants, specifically the impact of secondhand smoke exposure on respiratory defense mechanisms. It assesses understanding of how cigarette smoke impairs mucociliary clearance, increasing susceptibility to respiratory infections.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the most relevant risk factor given the patient's history and clinical presentation. Consider the patient's age, symptoms, and exposure history to narrow down the potential underlying factors contributing to the pneumonia.",
