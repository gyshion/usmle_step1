  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Minors (age <18) usually require parental consent for medical treatment; however, consent is generally not required in the following situations:\n\n*   Legal or situational emancipation (eg, parent, married)\n*   Emergency care in which delay of care could result in significant harm to life or limb\n*   Specific conditions (eg, sexually transmitted infection [STI], pregnancy, substance abuse) that are potentially serious, sensitive, or stigmatizing\n\nAllowing minors to consent for treatment of certain potentially serious medical conditions (eg, STI) encourages them to seek services without concern of parental involvement, as in this patient's situation. In most states, minors can also consent to substance abuse and mental health treatment as well as reproductive services, although there may be variations among states (eg, requiring minors to be a minimum age). Some, but not all states, also exclude information about sensitive services from insurance documentation that is sent to the parent (policyholder).\n\n(Choice A) Notification of parents for STIs other than HIV is not mandated in any state.\n\n(Choices B and E) The patient can obtain evaluation and treatment for STIs, including antibiotics, without parental notification or consent.\n\n(Choice C) Although it is often preferable for parents to be involved in their child's care, it should not be automatically assumed that disclosing information would be in the patient's best interest. This response also dismisses the patient's concern about confidentiality and fails to answer her question.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nMinors do not require parental consent for medical treatment of conditions that may be sensitive or stigmatizing such as sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy, and substance abuse.",
    "zh": "未成年人（年龄<18岁）通常需要父母同意才能进行医疗治疗；然而，在以下情况下，通常不需要同意：\n\n*   法律或情境上的解放（例如，父母，已婚）\n*   在紧急情况下，延误治疗可能导致对生命或肢体造成重大伤害\n*   特定情况（例如，性传播感染 [STI]，妊娠，药物滥用），这些情况可能很严重，敏感或具有污名性\n\n允许未成年人同意治疗某些潜在的严重医疗状况（例如，STI），鼓励他们寻求服务，而不必担心父母的参与，就像这位患者的情况一样。在大多数州，未成年人还可以同意药物滥用和精神健康治疗以及生殖服务，尽管各州之间可能存在差异（例如，要求未成年人达到最低年龄）。一些但并非所有州，也会从发送给父母（保单持有人）的保险文件中排除有关敏感服务的信息。\n\n（选项A）任何州都没有强制要求通知父母除HIV之外的STI。\n\n（选项B和E）患者可以获得STI的评估和治疗，包括抗生素，无需父母通知或同意。\n\n（选项C）尽管父母参与孩子的护理通常是可取的，但不能自动假定披露信息符合患者的最佳利益。这种反应也无视了患者对保密性的担忧，并且未能回答她的问题。\n\n教育目标：\n\n未成年人不需要父母同意治疗可能敏感或带有污名性的疾病，例如性传播感染、怀孕和药物滥用。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question assesses the legal and ethical considerations surrounding the treatment of minors, specifically regarding sexually transmitted infections and parental consent. It tests the understanding of when minors can consent to medical treatment without parental notification or consent.\n\nThe best approach is to recall the exceptions to parental consent laws, particularly those related to sensitive medical conditions like STIs. Consider the patient's concerns about confidentiality and the potential impact of involving parents.",
    "zh": "这个问题评估了围绕未成年人治疗的法律和伦理考量，特别是关于性传播感染和父母同意。它测试了对未成年人何时可以在没有父母通知或同意的情况下同意医疗的理解。\n\n最好的方法是回忆父母同意法律的例外情况，特别是那些与敏感医疗状况（如STI）相关的。考虑患者对保密性的担忧以及涉及父母的潜在影响。"
