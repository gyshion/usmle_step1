    "en": "A 30-year-old woman comes to the office due to a 6-month history of increasingly severe fatigue and malaise. For the past 5 years, she has lived on a small farm and eats only vegetables, fruits, and grains she grows herself. Medical history is unremarkable. The patient takes no medications or nutritional supplements. She does not use tobacco or alcohol. This patient is at increased risk for deficiency involving which of the following nutrients?",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "A vegan diet is characterized by abstinence from all animal-sourced products. It differs from a vegetarian diet in that vegetarians consume some nonmeat animal products (eg, milk, eggs). A vegan diet is plentiful in most vitamins (eg, A, B complex [except B12], C), minerals (eg, potassium, magnesium), and soluble fiber. In addition, although most single plant-based protein sources (except soy) are deficient in certain essential amino acids, dietary requirements can be met with a mixed vegan diet (eg, legumes plus grains).\n\nHowever, a vegan diet without supplementation or food fortification (as in this case) increases the risk for the following:\n\nVitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency: Vitamin B12 is naturally present in only animal-based foods. Deficiency usually takes years to develop after initiating a strict vegan diet due to large hepatic stores of vitamin B12.\n\nCalcium and vitamin D deficiency: Most dietary calcium and vitamin D intake is from animal-sourced products (eg, dairy). Individuals who follow a vegan diet often require supplementation to prevent osteoporosis, especially those without significant sunlight exposure (sunlight accounts for ~200-400 IU/day of the required 600 IU/day).\n\nIron deficiency: Many plant products (eg, leafy green vegetables) contain iron. However, the iron derived from plants (nonheme iron) is less well absorbed compared with iron derived from animals (heme iron). In addition, the quantity is often inadequate for those with increased dietary iron requirements, such as children during periods of rapid growth and women who are menstruating (like this young woman) (Choice A).\n\nThis patient developed fatigue and malaise after 5 years of following a strict vegan diet. Although many commercially prepared vegan products are fortified with additional vitamins and minerals, this patient is consuming unprocessed whole foods only. She likely has anemia due to iron and/or vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\n(Choices B, D, E, and F) Folic acid and thiamine (vitamin B1) are abundant in plant-based foods. Deficiency may occur in individuals with poor absorption (eg, alcohol use disorder) or malnutrition but is uncommon in those consuming a variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains.\n\nEducational objective:\nA vegan diet is characterized by abstinence from all animal-sourced products. Individuals who consume a vegan diet are often deficient in vitamin B12, calcium, and vitamin D. Those with increased dietary iron requirements (eg, menstruating women, children) may also develop iron deficiency. Supplementation is routinely recommended.",
    "zh": "纯素饮食的特点是完全禁食所有动物源性产品。它与素食饮食的不同之处在于，素食者食用一些非肉类动物产品（例如，牛奶、鸡蛋）。纯素饮食富含大多数维生素（例如，A、B族维生素[B12除外]、C）、矿物质（例如，钾、镁）和可溶性纤维。此外，尽管大多数单一的植物性蛋白质来源（大豆除外）缺乏某些必需氨基酸，但混合纯素饮食（例如，豆类加谷物）可以满足膳食需求。\n\n然而，在没有补充或食物强化的纯素饮食（如本例）中，会增加以下风险：\n\n维生素B12（钴胺素）缺乏症：维生素B12天然存在于仅动物性食物中。在开始严格的纯素饮食后，缺乏症通常需要数年时间才会发生，这归因于肝脏中大量的维生素B12储存。\n\n钙和维生素D缺乏症：大多数膳食钙和维生素D的摄入来自动物源性产品（例如，乳制品）。遵循纯素饮食的个体通常需要补充剂来预防骨质疏松症，尤其是那些没有大量阳光照射的人（阳光照射约占所需600 IU/天的200-400 IU/天）。\n\n铁缺乏症：许多植物产品（例如，绿叶蔬菜）含有铁。然而，植物来源的铁（非血红素铁）与动物来源的铁（血红素铁）相比，吸收较差。此外，对于那些膳食铁需求量增加的人（如快速生长期儿童和经期女性，如这位年轻女性）（选项A），其摄入量通常不足。\n\n在遵循严格纯素饮食5年后，该患者出现了疲劳和不适。尽管许多市售纯素产品都强化了额外的维生素和矿物质，但该患者只食用未加工的全食物。她很可能患有由于铁和/或维生素B12缺乏引起的贫血。\n\n（选项B、D、E和F）叶酸和硫胺素（维生素B1）在植物性食物中含量丰富。缺乏症可能发生在吸收不良的个体（例如，酒精使用障碍）或营养不良的人中，但在食用各种水果、蔬菜和谷物的人中并不常见。\n\n教育目标：\n纯素饮食的特点是完全禁食所有动物源性产品。食用纯素饮食的个体通常缺乏维生素B12、钙和维生素D。那些膳食铁需求量增加的人（例如，经期女性、儿童）也可能发生铁缺乏症。通常建议补充剂。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of nutritional deficiencies associated with a vegan diet, specifically focusing on vitamin B12, iron, calcium, and vitamin D. It also assesses the understanding of dietary sources of these nutrients and the impact of a strict vegan diet on nutrient intake.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that a strict vegan diet lacks animal-derived products, which are the primary sources of vitamin B12 and readily absorbable iron. Additionally, consider the patient's symptoms of fatigue and malaise, which are common in both iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies.",
