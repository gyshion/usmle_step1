    "en": "A 48-year-old woman with metastatic cervical cancer is brought to the emergency department due to worsening lethargy for the past several days. A year ago, the patient was diagnosed with cervical cancer, which has progressed despite chemotherapy treatment and metastasized to the liver and lungs. She has also developed bilateral hydronephrosis and renal failure due to ureteral compression by the tumor. The patient is receiving palliative care, and her pain has been adequately controlled with a stable dose of oral morphine. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 110/62 mm Hg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 10/min. On physical examination, the patient is somnolent and responds to painful stimuli only. The pupils are small and sluggish to react. The lungs are clear to auscultation, and heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is soft and nondistended. Arterial blood gas analysis shows respiratory acidosis.",

    "en": "Morphine stimulates mu opioid receptors to provide the desired effect of analgesia, but in doing so can also precipitate many undesired effects. This patient has multiple signs of OPIOID TOXICITY, including miosis (ie, pinpoint pupils), RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION (evidenced by slow respiratory rate and respiratory acidosis), and CNS depression (eg, somnolence, coma).\n\nMorphine is primarily metabolized by the liver via glucuronidation to form 2 MAJOR METABOLITES. These metabolites, morphine-3-glucuronide and MORPHINE-6-GLUCURONIDE, then undergo RENAL ELIMINATION via excretion in the urine. Because the metabolites are metabolically active, RENAL DYSFUNCTION can lead to METABOLITE ACCUMULATION and opioid toxicity. Morphine-6-glucuronide is particularly responsible for toxicity, acting as a more potent mu opioid receptor agonist than morphine itself.\n\nDue to its metabolically active and renally cleared metabolites, morphine requires careful monitoring when used in patients with renal dysfunction. When opioid pain control is needed in such patients, fentanyl or hydromorphone is often preferred as these drugs are predominantly hepatically cleared.\n\n(Choice A) Decreased first-pass metabolism occurs with drugs that are given by a route other than orally, allowing the drug to reach the systemic circulation without passing through the portal circulation and the liver. Examples include drugs that are administered sublingually, rectally, or intravenously.\n\n(Choice B) Decreased hepatic metabolism is common in the elderly or in patients with advanced liver disease (eg, cirrhosis). Although this patient has metastatic disease to the liver, accumulation of morphine metabolites is a more likely cause of toxicity in the setting of known renal failure.\n\n(Choice C) Enterohepatic circulation occurs when a drug undergoes biliary excretion into the small intestine, where it is then reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. Such drugs typically demonstrate a prolonged half-life. Although the phenomenon may account for a prolonged duration of therapeutic effect, it rarely accounts for toxicity.\n\n(Choice E) Drugs with a high volume of distribution (eg, amiodarone) are well distributed in the tissues and have a long half-life. These drugs may demonstrate prolonged therapeutic and/or adverse effects after discontinuation.",
    "zh": "吗啡刺激μ阿片受体以提供所需的镇痛效果，但在这样做的过程中，也可能导致许多不良反应。该患者有阿片类药物毒性的多种体征，包括缩瞳（即针尖样瞳孔）、呼吸抑制（表现为呼吸频率减慢和呼吸性酸中毒）和中枢神经系统抑制（如嗜睡、昏迷）。\n\n吗啡主要通过肝脏代谢，通过葡萄糖醛酸化形成2种主要代谢物。这些代谢物，吗啡-3-葡糖苷酸和吗啡-6-葡糖苷酸，然后通过尿液排泄进行肾脏消除。由于这些代谢物具有代谢活性，肾功能障碍可导致代谢物蓄积和阿片类药物毒性。吗啡-6-葡糖苷酸尤其导致毒性，它比吗啡本身更有效的μ阿片受体激动剂。\n\n由于其具有代谢活性且通过肾脏清除的代谢物，吗啡在肾功能障碍患者中使用时需要仔细监测。当此类患者需要阿片类药物止痛时，芬太尼或氢吗啡酮通常是首选，因为这些药物主要通过肝脏清除。\n\n（选项A）首过效应代谢降低发生在通过口服以外的途径给药的药物中，使得药物能够到达全身循环而无需通过门静脉循环和肝脏。例子包括舌下、直肠或静脉给药的药物。\n\n（选项B）肝脏代谢降低常见于老年人或患有晚期肝病（如肝硬化）的患者。尽管该患者有转移性肝病，但在已知肾衰竭的情况下，吗啡代谢物的蓄积是毒性的更可能原因。\n\n（选项C）肝肠循环发生在药物经过胆汁排泄进入小肠，然后被重新吸收入血的情况。此类药物通常表现出延长的半衰期。尽管这种现象可能解释了治疗作用的持续时间延长，但它很少导致毒性。\n\n（选项E）高分布容积的药物（如胺碘酮）在组织中分布良好，并且具有长半衰期。这些药物在停药后可能会表现出延长的治疗和/或不良反应。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of morphine metabolism, its active metabolites, and the clinical consequences of impaired renal function on drug toxicity. It specifically assesses the pathophysiology of opioid toxicity in the context of renal failure.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the signs of opioid toxicity in the patient, recall the metabolic pathways of morphine, recognize that its metabolites are renally excreted and are pharmacologically active, and understand how renal dysfunction leads to their accumulation and subsequent toxicity.",
