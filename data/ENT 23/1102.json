    "en": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the office due to a 1-day history of fever and irritability. The mother states that the boy has been tugging at his right ear. The patient has had 2 previous episodes of acute otitis media. Temperature is 38.1 C (100.6 F). Otoscopic examination shows a perforated right tympanic membrane with erythema and purulent exudate. Cultures from the exudate yield small, oxidase-positive, gram-negative coccobacilli that grow on factor X− and factor V−supplemented media, consistent with *Haemophilus influenzae*. The patient's immunizations are up to date. Which of the following best explains this patient's susceptibility to the pathogen causing his current infection? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient with fever and an inflamed, perforated tympanic membrane with purulent otorrhea has ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA. Middle ear infections occur most commonly in young children (age 6 months to 2 years) and are typically due to *Streptococcus pneumoniae* or *Haemophilus influenzae*.\n\n*H influenzae* is a small, oxidase-positive, gram-negative coccobacillus typically classified by the antigens in its polysaccharide capsule. However, there are MULTIPLE STRAINS of *H influenzae* that do not produce a capsule; these nontypeable strains are part of the normal upper respiratory tract flora but can also cause acute otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis.\n\nVaccination against *H influenzae* is with the protein-conjugated Hib vaccine, which confers immunity only to the more invasive type b strain (Choice A). The vaccine is recommended in all children to prevent Hib-associated bacteremia, pneumonia, epiglottitis, and meningitis. In countries with widespread Hib vaccination (eg, United States), most *H influenzae* strains isolated from children with respiratory mucosal infections (including acute otitis media) are nontypeable.\n\n(Choice B) The Hib vaccine contains capsular polysaccharide components to induce anticapsular antibodies (humoral immune response). Because the antibody response is weak in children, the vaccine is also conjugated with toxoid protein, which stimulates a helper T-cell response to help activate B-cell antibody formation. A cell-mediated cytotoxic T-cell response is not induced.\n\n(Choice C) Poor neutrophil function or a low neutrophil count predisposes to bacterial disease. However, neutrophil dysfunction (eg, chronic granulomatous disease, Chédiak-Higashi syndrome) typically presents with recurrent, severe bacterial infections such as pneumonia and abscesses. Ear infections due to *H influenzae* infection despite immunization with the Hib vaccine are more likely due to infection with a nontypeable strain than defective neutrophils.\n\n(Choice E) Exotoxins are secreted by certain bacteria (eg, *Clostridium botulinum, Corynebacterium diphtheriae*) to promote cell death but are not generally produced by any strain of *H influenzae*. The Hib vaccine is directed against capsular polysaccharide, not toxin.\n\nEducational objective: Nontypeable strains of *Haemophilus influenzae* are part of the normal upper respiratory tract flora and are a common cause of acute otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. Because nontypeable strains do not form a polysaccharide capsule, immunity is not conferred by vaccination with the *H influenzae* type b vaccine.",
    "zh": "这位发烧且鼓膜发炎、穿孔并伴有脓性耳溢的患者患有急性中耳炎。中耳感染最常发生在幼儿（6个月至2岁）中，通常由肺炎链球菌*Streptococcus pneumoniae*或流感嗜血杆菌*Haemophilus influenzae*引起。\n\n*H influenzae*是一种小的、氧化酶阳性、革兰氏阴性杆菌，通常根据其多糖荚膜中的抗原进行分类。然而，有多种*H influenzae*菌株不产生荚膜；这些非分型菌株是正常上呼吸道菌群的一部分，但也可能导致急性中耳炎、鼻窦炎和支气管炎。\n\n针对*H influenzae*的疫苗接种是使用蛋白结合的Hib疫苗，该疫苗仅对更具侵袭性的b型菌株提供免疫力（选项A）。建议所有儿童接种该疫苗，以预防Hib相关的菌血症、肺炎、会厌炎和脑膜炎。在广泛接种Hib疫苗的国家（例如，美国），从患有呼吸道粘膜感染（包括急性中耳炎）的儿童中分离出的大多数*H influenzae*菌株都是非分型菌株。\n\n（选项B）Hib疫苗包含荚膜多糖成分，以诱导抗荚膜抗体（体液免疫反应）。由于儿童的抗体反应较弱，因此该疫苗还与类毒素蛋白结合，从而刺激辅助性T细胞反应，以帮助激活B细胞抗体形成。不诱导细胞介导的细胞毒性T细胞反应。\n\n（选项C）中性粒细胞功能差或中性粒细胞计数低易患细菌性疾病。然而，中性粒细胞功能障碍（例如，慢性肉芽肿病、Chédiak-Higashi综合征）通常表现为复发性、严重的细菌感染，如肺炎和脓肿。尽管接种了Hib疫苗，但由于*H influenzae*感染引起耳部感染的可能性更高，这与感染非分型菌株有关，而不是中性粒细胞缺陷。\n\n（选项E）外毒素由某些细菌（例如，肉毒梭菌*Clostridium botulinum*、白喉棒状杆菌*Corynebacterium diphtheriae*）分泌，以促进细胞死亡，但通常不是由任何*H influenzae*菌株产生的。Hib疫苗针对荚膜多糖，而不是毒素。\n\n教育目标：非分型流感嗜血杆菌菌株是正常上呼吸道菌群的一部分，是急性中耳炎、鼻窦炎和支气管炎的常见原因。由于非分型菌株不形成多糖荚膜，因此接种*H influenzae* b型疫苗不能提供免疫力。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Haemophilus influenzae strains, specifically the difference between typeable and nontypeable strains, and the effectiveness of the Hib vaccine. It also tests understanding of the pathogenesis of acute otitis media. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the Hib vaccine only protects against type b strains of H. influenzae. Since the patient is up to date on immunizations but still has an infection, it is likely due to a nontypeable strain that does not produce a capsule.",
