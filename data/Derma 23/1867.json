  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Xanthelasma is a cutaneous lesion commonly found on the eyelid that contains lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells). These papules are typically yellow due to the location of the foam cells in the superficial dermis. Xanthelasma and other forms of xanthoma (tuberous, eruptive, tendinous) are classically associated with primary or secondary hyperlipidemia. Chronic cholestatic processes including obstructive biliary lesions and primary biliary cholangitis result in hypercholesterolemia due to leakage of bile back into the circulation, leading to the formation of xanthelasmas. Correction of underlying lipid defects can lead to slow resolution of these lesions.\n\n(Choice A) Ankylosing spondylitis is an HLA-B27-associated spondyloarthropathy that affects primarily young males and causes debilitating pain and deformity of the spine and hips.\n\n(Choice B) Hemochromatosis (\"bronze diabetes\") can cause generalized darkening of the skin due to hemosiderin deposition as well as cutaneous stigmata associated with chronic liver disease (eg, palmar erythema, gynecomastia, spider telangiectasias).\n\n(Choice C) Graves' disease (the most common cause of hyperthyroidism) can present with pretibial myxedema and exophthalmos due to glycosaminoglycan accumulation. However, glycosaminoglycan accumulation occurs within the retroorbital space (not over the eyelids). In addition, hypothyroidism (not hyperthyroidism) is a common cause of hyperlipidemia.\n\n(Choice D) Peptic ulcer disease may occur in multiple endocrine neoplasia 1.\n\n(Choice E) Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease causes mild persistent proteinuria that can result in dyslipidemia. However, this is a less common cause of xanthelasma than biliary cirrhosis.\n\nEducational objective: A yellowish eyelid papule or plaque containing lipid-laden macrophages is most likely xanthelasma. Xanthelasma may occur in association with primary or secondary hyperlipidemia. Cholestatic conditions such as primary biliary cholangitis are a potential cause of hypercholesterolemia leading to xanthelasma.",
    "zh": "睑黄瘤是一种常见的皮肤病变，常见于眼睑，其中含有富含脂质的巨噬细胞（泡沫细胞）。这些丘疹通常呈黄色，这是由于泡沫细胞位于表皮浅层。睑黄瘤和其他类型的黄色瘤（结节性、爆发性、腱性）通常与原发性或继发性高脂血症相关。慢性胆汁淤积过程，包括梗阻性胆道病变和原发性胆汁性胆管炎，会导致胆汁回流到循环中，从而导致高胆固醇血症，进而形成睑黄瘤。纠正潜在的脂质缺陷可以导致这些病变的缓慢消退。\n\n(选项A) 强直性脊柱炎是一种与HLA-B27相关的脊柱关节病，主要影响年轻男性，并导致脊柱和髋部的致残性疼痛和畸形。\n\n(选项B) 血色病（“青铜糖尿病”）可由于血铁黄素沉积引起皮肤普遍变黑，以及与慢性肝病相关的皮肤表现（例如，手掌红斑、男性乳房发育症、蜘蛛痣）。\n\n(选项C) Graves病（甲状腺功能亢进症的最常见病因）可表现为胫前黏液性水肿和眼球突出，这是由于糖胺聚糖的积累所致。然而，糖胺聚糖的积累发生在眼眶后间隙（而不是眼睑上方）。此外，甲状腺功能减退症（而非甲状腺功能亢进症）是高脂血症的常见原因。\n\n(选项D) 消化性溃疡病可能发生在多发性内分泌腺瘤病1型。\n\n(选项E) 常染色体显性遗传性多囊肾病引起轻度持续性蛋白尿，可导致血脂异常。然而，与胆汁性肝硬化相比，这并不是睑黄瘤的常见病因。\n\n教学目标：一种含有富含脂质的巨噬细胞的黄眼睑丘疹或斑块最有可能为睑黄瘤。睑黄瘤可能与原发性或继发性高脂血症相关。胆汁淤积性疾病，如原发性胆汁性胆管炎，是导致高胆固醇血症进而导致睑黄瘤的潜在原因。"
