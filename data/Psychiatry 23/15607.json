At his 2-week follow-up appointment, the patient reports that his mood is \"about the same.\" He continues to feel sad and unmotivated most days and is short-tempered with his wife and kids. The patient has little interest in food, sleeps poorly, and struggles to stay focused at work. He initially experienced some nausea and worsening insomnia with the medication, but these issues have since resolved. The patient drinks 4 or 5 beers a week and does not use recreational substances. He is discouraged by the lack of clear improvement and is anxious that he \"will never get better.\"",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has classic symptoms of MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) (eg, sadness, irritability, amotivation, sleep and appetite disturbances, impaired concentration) and is being treated appropriately with a SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITOR (SSRI) (eg, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram). As a drug class, antidepressants are associated with an interval DELAY BETWEEN DRUG INITIATION AND CLINICAL RESPONSE. Although some patients with MDD may have an early response to antidepressants apparent within 2 weeks, an adequate antidepressant trial is generally considered to be at least 4-6 WEEKS. At this point, the most likely explanation for this patient's poor response is inadequate duration of antidepressant treatment. While this patient expresses frustration that symptoms have not improved quickly enough (eg, \"is discouraged,\" \"anxious that he 'will never get better'\"), he should be encouraged to continue taking the medication for at least 2-4 more weeks before the next step in treatment is considered.\n\nIn addition, patients should be counseled about common transient side effects of SSRIs, including temporary gastrointestinal distress (eg, nausea) and brief symptoms overlapping with common anxiety presentations (eg, restlessness, insomnia), to avoid premature discontinuation and/or misattribution to additional disorders (Choices A and B).\n\n(Choice C) Excessive alcohol use can present with an alcohol-induced depressive disorder and should be considered in all patients with recent or ongoing alcohol use and mood complaints. However, at 4 or 5 beers a week, this man's use is below the unhealthy range (ie, >4 drinks/day or >14 drinks/week for men; >3 drinks/day or >7 drinks/week for women) and is unlikely to be the cause of his depressive symptoms or lack of treatment response.\n\n(Choice E) Treatment-resistant depression is commonly defined as failure to respond to at least 2 adequate antidepressant trials. This patient cannot be considered treatment resistant because he has had an inadequate trial of a single medication.",
    "zh": "该患者具有重度抑郁症（MDD）的典型症状（例如，悲伤、易怒、缺乏动力、睡眠和食欲紊乱、注意力不集中），并正在使用选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（SSRI）（例如，舍曲林、氟西汀、西酞普兰）进行适当治疗。作为一类药物，抗抑郁药与药物启动和临床反应之间的时间间隔延迟有关。尽管一些MDD患者可能在2周内对抗抑郁药有早期反应，但充分的抗抑郁药试验通常被认为至少需要4-6周。在这一点上，该患者反应差最有可能的解释是抗抑郁药治疗时间不足。虽然该患者对症状没有足够快地改善表示沮丧（例如，“感到沮丧”，“焦虑他'永远不会好起来'”），但应鼓励他继续服用药物至少2-4周，然后再考虑治疗的下一步。\n\n此外，应向患者咨询SSRI的常见短暂副作用，包括暂时性胃肠道不适（例如，恶心）和与常见焦虑表现重叠的短暂症状（例如，烦躁不安、失眠），以避免过早停药和/或错误归因于其他疾病（选项A和B）。\n\n（选项C）过度饮酒可表现为酒精引起的抑郁症，应在所有近期或持续饮酒且有情绪抱怨的患者中考虑。然而，每周喝4或5杯啤酒，该男子的饮用量低于不健康范围（即，男性>4杯/天或>14杯/周；女性>3杯/天或>7杯/周），不太可能是其抑郁症状或缺乏治疗反应的原因。\n\n（选项E）难治性抑郁症通常定义为对至少2次充分的抗抑郁药试验无反应。该患者不能被认为是难治性的，因为他仅接受了一次单一药物的不足试验。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the typical time course for antidepressant efficacy in the treatment of major depressive disorder. It emphasizes that a minimum duration of treatment is required before assessing response and considering alternative strategies.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the patient's symptoms consistent with MDD, identifying the current treatment, and recalling the established timeline for antidepressant effectiveness. Evaluating the patient's current treatment duration against the standard trial period is key to determining the most likely reason for lack of perceived improvement.",
