    "en": "A 65-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to substernal chest discomfort and intermittent palpitations that began this morning. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and stable angina that is managed medically. He takes high-dose metoprolol, atorvastatin, and low-dose aspirin. The patient reports that he has been traveling for the past week and ran out of his medications 2 days ago. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 148/82 mm Hg, and pulse is 112/min. ECG reveals sinus tachycardia with a 1-mm ST segment depression in the lateral leads. Which of the following is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient with elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, palpitations, and anginal pain following recent discontinuation of metoprolol is most likely experiencing BETA BLOCKER WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME. With changes in environmental stimulus, the feedback mechanisms in cells adjust the density of cell surface membrane receptors to regulate sensitivity to the stimulus. Prolonged beta-adrenergic blockade, for example, stimulates an increase in surface membrane expression of beta-adrenergic receptors, a process called UPREGULATION. When beta-adrenergic blockade is abruptly withdrawn, the increased density of beta-adrenergic receptors creates an amplified response to circulating catecholamines (ie, increased sensitivity). \n\nBecause metoprolol is cardioselective and primarily blocks beta-1 receptors, abrupt cessation stimulates beta-1 receptor–mediated increased heart rate and cardiac contractility. There is also increased blood pressure due to increased cardiac output. These changes create increased oxygen demand that may cause ischemia (evidenced by ST depression on ECG) and trigger angina in patients with underlying coronary artery disease.\n\n(Choice A) Beta blocker withdrawal symptoms result from an increase in the density of beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to an amplified response to circulating catecholamines. The level of circulating catecholamines is unchanged from baseline.\n\n(Choice B) Alpha-adrenergic receptors are predominantly activated in the setting of beta blockade. On cessation of beta blocker therapy, there is redistribution of catecholamines to beta-adrenergic receptors.\n\n(Choice C) Beta-adrenergic receptors function via cyclic AMP second messaging. The increased stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors following beta blocker cessation leads to increased cyclic AMP activity.\n\n(Choice D) Downregulation of surface membrane receptors occurs when cells are exposed to frequent agonist activity. For example, prolonged use of an alpha-1 agonist nasal spray (eg, phenylephrine) causes downregulation of alpha-1 receptors and reduced sensitivity to endogenous catecholamines. This is opposite to what is occurring in this patient.\n\nEducational objective:\nWhen exposed to a prolonged environmental stimulus, cells can adjust their sensitivity to the stimulus by upregulating or downregulating surface membrane receptors. Prolonged beta blockade leads to upregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors and increased sensitivity to circulating catecholamines, causing an enhanced beta-adrenergic response on abrupt beta blocker cessation (ie, beta blocker withdrawal syndrome).",
    "zh": "该患者近期停用美托洛尔后出现血压升高、心动过速、心悸和心绞痛，最有可能经历β受体阻滞剂停药综合征。当环境刺激发生变化时，细胞内的反馈机制会调节细胞表面膜受体的密度以调节对刺激的敏感性。例如，长期β-肾上腺素能阻滞会刺激β-肾上腺素能受体在表面膜上的表达增加，这一过程称为上调。当突然停止β-肾上腺素能阻滞时，β-肾上腺素能受体密度的增加会增强对循环儿茶酚胺的反应（即敏感性增加）。\n\n由于美托洛尔具有心脏选择性，主要阻滞β-1受体，突然停药会刺激β-1受体介导的心率和心肌收缩力增加。由于心输出量增加，血压也会升高。这些变化会增加耗氧量，可能导致缺血（通过心电图上的ST段压低证实）并诱发潜在冠状动脉疾病患者的心绞痛。\n\n（选项A）β受体阻滞剂停药症状源于β-肾上腺素能受体密度的增加，导致对循环儿茶酚胺的反应增强。循环儿茶酚胺的水平与基线相比没有变化。\n\n（选项B）在β受体阻滞的情况下，α-肾上腺素能受体主要被激活。停止β受体阻滞剂治疗后，儿茶酚胺会重新分布到β-肾上腺素能受体。\n\n（选项C）β-肾上腺素能受体通过环磷酸腺苷第二信使系统发挥作用。停止β受体阻滞剂后，对β-肾上腺素能受体的刺激增加导致环磷酸腺苷活性增加。\n\n（选项D）当细胞暴露于频繁的激动剂活性时，会发生表面膜受体的下调。例如，长期使用α-1激动剂鼻喷雾剂（如苯肾上腺素）会导致α-1受体的下调以及对内源性儿茶酚胺的敏感性降低。这与该患者的情况相反。\n\n教育目标：\n当暴露于长期的环境刺激时，细胞可以通过上调或下调表面膜受体来调节其对刺激的敏感性。长期β受体阻滞会导致β-肾上腺素能受体的上调和对循环儿茶酚胺的敏感性增加，在突然停止β受体阻滞剂时会引起增强的β-肾上腺素能反应（即β受体阻滞剂停药综合征）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of beta-blocker withdrawal syndrome, specifically the physiological changes that occur with abrupt cessation of beta-blocker therapy. It assesses understanding of receptor upregulation and the resulting increased sensitivity to catecholamines. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's history of beta-blocker use and recent discontinuation.
