    "en": "This patient's auscultatory findings reveal a blowing holosystolic murmur best heard over the cardiac apex (typically with radiation to the axilla), which is classic for mitral regurgitation (MR). Given her emigration from Southeast Asia and knee swelling as a child, the MR is most likely due to rheumatic heart disease (rheumatic heart disease is most commonly seen in Latin America, Africa, and Asia).\n\nPatients with rheumatic heart disease almost always have mitral valve involvement: MR is the more common manifestation in young patients (eg, age <25), whereas mitral stenosis is more common in middle-aged patients (eg, age >30). With increasing age, mixed mitral valve disease (ie, components of both regurgitation and stenosis) becomes increasingly frequent.\n\n(Choice A) Patients with an ascending aortic aneurysm may develop aortic regurgitation secondary to aortic root dilation; an early decrescendo diastolic murmur is expected, best heard at the right upper sternal border.\n\n(Choice B) The typical murmur of an atrial septal defect is not caused by blood flow through the defect itself but results from an elevation in right-sided blood volume with increased blood flow across the pulmonic valve (ie, pulmonic flow murmur). It is recognized as a faint midsystolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border and with fixed splitting of S2.\n\n(Choice C) A bicuspid aortic valve is commonly associated with aortic stenosis, which classically causes a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border and with radiation to the carotids. Aortic stenosis due to a bicuspid aortic valve typically affects patients age >40.\n\n(Choice E) Rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause of mitral stenosis. With mitral stenosis, auscultation at the cardiac apex is expected to reveal an opening snap followed by a low-pitch, middiastolic, rumbling murmur. The murmur may accentuate in late diastole due to atrial contraction against the stenotic valve.\n\nEducational objective:\nMitral regurgitation causes a blowing holosystolic murmur best heard at the cardiac apex and with radiation to the axilla. Rheumatic heart disease is a common cause of both mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis and is most commonly seen in patients who grew up in Latin America, Africa, or Asia. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者的听诊结果显示，在心脏心尖处听到的吹风样全收缩期杂音（通常向腋窝放射）是二尖瓣反流（MR）的典型表现。考虑到她来自东南亚并且小时候有膝盖肿胀的病史，MR 最可能的原因是风湿性心脏病（风湿性心脏病最常见于拉丁美洲、非洲和亚洲）。\n\n风湿性心脏病患者几乎总是累及二尖瓣：MR 是年轻患者（例如，年龄 <25 岁）更常见的表现，而二尖瓣狭窄在中年患者（例如，年龄 >30 岁）中更常见。随着年龄的增长，混合性二尖瓣疾病（即，反流和狭窄的成分）变得越来越常见。\n\n(选项 A) 患有升主动脉瘤的患者可能会因主动脉根部扩张而发生主动脉瓣反流；预计会听到早期的减弱性舒张期杂音，最好在右胸骨上缘听到。\n\n(选项 B) 房间隔缺损的典型杂音不是由血液流过缺损本身引起的，而是由右侧血容量升高导致通过肺动脉瓣的血流量增加（即，肺动脉血流杂音）引起的。它被认为是在左胸骨上缘听到的微弱的中收缩期杂音，并伴有S2固定分裂。\n\n(选项 C) 二叶式主动脉瓣通常与主动脉瓣狭窄有关，这通常会导致在右胸骨上缘听到的增强-减弱型收缩期杂音，并向颈动脉放射。由二叶式主动脉瓣引起的主动脉瓣狭窄通常影响年龄 >40 岁的患者。\n\n(选项 E) 风湿性心脏病是二尖瓣狭窄最常见的原因。对于二尖瓣狭窄，预计在心脏心尖处听诊会发现一个开放性喀喇声，然后是低音调的中舒张期隆隆杂音。由于心房收缩对抗狭窄的瓣膜，杂音可能会在舒张晚期增强。\n\n教育目标：\n二尖瓣反流会导致在心脏心尖处听到的吹风样全收缩期杂音并向腋窝放射。风湿性心脏病是二尖瓣反流和二尖瓣狭窄的常见原因，最常见于在拉丁美洲、非洲或亚洲长大的人群。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cardiac auscultation findings and the etiology of mitral regurgitation, particularly in the context of rheumatic heart disease. It requires recognizing the characteristic murmur of mitral regurgitation and considering the patient's history and demographic factors.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key findings: a holosystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla, a history of childhood knee swelling, and emigration from Southeast Asia. These clues point towards rheumatic heart disease as the underlying cause of mitral regurgitation.",
