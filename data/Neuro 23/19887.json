    "en": "A 28-year-old woman comes to the office due to pain at a previous surgery site. The patient underwent cesarean delivery a year ago and had no issues with wound healing. However, over the past 2 months, she has had intermittent sharp and burning pain at the incision site. Physical examination reveals a well-healed, low, transverse scar. There is a small knot palpable at the left end of the scar, light touch of which elicits severe pain. Cutaneous sensory nerve injury and abnormal axonal regeneration are suspected. Which of the following ion channels is most likely upregulated within the affected axons?",

    "en": "This patient likely suffered cutaneous nerve damage during her surgical procedure. Transected nerves undergo wallerian degeneration, which involves axonal dissolution while activated Schwann cells and macrophages degrade myelin. In addition to clearing cellular debris, Schwann cells and macrophages stimulate formation of a growth cone from the proximal axon stump to facilitate nerve regeneration. However, if the regenerating axons cannot find their distal target, regeneration can result in formation of a disorganized mass of axonal processes, Schwann cells, vascular hyalinization, and fibrosis known as a neuroma. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nChronic axonal injury or inflammation (such as occurs with a neuroma) induces increased expression of voltage-gated sodium channels, which are important for the generation and propagation of action potentials. The density of voltage-gated sodium channels correlates with the excitability of nerves; therefore, the upregulated sodium channels in injured nerves and neuromas increase nociceptive (pain) sensitivity. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nTo support the diagnosis of a neuroma, local anesthetic, which blocks sodium channels in the neuronal cell membrane, is administered to prevent depolarization of the nerve. This often provides immediate relief of pain. {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(Choice A) Action potential propagation depends on voltage-gated calcium channels in certain cardiac conduction tissues (eg, sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes). However, peripheral nerve depolarization is driven primarily by sodium, rather than calcium, influx.\n\n(Choice B) The influx of negative chloride ions often causes hyperpolarization, which inhibits formation of action potentials.\n\n(Choice C) Magnesium selective ion channels are not directly involved in nerve depolarization. However, magnesium ions block calcium channels, preventing calcium influx at the axon terminal. This impairs release of neurotransmitter vesicles into the synapse, inhibiting impulse transmission.\n\n(Choice D) The efflux of potassium out of the cell leads to hyperpolarization. Therefore, upregulation of potassium channels would tend to keep the membrane potential away from the depolarization threshold, leading to less signal transmission (ie, less pain). {{exhibit_4}}\n\nEducational objective:\nA neuroma forms when regenerating axons are unable to find their distal target and create a haphazard mass of axons and supporting cells. Upregulation of voltage-gated sodium channels, which generate and propagate action potentials, is likely responsible for the increased pain of these lesions.",
    "zh": "该患者可能在手术过程中遭受了皮肤神经损伤。被切断的神经会发生华勒变性，这包括轴突溶解，同时激活的许旺细胞和巨噬细胞降解髓鞘。除了清除细胞碎片外，许旺细胞和巨噬细胞还会刺激近端轴突残端形成生长锥，以促进神经再生。然而，如果再生的轴突无法找到其远端靶点，再生会导致形成轴突过程、许旺细胞、血管透明变性和纤维化的无序团块，称为神经瘤。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n慢性轴突损伤或炎症（如神经瘤所发生的）会诱导电压门控钠离子通道的表达增加，这对于动作电位的产生和传导非常重要。电压门控钠离子通道的密度与神经的兴奋性相关；因此，受损神经和神经瘤中上调的钠离子通道会增加伤害性（疼痛）敏感性。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n为了支持神经瘤的诊断，局部麻醉药（阻断神经元细胞膜中的钠离子通道）被用于阻止神经的去极化。这通常能立即缓解疼痛。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n（选项A）动作电位的传导取决于某些心脏传导组织（例如，窦房结和房室结）中的电压门控钙离子通道。然而，周围神经的去极化主要由钠离子内流驱动，而不是钙离子。\n\n（选项B）负氯离子的内流通常会导致超极化，从而抑制动作电位的形成。\n\n（选项C）镁选择性离子通道不直接参与神经去极化。然而，镁离子会阻断钙离子通道，阻止钙离子在轴突末端的内流。这会损害神经递质囊泡释放到突触中，从而抑制冲动传递。\n\n（选项D）钾离子流出细胞会导致超极化。因此，钾离子通道的上调会倾向于使膜电位远离去极化阈值，从而导致较少的信号传递（即，较少的疼痛）。{{exhibit_4}}\n\n教育目标：\n当再生的轴突无法找到其远端靶点并形成轴突和支持细胞的无序团块时，就会形成神经瘤。上调生成和传播动作电位的电压门控钠离子通道可能是导致这些病变疼痛增加的原因。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of neuroma formation following nerve injury and the role of sodium channels in pain sensitization. It assesses understanding of axonal regeneration, the pathophysiology of neuroma development, and the resulting upregulation of ion channels. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical scenario of a neuroma and recall that chronic nerve injury leads to increased expression of voltage-gated sodium channels, contributing to increased pain sensitivity.
