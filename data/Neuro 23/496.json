    "en": "A 38-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to severe abdominal pain and delivers a stillborn neonate who is missing a large portion of the scalp and skull, partially exposing the brain, which is also only partially formed. The patient did not know she was pregnant and had no prenatal care. Medical history is significant for bipolar disorder and chronic hypertension. Interview of the patient reveals pressured and tangential speech, and she states that she takes certain prescription medications when she remembers but cannot identify which ones. If used during pregnancy, which of the following substances most likely contributed to this neonate's abnormalities?",

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This stillborn neonate has anencephaly, or absence of the forebrain and major portions of the skull. Anencephaly is an open neural tube defect (NTD) caused by defective primary neurulation, an embryologic process in which the neural folds fuse in the midline to create the neural tube. Fusion starts in the cervical region and extends rostrally and caudally to the anterior and posterior neuropores, respectively. Failure of anterior (rostral) neuropore closure results in anencephaly, whereas failure of posterior (caudal) neuropore closure results in an open spinal dysraphism (eg, myelomeningocele). \n\nMost isolated NTDs are related to folate (vitamin B9) deficiency (eg, poor dietary intake). Folate supplementation is recommended for all women of childbearing age because the neural tube develops during the time when most women are unaware of their pregnancy.\n\nIn addition to insufficient dietary folate, first trimester use of medications that impair folate metabolism is associated with a 10- to 20-fold increased risk of NTDs. These medications include valproate, which is typically prescribed for bipolar disorder (likely in this patient) or epilepsy. Others include methotrexate and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. These medications are contraindicated in pregnancy. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices A, D, and E) ACE inhibitors, isotretinoin, and Lithium are contraindicated in pregnancy due to teratogenic effects. ACE inhibitors cause fetal renal damage, lithium use is associated with increased incidence of Ebstein anomaly, and isotretinoin is a potent teratogen that can cause a multitude of defects (eg, microcephaly, ear/facial deformities, cardiac defects). However, use of these substances during pregnancy is not associated with NTDs.\n\n(Choices B and C) Alcohol use is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome; findings include a smooth filtrum, thin upper lip, and small palpebral fissures. Heroin or other opiate use during pregnancy can lead to withdrawal in the infant postnatally (neonatal abstinence syndrome). NTDs are not associated with prenatal alcohol or opiate use. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "这名死产新生儿患有无脑畸形，即前脑和颅骨主要部分的缺失。无脑畸形是一种开放性神经管缺陷 (NTD)，由原神经胚化缺陷引起，原神经胚化是一个胚胎学过程，其中神经褶在中线融合形成神经管。融合始于颈部区域，并分别向头端和尾端延伸至前神经孔和后神经孔。前（头端）神经孔闭合失败导致无脑畸形，而后（尾端）神经孔闭合失败导致开放性脊柱裂（例如，脊髓脊膜膨出）。\n\n大多数孤立性NTD与叶酸（维生素B9）缺乏症（例如，膳食摄入不足）有关。建议所有育龄妇女补充叶酸，因为神经管是在大多数妇女不知道自己怀孕的时候发育的。\n\n除了膳食叶酸不足外，孕早期使用会损害叶酸代谢的药物与NTD的风险增加10至20倍有关。这些药物包括丙戊酸盐，通常用于治疗双相情感障碍（可能在这位患者身上）或癫痫。其他药物包括甲氨蝶呤和甲氧苄氨嘧啶-磺胺甲噁唑。这些药物在妊娠期间禁用。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项A、D和E）ACE抑制剂、异维A酸和锂因致畸作用而在妊娠期间禁用。ACE抑制剂会导致胎儿肾脏损害，锂的使用与Ebstein畸形的发生率增加有关，而异维A酸是一种有效的致畸剂，可引起多种缺陷（例如，小头畸形、耳/面部畸形、心脏缺陷）。然而，在妊娠期间使用这些物质与NTD无关。\n\n（选项B和C）饮酒与胎儿酒精综合征有关；表现包括人中平滑、上唇薄而眼裂小。在妊娠期间使用海洛因或其他阿片类药物会导致婴儿产后戒断（新生儿戒断综合征）。NTD与产前饮酒或阿片类药物的使用无关。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of neural tube defects (NTDs) and the teratogenic effects of certain medications, specifically focusing on the association between valproate use during pregnancy and the increased risk of NTDs like anencephaly. It also requires understanding of the importance of folate in neural tube development.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the most likely cause of the neural tube defect based on the patient's history of bipolar disorder and potential medication use. Recognizing that valproate impairs folate metabolism and is a known risk factor for NTDs is crucial for selecting the correct answer.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对神经管缺陷 (NTD) 和某些药物的致畸作用的认识，特别是关注孕期使用丙戊酸盐与增加NTD（如无脑畸形）风险之间的关联。它还需要了解叶酸在神经管发育中的重要性。\n\n最佳方法是根据患者的双相情感障碍病史和潜在用药情况，确定神经管缺陷最可能的原因。认识到丙戊酸盐会损害叶酸代谢，并且是NTD的已知风险因素，这对于选择正确答案至关重要。"
