Last week, the patient developed a runny nose and cough, which resolved 2 days prior to the development of ear pain. He has no chronic medical conditions. Temperature is 38.4 C (101.1 F). There is purulent drainage from the left ear. Otoscopic examination of the left ear reveals a normal-appearing external canal and an erythematous tympanic membrane with purulent fluid pooling within the distal external canal {{exhibit_1}}.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with an erythematous tympanic membrane and purulent otorrhea has acute otitis media (AOM) complicated by tympanic membrane perforation, which can be obscured due to drainage. Acute middle ear infections occur most commonly in young children (age 6 months to 2 years) and are often due to Streptococcus pneumoniae {{exhibit_2}}. \n\nA viral upper respiratory infection (URI) typically precedes the development of AOM because it causes inflammatory edema of the respiratory mucosa that can lead to obstruction of the eustachian tube. The eustachian tube normally opens to equalize middle ear pressure and drain secretions. Therefore, obstruction leads to the accumulation of secretions, providing a rich medium for bacterial growth. Bacterial colonizers of the upper respiratory tract (eg, S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis) then proliferate in the middle ear secretions. This overgrowth of bacteria and consequent immune response result in AOM. \n\nSuppurative fluid accumulation increases middle ear pressure and causes the tympanic membrane to become inflamed and bulge outward. If the eustachian tube remains obstructed, this increased pressure can rupture the tympanic membrane. \n\n(Choice A) Although Klebsiella pneumoniae can be a colonizer of the mouth and throat, it is unlikely to cause AOM in otherwise healthy children. Instead, it more often causes respiratory diseases in older, immunosuppressed patients (eg, pneumonia in patients with alcohol overuse). \n\n(Choice B) Moraxella catarrhalis is also an upper respiratory colonizer that can cause AOM. However, infection with it is less common than with S pneumoniae. \n\n(Choice C) Proteus mirabilis classically causes genitourinary infections; its ability to split urea alkalinizes the urine, increasing the formation of kidney stones. \n\n(Choice D) Pseudomonas aeruginosa is more commonly implicated in otitis externa than AOM. \n\n(Choice E) Staphylococcus aureus is typically found as a colonizer of the skin rather than the respiratory tract. Therefore, it is more often implicated in skin and soft tissue infections, including otitis externa. \n\nEducational objective: \nAcute otitis media usually occurs after a viral upper respiratory infection causes obstruction of the eustachian tube. This obstruction leads to the accumulation of secretions, which encourages bacterial growth. The most common bacterial causes are respiratory colonizers, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis {{exhibit_3}}.",
    "zh": "该患者出现鼓膜发红和脓性耳溢，患有急性中耳炎 (AOM)，并伴有鼓膜穿孔，由于引流可能无法观察到。急性中耳感染最常发生在幼儿（6个月至2岁）中，通常由肺炎链球菌引起{{exhibit_2}}。\n\n病毒性上呼吸道感染 (URI) 通常先于 AOM 的发展，因为它会导致呼吸道黏膜的炎症性水肿，进而导致咽鼓管阻塞。咽鼓管通常开放以平衡中耳压力并引流分泌物。因此，阻塞会导致分泌物积聚，为细菌生长提供丰富的培养基。上呼吸道的细菌定植菌（例如，肺炎链球菌、流感嗜血杆菌、卡他莫拉菌）随后在中耳分泌物中增殖。这种细菌过度生长和随之而来的免疫反应导致 AOM。\n\n化脓性液体积聚会增加中耳压力，并导致鼓膜发炎并向外膨胀。如果咽鼓管仍然阻塞，这种增加的压力可能会导致鼓膜破裂。\n\n（选项 A）尽管肺炎克雷伯菌可以定植于口腔和咽喉，但它不太可能导致其他健康的儿童患上 AOM。相反，它更常导致老年、免疫抑制患者的呼吸道疾病（例如，饮酒过量的患者的肺炎）。\n\n（选项 B）卡他莫拉菌也是一种上呼吸道定植菌，可引起 AOM。然而，感染它的情况不如肺炎链球菌常见。\n\n（选项 C）奇异变形杆菌通常引起泌尿生殖系统感染；它分解尿素的能力会使尿液碱化，增加肾结石的形成。\n\n（选项 D）铜绿假单胞菌更常见于外耳炎而非 AOM。\n\n（选项 E）金黄色葡萄球菌通常存在于皮肤定植菌中，而不是呼吸道。因此，它更常与皮肤和软组织感染有关，包括外耳炎。\n\n教育目标：\n急性中耳炎通常发生在病毒性上呼吸道感染导致咽鼓管阻塞之后。这种阻塞导致分泌物积聚，从而促进细菌生长。最常见的细菌病因是呼吸道定植菌，包括肺炎链球菌、流感嗜血杆菌和卡他莫拉菌{{exhibit_3}}。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the etiology and pathophysiology of acute otitis media (AOM) in children, specifically the common bacterial pathogens involved. It also assesses the ability to correlate clinical findings with the most likely causative organism. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the preceding viral upper respiratory infection and the purulent drainage, which are characteristic of AOM. Knowing that STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE is the most common bacterial cause of AOM in children helps to narrow down the options.",
