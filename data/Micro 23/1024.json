    "en": "A 22-year-old woman participates in a research study. She is asymptomatic and has not had a respiratory illness in the last 8 weeks. She reports no chronic medical problems and takes no medications. A nasopharyngeal specimen is obtained and cultured on a selective medium containing vancomycin, colistin, nystatin, and trimethoprim. The organism most likely to be isolated is typically associated with which of the following conditions?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The nasopharynx is colonized with a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, nasopharyngeal swabs are often cultured on media containing antibiotics to isolate a specific organism. The agar described in this case is the Thayer-Martin medium, used to identify pathogenic Neisseria organisms such as N meningitidis (a common cause of MENINGITIS) and N gonorrhoeae (a common cause of urethritis). The Thayer-Martin medium is a chocolate sheep blood agar infused with vancomycin to inhibit gram-positive bacteria; with colistin and trimethoprim to inhibit gram-negative bacteria (other than pathogenic Neisseria species); and with nystatin to inhibit yeast.\n\n(Choice A) The most common cause of cystitis is Escherichia coli, a gram-negative rod inhibited by colistin and trimethoprim. E coli is not a common nasopharyngeal organism.\n\n(Choice B) Dental carries are caused primarily by Streptococcus (eg, S mutans) and Lactobacillus species, gram-positive organisms inhibited by vancomycin.\n\n(Choice C) Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the cause of diphtheria. It usually presents with slow-onset sore throat, malaise, and low-grade fever. C diphtheriae is a gram-positive organism inhibited by vancomycin.\n\n(Choices E and F) The most common cause of both otitis media and community-acquired pneumonia in adults is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although S pneumoniae can colonize the nasopharynx, this gram-positive organism is inhibited by vancomycin.\n\n(Choice G) Rheumatic heart disease is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus), a common gram-positive pharyngeal pathogen. S pyogenes is inhibited by vancomycin.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe Thayer-Martin medium is used to isolate pathogenic Neisseria species such as N meningitidis and N gonorrhoeae. It is a chocolate sheep blood agar that contains vancomycin to inhibit the growth of gram-positive organisms; colistin and trimethoprim to inhibit gram-negative bacteria (other than pathogenic Neisseria); and nystatin to inhibit yeast.",
    "zh": "鼻咽部定植有多种革兰氏阳性和革兰氏阴性菌。因此，鼻咽拭子通常在含有抗生素的培养基上培养，以分离特定病原体。本例中描述的琼脂是改良的 Thayer-Martin 培养基，用于鉴定致病性奈瑟菌，如脑膜炎奈瑟菌（脑膜炎的常见病因）和淋病奈瑟菌（尿道炎的常见病因）。Thayer-Martin 培养基是一种巧克力羊血琼脂，加入万古霉素以抑制革兰氏阳性菌；加入粘菌素和甲氧苄氨嘧啶以抑制革兰氏阴性菌（除致病性奈瑟菌）；并加入制霉菌素以抑制酵母菌。\n\n（选项 A）膀胱炎的最常见病因是大肠杆菌，一种被粘菌素和甲氧苄氨嘧啶抑制的革兰氏阴性杆菌。大肠杆菌不是常见的鼻咽病原体。\n\n（选项 B）龋齿主要由链球菌（如变异链球菌）和乳杆菌属引起，是受万古霉素抑制的革兰氏阳性菌。\n\n（选项 C）白喉的病因是白喉棒状杆菌。它通常表现为起病缓慢的咽喉痛、不适和低热。白喉棒状杆菌是一种被万古霉素抑制的革兰氏阳性菌。\n\n（选项 E 和 F）成人中耳炎和社区获得性肺炎的最常见病因是肺炎链球菌。虽然肺炎链球菌可以定植于鼻咽部，但这种革兰氏阳性菌被万古霉素抑制。\n\n（选项 G）风湿性心脏病由化脓性链球菌（A组链球菌）引起，这是一种常见的革兰氏阳性咽部病原体。化脓性链球菌被万古霉素抑制。\n\n教育目标：\nThayer-Martin 培养基用于分离致病性奈瑟菌，如脑膜炎奈瑟菌和淋病奈瑟菌。它是一种巧克力羊血琼脂，含有万古霉素以抑制革兰氏阳性菌的生长；粘菌素和甲氧苄氨嘧啶以抑制革兰氏阴性菌（除致病性奈瑟菌）；以及制霉菌素以抑制酵母菌。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of common nasopharyngeal flora and the selective media used to isolate specific organisms, particularly Neisseria species. It also requires understanding the diseases associated with these organisms.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the Thayer-Martin medium is selective for Neisseria species, particularly N. meningitidis, which is a common cause of meningitis. The antibiotics in the medium inhibit the growth of other common nasopharyngeal organisms.",
