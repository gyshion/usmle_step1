    "en": "A 34-year-old woman comes to the office due to vague abdominal pain over the past several months. She has no significant past medical history. The patient does not use tobacco or alcohol. Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F). On physical examination, right upper quadrant fullness is present. Abdominal imaging reveals a dense liver mass. Angiography shows a well-demarcated, highly vascularized tumor surrounded by normal liver parenchyma.",

    "en": "This patient has a highly vascularized liver tumor, possibly a benign hepatic hemangioma. Many cases are discovered incidentally. ANGIOGENESIS (blood vessel formation) is predominantly driven by the following 2 substances:\n\n*   Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF): VEGF stimulates angiogenesis in a variety of tissues (normal, chronically inflamed, healing, or neoplastic). As VEGF increases endothelial cell motility and proliferation, new capillaries begin to sprout.\n*   Fibroblast growth factor (FGF): FGF-2 is produced by a wide range of cells and is involved in endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. FGF-2 also appears to play an important role in embryogenesis by stimulating angioblast production. As a group, FGFs not only contribute to angiogenesis, but also to embryonic development, hematopoiesis, and wound repair (by recruiting macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells to damaged tissues).\n\nHowever, the laminin in basement membranes may pose a physical barrier to the sprouting of new blood vessels.\n\n(Choice A) Epidermal growth factor (EGF), not to be confused with VEGF, has a mitogenic influence on epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and fibroblasts. EGF does not appear to play as important a role in angiogenesis as VEGF or FGF-2.\n\n(Choice C) Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), or somatomedin C, is synthesized predominantly by growth hormone-influenced hepatocytes and serves to stimulate cell growth and multiplication. IGF-1 does not appear to directly stimulate angiogenesis, but it can indirectly promote it by encouraging cell growth.\n\n(Choices D and E) Although the proinflammatory nature of interleukin-1 (IL-1) can induce the release of other proinflammatory cytokines that trigger cellular VEGF expression, IL-1 does not appear to directly stimulate angiogenesis. Similarly, although interferon-γ can indirectly promote neovascularization through activation of macrophages (can release VEGF), it does not appear to directly stimulate angiogenesis.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe key growth factors that promote angiogenesis in neoplastic and granulation tissue are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor. Proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin-1) can indirectly promote angiogenesis through increased VEGF expression. The laminin in basement membranes may pose a physical barrier to the sprouting of new blood vessels.",
    "zh": "该患者有一个高度血管化的肝脏肿瘤，可能是良性的肝血管瘤。许多病例是偶然发现的。血管生成（血管形成）主要由以下两种物质驱动：\n\n*   血管内皮生长因子（VEGF）：VEGF刺激各种组织（正常、慢性炎症、愈合或肿瘤）的血管生成。随着VEGF增加内皮细胞的活力和增殖，新的毛细血管开始萌发。\n*   成纤维细胞生长因子（FGF）：FGF-2由多种细胞产生，参与内皮细胞增殖、迁移和分化。FGF-2似乎也在胚胎发生中起重要作用，通过刺激成血管细胞的产生。作为一个整体，FGF不仅促进血管生成，还促进胚胎发育、造血和伤口修复（通过招募巨噬细胞、成纤维细胞和内皮细胞到受损组织）。\n\n然而，基底膜中的层粘连蛋白可能会对新生血管的发芽构成物理屏障。\n\n（选项A）表皮生长因子（EGF），不要与VEGF混淆，对上皮细胞、肝细胞和成纤维细胞具有有丝分裂影响。EGF在血管生成中似乎不像VEGF或FGF-2那样起重要作用。\n\n（选项C）胰岛素样生长因子1（IGF-1），或生长调节素C，主要由受生长激素影响的肝细胞合成，用于刺激细胞生长和增殖。IGF-1似乎不能直接刺激血管生成，但可以通过促进细胞生长间接促进血管生成。\n\n（选项D和E）虽然白介素-1（IL-1）的促炎性质可以诱导其他促炎细胞因子的释放，从而触发细胞VEGF表达，但IL-1似乎不能直接刺激血管生成。同样，虽然干扰素-γ可以通过激活巨噬细胞（可以释放VEGF）间接促进新血管形成，但它似乎不能直接刺激血管生成。\n\n教育目标：\n促进肿瘤性和肉芽组织血管生成的主要生长因子是血管内皮生长因子（VEGF）和成纤维细胞生长因子。促炎细胞因子（例如，白介素-1）可以通过增加VEGF的表达间接促进血管生成。基底膜中的层粘连蛋白可能会对新生血管的发芽构成物理屏障。"
