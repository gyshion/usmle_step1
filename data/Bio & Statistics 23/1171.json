    "en": "A 73-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up. He was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 3 years ago when routine laboratory testing revealed a markedly elevated leukocyte count. He feels well. On examination, he has stable lymphadenopathy. He has been reading about management options should his CLL progress and inquires about an experimental drug that selectively binds malignant lymphocytes. The drug has been shown to significantly prolong survival in patients with stage 3 and 4 CLL, without curing the malignancy. If this new drug were widely used, what changes would be expected in the number of incident and prevalent cases of CLL?",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Incident cases represent new cases diagnosed in a given period of time. Prevalent cases are the total number of cases (both old and new) at a particular point in time. For a non-transmissible condition such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the number of incident cases will not be changed by any kind of treatment because the disease has already developed when the treatment is started (and treatment of existing patients will not prevent new patients from developing CLL). Any treatment that prolongs survival but does not cure the disease will increase the number of prevalent cases due to an increase in the number of afflicted (but still living) individuals over time.\n\nDifferences in terminology may lead to confusion. Incident cases and prevalent cases are often referred to as simply \"incidence\" and \"prevalence.\" Incidence can also represent the number of new cases divided by the population at risk over a period of time and can be converted into a rate (eg, annual incidence per 10,000 population). Prevalence typically refers to point prevalence (total number of cases at a particular point in time) as opposed to period prevalence (over a period of time). The specific meaning is often clear from the context.\n\nEducational objective:\nIncident cases represent new cases diagnosed in a given period of time. Prevalent cases are the total number of cases (both old and new) at a particular point in time. Any treatment that prolongs survival but does not cure the disease will increase prevalence due to an increase in the number of afflicted (but still living) individuals over time.",
    "zh": "发病病例是指在特定时期内诊断出的新病例。患病病例是指在特定时间点的病例总数（包括旧病例和新病例）。对于像慢性淋巴细胞白血病（CLL）这样的非传染性疾病，任何治疗都不会改变发病病例数，因为当开始治疗时，疾病已经发生（并且治疗现有患者不会阻止新患者发生CLL）。任何延长生存期但不能治愈疾病的治疗，都会由于受影响（但仍然存活）的个体数量随时间增加而增加患病病例数。\n\n术语上的差异可能会导致混淆。发病病例和患病病例通常简称为“发病率”和“患病率”。发病率也可以表示一段时间内的新病例数除以有风险的人群，并可以转换为比率（例如，每年每10,000人口的发病率）。患病率通常指某一点患病率（在特定时间点的病例总数），而不是时段患病率（在一段时间内）。具体含义通常从上下文中可以清楚地看出。\n\n教育目标：\n发病病例是指在特定时期内诊断出的新病例。患病病例是指在特定时间点的病例总数（包括旧病例和新病例）。任何延长生存期但不能治愈疾病的治疗，都会由于受影响（但仍然存活）的个体数量随时间增加而增加患病率。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of incidence and prevalence in the context of chronic disease management. It assesses how a treatment that prolongs survival, but does not cure, impacts the number of prevalent and incident cases.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that incident cases represent new diagnoses, which are unaffected by a treatment targeting existing cases. The treatment prolongs survival, leading to a rise in the number of prevalent cases without affecting new cases.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试对慢性病管理中发病率和患病率的理解。它评估了延长生存期但不能治愈的治疗如何影响患病病例数和发病病例数。\n\n解决这个问题的关键是认识到发病病例代表新诊断，而新诊断不受针对现有病例的治疗的影响。治疗延长了生存期，导致患病病例数增加，而不会影响新病例。"
