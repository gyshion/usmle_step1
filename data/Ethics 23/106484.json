    "en": "A 70-year-old woman comes to the office for evaluation of headaches. She has been having a severe, persistent headache for the past 2 weeks that is worse in the morning and always lingers throughout the day. The patient frequently feels nauseated but has no vomiting. Medical history is significant for major depressive disorder and a prior suicide attempt at age 45; the patient is currently taking an antidepressant and has been in remission for the past year. MRI of the head reveals a mass with surrounding edema in the left cerebral hemisphere that is consistent with glioblastoma multiforme. The patient returns to the office with her son to discuss the results. Before the physician has a chance to share the findings, the son asks to speak in private and requests that the physician not reveal the results to his mother. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to the patient's son?",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Autonomy supports a patient's right to know his or her diagnosis, treatment options, and potential outcomes. However, personal preferences vary (eg, some patients may decline test results or learning their diagnosis), and individual circumstances should guide disclosure.\n\nIn this scenario, the patient's preferences regarding her test results and diagnosis (eg, glioblastoma multiforme), which has a poor prognosis, are unclear. Her son has privately requested that the results not be shared with his mother. If family members ask to withhold medical information from the patient, it is imperative for the physician to understand their reasoning and concerns. The son may have a valid safety concern regarding disclosure of bad news to his mother, who the physician knows has a history of depression and a prior suicide attempt.\n\nHowever, the physician should not make hasty assumptions about family circumstances, the son's concerns, or the patient's state of mind. The most appropriate approach is to listen to the family's concerns and better understand the situation before deciding how best to proceed.\n\n(Choice A) This statement supports patient autonomy. However, it does not allow the son to clarify his concerns; instead, it takes a paternalistic tone (eg, \"I think it's best\"). It also hints at a poor diagnosis (eg, \"it will be difficult to hear\"), which violates health privacy.\n\n(Choice B) The impact of bad news should be considered; however, this statement references the patient's history of depression and suicidality, which is protected health information. In addition, the physician cannot violate confidentiality by sharing results with the patient's son without her permission.\n\n(Choice D) Although the statement expresses empathy, it does not give the son a chance to explain why he opposes disclosing the diagnosis. Premature dismissal of his concerns risks the loss of valuable information (eg, safety concerns).\n\n(Choice E) This approach assumes that the son's intention is to avoid distressing his mother. However, the underlying reason may be something else (eg, cultural norms, the patient's own wishes). The physician should keep an open mind to the son's concerns and not presume to know the patient's feelings without speaking to her first.\n\nEducational objective:\nAutonomy, which supports a patient's right to know his or her diagnosis, is a fundamental ethical principle. However, limiting disclosure of a diagnosis may be appropriate under certain circumstances (eg, patient preference, imminent safety concerns). An understanding, open approach is necessary to uncover these circumstances.",
    "zh": "自主权支持患者了解其诊断、治疗方案和潜在结果的权利。然而，个人偏好各不相同（例如，一些患者可能拒绝接受检查结果或了解他们的诊断），并且应该根据具体情况来指导信息披露。\n\n在这种情况下，患者对她的检查结果和诊断（例如，多形性胶质母细胞瘤，预后不良）的偏好尚不清楚。她的儿子私下要求不要与他的母亲分享结果。如果家人要求隐瞒患者的医疗信息，医生必须了解他们的推理和担忧。儿子可能对向母亲披露坏消息有合理的安全担忧，医生知道她有抑郁症病史和之前的自杀企图。\n\n然而，医生不应草率地对家庭情况、儿子的担忧或患者的精神状态做出假设。最合适的方法是倾听家人的担忧，并在决定如何最好地进行之前更好地了解情况。\n\n（选项A）该声明支持患者自主权。然而，它不允许儿子澄清他的担忧；相反，它采取了家长式的语气（例如，“我认为这是最好的”）。它还暗示了一个不良的诊断（例如，“很难听到”），这侵犯了健康隐私。\n\n（选项B）应该考虑坏消息的影响；然而，该声明提到了患者的抑郁症和自杀史，这是受保护的健康信息。此外，未经患者许可，医生不得通过与患者的儿子分享结果来违反保密原则。\n\n（选项D）尽管该声明表达了同情，但它没有给儿子解释他反对披露诊断的机会。过早地驳回他的担忧会冒着失去有价值信息的风险（例如，安全担忧）。\n\n（选项E）这种方法假设儿子的意图是避免让他的母亲感到痛苦。然而，潜在的原因可能是其他原因（例如，文化规范，患者自己的意愿）。医生应该对儿子的担忧持开放态度，并且在没有先与她交谈的情况下，不要假定知道患者的感受。\n\n教育目标：\n自主权，即支持患者了解其诊断的权利，是一项基本伦理原则。然而，在某些情况下，限制披露诊断可能是合适的（例如，患者偏好，迫在眉睫的安全问题）。有必要采取理解、开放的方法来揭示这些情况。"

It requires the examinee to apply these principles in a complex clinical scenario involving a patient with a history of depression and a son requesting that the diagnosis not be shared with the mother.\n\nThe best approach is to prioritize understanding the son's concerns and the potential reasons for his request before making a decision about disclosing the diagnosis.
