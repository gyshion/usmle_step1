    "en": "This patient's marked anxiety response and fear regarding blood drawing (a specific phobic stimulus) with a history of avoidance behavior is consistent with SPECIFIC PHOBIA, one of the most common anxiety disorders. The BLOOD-INJECTION-INJURY type (ie, fear of blood, injections, and injury) is often accompanied by a VASOVAGAL FAINTING response, and severe cases may be associated with avoidance of necessary medical procedures. Other subtypes of specific phobia, based on the type of phobic stimulus, include animals (eg, insects, snakes, dogs), natural environment (eg, heights, storms, water), and situations (eg, elevators, enclosed places, airplanes).\n\nThe treatment of choice of specific phobia is COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY with repetitive, graded exposure to the fear-inducing stimulus.\n\n(Choice A) Although medical conditions such as asthma or hypoglycemia can result in anxiety, it is more likely that this patient's longstanding and specific fear of blood is triggering her current symptoms.\n\n(Choice B) ILLNESS ANXIETY DISORDER involves persistent preoccupation with having or developing a serious medical condition.\n\n(Choice C) Patients with specific phobia may experience anxiety that reaches the level of a panic attack when exposed to the phobic stimulus. However, panic attacks in specific phobia are always triggered by the phobic stimulus; diagnosis of panic disorder requires that patients experience recurrent, unexpected panic attacks with no trigger.\n\n(Choice D) Both specific phobia and POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) may be associated with anxiety and avoidance of situations related to a traumatic event. However, PTSD also involves intrusive symptoms of reexperiencing (eg, flashbacks, nightmares) that are not present in this patient.\n\nEducational objective: Specific phobia is a common anxiety disorder characterized by high levels of anxiety and panic attacks triggered by exposure, or anticipation of exposure, to a feared stimulus. As a result, these patients try to avoid the phobic stimulus whenever possible.",
    "zh": "该患者对抽血（一种特定的恐惧刺激）的明显焦虑反应和恐惧，并伴有回避行为史，与特定恐惧症一致，这是最常见的焦虑症之一。 血液-注射-损伤型（即，对血液、注射和损伤的恐惧）通常伴有血管迷走神经性晕厥反应，严重病例可能与避免必要的医疗程序有关。 特定恐惧症的其他亚型，基于恐惧刺激的类型，包括动物（例如，昆虫、蛇、狗）、自然环境（例如，高度、风暴、水）和情境（例如，电梯、封闭场所、飞机）。\n\n特定恐惧症的首选治疗方法是认知行为疗法，反复、渐进地暴露于引起恐惧的刺激。\n\n（选项A）尽管哮喘或低血糖等疾病可能导致焦虑，但更有可能的是，该患者长期以来对血液的特定恐惧正在触发她目前的症状。\n\n（选项B）疾病焦虑症涉及持续关注患有或发展严重疾病。\n\n（选项C）患有特定恐惧症的患者在暴露于恐惧刺激时可能会经历达到惊恐发作水平的焦虑。 然而，特定恐惧症中的惊恐发作总是由恐惧刺激触发； 惊恐障碍的诊断需要患者经历反复的、意想不到的无触发的惊恐发作。\n\n（选项D）特定恐惧症和创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD) 都可能与焦虑和回避与创伤事件相关的情况有关。 然而，PTSD 还涉及重体验（例如，闪回、噩梦）的侵入性症状，这些症状在该患者中不存在。\n\n教育目标：特定恐惧症是一种常见的焦虑症，其特征是高水平的焦虑和惊恐发作，这些发作是由暴露于或预期暴露于恐惧刺激引起的。 因此，这些患者会尽可能避免恐惧刺激。"
