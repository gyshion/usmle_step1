    "en": "A new drug has been developed to treat cardiac arrhythmias. The drug has high affinity for activated and inactivated sodium channels but relatively little affinity for resting sodium channels. An experiment is devised to maintain sodium channels in the inactivated state for a prolonged period, during which they are exposed to the new drug. After allowing the sodium channels to return to the resting state, the speed of the drug's dissociation from the sodium channels is recorded and shown below. The dissociation curve for quinidine is given for comparison. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "The drug described is representative of a class IB antiarrhythmic medication, which blocks voltage-gated Na+ channels. Most of the clinically useful agents bind within the pore of the channel during the open and/or inactivated states; dissociation of the drug occurs during the resting state. This state-dependent manner of binding causes a phenomenon in which tissues undergoing frequent depolarization become more susceptible to blockage (use dependence). The faster the heart rate, the more time the Na+ channels spend in the open and inactivated states and the more that become blocked.\n\nThe binding strength of class I antiarrhythmics varies between the different subclasses, with Class IB agents (eg, lidocaine) having the weakest binding compared to other class I antiarrhythmics. Dissociation from the channels occurs so rapidly that there is minimal cumulative effect over multiple cardiac cycles, resulting in little use dependence. These drugs are more selective for ischemic myocardium because the elevated (less negative) resting membrane potential delays Na+ channel transition from the inactivated to the resting state, resulting in increased drug binding. As such, class IB antiarrhythmics are useful for treating ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias.\n\nIn contrast, class IC agents (eg, propafenone, flecainide) have the strongest binding (Choice B). They are the slowest to dissociate from the channel, which allows their blocking effects to accumulate over multiple cardiac cycles. This leads to substantially greater blockade at higher heart rates (high use dependence), making them particularly effective at terminating tachyarrhythmias. However, the prominent use-dependent effects of class IC drugs can cause an excessive delay in conduction speed that can promote arrhythmias, especially in patients with ischemic or structural heart disease.\n\n(Choice A) Disopyramide, quinidine, and procainamide are class IA antiarrhythmic drugs that have an intermediate dissociation speed. The dissociation curve for the new drug shows that drug-channel dissociation is faster than with quinidine, indicating that it is most similar to a class IB antiarrhythmic agent such as lidocaine.\n\n(Choice D) Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker (class II antiarrhythmic). It causes decreased chronotropy and inotropy via beta-1 blockade.\n\n(Choice E) Class III antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide) act predominantly by blocking potassium channels and prolonging phase 3 repolarization. Sotalol also has beta-blocking activity.\n\n(Choice F) Verapamil and diltiazem are calcium channel blockers that function as class IV antiarrhythmics due to their effects on cardiac slow-response tissue. Although nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker as well, it is selective for vascular smooth muscle and does not have a notable effect on the heart.\n\nEducational objective:\nFor class I antiarrhythmics, sodium-channel-binding strength is IC > IA > IB. Use dependence describes the phenomenon in which higher heart rates lead to increased sodium channel blockade due to cumulative blocking effects over multiple cardiac cycles. Class IC antiarrhythmics demonstrate the most use dependence due to their slow dissociation from the receptor, and class IB drugs have the least use dependence as they rapidly dissociate. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "所描述的药物代表一类 IB 型抗心律失常药物，它阻断电压门控 Na+ 通道。大多数临床上有用的药物在通道的开放和/或失活状态下结合在通道孔内；药物的解离发生在静息状态。这种状态依赖性的结合方式导致了一种现象，即经常去极化的组织更容易受到阻滞（使用依赖性）。心率越快，Na+ 通道在开放和失活状态下花费的时间就越多，被阻滞的通道也就越多。\n\nI 类抗心律失常药物的结合强度在不同的亚类之间有所不同，其中 IB 类药物（如利多卡因）与其他 I 类抗心律失常药物相比，结合最弱。从通道的解离发生得非常迅速，在多个心动周期内累积效应最小，导致使用依赖性很小。这些药物对缺血性心肌的选择性更高，因为升高的（负性降低）静息膜电位延迟了 Na+ 通道从失活状态到静息状态的转变，导致药物结合增加。因此，IB 类抗心律失常药物可用于治疗缺血引起的心室性心律失常。\n\n相比之下，IC 类药物（如普罗帕酮、氟卡尼）具有最强的结合力（选项 B）。它们从通道的解离速度最慢，这使得它们的阻断作用可以在多个心动周期内累积。这导致在高心率下出现更大的阻断（高使用依赖性），使它们特别有效地终止快速性心律失常。然而，IC 类药物显着的使用依赖性作用会导致传导速度过度延迟，这可能会促进心律失常，特别是在患有缺血性或结构性心脏病的患者中。\n\n（选项 A）双异丙吡胺、奎尼丁和普鲁卡因胺是 IA 类抗心律失常药物，具有中等解离速度。新药的解离曲线表明，药物-通道解离速度快于奎尼丁，表明它最类似于 IB 类抗心律失常药物，如利多卡因。\n\n（选项 D）普萘洛尔是一种非选择性 β-肾上腺素能受体阻滞剂（II 类抗心律失常药）。它通过 β-1 阻滞引起负性变时性和负性肌力作用。\n\n（选项 E）III 类抗心律失常药物（胺碘酮、索他洛尔、多非利特）主要通过阻断钾离子通道和延长第 3 相复极化而发挥作用。索他洛尔也具有 β-阻滞活性。\n\n（选项 F）维拉帕米和地尔硫卓是钙通道阻滞剂，由于它们对心脏慢反应组织的影响，属于 IV 类抗心律失常药物。虽然硝苯地平也是一种钙通道阻滞剂，但它对血管平滑肌具有选择性，并且对心脏没有明显的影响。\n\n教育目标：\n对于 I 类抗心律失常药物，钠通道结合强度为 IC > IA > IB。使用依赖性描述了心率越高导致钠通道阻滞增加的现象，这是由于在多个心动周期内的累积阻断作用所致。由于 IC 类抗心律失常药物从受体的解离速度慢，因此表现出最大的使用依赖性，而 IB 类药物的解离速度快，因此具有最小的使用依赖性。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"
