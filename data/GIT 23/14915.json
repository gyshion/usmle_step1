    "en": "A 70-year-old man comes to the office due to persistent epigastric discomfort and nausea for the past several months. He has also noticed black-colored stools on several occasions. Medical history is notable for hypertension and osteoarthritis. The patient emigrated from rural China 5 years ago to live with his daughter. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Physical examination shows a thin male with pale mucous membranes, an enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node, and epigastric tenderness on deep palpation. Stool testing for occult blood is positive. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals a 3-cm ulceration at the gastric antrum, with a heaped-up irregular border. Biopsy from the edge of the ulcer reveals glandular structures containing intestinal-like columnar cells.",
    "zh": "一名70岁男性因过去几个月持续性上腹部不适和恶心来就诊。他还注意到几次黑便。病史中值得注意的是高血压和骨关节炎。该患者5年前从中国农村移民到这里与女儿同住。他不吸烟、不饮酒，也不使用非法药物。体格检查显示一名消瘦的男性，黏膜苍白，左锁骨上淋巴结肿大，深触诊时上腹部压痛。大便潜血试验呈阳性。上消化内镜检查显示胃窦部有一个3厘米的溃疡，边缘不规则，呈隆起状。溃疡边缘的活检显示含有类似肠型柱状细胞的腺体结构。"

    "en": "This patient with epigastric pain, occasional melena, and left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (ie, Virchow node) has intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma, the most common primary gastric malignancy. It is typically visualized endoscopically as an ulcerated mass with irregular folded or heaped-up edges. Histologically, intestinal-type gastric cancer resembles colon adenocarcinoma and is characterized by glandular structures containing intestinal-like columnar (or cuboidal) cells.\n\nGastric cancer occurs with the highest incidence in patients from Eastern Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America, possibly due to the increased consumption of salt-preserved foods (eg, salt-cured fish), which directly damage the gastric epithelium and potentiate the effects of carcinogens. Common carcinogens associated with gastric cancer include n-nitroso–containing compounds (eg, tobacco, processed meat) and chronic Helicobacter pylori infection, both of which may also be present at increased levels in these populations. Other risk factors include obesity and autoimmune atrophic gastritis.\n\n(Choices A and E) Chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and gastrin-producing tumors (ie, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) are associated with benign peptic ulcer disease, not gastric adenocarcinoma. Benign ulcers are typically clean-based with regular borders (as opposed to this patient’s ulcerated lesion with irregular, heaped-up borders); in addition, intestinal metaplasia is unexpected.\n\n(Choice C) Excessive consumption of hot beverages is associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, not gastric adenocarcinoma.\n\n(Choice D) Disruption of the lower esophageal sphincter enables gastric acid to reflux into the esophagus, which predisposes patients to esophageal intestinal metaplasia (eg, Barrett esophagus) and ultimately esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, this is not a risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma.\n\nEducational objective:\nIntestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma is visualized endoscopically as an ulcerated mass with irregular folded or heaped-up edges. Histologically, it resembles colon adenocarcinoma and is characterized by glandular structures containing intestinal-like columnar (or cuboidal) cells. Risk factors include Helicobacter pylori infection, a high-salt diet, n-nitroso-containing compounds, and autoimmune atrophic gastritis.",
    "zh": "该患者出现上腹部疼痛、偶有黑便以及左锁骨上淋巴结病（即，Virchow淋巴结），患有肠型胃腺癌，这是最常见的原发性胃恶性肿瘤。通常通过内镜检查将其可视化为边缘不规则、隆起的溃疡性肿块。组织学上，肠型胃癌类似于结肠腺癌，其特征是含有类似肠型柱状（或立方形）细胞的腺体结构。\n\n胃癌在东亚、东欧和南美洲的患者中发病率最高，这可能与过度食用盐腌食物（例如，盐腌鱼）有关，盐腌食物会直接损害胃上皮细胞并增强致癌物的作用。与胃癌相关的常见致癌物包括含n-亚硝基化合物（例如，烟草、加工肉）和慢性幽门螺杆菌感染，这两种情况在这些人群中也可能以较高水平存在。其他危险因素包括肥胖和自身免疫性萎缩性胃炎。\n\n（选项A和E）长期使用非甾体抗炎药和产生胃泌素的肿瘤（即，Zollinger-Ellison综合征）与良性消化性溃疡病相关，而不是胃腺癌。良性溃疡通常基底干净，边缘规则（与该患者边缘不规则、隆起的溃疡性病变相反）；此外，不期望出现肠化生。\n\n（选项C）过度饮用热饮与食管鳞状细胞癌相关，而不是胃腺癌。\n\n（选项D）食管下括约肌的功能紊乱导致胃酸反流入食管，这使患者易患食管肠化生（例如，Barrett食管）并最终导致食管腺癌。然而，这并不是胃腺癌的危险因素。\n\n教育目标：\n肠型胃腺癌通过内镜检查可视化为边缘不规则、隆起的溃疡性肿块。组织学上，它类似于结肠腺癌，其特征是含有类似肠型柱状（或立方形）细胞的腺体结构。危险因素包括幽门螺杆菌感染、高盐饮食、含n-亚硝基化合物和自身免疫性萎缩性胃炎。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of risk factors, endoscopic findings, and histological features of intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma. It also requires differentiating gastric adenocarcinoma from other gastrointestinal malignancies and benign peptic ulcer disease.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's demographics (Asian descent), endoscopic findings (ulcerated mass with irregular borders), and histological features (intestinal-like columnar cells). Recognize that salt-preserved foods are a major risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma, especially in certain populations.",
