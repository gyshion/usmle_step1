    "en": "A 62-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to sudden-onset of high fever, shaking chills, shortness of breath, and productive cough. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. Examination shows dullness to percussion over the left side of the chest. Chest x-ray {{exhibit_1}} reveals consolidation in the left upper lobe. Gram stain of the sputum shows numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes and gram-positive cocci in pairs. When cultured on a blood agar plate under aerobic conditions, the bacterial colonies are surrounded by a zone of incomplete hemolysis. The organism responsible for this patient's condition is most likely to exhibit which of the following virulence features?",

    "en": "Lobar pneumonia typically presents with acute-onset fever, cough, and lobar consolidation on chest x-ray. Although a number of different bacterial pathogens cause lobar pneumonia (eg, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus), the most common cause is Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nS pneumoniae is a gram-positive diplococci that exhibits partial (α) hemolysis on blood agar (green colonies) and is bile-soluble and Optochin-sensitive. Its major virulence factor is a thick polysaccharide capsule that encases the organism and prevents phagocytosis and complement binding. Under the microscope, the capsule swells and appears as a halo around the blue-stained bacterial cells when specific anti-capsular antibodies and methylene blue dye are added (\"quelling reaction\").\n\nInfection with S. pneumoniae leads to the generation of anti-capsular antibodies that are protective against future infection with that strain. However, over 90 different antigenic variations (serotypes) of capsular polysaccharides have been identified, so future infection can occur with a strain that has not yet been encountered. Therefore, patients at high risk for invasive pneumococcal disease (eg, HIV, extremes of age) are generally given the pneumococcal vaccine, which induces immunity against the most common strains.\n\nOther virulence factors of S. pneumoniae include IgA protease (inactivates secretory IgA), adhesins (necessary for adhesion to epithelial cells), and pneumolysin (cytotoxin that causes pores in cell membranes and cell lysis).\n\n(Choice A) Certain bacterial exotoxins (eg, Shiga toxin) enter the host cell and cleave a nucleobase from the host ribosome, thereby inhibiting host protein synthesis. Others (eg, diphtheria toxin) prevent protein elongation. S. pneumoniae does not directly inhibit host protein synthesis.\n\n(Choice B) Motility within host tissue can be provided by flagella. S. pneumoniae is a nonmotile organism.\n\n(Choice C) Facultative intracellular bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes have virulence factors that prevent the bacteria from being destroyed by the phagolysosome of macrophages. S. pneumoniae is not an intracellular pathogen.\n\n(Choice E) Spores are resistant to chemical disinfectants, irradiation, desiccation, and temperatures as high as 120 C (248 F). Bacillus and Clostridium species commonly produce spores, but S. pneumoniae does not.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe primary virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae is a polysaccharide capsule that inhibits opsonization and phagocytosis. The polysaccharide capsule of the most virulent strains is targeted by the pneumococcal vaccine, which confers immunity against those subtypes.",
    "zh": "大叶性肺炎通常表现为急性发热、咳嗽和胸部X光片上出现大叶实变。虽然许多不同的细菌病原体可引起大叶性肺炎（例如，流感嗜血杆菌、卡他莫拉菌、金黄色葡萄球菌），但最常见的原因是肺炎链球菌。\n\n肺炎链球菌是一种革兰氏阳性双球菌，在血琼脂上表现出部分 (α) 溶血（绿色菌落），并且可溶于胆汁并对Optochin敏感。其主要毒力因子是一个厚的荚膜多糖，包围着病原体，阻止吞噬作用和补体结合。在显微镜下，当添加特异性抗荚膜抗体和亚甲蓝染料时，荚膜会膨胀并呈现为蓝色染色的细菌细胞周围的光晕（“肿胀反应”）。\n\n肺炎链球菌感染会导致产生抗荚膜抗体，这些抗体可预防将来感染该菌株。然而，已经鉴定出超过90种不同的荚膜多糖抗原变异（血清型），因此将来可能感染尚未遇到的菌株。因此，对于侵袭性肺炎球菌疾病高危患者（例如，HIV感染者，年龄极端者），通常会接种肺炎球菌疫苗，该疫苗可诱导针对最常见菌株的免疫力。\n\n肺炎链球菌的其他毒力因子包括IgA蛋白酶（使分泌型IgA失活）、粘附素（对粘附到上皮细胞是必需的）和肺溶血素（细胞毒素，导致细胞膜孔和细胞裂解）。\n\n（选项A）某些细菌外毒素（例如，志贺毒素）进入宿主细胞并从宿主核糖体上切割一个核碱基，从而抑制宿主蛋白质的合成。其他毒素（例如，白喉毒素）阻止蛋白质的延伸。肺炎链球菌不直接抑制宿主蛋白质的合成。\n\n（选项B）在宿主组织内的运动性可以由鞭毛提供。肺炎链球菌是一种非运动性病原体。\n\n（选项C）兼性细胞内细菌，如结核分枝杆菌和单核细胞增生李斯特菌，具有阻止细菌被巨噬细胞吞噬溶酶体破坏的毒力因子。肺炎链球菌不是细胞内病原体。\n\n（选项E）芽孢耐受化学消毒剂、照射、干燥和高达120摄氏度（248华氏度）的温度。芽孢杆菌属和梭菌属细菌通常产生芽孢，但肺炎链球菌不产生。\n\n教育目标：\n肺炎链球菌的主要毒力因子是荚膜多糖，可抑制调理作用和吞噬作用。最强毒力菌株的荚膜多糖是肺炎球菌疫苗的靶标，该疫苗可赋予针对这些亚型的免疫力。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the virulence factors of Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common cause of community-acquired lobar pneumonia. It requires correlating clinical presentation, Gram stain findings, and culture characteristics with specific mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the likely pathogen based on the clinical vignette and laboratory findings. Then, recall the key virulence factors of that pathogen and determine which of the provided options represents a significant mechanism of pathogenicity for Streptococcus pneumoniae, particularly its role in evading host defenses.",
