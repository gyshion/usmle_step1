    "en": "A 68-year-old man comes to the office with a 6-week history of muscle pain and fatigue. He has achy pain that is not related to activity. The patient has tried warm compresses and over-the-counter analgesics without relief. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, mixed hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease with an acute myocardial infarction 2 years ago. {{exhibit_1}} Physical examination shows diffuse tenderness in the proximal muscles of the upper and lower extremities. Serum creatine kinase activity is elevated. Which of the following drug combinations is most likely responsible for this patient's condition?",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Statins (eg, atorvastatin) are the first-line therapy for most patients with hypercholesterolemia and are useful in primary and secondary prevention of acute coronary events. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in synthesis of cholesterol. Statins lower total cholesterol, LDL, and triglyceride levels.\n\nThe primary side effects of statins include myopathy and hepatitis. Statin-associated myopathy is usually characterized by mild muscular pain and resolves with discontinuation of the medication. However, some patients will develop severe myopathy with striking elevations in creatine kinase levels and occasional rhabdomyolysis. The risk of severe myopathy is increased when statins are given concurrently with fibrates (particularly gemfibrozil), which impair the hepatic clearance of statins and lead to excessive blood levels. An increased risk of statin myopathy is also likely with concurrent use of niacin or ezetimibe, but to a lesser extent.\n\n(Choice A) Concurrent use of bile acid sequestrants (eg, cholestyramine) with statins does not increase the risk of myopathy. However, bile acid sequestrants can reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of statins.\n(Choice D) Fibrates can increase drug levels of ezetimibe but this does not have a significant impact on its side effects, which are generally mild and not dose-related. Ezetimibe does not alter the pharmacokinetics of fibrates and does not substantially influence their adverse effects.\n(Choices E and F) The primary adverse effects of niacin include flushing, hyperglycemia, and hepatotoxicity. There are no significant interactions with the concurrent use of niacin and ezetimibe or gemfibrozil.",
    "zh": "他汀类药物（例如，阿托伐他汀）是大多数高胆固醇血症患者的一线治疗药物，并可用于急性冠脉事件的一级和二级预防。他汀类药物抑制HMG-CoA还原酶，这是负责胆固醇合成中限速步骤的酶。他汀类药物可降低总胆固醇、LDL和甘油三酯水平。\n\n他汀类药物的主要副作用包括肌病和肝炎。他汀类药物相关的肌病通常表现为轻度肌肉疼痛，停药后可缓解。然而，一些患者会发生严重的肌病，伴有肌酸激酶水平显着升高和偶尔的横纹肌溶解症。当他汀类药物与贝特类药物（尤其是吉非贝齐）同时使用时，严重肌病的风险会增加，因为贝特类药物会损害他汀类药物的肝脏清除，导致血液水平过高。同时使用烟酸或依泽替米贝也可能增加他汀类药物肌病的风险，但程度较轻。\n\n（选项A）与他汀类药物同时使用胆汁酸螯合剂（例如，考来烯胺）不会增加肌病的风险。然而，胆汁酸螯合剂可降低他汀类药物的胃肠道吸收。\n（选项D）贝特类药物可增加依泽替米贝的药物水平，但这对其副作用没有显着影响，副作用通常较轻且与剂量无关。依泽替米贝不改变贝特类药物的药代动力学，也不会显着影响其不良反应。\n（选项E和F）烟酸的主要不良反应包括潮红、高血糖和肝毒性。同时使用烟酸和依泽替米贝或吉非贝齐没有显着相互作用。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of statin-induced myopathy, characterized by muscle pain, fatigue, and elevated creatine kinase levels. This is likely exacerbated by the concurrent use of a statin (atorvastatin) and a fibrate (gemfibrozil), as this combination is known to increase the risk of severe myopathy due to impaired statin clearance.",
    "zh": "患者表现出提示他汀类药物引起的肌病的症状，其特征是肌肉疼痛、疲劳和肌酸激酶水平升高。这很可能因同时使用他汀类药物（阿托伐他汀）和贝特类药物（吉非贝齐）而加重，因为已知这种组合会由于他汀类药物清除受损而增加严重肌病的风险。"
