    "en": "A 64-year-old man presents to the office with chest discomfort and mild shortness of breath that started one hour ago after an argument with his wife. He has a long history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. His blood pressure is 180/100 mmHg and his heart rate is 100/min. An EKG taken in the emergency department shows no signs of acute ischemia. Cardiac auscultation in the left decubitus position on full expiration reveals a presystolic sound. Which of the following best explains this physical examination finding?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "An S4 is an isolated presystolic (late diastolic) sound heard just prior to S1. An S4 is caused by **left atrial contraction** that forces atrial blood into a poorly compliant left ventricle (LV) that is nearly filled to capacity. When blood is forced into the ventricle by the atrium under these conditions it generates a large, rapid increase in LV pressure thereby producing a sound possibly resulting from rapid deceleration of the forced blood or from impact of the filling ventricle with the chest wall. LV hypertrophy and other causes of diastolic heart failure therefore favor generation of an S4 sound. This patient's LV hypertrophy is likely secondary to **chronic hypertension**.\n\n(Choice A) Papillary muscle dysfunction may cause incomplete closure of the atrioventricular valves resulting in a murmur audible during systole.\n\n(Choice C) An increase in LV preload is typically accommodated by stretching in a normally compliant ventricle and does not result in characteristic heart sounds.\n\n(Choice D) Aortic regurgitation causes a decrescendo early and mid-diastolic murmur.\n\n(Choice E) Mitral leaflet fusion and fibrosis may cause mitral stenosis resulting in a mid-diastolic murmur with possible late diastolic (pre-systolic) accentuation due to atrial contraction.\n\nEducational objective:\nAn S4 sound is best heard near the cardiac apex at the point of maximal impulse with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. It results from the atrial contraction, which forces blood into an LV that has reached its limit of compliance. Chronic hypertension causes left ventricular hypertrophy, which itself may promote the generation of an S4 sound.",
    "zh": "S4是一种在S1之前听到的孤立的收缩前（舒张晚期）声音。S4是由**左心房收缩**引起的，它迫使心房血液进入顺应性差的左心室（LV），左心室几乎已充满。当在这种情况下，血液由心房被迫进入心室时，会产生LV压力的大幅快速升高，从而产生声音，这可能源于强制血液的快速减速，或者源于充盈的心室撞击胸壁。因此，LV肥大和其他舒张性心力衰竭的原因有利于S4声音的产生。该患者的LV肥大很可能继发于**慢性高血压**。\n\n（选项A）乳头肌功能障碍可能导致房室瓣关闭不全，从而导致在收缩期可听到的杂音。\n\n（选项C）LV前负荷的增加通常通过在顺应性正常的的心室中牵张而得到适应，并且不会产生特征性的心脏声音。\n\n（选项D）主动脉瓣关闭不全会导致减弱的舒张早期和中期杂音。\n\n（选项E）二尖瓣叶融合和纤维化可能导致二尖瓣狭窄，从而导致舒张中期杂音，并可能因心房收缩而导致舒张晚期（收缩前）增强。\n\n教育目的：\nS4声音最好在心脏尖端，即最大冲动点附近，患者处于左侧卧位时听到。它是由心房收缩引起的，心房收缩迫使血液进入已达到其顺应性极限的LV。慢性高血压引起左心室肥大，这本身可能促进S4声音的产生。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize the cause of an S4 heart sound in the context of hypertension. The key is understanding the pathophysiology of S4 sounds and their association with decreased ventricular compliance.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that an S4 sound is caused by atrial contraction against a stiff ventricle. Consider the patient's history of hypertension, which can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy and decreased compliance, making left ventricular hypertrophy the most likely cause.",
    "zh": "此问题测试在有高血压的背景下，识别S4心脏声音原因的能力。关键是理解S4声音的病理生理学及其与心室顺应性降低的关系。\n\n为了解决这个问题，回想一下S4声音是由心房收缩对抗僵硬的心室引起的。考虑患者的高血压病史，这可能导致左心室肥大和顺应性降低，使左心室肥大成为最可能的原因。"
