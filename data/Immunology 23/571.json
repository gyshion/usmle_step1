A maternal uncle died of recurrent infections during childhood. The patient is at the 10th percentile for {{exhibit_1}} and {{exhibit_2}}. Temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F). Examination shows an ill-appearing patient with point tenderness over the right lower tibia. There are healed incisions over the thighs and neck from prior drainage sites. Imaging reveals evidence of tibial osteomyelitis. Blood and bone cultures grow Serratia marcescens. Evaluation of the patient's neutrophils by dihydrohodamine flow cytometry shows an absence of fluorescence. This patient's condition is most likely due to impaired activity of which of the following enzymes?",

    "en": "This patient's abnormal flow cytometry findings are characteristic of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), an X-linked condition caused by NADPH oxidase deficiency. NADPH oxidase is a membrane-bound complex within phagolysosomes that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to superoxide during the respiratory burst. The production of reactive oxygen species facilitates the intracellular killing of organisms ingested by phagocytes. Patients with CGD have impaired intracellular killing, resulting in recurrent bacterial and fungal infections (eg, abscesses, lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis) caused by certain catalase-positive organisms (eg, Serratia). Diagnostic tests for CGD involve the assessment of neutrophil superoxide production:\n\n* Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) testing assesses the production of superoxide radicals by measuring the oxidation of DHR to rhodamine, a fluorescent green compound that can be detected on flow cytometry. An absence of fluorescence correlates with impaired oxidation/respiratory burst and a diagnosis of CGD.\n\n* Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) testing involves adding NBT to a sample of the patient's neutrophils. Properly functioning neutrophils produce reactive oxygen species, which reduce the pale NBT to dark blue formazan that precipitates within the cells. The compound has no change in color in patients with CGD.\n\n(Choice A) Adenosine deaminase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes severe combined immunodeficiency. This condition results in a profound decrease in B and T lymphocytes with variable immunoglobulin deficiencies; DHR testing would be normal.\n\n(Choice B) Cytochrome c oxidase is a multisubunit complex that acts as the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Deficiency results in variable myopathic and encephalopathic, not infectious, findings.\n\n(Choice C) Lysozyme is an enzyme that helps destroy bacterial cell walls; deficiency increases the risk of gram-positive infections. However, a defect in lysozyme would not explain this patient's abnormal DHR testing.\n\n(Choice D) Myeloperoxidase, an enzyme found in neutrophil azurophilic granules, aids in intracellular killing by catalyzing the production of hypochlorite (bleach) from hydrogen peroxide and iodide. Although DHR testing can be abnormal in myeloperoxidase deficiency, patients are usually asymptomatic; a minority have invasive Candida infections. In contrast, this child's severe bacterial infections (lymphadenitis, abscess, Serratia osteomyelitis) make this diagnosis unlikely.",
    "zh": "该患者异常的流式细胞术结果是慢性肉芽肿病(CGD)的特征，这是一种由NADPH氧化酶缺乏引起的X连锁疾病。NADPH氧化酶是吞噬溶酶体内的膜结合复合物，在呼吸爆发期间催化氧还原为超氧化物。活性氧的产生促进了吞噬细胞摄入的生物体的细胞内杀灭。CGD患者细胞内杀灭受损，导致反复细菌和真菌感染（如脓肿、淋巴结炎、骨髓炎），这些感染是由某些过氧化氢酶阳性生物（如粘质沙雷氏菌）引起的。CGD的诊断测试包括评估中性粒细胞超氧化物产生：\n\n* 二氢罗丹明（DHR）测试通过测量DHR氧化成罗丹明来评估超氧自由基的产生，罗丹明是一种可在流式细胞术中检测到的荧光绿色化合物。无荧光与氧化/呼吸爆发受损和CGD的诊断相关。\n\n* 硝基蓝四唑（NBT）测试包括将NBT添加到患者的中性粒细胞样本中。功能正常的中性粒细胞会产生活性氧，将淡NBT还原为深蓝色甲脎，沉淀在细胞内。CGD患者的化合物颜色没有变化。\n\n(选项 A) 腺苷脱氨酶缺乏症是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，可导致严重的联合免疫缺陷。这种情况导致B细胞和T细胞的严重减少，伴有不同的免疫球蛋白缺陷；DHR检测结果将正常。\n\n(选项 B) 细胞色素c氧化酶是一种多亚基复合物，作为线粒体呼吸链的末端酶。缺乏导致各种肌病和脑病，而不是感染性发现。\n\n(选项 C) 溶菌酶是一种有助于破坏细菌细胞壁的酶；缺乏会增加革兰氏阳性菌感染的风险。然而，溶菌酶的缺陷并不能解释该患者异常的DHR检测结果。\n\n(选项 D) 髓过氧化物酶是一种在中性粒细胞嗜天青颗粒中发现的酶，通过催化过氧化氢和碘化物产生次氯酸盐（漂白剂）来帮助细胞内杀灭。虽然髓过氧化物酶缺乏症的DHR检测结果可能异常，但患者通常无症状；少数患者有侵袭性念珠菌感染。相比之下，该儿童的严重细菌感染（淋巴结炎、脓肿、沙雷氏菌骨髓炎）使该诊断不太可能。"
