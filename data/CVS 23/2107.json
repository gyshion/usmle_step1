    "en": "Extra (gallop) heart sounds {{exhibit_2}}\n\nThis patient has a low pitch, extra heart sound at the end of diastole (just before S1) known as an S4. An S4 is thought to be caused by blood striking a stiff ventricular wall during atrial contraction. It can be a normal finding in elderly patients (eg, age >70) due to a physiologic, age-related decrease in left ventricular (LV) compliance. However, in younger patients it typically indicates pathologic LV wall stiffening, most commonly due to concentric LV hypertrophy in response to prolonged hypertension (likely the cause in this case).\n\nIn comparison, an S3 is heard in early diastole (just after S2) and is thought to result from reverberation of sound due to blood filling an enlarged and volume-overloaded ventricle (as occurs with eccentric hypertrophy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction). Both S3 and S4 are best heard at the cardiac apex with the bell of the stethoscope.\n\n(Choice A) Aortic root dilation can cause aortic regurgitation, which is recognized by a decrescendo early diastolic murmur. Aortic regurgitation resulting from aortic root (as opposed to valvular) pathology is typically best heard at the right upper sternal border.\n\n(Choice B) An atrial septal defect typically causes a faint, crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur (best heard at the left upper sternal border) caused by increased blood flow through the pulmonic valve (ie, pulmonic flow murmur). Splitting of S2 is wide and fixed.\n\n(Choice D) Mitral valve prolapse classically causes a midsystolic click followed by the late systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation (best heard at the cardiac apex). The click is relatively high pitched, and the timing varies with changes in LV blood volume.\n\n(Choice E) Pericardial effusion commonly occurs as a complication of acute pericarditis, which may be recognized by a triphasic pericardial friction rub best heard at the left lower sternal border with the patient leaning forward.\n\nEducational objective:\nAn S4 is a low frequency, extra heart sound that occurs at the end of diastole (just before S1). It is caused by blood striking a stiff ventricular wall during atrial contraction; it can be a normal finding in elderly patients (eg, age >70), but typically indicates pathologic ventricular wall stiffening in younger patients (most commonly due to concentric left ventricular hypertrophy in response to chronic hypertension).",
    "zh": "额外（奔马律）心音 {{exhibit_2}}\n\n该患者在舒张末期（S1之前）有一个低调的额外心音，称为S4。S4被认为是由血液在心房收缩期间撞击僵硬的室壁引起的。对于老年患者（例如，70岁以上）来说，这可能是一个正常现象，因为与年龄相关的左心室 (LV) 顺应性降低。然而，在年轻患者中，它通常表明病理性LV壁僵硬，最常见的原因是由于对长期高血压的反应而引起的向心性LV肥大（在这种情况下可能是原因）。\n\n相比之下，S3是在舒张早期（S2之后）听到的，被认为是由于血液充盈扩大和容量超负荷的室而引起的声波回响（如在射血分数降低的心力衰竭中发生偏心肥大时发生）。S3和S4都最好用听诊器的钟形部分在心尖处听到。\n\n（选项 A）主动脉根部扩张可引起主动脉瓣关闭不全，其特征是舒张早期出现递减性杂音。由主动脉根部（而不是瓣膜）病理引起的瓣关闭不全通常在右侧胸骨上缘听诊效果最佳。\n\n（选项 B）房间隔缺损通常引起轻微的、渐强-减弱的收缩期杂音（在左上胸骨缘听诊效果最佳），这是由于通过肺动脉瓣的血流量增加所致（即，肺动脉血流杂音）。S2分裂广泛且固定。\n\n（选项 D）二尖瓣脱垂通常引起中收缩期喀喇音，随后是二尖瓣反流的舒张晚期杂音（在心尖处听诊效果最佳）。喀喇音相对较高，其时机随LV血容量的变化而变化。\n\n（选项 E）心包积液通常是急性心包炎的并发症，可以通过在患者前倾时在左下胸骨缘听诊到的三相心包摩擦音来识别。\n\n教育目标：\nS4是一种低频的额外心音，发生在舒张末期（S1之前）。它是由血液在心房收缩期间撞击僵硬的室壁引起的；这在老年患者（例如，70岁以上）中可能是正常现象，但通常表明年轻患者的病理性室壁僵硬（最常见的原因是由于对慢性高血压的反应而引起的向心性左心室肥大）。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize the significance of an S4 heart sound and its association with left ventricular hypertrophy, particularly in the context of hypertension. It also requires differentiating between various heart murmurs and sounds associated with other cardiac conditions.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key finding (S4 heart sound) and correlate it with the patient's history of hypertension. Recall that an S4 is often associated with a stiffened left ventricle, commonly due to hypertrophy from chronic hypertension.",
