    "en": "A 57-year-old man comes to the office due to unrefreshing sleep. He feels tired during the day and occasionally has to nap during his lunch hours. According to his wife, the patient snores loudly during sleep and frequently gasps for breath. He also has severe claustrophobia. Past medical history is significant for hypertension. The patient takes no sedative medications and is a lifetime nonsmoker. Blood pressure is 156/94 mm Hg and BMI is 30 kg/m². Physical examination is significant for a bulky tongue and crowded, narrow oropharynx. Electrical stimulation of which of the following nerves may improve the pathophysiologic cause of this patient's symptoms?",

    "en": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by recurrent episodes of upper airway collapse during sleep. Anatomical and neuromuscular mechanisms have been implicated in OSA. Neuromuscular weakness as a pathogenic mechanism in OSA is supported by the fact that apneas occur only during sleep, a time of muscle relaxation. The upper airway dilator muscles weaken during the transition from wake to sleep, leading to airway narrowing and ultimately collapse in individuals with OSA. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nStimulation of the hypoglossal nerve using an implantable nerve stimulator causes the tongue to move forward slightly, increasing the anteroposterior diameter of the airway. Studies with these devices have shown a reduction in the number of obstructive events during sleep.\n\n(Choices B and C) The lingual nerve arises from the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve and supplies sensory innervation to the tongue. The maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve provides sensation to the mid-face area. Neither of these nerves provides motor innervation to the oropharyngeal muscles involved in OSA.\n\n(Choice D) The phrenic nerve supplies the diaphragm. Although diaphragmatic paralysis can cause sleep apnea, OSA with loud snoring and gasping respirations is due to oropharyngeal rather than diaphragmatic dysfunction.\n\n(Choice E) The vocal cords are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve, but sleep apnea is primarily a problem of the pharynx, not larynx.\n\nEducational objective:\nNeuromuscular weakness of the oropharynx is involved in the pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea. Electrical stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve increases the diameter of the oropharyngeal airway and decreases the frequency of apneic events.",
    "zh": "阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停（OSA）的特征是睡眠期间反复发生上气道塌陷。解剖学和神经肌肉机制与OSA有关。神经肌肉无力作为OSA的致病机制，可以通过以下事实得到支持，即呼吸暂停仅在睡眠期间发生，而睡眠是肌肉放松的时间。在上气道扩张肌从清醒状态到睡眠状态的转变过程中会减弱，导致气道变窄，最终导致OSA患者的塌陷。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n使用可植入神经刺激器刺激舌下神经会导致舌头稍微向前移动，从而增加气道的矢状径。使用这些设备的研究表明，睡眠期间阻塞事件的数量有所减少。\n\n（选项B和C）舌神经起自三叉神经的下颌分支，并为舌头提供感觉神经支配。三叉神经的上颌分支为面中部区域提供感觉。这些神经都不能为参与OSA的口咽部肌肉提供运动神经支配。\n\n（选项D）膈神经支配膈肌。虽然膈肌麻痹会导致睡眠呼吸暂停，但OSA伴有响亮的打鼾声和喘息呼吸，是由于口咽而不是膈肌功能障碍引起的。\n\n（选项E）声带由喉返神经支配，但睡眠呼吸暂停主要是一个咽部问题，而不是喉部问题。\n\n教育目标：\n口咽的神经肌肉无力参与阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停的病理生理学。 电刺激舌下神经可增加口咽气道的直径，并减少呼吸暂停事件的频率。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the role of neuromuscular weakness in the oropharynx. It also assesses understanding of the hypoglossal nerve's function in maintaining airway patency during sleep.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's symptoms as indicative of OSA. Then, recall that neuromuscular weakness of the oropharynx contributes to airway collapse in OSA, and the hypoglossal nerve innervates muscles that can help maintain airway patency.",
