    "en": "A 45-year-old man comes to the emergency department with multiple hand lacerations sustained when he punched his hand through a window. The patient says he \"momentarily lost control\" when he came home from work to find that his wife had moved out of the home and taken their two children. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 150/88 mm Hg, and pulse is 96/min. The patient has multiple abrasions and cuts on his right hand and is informed that two lacerations will require suturing. The patient is agitated and angrily says: \"I've been waiting a really long time and have to get out of here and set things straight with my wife and kids. I don't have time for stitches anymore. You are all incompetent.\" Which of the following questions is most appropriate in determining the best next step in management of this patient?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient shows several signs that are concerning for potential violence, including a RECENT INCIDENT of violent/self-destructive behavior resulting in injury and ESCALATING AGITATION and angry, demanding behavior in the emergency department. The self-harm incident occurred in the context of an acute and devastating loss. The meaning of his vaguely threatening statement (\"have to get out of here and set things straight with my wife and kids\") is unclear and a concerning sign for potential further harm to himself or his family. His agitation has likely been compounded by a long wait time, and the physician must respond to the patient's impatience to leave and at the same time perform a necessary safety evaluation.\n\nThe potential for further violence should be addressed directly. The patient should be asked if he is having any thoughts or impulses to hurt anyone or himself. If the patient is feeling homicidal and/or suicidal, he should not be allowed to leave the emergency department and should be placed on hold, involuntarily if necessary.\n\n(Choice A) The disinhibiting effects of alcohol or drugs can increase the risk for violence, and asking the patient what he has used can aid in his overall management. However, this patient does not show signs of gross intoxication or withdrawal, which would require immediate treatment. The more critical issue is determining if he is having thoughts of harming himself or others because this would determine the need to hold him in the emergency department.\n\n(Choices C and D) These statements fail to address directly the patient's potential for violence. Determining if this patient is feeling homicidal and/or suicidal is the most critical step in management.\n\n(Choice E) Although this statement attempts to be empathic, it asks a closed-ended yes-or-no question in a leading manner that may irritate the patient and cause him to become defensive. It would be better to ask the patient to talk about what he is going through in an open-ended fashion (eg, \"You have been through a lot today. How are you managing it all?\").",
    "zh": "该患者表现出几个令人担忧的迹象，可能存在暴力倾向，包括最近发生的暴力/自毁行为导致受伤，以及急诊科不断升级的激动和愤怒、要求过度的行为。自残事件发生在突发且毁灭性损失的背景下。他对模糊的威胁性言论（“必须离开这里，和我妻子和孩子们把事情说清楚”）的含义尚不明确，并且是潜在进一步伤害自己或家人的令人担忧的迹象。他的激动很可能因长时间的等待而加剧，医生必须对患者离开的急躁做出回应，同时进行必要的安全评估。\n\n应直接解决进一步暴力的可能性。应询问患者是否有任何伤害他人或自己的想法或冲动。如果患者感到有杀人或自杀的念头，则不应允许其离开急诊科，并在必要时非自愿地对其进行留置。\n\n（选项A）酒精或药物的去抑制作用会增加暴力风险，询问患者使用了什么药物有助于他的整体管理。然而，该患者没有表现出明显的醉酒或戒断症状，这需要立即治疗。更关键的问题是确定他是否正在考虑伤害自己或他人，因为这将决定是否需要在急诊科留住他。\n\n（选项C和D）这些陈述未能直接解决患者潜在的暴力行为。确定该患者是否感到有杀人或自杀念头是管理中最关键的步骤。\n\n（选项E）尽管此陈述试图表示同情，但它以引导的方式询问封闭式的是或否问题，这可能会激怒患者并导致他变得具有防御性。最好以开放的方式询问患者正在经历的事情（例如，“您今天经历了许多事情。您是如何处理这一切的？”）。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to assess the risk of violence and self-harm in an agitated patient presenting to the emergency department. It requires recognizing concerning behaviors and statements, and prioritizing the patient's safety.\n\nThe best approach is to directly address the potential for violence by asking about thoughts or impulses to harm oneself or others. Avoid closed-ended questions and focus on open-ended communication to gather more information and de-escalate the situation.",
