    "en": "A primary care physician is invited to give a presentation to a local employer. He is a member of a large multi-specialty medical group, which he joined less than a year ago after completing residency. During the presentation, the physician discusses the various medical specialties available within the group, as well as the range of ancillary services the group offers at its facilities. In the ensuing discussion, the physician learns that the employer has been facing financial difficulties. The employer wishes to continue offering health care coverage to its employees but needs to reduce expenditures. As a result, the employer would like to negotiate a contract in which the medical group would provide care to all the company's employees in exchange for a set monthly fee per employee.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "An arrangement in which a payor (individual, employer, or government entity) pays a fixed, predetermined fee per patient to cover all required medical services is termed capitation. Capitation is the payment structure underlying health maintenance organization (HMO) provider networks. Under capitation, there is an incentive for the provider and patient to reduce expenses, usually by restricting patients to a limited panel of providers within the plan, requiring referrals from a primary care provider prior to specialist consultations, and denying payment for services that do not meet established evidence-based guidelines.\n\nCapitation payments are often made to a private insurance company, which then negotiates with individual physicians or physician networks to provide care. Alternately, a very large physician group (including primary and specialty physicians) may contract directly with employers to provide capitated care for their employees.\n\n(Choice B) Discounted fee-for-service is a payment arrangement in which an insurer pays a provider for each individual service provided at a pre-arranged, discounted rate. Employers would not generally negotiate a fee-for-service contract directly with a provider.\n\n(Choice C) Global payment is an arrangement in which an insurer pays a provider a single payment to cover all the expenses associated with an incident of care. This is most commonly done for elective surgeries, in which the global payment covers the surgery as well as any pre- and post-operative visits needed.\n\n(Choice D) A patient-centered medical home is a specific model of primary care in which patients have access to a personal physician who coordinates care and sees the patient through all aspects of care, including preventive services and acute and chronic disease management. Payment for these services may be capitated or fee-for-service.\n\n(Choice E) Point-of-service plans require patients to have a primary care provider and obtain referrals for specialty consultations. They differ from HMO plans in that they allow patients to see providers outside the network, albeit at higher out-of-pocket costs (copays and deductibles).\n\nEducational objective:\nCapitation is an arrangement in which a payor pays a fixed, predetermined fee to provide all the services required by a patient. Payors may negotiate a capitated contract with an insurance company that then pays the providers, or a large medical group may negotiate directly with the payor.",
    "zh": "支付方（个人、雇主或政府实体）支付固定的、预先确定的每位患者的费用以涵盖所有必要的医疗服务，这种安排被称为人头付费。人头付费是健康维护组织 (HMO) 提供者网络的基础支付结构。在人头付费下，提供者和患者都有降低费用的动机，通常通过将患者限制在计划内的有限提供者小组中，要求在专科医生会诊前由初级保健提供者转诊，并拒绝为不符合既定循证指南的服务付款。\n\n人头付费通常支付给私立保险公司，然后由保险公司与个别医生或医生网络协商以提供医疗服务。或者，一个非常大的医生集团（包括初级保健医生和专科医生）可以直接与雇主签订合同，为其员工提供人头付费护理。\n\n（选项 B）折扣按服务付费是一种付款安排，保险公司以预先约定的折扣费率为每项提供的服务向提供者付款。雇主通常不会直接与提供者协商按服务付费合同。\n\n（选项 C）总额预付是一种安排，保险公司向提供者支付一次性付款，以涵盖与一次护理事件相关的所有费用。这通常用于选择性手术，总额预付涵盖手术以及所需的术前和术后就诊。\n\n（选项 D）以患者为中心的医疗之家是一种特定的初级保健模式，患者可以获得一位个人医生，该医生协调护理并负责患者的各个方面，包括预防服务以及急性和慢性疾病管理。这些服务的付款方式可以是人头付费或按服务付费。\n\n（选项 E）服务点计划要求患者拥有初级保健提供者，并获得专科会诊的转诊。它们与 HMO 计划的不同之处在于，它们允许患者在网络外就诊，尽管自付费用较高（共同付款和免赔额）。\n\n教育目标：\n人头付费是一种安排，付款人支付固定的、预先确定的费用，以提供患者所需的所有服务。付款人可以与保险公司协商人头付费合同，然后由保险公司向提供者付款，或者大型医疗集团可以直接与付款人协商。"
