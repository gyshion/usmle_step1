  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "As the aorta courses through the lower abdomen, it divides into the common iliac arteries, which subsequently branch into the internal and external iliac arteries. The inferior epigastric artery branches off the external iliac artery immediately proximal to the inguinal ligament before the external iliac artery becomes the common femoral artery. As the inferior epigastric artery runs superiorly and medially up the abdomen, it provides blood supply to the lower anterior abdominal wall. The other main branch off the external iliac artery is the deep circumflex iliac artery, which branches more laterally but also supplies blood to the lower abdominal wall.\n\n(Choices B, D, and E) The internal iliac artery supplies most of the structures of the pelvis, gluteal region, and medial thigh. The obturator artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery that runs inferiorly to supply blood to the bladder and medial compartment of the thigh. The superior gluteal artery is the continuation of the internal iliac artery and runs inferiorly to supply blood to the gluteal muscles and a portion of the hip.\n\n(Choice C) The medial circumflex femoral artery branches off the deep femoral artery to supply blood to the femoral neck.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe inferior epigastric artery branches off the external iliac artery immediately proximal to the inguinal ligament. It provides blood supply to the lower anterior abdominal wall as it runs superiorly and medially up the abdomen. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the arterial anatomy of the lower abdomen and pelvis, specifically the origin and course of the inferior epigastric artery. It requires interpretation of an angiogram to identify the artery indicated by the arrow.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recognize the anatomical relationships of the arteries in the region, particularly the branching pattern of the external iliac artery and the location of the inferior epigastric artery relative to the inguinal ligament.",
