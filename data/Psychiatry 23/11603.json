    "en": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office due to disabling anxiety. The patient was recently promoted to his company's headquarters, requiring him to work on the 48th floor of the building. As soon as he steps on the elevator, he feels panicky and faint, sweats profusely, and has heart palpitations. The patient is worried that he might have to resign if he is unable to control his anxiety. His fear of elevators dates back to childhood. He drinks 1 or 2 beers on weekends but does not use tobacco or illicit drugs.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's marked and immediate fear in a specific situation (ie, elevator as phobic stimulus) is consistent with a SPECIFIC PHOBIA. Although he feels panicky when confronted with the phobic stimulus, he does not have unexpected panic attacks as in panic disorder.\n\nCognitive-behavioral therapy, involving systematic, REPEATED EXPOSURE to the phobic stimulus, is the treatment of choice for specific phobia. Exposure is typically performed in a gradual, STEP-WISE MANNER, resulting in decreased anxiety over time as habituation and extinction occur. Confrontation with the phobic stimulus in a safe and controlled manner can be accomplished through in vivo (most effective), imaginal, and virtual reality exposure techniques.\n\n(Choice A) Benzodiazepines (eg, alprazolam) can be used in the acute treatment of specific phobia when there is lack of time, no available therapist, or infrequent encounters. It could be considered in the short-term treatment of this patient's anxiety while cognitive-behavioral therapy takes effect. Benzodiazepines, however, carry the risks of dependence, rebound anxiety, and cognitive impairment and would not be the appropriate long-term choice for this patient who must encounter the phobic stimulus at work on a daily basis.\n\n(Choices C and G) Escitalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), and venlafaxine (a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) are used to treat depression in addition to panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder. They are not first-line treatments for specific phobia.\n\n(Choice D) The beta blocker propranolol has been used to treat performance anxiety (a subtype of social anxiety disorder) but is not useful for specific phobia.\n\n(Choices E and F) These forms of psychotherapy would not address this patient's specific phobia directly. Psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on developing insight into unresolved conflicts and the influence of past relationships on current life situations. Supportive psychotherapy is aimed at bolstering adaptive psychological defenses to help individuals cope with acute crises or chronic psychiatric illness.\n\nEducational objective:\nExposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy, in which patients are systematically confronted with their feared objects or situations, is the most effective long-term treatment for specific phobia.",
    "zh": "该患者在特定情境（即电梯作为恐惧刺激物）中表现出的明显而即时的恐惧，与特定恐惧症一致。尽管他在面对恐惧刺激物时感到恐慌，但他没有像在惊恐障碍中那样出现意外的惊恐发作。\n\n认知行为疗法，包括系统地、重复地暴露于恐惧刺激物，是特定恐惧症的首选治疗方法。暴露通常以渐进的、逐步的方式进行，随着习惯化和消退的发生，焦虑感会随着时间的推移而降低。以安全可控的方式面对恐惧刺激物，可以通过体内（最有效）、想象和虚拟现实暴露技术来实现。\n\n（选项A）苯二氮卓类药物（如阿普唑仑）可用于特定恐惧症的急性治疗，当缺乏时间、没有可用的治疗师或不经常遇到时。在认知行为疗法生效之前，可以考虑将其用于该患者焦虑症的短期治疗。然而，苯二氮卓类药物具有依赖性、反跳性焦虑和认知障碍的风险，对于必须每天在工作中面对恐惧刺激物的患者来说，这并不是合适的长期选择。\n\n（选项C和G）艾司西酞普兰（一种选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂）和文拉法辛（一种5-羟色胺-去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂）用于治疗抑郁症，以及惊恐障碍、广泛性焦虑症和社会焦虑症。它们不是特定恐惧症的一线治疗方法。\n\n（选项D）β受体阻滞剂普萘洛尔已被用于治疗表演焦虑（一种社交焦虑症的亚型），但对特定恐惧症无用。\n\n（选项E和F）这些形式的心理治疗不能直接解决患者的特定恐惧症。精神动力学心理治疗侧重于深入了解未解决的冲突以及过去关系对当前生活状况的影响。支持性心理治疗旨在增强适应性心理防御能力，以帮助个人应对急性危机或慢性精神疾病。\n\n教育目标：\n基于暴露的认知行为疗法，在这种疗法中，患者会系统地面对他们所恐惧的对象或情境，是特定恐惧症最有效的长期治疗方法。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of specific phobias, their diagnostic features, and the most effective long-term treatment modalities. It requires differentiating specific phobias from other anxiety disorders and knowing the first-line therapy for phobias.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the core features of a specific phobia from the clinical vignette. Subsequently, the options should be evaluated based on established treatment guidelines for specific phobias, prioritizing evidence-based, long-term therapeutic interventions.",
