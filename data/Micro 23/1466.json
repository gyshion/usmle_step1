    "en": "A 71-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is hospitalized due to shortness of breath and wheezing. The patient is treated with bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids for acute COPD exacerbation. His symptoms improve over the next 2 days. Before being discharged, an intramuscular vaccine containing inactivated viral components, which he normally receives annually, is administered. Several weeks later, the patient comes in close contact with an individual infected with the same virus contained in the vaccine.",

    "en": "Influenza vaccination is administered either by injection (inactivated [killed] vaccine) or nasal spray (live attenuated vaccine). Each seasonal influenza vaccine contains antigens (or attenuated virions) from 3 or 4 influenza A and B virus strains. Antigens from multiple influenza types are included in the vaccine because antibodies against 1 strain confer limited or no protection against the others. Annual vaccination is recommended due to waning effectiveness over time and because circulating strains of influenza change from year to year. All individuals age >6 months should be immunized, especially health care workers and those at risk of serious complications such as the elderly, patients with chronic illness (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and immunocompromised individuals.\n\nInactivated versions of the influenza vaccine stimulate the formation of neutralizing antibodies against the hemagglutinin antigen of included strains. Subsequent exposure to a strain of influenza included in the vaccine will not result in infection because the antibodies bind to hemagglutinin, thereby preventing hemagglutinin from attaching to the sialic acid receptor on host respiratory epithelial cells (preventing viral entry).\n\n(Choice A) Because inactivated viral vaccines do not infect host cells, they are not processed by the MHC class I pathway and do not stimulate a potent CD8+ T-cell response. In contrast, live attenuated influenza vaccines replicate in nasopharyngeal cells and are displayed on MHC class I molecules, thereby generating a strong cytotoxic T-cell response that results in the destruction of the infected cell.\n\n(Choices B and E) Protective antibodies against influenza primarily target the surface glycoproteins and impair viral entry. Immunization does not typically affect viral genomic replication or assembly, which occurs in the interior of the cell and cannot be targeted easily by an antibody response.\n\n(Choice C) Neuraminidase cleaves the terminal sialic acid residues on glycoconjugate receptors, which releases influenza virions from infected cells. Oseltamivir is a sialic acid analogue that competitively inhibits influenza neuraminidase, which prevents release of viral progeny.\n\nEducational objective:\nInactivated (killed or component) viral vaccines primarily generate a humoral immune response against extracellular viral antigens, preventing viral entry into the cell. In contrast, live attenuated viral vaccines can generate a strong cell-mediated immune response that can kill virally-infected cells, in addition to providing humoral immunity.",
    "zh": "流感疫苗接种可以通过注射（灭活[灭活]疫苗）或鼻喷雾剂（减毒活疫苗）进行。每种季节性流感疫苗都包含来自3或4种甲型和乙型流感病毒株的抗原（或减毒病毒体）。疫苗中包含多种流感类型的抗原，因为针对一种毒株的抗体对其他毒株提供的保护有限或无效。由于随着时间的推移，有效性会减弱，并且流感循环毒株每年都在变化，因此建议每年接种疫苗。所有6个月以上的个体都应接种疫苗，尤其是医护人员和有严重并发症风险的人群，如老年人、慢性病患者（如慢性阻塞性肺病）和免疫功能低下的人。\n\n灭活型流感疫苗会刺激针对所含毒株的血凝素抗原的中和抗体的形成。随后接触疫苗中包含的流感毒株不会导致感染，因为抗体会与血凝素结合，从而阻止血凝素与宿主呼吸道上皮细胞上的唾液酸受体结合（防止病毒进入）。\n\n（选项A）由于灭活病毒疫苗不会感染宿主细胞，因此它们不会通过MHC I类途径处理，也不会刺激强效的CD8+ T细胞反应。相比之下，减毒活流感疫苗会在鼻咽细胞中复制并在MHC I类分子上显示，从而产生强大的细胞毒性T细胞反应，导致受感染细胞的破坏。\n\n（选项B和E）针对流感的保护性抗体主要靶向表面糖蛋白并损害病毒进入。免疫接种通常不会影响细胞内的病毒基因组复制或组装，抗体反应不容易靶向。\n\n（选项C）神经氨酸酶切割糖缀合物受体上的末端唾液酸残基，从而从受感染细胞中释放流感病毒体。奥司他韦是一种唾液酸类似物，可竞争性抑制流感神经氨酸酶，从而阻止病毒子代的释放。\n\n教育目标：\n灭活（灭活或成分）病毒疫苗主要针对细胞外病毒抗原产生体液免疫反应，阻止病毒进入细胞。相比之下，减毒活病毒疫苗除了提供体液免疫外，还可以产生强大的细胞介导免疫反应，可以杀死病毒感染的细胞。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of influenza vaccine types (inactivated vs. live attenuated) and the immune response generated by each. It assesses understanding of how inactivated vaccines stimulate antibody production to prevent viral entry, while live attenuated vaccines can also induce cell-mediated immunity.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the patient received an inactivated influenza vaccine. This type of vaccine primarily stimulates a humoral immune response, leading to the production of neutralizing antibodies that prevent viral entry into host cells. Therefore, the most likely outcome is inhibition of viral entry.",
