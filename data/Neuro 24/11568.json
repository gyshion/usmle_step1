    "en": "A 44-year-old man with a history of advanced HIV is brought to the office by his family due to progressive cognitive decline. Over the last several years he has had worsening memory deficits and difficulty carrying out simple mental tasks. The patient has had no headaches, slurred speech, muscle weakness, or changes in vision. He was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago, but his medical follow-up and treatment compliance have been poor. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Vital signs are normal. He has difficulty with delayed recall as well as several executive function tasks. The remainder of his neurologic examination is unremarkable. Two weeks later, he dies from severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. Which of the following histopathologic findings would most likely be found on biopsy of this patient's brain?",

    "en": "This patient with a history of long-standing HIV infection, medical noncompliance, and progressive cognitive decline likely had HIV-associated dementia. Most cases occur in those with advanced HIV who have CD4 counts <200/mm³. Patients usually develop features of subcortical dementia, including attention or working memory deficits, executive dysfunction, and slow information processing.\nHIV enters the central nervous system via infected monocytes and establishes a productive infection in microglial cells (resident macrophages of the central nervous system) and blood-derived perivascular macrophages. Activation of these cells occurs in response to the infection, inflammatory cytokines, and HIV-derived proteins, which leads them to cluster around small areas of necrosis (forming microglial nodules) and fuse together to form multinucleated giant cells. Because HIV does not directly infect neurons, the underlying pathology of HIV-associated dementia is thought to stem from the release of neurotoxic compounds by these activated monocytes.\n(Choices A and B) Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is marked by beta-amyloid deposits in the walls of cortical blood vessels. This condition is usually asymptomatic but can be marked by intracerebral hemorrhage or Alzheimer dementia. Alzheimer dementia is also associated with neuritic (senile) plaques, which are extracellular deposits of beta-amyloid surrounded by dystrophic neurites; they stain positive with Congo red and are often located in the hippocampus. Alzheimer dementia is typically seen in older adults and is characterized by slowly progressive memory impairment and higher cortical dysfunction (eg, aphasia, agnosia, apraxia).\n(Choice C) Patients with rabies develop eosinophilic inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of neuronal cells (Negri bodies). Rabies is a neurotropic virus that is transmitted by the saliva of infected animals, usually via a bite wound. Patients classically develop fever, hydrophobia (fear of water), and pharyngeal spasms.\n(Choice E) Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant disorder that causes choreiform movement, psychiatric disturbances, and dementia. It is characterized by severe neuronal loss in the caudate nucleus.\n(Choice F) Lacunar infarctions cause slit-like white matter cavities with surrounding gliosis. Recurrent lacunar infarctions can result in vascular dementia, which is often characterized by sudden/stepwise cognitive decline and focal neurologic deficits. Patients with vascular dementia are typically older and usually have cardiovascular risk factors.",
    "zh": "该患者有长期HIV感染史、医疗依从性差和进行性认知能力下降，可能患有HIV相关性痴呆。大多数病例发生在CD4计数<200/mm³的晚期HIV患者中。患者通常会出现皮质下痴呆的特征，包括注意力或工作记忆缺陷、执行功能障碍和信息处理缓慢。\nHIV通过受感染的单核细胞进入中枢神经系统，并在小胶质细胞（中枢神经系统的常驻巨噬细胞）和血源性血管周巨噬细胞中建立有效的感染。这些细胞的激活是对感染、炎症细胞因子和HIV衍生蛋白的反应，导致它们聚集在小块坏死区域周围（形成小胶质细胞结节）并融合在一起形成多核巨细胞。由于HIV不直接感染神经元，HIV相关性痴呆的潜在病理被认为源于这些活化单核细胞释放的神经毒性化合物。\n（选项 A 和 B） 脑淀粉样血管病以皮质血管壁中的β-淀粉样蛋白沉积为特征。这种情况通常无症状，但可能以脑出血或阿尔茨海默病痴呆为特征。阿尔茨海默病痴呆也与神经炎性（老年斑）斑块有关，这些斑块是β-淀粉样蛋白的细胞外沉积物，周围有营养不良性神经突；它们用刚果红染色呈阳性，并且通常位于海马体。阿尔茨海默病痴呆通常见于老年人，其特征是缓慢进展的记忆力受损和高级皮质功能障碍（例如，失语症、失认症、失用症）。\n（选项 C） 狂犬病患者在神经元细胞的细胞质中形成嗜酸性包涵体（内基小体）。狂犬病是一种神经毒性病毒，通过受感染动物的唾液传播，通常通过咬伤伤口传播。患者通常会出现发烧、恐水症（怕水）和咽部痉挛。\n（选项 E） 亨廷顿病是一种常染色体显性遗传疾病，可引起舞蹈病样运动、精神障碍和痴呆。其特征是在尾状核中出现严重的神经元缺失。\n（选项 F） 腔隙性梗死导致裂隙样白质空腔伴周围神经胶质增生。反复发生的腔隙性梗死可导致血管性痴呆，其通常以突然/阶梯式认知能力下降和局灶性神经功能缺损为特征。血管性痴呆患者通常年龄较大，并且通常具有心血管危险因素。"
