    "en": "A 34-year-old man comes to the clinic due to frequent clumsiness. For the last 6 months, he has had repeated minor injuries from walking into doorways and stationary objects. The patient was also reprimanded at work for causing his supervisor to spill coffee when he bumped into her in the hallway. Medical history is notable for recurrent renal stones; following a subsequent diagnostic evaluation, the patient underwent definitive treatment with neck surgery 3 years ago. Family history is unavailable as the patient was adopted. Physical examination reveals bitemporal visual field defects. Cranial nerves, motor strength, and deep-tendon reflexes are otherwise normal. In addition to brain imaging, this patient should also be screened for which of the following tumors?",
    "zh": "一名34岁男性因经常笨拙来诊。在过去的6个月里，他因撞到门框和静止物体而反复受到轻微损伤。该患者还因在走廊里撞到主管导致主管洒出咖啡而被工作场所训斥。病史记录为反复肾结石；在随后的诊断评估后，患者于3年前接受了颈部手术的明确治疗。由于患者被收养，因此无法获得家族史。体格检查显示双颞视野缺损。脑神经、运动力量和深腱反射在其他方面均正常。除了脑部影像学检查外，该患者还应筛查以下哪种肿瘤？"

    "en": "Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is caused by mutations in the *MEN1* tumor suppressor gene and is characterized by tumors of the parathyroid gland, pituitary, and pancreas (the \"3 Ps\"). Primary hyperparathyroidism is often the initial manifestation and usually presents with asymptomatic hypercalcemia or renal stones. Prolactin-secreting adenomas (prolactinomas) are the most common pituitary tumors. In premenopausal women, prolactinomas typically present with metabolic symptoms (eg, menstrual irregularities, galactorrhea); in men and postmenopausal women they usually present later when tumor enlargement leads to mass effect symptoms such as headache or bitemporal visual field defects (causing clumsiness in this patient) due to compression of the optic chiasm.\n\nEntero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are the third major tumor type in MEN1. Gastrinoma (leading to Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) is the most common, followed by insulinoma and nonfunctional tumors. These tumors are often metastatic and are a frequent cause of tumor-related death in MEN1. This patient has visual field defects consistent with a pituitary mass lesion, which warrants cerebral imaging. In addition, he has a history of symptomatic hyperparathyroidism. Given these features of MEN1, he is also at increased risk for entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.\n\n(Choice A) Pheochromocytoma is an adrenal medullary tumor that occurs commonly in MEN2A and 2B. However, this patient's visual field defect suggests a pituitary tumor, which is more characteristic of MEN1 (not associated with pheochromocytoma).\n\n(Choice B) Primary bone tumors are not increased in *MEN1*, although malignant neuroendocrine tumors may occasionally metastasize to bone.\n\n(Choice C) The major inherited syndromes associated with breast cancer include *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* mutations (breast, ovarian, uterine/fallopian tube, pancreatic cancers). Less common syndromes include Cowden syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Hyperparathyroidism and pituitary tumors are not prominent manifestations of any of these syndromes and are more consistent with MEN1.\n\n(Choice D) Familial adenomatous polyposis is associated with an increased risk of colon cancer and with adrenal adenomas and thyroid cancer.\n\nEducational objective:\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome is characterized by tumors of the pituitary, parathyroid gland, and pancreas (the \"3 Ps\").",
    "zh": "1型多发性内分泌肿瘤 (MEN1) 由 *MEN1* 抑癌基因突变引起，其特征是甲状旁腺、垂体和胰腺的肿瘤（“3个P”）。原发性甲状旁腺功能亢进通常是最初的表现，通常表现为无症状的高钙血症或肾结石。泌乳素分泌腺瘤（催乳素瘤）是最常见的垂体肿瘤。在绝经前妇女中，催乳素瘤通常表现为代谢症状（例如，月经不规律、溢乳）；在男性和绝经后妇女中，它们通常在肿瘤增大导致压迫效应症状（如头痛或双颞视野缺损，导致该患者笨拙）时出现，这是由于视交叉压迫所致。\n\n肠胰神经内分泌肿瘤是MEN1中的第三大肿瘤类型。胃泌素瘤（导致佐林格-埃利森综合征）最常见，其次是胰岛素瘤和无功能性肿瘤。这些肿瘤通常发生转移，并且是MEN1中肿瘤相关死亡的常见原因。该患者有视野缺损，这与垂体占位性病变一致，因此需要进行脑部影像学检查。此外，他有症状性甲状旁腺功能亢进的病史。鉴于这些MEN1的特征，他还面临患肠胰神经内分泌肿瘤的风险增加。\n\n(选项A) 嗜铬细胞瘤是一种肾上腺髓质肿瘤，常见于MEN2A和2B。然而，该患者的视野缺损提示垂体肿瘤，这更符合MEN1的特征（与嗜铬细胞瘤无关）。\n\n(选项B) 原发性骨肿瘤在 *MEN1* 中并未增加，尽管恶性神经内分泌肿瘤有时会转移到骨骼。\n\n(选项C) 与乳腺癌相关的主要遗传综合征包括 *BRCA1* 和 *BRCA2* 突变（乳腺癌、卵巢癌、子宫/输卵管癌、胰腺癌）。不太常见的综合征包括Cowden综合征、Li-Fraumeni综合征和Peutz-Jeghers综合征。甲状旁腺功能亢进和垂体肿瘤不是这些综合征的突出表现，而更符合MEN1。\n\n(选项D) 家族性腺瘤性息肉病与结肠癌风险增加以及肾上腺腺瘤和甲状腺癌有关。\n\n教育目标：\n1型多发性内分泌肿瘤综合征的特征是垂体、甲状旁腺和胰腺的肿瘤（“3个P”）。"

It also tests the ability to recognize clinical manifestations of these tumors, such as bitemporal hemianopsia and renal stones.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the constellation of symptoms (bitemporal visual field defects and recurrent renal stones) as suggestive of MEN1.
