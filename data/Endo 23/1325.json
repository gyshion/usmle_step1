    "en": "A 19-year-old man comes to the office due to frequent episodes of disorientation, palpitations, tremulousness, and excessive sweating over the past 3 months. The symptoms resolve quickly after he drinks juice or a sweetened beverage. The patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at age 12. He takes short- and long-acting insulin and has had no dose changes in the past 2 years. The patient is a college student and reports increased stress due to his examination schedule and frequent travel with the school tennis team. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Vital signs and physical examination are within normal limits, but he has gained 3 kg (6.6 lb) since his last visit 4 months ago. Laboratory results include a hemoglobin A1c of 6.8%.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has frequent symptomatic HYPOGLYCEMIA—disorientation, sweating, and palpitations relieved by intake of glucose—despite making no changes to his established insulin regimen. Hypoglycemia is often induced in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus by inadvertent overdose of insulin or decreased carbohydrate intake (eg, skipped meal) but can also be triggered by INTENSIVE physical activity or exercise. Glucose uptake by skeletal muscle cells is mediated by glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4). GLUT-4 is translocated to cell membranes and transverse tubules (deep invaginations in the cell membrane) in response to insulin. GLUT-4 translocation also occurs during muscle contraction by an insulin-independent mechanism mediated by several cellular factors, including AMP-activated kinase, nitric oxide, and calcium-calmodulin-activated protein kinase. In normal individuals, overt hypoglycemia does not occur with exercise because a drop in blood glucose suppresses insulin release from the beta cells, and counterregulatory hormones (eg, glucagon) increase endogenous glucose production via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. However, patients taking exogenous insulin are vulnerable to exercise-induced hypoglycemia because insulin continues to be released from the injection site despite falling glucose levels. {{exhibit_1}}\n(Choice A) Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance cannot break down fructose. They develop hypoglycemia and vomiting after ingestion of fructose-containing foods. However, this condition typically presents at the age of weaning (when fructose is introduced), and patients often develop a protective diastase for sweets. Ingestion of a fructose-containing drink would worsen the hypoglycemia, not correct it.\n(Choices C and D) Significant stressors such as severe mental or emotional distress, sleep deprivation, infection, and pain tend to cause hyperglycemia rather than hypoglycemia due to increased production of counterregulatory hormones (eg, catecholamines, cortisol). These hormones raise the glucose level by increasing glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and decreasing pancreatic insulin secretion (in patients with residual islet cell function).\n(Choice E) Weight gain is associated with insulin resistance. Patients treated with insulin who gain weight usually develop hyperglycemia and require increased doses of insulin to maintain control of glucose.",
    "zh": "尽管患者的既定胰岛素治疗方案没有改变，但该患者经常出现有症状的低血糖症——定向力障碍、出汗和心悸，这些症状通过摄入葡萄糖得以缓解。1型糖尿病患者的低血糖症通常是由胰岛素无意过量或碳水化合物摄入减少（例如，漏餐）引起的，但也可能由剧烈的体力活动或运动触发。骨骼肌细胞对葡萄糖的摄取由葡萄糖转运蛋白4型（GLUT-4）介导。GLUT-4在对胰岛素的反应中易位到细胞膜和横向小管（细胞膜的深陷）中。GLUT-4的易位也发生在肌肉收缩期间，通过几种细胞因子介导的胰岛素非依赖性机制，包括AMP激活的激酶、一氧化氮和钙调蛋白激活的蛋白激酶。在正常人中，运动时不会发生明显的低血糖症，因为血糖下降会抑制胰岛β细胞释放胰岛素，并且对抗调节激素（例如，胰高血糖素）通过糖原分解和糖异生增加内源性葡萄糖的产生。然而，服用外源性胰岛素的患者容易发生运动引起的低血糖症，因为尽管血糖水平下降，但胰岛素仍会从注射部位持续释放。{{exhibit_1}}\n（选项A）患有遗传性果糖不耐受症的患者无法分解果糖。他们在摄入含果糖的食物后出现低血糖症和呕吐。然而，这种情况通常发生在断奶期（引入果糖时），并且患者通常会产生对甜食的保护性淀粉酶。摄入含果糖的饮料会加重低血糖症，而不是纠正它。\n（选项C和D）严重的应激源，如严重的精神或情绪困扰、睡眠不足、感染和疼痛，由于对抗调节激素（如儿茶酚胺、皮质醇）的产生增加，往往会导致高血糖症而不是低血糖症。这些激素通过增加糖原分解和糖异生并减少胰腺胰岛素分泌（在有残余胰岛细胞功能的患者中）来提高葡萄糖水平。\n（选项E）体重增加与胰岛素抵抗有关。用胰岛素治疗且体重增加的患者通常会发展为高血糖症，并且需要增加剂量的胰岛素以维持葡萄糖的控制。"
