    "en": "A 69-year-old hospitalized woman is evaluated for new-onset weakness of the right foot. The patient has a history of chronic hip pain due to osteoarthritis. Two days ago, she underwent left total hip arthroplasty under general anesthesia while in the right lateral decubitus position. Since the surgery, she has had difficulty moving her right foot. Other medical conditions include lumbar spinal stenosis, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a small ischemic stroke with no residual deficit. On examination of the right lower extremity, the patient is unable to dorsiflex the ankle, evert the foot, or extend the toes. Sensation is decreased over the dorsum of the right foot. Injury to which of the following structures is the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The common fibular (peroneal) nerve originates in the popliteal fossa as the lateral branch of the sciatic nerve. From there, it courses around the posterolateral head and lateral neck of the fibula before dividing into the deep and superficial fibular nerves:\n\n*   The superficial fibular nerve innervates the muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg, which primarily function to evert the foot. It also provides sensory innervation to the lateral lower leg and dorsum of the foot.\n*   The deep fibular nerve innervates the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg, which function primarily to dorsiflex the foot and toes. It also provides sensory innervation to the region between the first and second toes.\n\nThe common fibular nerve's superficial location at the level of the proximal fibula and the bony prominence of the fibular head leave the nerve particularly susceptible to compression from a leg cast or prolonged positioning in the lateral decubitus position (eg, during surgical procedures). Common fibular neuropathy characteristically presents with deficits involving the deep fibular (eg, weakness of foot dorsiflexion and toe extension) and superficial fibular (eg, weakness of foot eversion, sensory loss over the dorsal foot) nerves (Choice B). {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice C) Although the femoral nerve is rarely affected during hip replacement, this injury would result in weakness on hip flexion and knee extension, along with sensory loss over the anterior thigh.\n\n(Choice D) The lateral sural cutaneous nerve is a branch of the common fibular nerve that provides sensory innervation to the posterolateral lower leg; it does not provide motor innervation.\n\n(Choice E) Irritation of the lumbosacral spinal nerve roots can cause variable sensorimotor deficits due to involvement of multiple myotomes and dermatomes. This patient's sensorimotor findings are specific for common fibular nerve injury.\n\n(Choice F) The most common cause of proximal sciatic nerve injury is trauma or surgery involving the hip joint. However, sciatic nerve injury causes deficits in the common fibular, tibial, and sural nerve distributions, with loss of sensation over the posterior leg and weakness involving the hamstrings and most of the muscles of the lower leg.\n\n(Choice G) The tibial nerve can be injured at the knee by trauma or compression (eg, Baker cyst in the popliteal fossa). Proximal tibial neuropathy usually causes weakness of foot plantar flexion and decreased sensation over the sole.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe common fibular nerve is superficially located at the proximal fibula, leaving it vulnerable to injury by compression by the fibular head (eg, prolonged lying on the affected side). Patients typically have weakness of foot dorsiflexion (ie, footdrop), foot eversion, and toe extension, along with sensory loss over the lateral lower leg and dorsal foot. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "腓总神经起源于腘窝，是坐骨神经的侧支。然后，它绕过腓骨后外侧头和腓骨颈外侧，然后分为深腓神经和腓浅神经：\n\n*   腓浅神经支配小腿外侧间隔的肌肉，其主要功能是使足外翻。它还为小腿外侧和足背提供感觉神经支配。\n*   深腓神经支配小腿前间隔的肌肉，其主要功能是背屈足和脚趾。它还为第一和第二脚趾之间的区域提供感觉神经支配。\n\n腓总神经在腓骨近端水平的浅表位置和腓骨头的骨性隆起使得该神经特别容易受到来自腿部石膏或长时间的侧卧位（例如，在手术过程中）的压迫。腓总神经病变的特征性表现为涉及深腓神经（例如，足背屈和脚趾伸展无力）和腓浅神经（例如，足外翻无力，足背感觉丧失）的缺陷 (选项 B)。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项 C) 尽管股神经很少在髋关节置换术中受到影响，但这种损伤会导致髋屈和膝伸无力，以及大腿前部感觉丧失。\n\n(选项 D) 腓肠外侧皮神经是腓总神经的一个分支，为小腿后外侧提供感觉神经支配；它不提供运动神经支配。\n\n(选项 E) 腰骶神经根受刺激可引起可变的感觉运动功能障碍，这与涉及多个肌节和皮节有关。该患者的感觉运动发现特定于腓总神经损伤。\n\n(选项 F) 近端坐骨神经损伤最常见的原因是累及髋关节的创伤或手术。然而，坐骨神经损伤会导致腓总神经、胫神经和腓肠神经的分布缺陷，伴有小腿后部感觉丧失和腘绳肌以及小腿大部分肌肉无力。\n\n(选项 G) 胫神经可在膝盖处因外伤或压迫而受损（例如，腘窝的贝克囊肿）。近端胫神经病通常会导致足跖屈无力和足底感觉减退。\n\n教学目标：\n腓总神经位于腓骨近端，容易受到腓骨头的压迫损伤（例如，长时间侧卧）。患者通常表现为足背屈无力（即足下垂）、足外翻和脚趾伸展无力，以及小腿外侧和足背感觉丧失。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of common fibular nerve (peroneal nerve) injury, its anatomical course, and the resulting clinical presentation of motor and sensory deficits. It also requires differentiating this neuropathy from other nerve injuries in the lower extremity.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's risk factors (prolonged lateral decubitus position during surgery), identify the specific motor and sensory deficits (weakness of dorsiflexion, eversion, toe extension, and dorsal foot sensory loss), and correlate these findings with the anatomical distribution of the common fibular nerve.",
