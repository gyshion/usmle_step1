    "en": "A 28-year-old man comes to the office due to occasional anxiety attacks over the past 6 months. The patient describes episodes that \"come out of nowhere\" in which he feels light-headed, sweaty, shaky, and nauseated. He says, \"At first I didn't really care because the attacks don't last long, but now I'm worried I'll have one while I'm at work or when I'm driving.\" The patient has no history of cardiac disease and takes no medications. He has 4 or 5 alcoholic drinks 3 times a week and adds, \"Having some beers and watching football really help take my mind off of things.\" The patient appears calm, and vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination, ECG, comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests show no abnormalities.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's recurrent, unexpected anxiety attacks and physical symptoms of dizziness, sweating, shaking, and nausea without an identifiable medical cause are consistent with PANIC DISORDER. Affected patients usually worry about having future attacks, as in this case, and frequently develop avoidance behaviors and agoraphobia.\n\nTreatment options for panic disorder include antidepressants and/or cognitive-behavioral therapy. Among the antidepressants, SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are the preferred first-line therapy because of their relatively benign adverse effect profile compared with that of monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants (Choices C and F).\n\nBenzodiazepines are also effective in panic disorder and have a more rapid onset of action. However, because of the risks for abuse and addiction, they are typically reserved for short-term use in acutely symptomatic and functionally impaired patients who require rapid relief. They should be avoided in patients with a history of or high risk for substance misuse, such as this patient (Choice A).\n\n(Choice B) Although this patient has prominent physical symptoms, beta blockers as monotherapy are not effective in panic disorder. They can be used to treat the physiologic manifestations of performance anxiety.\n\n(Choice D) There is no evidence to support the use of antipsychotics as monotherapy for panic disorder.\n\nEducational objective: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are first-line pharmacotherapy for panic disorder. Benzodiazepines are reserved for patients who require immediate relief but should be avoided in those with substance misuse.",
    "zh": "该患者反复出现、无法预料的焦虑发作，以及伴有头晕、出汗、颤抖和恶心等躯体症状，但没有明确的医学病因，这与恐慌症相符。受影响的患者通常会担心未来会再次发作，就像本例一样，并且经常出现回避行为和广场恐惧症。\n\n恐慌症的治疗方案包括抗抑郁药和/或认知行为疗法。在抗抑郁药中，选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂(SSRIs)或5-羟色胺-去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂是首选的一线治疗方法，因为与单胺氧化酶抑制剂和三环类抗抑郁药(选项C和F)相比，它们的副作用较轻。\n\n苯二氮卓类药物对恐慌症也有效，并且起效更快。然而，由于存在滥用和成瘾的风险，它们通常保留用于需要快速缓解的急性有症状和功能受损的患者的短期使用。应避免用于有物质滥用史或高风险的患者，如本例患者(选项A)。\n\n(选项B) 尽管该患者有明显的躯体症状，但β受体阻滞剂作为单药治疗对恐慌症无效。它们可用于治疗与表现焦虑相关的生理表现。\n\n(选项D) 没有证据支持将抗精神病药作为单药治疗用于恐慌症。\n\n教育目标：选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂是恐慌症的一线药物治疗。苯二氮卓类药物保留用于需要立即缓解的患者，但应避免用于有物质滥用的患者。"
