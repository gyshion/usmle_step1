    "en": "A 13-year-old boy is brought to the clinic due to breast development. Two months ago, the parents first noticed bilateral breast buds, which have slowly enlarged. Height is 151 cm (59.4 in) and weight is 37.5 kg (82.7 lb), corresponding to the 25th and 15th percentiles, respectively. BMI is at the 16th percentile. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 106/64 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 16/min. Breast palpation reveals bilateral concentric, mobile, tender mounds of tissue deep to the areolas, one measuring 1.5 cm in diameter and the other measuring 2.5 cm. Genital examination is consistent with sexual maturity rating (Tanner stage) 1. Which of the following clinical features in this patient is most concerning for a pathological cause of the breast enlargement?",

    "en": "This adolescent has gynecomastia, which can be physiologic (most common in this age group) or pathologic. Physiologic (or pubertal) gynecomastia is caused by an imbalance of hormones that either stimulate or inhibit the development of breast tissue. During puberty in boys, androgens produced by the adrenal glands are peripherally aromatized to estrogens, providing a source of stimulatory hormones that are not yet counterbalanced by adult testosterone levels. This leads to physiologic development of breast tissue in over half of adolescent boys at Tanner stage 3-4 that can be unilateral or bilateral, asymmetric, and tender (Choices A, C, and D). Physiologic gynecomastia is benign and typically resolves within a year.\n\nIn contrast, clinical features that raise concern for pathologic gynecomastia include:\n\n*   Development before or after midpuberty (eg, Tanner stage 1 or 5)\n*   Rapid progression or size >4 cm\n*   Location eccentric to the nipple areolar complex\n*   Persistence for >3 years\n\nThis patient has no testicular enlargement or signs of adrenarche (eg, axillary hair, body odor) and is therefore prepubertal, warranting further evaluation for a pathologic source of stimulatory hormones (eg, exogenous medications, testicular/adrenal/pituitary tumor). {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice B) Patients with elevated BMI are at risk for both pseudogynecomastia (fatty infiltration of the breast) as well as true gynecomastia due to increased activity of aromatase in obese males. This patient has a normal BMI.\n\nEducational objective:\nAdolescent gynecomastia is often physiologic due to an imbalance of estrogens and testosterone in early puberty. Features suggestive of pathologic gynecomastia include onset before or after midpuberty (no secondary sexual characteristics), findings consistent with systemic illness (eg, goiter), as well as size >4 cm, rapid progression, and location eccentric to the nipple areolar complex. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "这位青少年患有男性乳房发育症，这可以是生理性的（在这种年龄组中最常见）或病理性的。生理性（或青春期）男性乳房发育症是由刺激或抑制乳房组织发育的激素失衡引起的。在男孩青春期，肾上腺产生的雄激素在外周芳香化酶的作用下转化为雌激素，提供了尚未被成人睾酮水平抵消的刺激性激素的来源。这导致在Tanner分期3-4期的超过一半的青春期男孩中乳房组织生理性发育，可以是单侧或双侧的，不对称的，并且触痛（选项A、C和D）。生理性男性乳房发育症是良性的，通常在一年内消退。\n\n相比之下，引起对病理性男性乳房发育症关注的临床特征包括：\n\n*   在青春期中期之前或之后发育（例如，Tanner分期1或5）\n*   快速进展或大小>4厘米\n*   位置偏离乳头乳晕复合体\n*   持续时间超过3年\n\n该患者没有睾丸增大或肾上腺功能初现的迹象（例如，腋毛，体味），因此处于青春期前期，需要进一步评估刺激性激素的病理来源（例如，外源性药物，睾丸/肾上腺/垂体肿瘤）。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项B）BMI升高的患者由于肥胖男性中芳香化酶活性增加，既有假性男性乳房发育症（乳房脂肪浸润）的风险，也有真性男性乳房发育症的风险。该患者的BMI正常。\n\n教育目标：\n青少年男性乳房发育症通常是生理性的，是由于青春期早期雌激素和睾酮失衡所致。提示病理性男性乳房发育症的特征包括在青春期中期之前或之后发病（无第二性征），与全身性疾病相符的发现（例如，甲状腺肿），以及大小>4厘米，快速进展，以及位置偏离乳头乳晕复合体。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to differentiate between physiologic and pathologic gynecomastia in an adolescent male, focusing on clinical features that suggest an underlying pathological cause. It requires knowledge of pubertal development and hormonal influences on breast tissue.\n\nThe best approach is to identify features in the patient's presentation that deviate from typical physiologic gynecomastia, such as onset before midpuberty (Tanner stage 1 or 5), rapid progression, large size (>4 cm), or eccentric location. Recognizing these red flags helps prioritize further evaluation for potential underlying causes.",
