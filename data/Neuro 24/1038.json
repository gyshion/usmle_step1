    "en": "A 2-month-old boy is brought to the clinic for irritability, poor feeding, and frequent vomiting. Weight is at the 15th percentile, and head circumference is at the 96th percentile. Lung sounds are clear throughout, and heart auscultation reveals no murmurs. The abdomen is soft and nondistended. There is hepatosplenomegaly. Diffusely reduced muscle tone is present in all extremities. Funduscopy reveals white-yellow chorioretinal lesions in both eyes. MRI of the brain shows enlarged ventricles and scattered intracranial calcifications.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with hydrocephalus, intracranial calcifications, and chorioretinal lesions has the classic triad of findings for CONGENITAL TOXOPLASMOSIS. Congenital infections (eg, TORCH infections [Toxoplasmosis, Other infections, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex]) are acquired in utero due to TRANSPLACENTAL TRANSMISSION from an infected mother. Maternal infection may be asymptomatic or mild but can severely affect the fetus, particularly when contracted early in pregnancy.\n\nProlonged inflammation of the CNS during fetal development can lead to chronic inflammatory findings such as INTRACRANIAL CALCIFICATIONS. Obstructive HYDROCEPHALUS can also occur, as seen in this patient with ventriculomegaly, enlarged head circumference, and signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, vomiting, hypotonia). Chronic chorioretinal inflammation (ie, CHIORIORETINITIS) produces white-yellow RETINAL SCARS that are visible on funduscopy.\n\nOther nonspecific findings that may raise suspicion for in utero infection include growth restriction, hepatosplenomegaly (due to fetal reticuloendothelial activation), and rash.\n\n(Choices A and E) Although chromosomal abnormalities and single gene defects can lead to congenital disorders associated with neurologic abnormalities, chorioretinitis is highly associated with infection, particularly when presenting with the classic triad of features for toxoplasmosis.\n\n(Choice B) Intrapartum transmission of certain bacteria (eg, group B Streptococcus) or viruses (eg, herpes simplex virus) can cause meningitis or encephalitis beyond the neonatal period, and presentation can include irritability, poor feeding, vomiting, and hypotonia. However, fever would be expected, and chorioretinal lesions would not be seen.\n\n(Choice D) Postpartum infection with pathogens such as Toxoplasma and cytomegalovirus is often asymptomatic or can cause mild, self-limited fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy. Late findings of prolonged infection and inflammation (eg, intracranial calcifications, chorioretinitis) typically occur only with intrauterine infection.\n\nEducational objective: Congenital toxoplasmosis is an infection acquired in utero that can present with hydrocephalus, intracranial calcifications, and chorioretinitis due to prolonged CNS inflammation.",
    "zh": "这位患有脑积水、颅内钙化和脉络视网膜病变的患者具有先天性弓形虫病的典型三联征表现。先天性感染（例如，TORCH感染[弓形虫病、其他感染、风疹、巨细胞病毒和单纯疱疹病毒]）由于受感染母亲的经胎盘传播而在子宫内获得。母亲感染可能无症状或轻微，但会严重影响胎儿，尤其是在妊娠早期感染时。\n\n胎儿发育过程中CNS的长期炎症可导致慢性炎症表现，如颅内钙化。阻塞性脑积水也可能发生，如该患者所见，表现为脑室扩大、头围增大和颅内压增高征象（例如，呕吐、肌张力减低）。慢性脉络视网膜炎症（即，脉络视网膜炎）产生黄白色视网膜瘢痕，可在眼底镜检查中看到。\n\n其他可能引起对宫内感染怀疑的非特异性发现包括生长受限、肝脾肿大（由于胎儿网状内皮激活）和皮疹。\n\n（选项 A 和 E）虽然染色体异常和单基因缺陷可导致与神经系统异常相关的先天性疾病，但脉络视网膜炎与感染高度相关，尤其是在出现弓形虫病经典三联征表现时。\n\n（选项 B）某些细菌（例如，B族链球菌）或病毒（例如，单纯疱疹病毒）的分娩期传播可导致新生儿期后的脑膜炎或脑炎，表现可包括烦躁、喂养不良、呕吐和肌张力减低。然而，预期会出现发热，但不会看到脉络视网膜病变。\n\n（选项 D）产后感染病原体，如弓形虫和巨细胞病毒，通常无症状或可引起轻度、自限性发热、皮疹和淋巴结病。长期感染和炎症的晚期发现（例如，颅内钙化、脉络视网膜炎）通常仅发生在宫内感染中。\n\n教育目标：先天性弓形虫病是一种在子宫内获得的感染，可因CNS长期炎症而表现为脑积水、颅内钙化和脉络视网膜炎。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of congenital infections, specifically the clinical presentation and etiology of congenital toxoplasmosis. It requires differentiating between various causes of congenital neurological and ocular abnormalities.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the classic triad of hydrocephalus, intracranial calcifications, and chorioretinitis as highly suggestive of congenital toxoplasmosis. This then leads to identifying in utero infection as the most likely cause, distinguishing it from other infectious routes or genetic etiologies.",
