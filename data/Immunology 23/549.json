    "en": "A 28-year-old woman is treated with high-dose prednisone for severe lupus nephritis. Several hours after therapy is initiated, she becomes very agitated and delusional. Blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg and heart rate is 110/min. A basic metabolic profile, complete blood cell (CBC) count, and urinalysis are obtained. The CBC differential is expected to show an increase in which of the following as a result of this patient's therapy?",

    "en": "As a result of their immunosuppressive effects, corticosteroids such as prednisone have been used to treat many autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus. However, corticosteroid use can lead to a number of adverse effects. High doses can sometimes cause corticosteroid-induced psychosis (confusion, hallucinations), as seen in this patient; hypoalbuminemia is a risk factor, and the neuropsychiatric symptoms typically resolve with discontinuation of therapy.\n\nCorticosteroid receptors also have widespread physiologic effects, including those on circulating leukocytes and vascular endothelial cells. NEUTROPHIL counts increase following administration of the drug as a result of \"demargination\" of neutrophils previously attached to the vessel wall. Therefore, neutrophil recruitment to fight infection in tissues is decreased, potentially contributing to increased infection risk.\n\n(Choice A) Corticosteroids reduce basophil count, which decreases local inflammatory responses by preventing histamine release.\n\n(Choice B) Eosinophil counts decrease significantly with administration of corticosteroids (an effect previously used as the basis for a bioassay for corticosteroids). These drugs are used in allergic conditions as they reduce the eosinophil count and therefore the release of mediators from the eosinophils.\n\n(Choice C) Corticosteroids reduce peripheral lymphocyte counts within minutes as a result of inhibition of immunoglobulin synthesis, stimulation of lymphocyte apoptosis, and lymphocyte redistribution (from the intravascular compartment to the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow). T lymphocyte counts are typically reduced to a greater degree than B lymphocyte counts.\n\n(Choice D) Corticosteroids inhibit peripheral extravasation of monocytes and macrophages and decrease antigen presentation by macrophages and dendritic cells. Blood monocyte levels drop after corticosteroid administration due to redistribution to lymphoid tissues.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe acute effects of corticosteroids on the white blood cell count include an increased neutrophil count and decreased lymphocyte, monocyte, basophil, and eosinophil counts. The increase in the neutrophil count results from \"demargination\" of neutrophils previously attached to the vessel wall.",
    "zh": "由于其免疫抑制作用，皮质类固醇如泼尼松已被用于治疗许多自身免疫性和炎症性疾病，包括系统性红斑狼疮。然而，使用皮质类固醇会导致许多不良反应。高剂量有时会导致皮质类固醇诱发的精神病（意识模糊、幻觉），如该患者所示；低白蛋白血症是一个危险因素，神经精神病学症状通常在停用治疗后消退。\n\n皮质类固醇受体也有广泛的生理效应，包括对循环白细胞和血管内皮细胞的影响。使用该药物后，中性粒细胞计数增加，这是由于先前附着在血管壁上的中性粒细胞的“去边缘化”所致。因此，中性粒细胞募集到组织中对抗感染减少，这可能导致感染风险增加。\n\n(选项A) 皮质类固醇减少嗜碱性粒细胞计数，通过防止组胺释放来减少局部炎症反应。\n\n(选项B) 嗜酸性粒细胞计数在使用皮质类固醇后显着降低（这种影响以前被用作皮质类固醇生物测定的基础）。这些药物用于过敏性疾病，因为它们减少了嗜酸性粒细胞计数，从而减少了嗜酸性粒细胞的介质释放。\n\n(选项C) 皮质类固醇可在几分钟内降低外周淋巴细胞计数，这是由于抑制免疫球蛋白合成、刺激淋巴细胞凋亡和淋巴细胞重新分布（从血管内室到脾脏、淋巴结和骨髓）。T淋巴细胞计数通常比B淋巴细胞计数降低更多。\n\n(选项D) 皮质类固醇抑制单核细胞和巨噬细胞的外周外渗，并减少巨噬细胞和树突状细胞的抗原呈递。由于重新分布到淋巴组织，皮质类固醇给药后血液单核细胞水平下降。\n\n教育目标：\n皮质类固醇对白细胞计数的急性影响包括中性粒细胞计数增加以及淋巴细胞、单核细胞、嗜碱性粒细胞和嗜酸性粒细胞计数减少。中性粒细胞计数的增加是由于先前附着在血管壁上的中性粒细胞的“去边缘化”所致。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the effects of corticosteroid therapy on white blood cell counts, specifically the phenomenon of neutrophil demargination. It also assesses understanding of the immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids and their impact on different leukocyte populations.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that corticosteroids cause neutrophil demargination, leading to an increase in circulating neutrophils. Eliminate options that describe a decrease in cell counts (basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes) and select the option that indicates an increase in neutrophils.",
