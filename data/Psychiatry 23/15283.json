    "en": "A 35-year-old man comes to the office due to problems with irritability, anxiety, and low self-esteem. He was recently fired due to poor work performance at his data entry job and worries about finding a new job and supporting himself. The patient is currently in a relationship but mentions that his girlfriend is upset by his frequent lateness and forgetfulness and has threatened to leave him. Further history indicates that his problems are long-standing and date back to childhood when he had behavioral problems in school. The patient frequently feels overwhelmed due to being disorganized. He frequently procrastinates, is bored easily at work, and jumps to another project before completing what he is working on. The patient drinks 3 or 4 beers a week and smokes marijuana twice a month. On mental status examination, he is cooperative and talkative but appears tense, restless, and easily distracted.",

    "en": "This patient's disorganization, forgetfulness, excessive procrastination, difficulty completing tasks, irritability, restlessness, and distractibility are suggestive of adult ATTENTION-DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD). Evidence of behavioral problems since childhood (some symptoms prior to age 12 are required) and the chronic nature of his difficulties further support this diagnosis. ADHD frequently persists into ADULTHOOD and may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed as an anxiety, mood, or personality disorder.\n\nAlthough the same diagnostic criteria are used, adults with ADHD are LESS OVERTLY hyperactive compared to children. They typically experience a sense of inner restlessness, irritability, impulsive speech, and decision making and executive skills dysfunction (eg, difficulties in organizing/prioritizing tasks, lack of follow-through, forgetfulness, poor time management) that can result in significant social and occupational impairment (eg, unemployment, reduced productivity, relationship difficulties). Stimulant medication is the first-line treatment for adult ADHD.\n\n(Choice A) Adjustment disorder is diagnosed when symptoms occur in response to a stressor and do not meet the criteria for another mental disorder. This patient's symptoms and impairment are long-standing and are likely the cause of his employment and relationship difficulties.\n\n(Choice C) Bipolar disorder is differentiated from ADHD in adults by an episodic course consisting of discrete periods of severe manic or depressive symptoms. Although mood instability, impulsivity, restlessness, and talkativeness are seen in both disorders, this patient has a chronic (not episodic) illness and lacks other bipolar symptoms.\n\n(Choice D) Patients with borderline personality disorder also exhibit emotional dysregulation and impulsivity, but this patient lacks the identity disturbance and recurrent suicidal behaviors that characterize this disorder.\n\n(Choice E) Generalized anxiety disorder involves excessive anxiety about multiple issues. This patient's anxiety is related to realistic worries about his job situation.\n\n(Choice F) Patients with ADHD often struggle with poor self-esteem due to years of underachievement and may experience comorbid depression. However, this patient does not have sufficient depressive symptoms to diagnose persistent depressive disorder.\n\n(Choice G) The amount and extent of this patient's alcohol and marijuana use are insufficient to explain his symptoms and lifelong impairment.\n\nEducational objective:\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often persists into adulthood. Adults with ADHD are less overtly hyperactive but experience chronic problems with distractibility, disorganization, and impulsivity that cause significant social and occupational impairment.",
    "zh": "该患者的缺乏条理、健忘、过度拖延、难以完成任务、易怒、烦躁和注意力分散提示成人注意力缺陷多动障碍（ADHD）。自童年以来就存在行为问题（需要12岁之前出现某些症状）的证据以及他问题的慢性性质进一步支持了这一诊断。ADHD经常持续到成年，并且可能未被识别或被误诊为焦虑症、情绪障碍或人格障碍。\n\n尽管使用相同的诊断标准，但患有ADHD的成年人与儿童相比，外显性多动较少。他们通常会感到内在的烦躁、易怒、冲动性言语以及决策和执行技能功能障碍（例如，组织/优先处理任务困难、缺乏贯彻执行能力、健忘、时间管理不善），这可能导致严重的社会和职业损害（例如，失业、生产力下降、人际关系困难）。兴奋剂药物是成人ADHD的一线治疗。\n\n(选项A) 适应障碍是在对压力源做出反应时出现症状，并且不符合其他精神障碍的标准时诊断的。该患者的症状和损害由来已久，很可能是导致其就业和人际关系困难的原因。\n\n(选项C) 双相情感障碍与成人ADHD的区别在于，其病程呈发作性，由严重的躁狂或抑郁症状的离散时期组成。尽管情绪不稳定、冲动、烦躁和健谈在两种疾病中均可见，但该患者患有慢性（非发作性）疾病，并且缺乏其他双相情感障碍症状。\n\n(选项D) 边缘型人格障碍患者也会表现出情绪失调和冲动，但该患者缺乏这种疾病的特征性身份障碍和反复自杀行为。\n\n(选项E) 广泛性焦虑症涉及对多个问题的过度焦虑。该患者的焦虑与对他工作情况的现实担忧有关。\n\n(选项F) 患有ADHD的患者往往由于多年来的学业成绩不佳而导致自卑，并且可能伴有合并抑郁症。然而，该患者没有足够的抑郁症状来诊断持续性抑郁障碍。\n\n(选项G) 该患者的饮酒量和吸食大麻的程度不足以解释他的症状和终身损害。\n\n教育目标：\n注意力缺陷多动障碍（ADHD）经常持续到成年。患有ADHD的成年人外显性多动较少，但会遇到慢性注意力分散、缺乏条理和冲动问题，这些问题会导致严重的社会和职业损害。"

It emphasizes the chronic nature of ADHD and its impact on social and occupational functioning.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully evaluate the patient's lifelong history of behavioral issues, current symptoms of inattention, disorganization, procrastination, and restlessness, and consider how these symptoms align with the diagnostic criteria for ADHD while ruling out other potential diagnoses based on their specific features.",
