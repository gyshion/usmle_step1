  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient has decreased activity of erythrocyte transketolase (ETKA), a thiamine-dependent enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway. This finding is essentially diagnostic for thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. The primary risk factor for thiamine deficiency is malnutrition; in this case, gastric bypass surgery without appropriate micronutrient supplementation likely led to maternal thiamine deficiency and, in turn, to deficiency in this exclusively breastfed infant.\n\nIn addition to involvement in transketolase activity, thiamine is a cofactor for other enzymes involved in glucose metabolism (eg, 2-carbon transfer, decarboxylation), including alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase (converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA). Impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase activity diverts pyruvate to the anaerobic glycolysis pathway, which produces lactate. Lactic acidosis leads to decreased peripheral vascular resistance, which contributes to the classic finding of high-output heart failure. However, over time, direct impairment of myocyte energy production leads to reduced cardiac contractility and a low-output state.\n\nMyocardial dysfunction due to thiamine deficiency is referred to as wet beriberi. Infantile beriberi is rare but often fulminant, with symptoms related to pulmonary/systemic fluid overload, including feeding intolerance and respiratory distress, as well as cardiomegaly and hepatomegaly, as seen in this patient. Wet beriberi can be fatal without prompt thiamine supplementation.\n\n(Choice A) Alpha-1,4-glucosidase deficiency (Pompe disease) causes cardiomegaly due to glycogen accumulation in myocytes; heart failure can lead to hepatomegaly. Infants typically have profound weakness and hypotonia, findings not present in this patient. Moreover, ETKA and lactate would be normal.\n\n(Choice B) Alpha-L-iduronidase deficiency (Hurler syndrome) results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans and often presents with hepatomegaly; heart failure can also occur. In contrast to this patient, characteristic coarse facial features and recurrent respiratory infections are expected; serum lactate and ETKA would be normal.\n\n(Choice C) Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency (galactosemia) results in impaired galactose metabolism. Hepatomegaly and vomiting are common but typically develop in the first week of life and are associated with jaundice and hypotonia. ETKA would be normal.\n\n(Choice D) Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (von Gierke disease) results in accumulation of glycogen in the liver, causing hepatomegaly; lactic acidosis is common. However, cardiomegaly would not be seen, and ETKA would be normal.",
    "zh": "患者红细胞转酮醇酶（ETKA）活性降低，这是一种磷酸戊糖途径中依赖硫胺素的酶。这一发现基本上可以诊断为硫胺素（维生素 B1）缺乏症。硫胺素缺乏症的主要危险因素是营养不良；在这种情况下，胃旁路手术未进行适当的微量营养素补充，很可能导致母亲硫胺素缺乏症，进而导致纯母乳喂养的婴儿出现缺乏症。\n\n除了参与转酮醇酶活性外，硫胺素还是参与葡萄糖代谢的其他酶（例如，2-碳转移、脱羧）的辅助因子，包括α-酮戊二酸脱氢酶和丙酮酸脱氢酶（将丙酮酸转化为乙酰辅酶 A）。丙酮酸脱氢酶活性受损会将丙酮酸转移到无氧糖酵解途径，从而产生乳酸。乳酸性酸中毒导致外周血管阻力降低，这有助于高输出心力衰竭的典型发现。然而，随着时间的推移，心肌细胞能量产生的直接受损会导致心脏收缩力降低和低输出状态。\n\n由于硫胺素缺乏导致的心肌功能障碍被称为湿性脚气病。婴儿脚气病很少见，但通常病情急剧恶化，其症状与肺/全身液体超负荷有关，包括喂养不耐受和呼吸窘迫，以及该患者所见的心脏肥大和肝脏肿大。如果不及时补充硫胺素，湿性脚气病可能是致命的。\n\n（选项 A）α-1,4-葡萄糖苷酶缺乏症（庞贝病）由于糖原在心肌细胞中积累导致心脏肥大；心力衰竭可导致肝肿大。婴儿通常有严重的无力和肌张力减退，这些发现不出现在该患者身上。此外，ETKA 和乳酸水平将正常。\n\n（选项 B）α-L-艾杜糖醛酸酶缺乏症（赫勒综合征）会导致糖胺聚糖的积累，并且经常表现为肝肿大；也可能发生心力衰竭。与该患者相比，预计会出现特征性的粗糙面容和反复呼吸道感染；血清乳酸和 ETKA 将正常。\n\n（选项 C）半乳糖-1-磷酸尿苷转移酶缺乏症（半乳糖血症）导致半乳糖代谢受损。肝肿大和呕吐很常见，但通常发生在生命的头一周，并伴有黄疸和肌张力减退。ETKA 将正常。\n\n（选项 D）葡萄糖-6-磷酸酶缺乏症（冯·吉尔克病）导致肝脏中糖原积累，导致肝肿大；乳酸性酸中毒很常见。然而，不会出现心脏肥大，并且 ETKA 将正常。"

    "en": "A 2-month-old infant presents with irritability, vomiting, decreased urine output, respiratory distress, and an enlarged liver. The infant is exclusively breastfed. The mother has a history of obesity and gastric bypass surgery. The infant's temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 190/min, and respirations are 60/min. Chest radiography reveals cardiomegaly. Further work-up shows impaired carbohydrate metabolism with increased serum levels of lactate and decreased erythrocyte transketolase activity. The most likely additional enzyme with impaired activity is pyruvate dehydrogenase due to thiamine deficiency related to maternal malnutrition from gastric bypass.",
