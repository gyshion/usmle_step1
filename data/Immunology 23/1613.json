    "en": "A 55-year-old man with end-stage hepatitis C virus infection undergoes orthotopic liver transplantation from a deceased donor. The patient has no perioperative complications and is discharged from the hospital on appropriate immunosuppressant medications. One week after the surgery, he develops nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. Physical examination shows a painful maculopapular rash over his neck, back, and extremities that extends to the palms and soles. Endoscopic evaluation reveals multiple ulcerations of the intestinal mucosa. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current condition?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient most likely has graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a condition that usually occurs after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. However, GVHD can also occur following transplantation of organs rich in lymphocytes (eg, liver) or transfusion of non-irradiated blood.\n\nPatients affected by GVHD are generally severely immunodeficient due to the primary disease process or as a result of immunosuppressive medications. This allows immunocompetent donor T cells from the graft to survive and migrate into host tissues, where they recognize host MHC antigens as foreign and become sensitized. On activation, donor CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (not B cells) participate in host cell destruction (Choice A).\n\nAny organ may be a target of GVHD, but the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract are the most frequently affected. Early signs of GVHD include a diffuse maculopapular rash that has a predilection for the palms and soles and may desquamate in severe cases. GI tract involvement causes diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, and abdominal pain. Liver damage will manifest as abnormal liver function tests. In this case, the donated liver would not be significantly affected as the donor T cells perceive the liver as self.\n\n(Choices C and D) Acute and chronic graft rejections occur following host T and B cell sensitization against graft MHC antigens. The resulting immune response leads to graft failure without significant involvement of other organ systems. This patient's skin and GI findings make GVHD more likely.\n\n(Choice E) If the tissue recipient has antibodies against donor ABO antigens, hyperacute rejection will develop within minutes of transplantation. Spasm and occlusion of graft vessels occur, leading to ischemia and necrosis.\n\nEducational objective:\nGraft-versus-host disease can occur following transplantation of organs rich in lymphocytes (eg, liver). T lymphocytes found in the donor organ become sensitized against the MHC antigens of the recipient and subsequently attack the host's tissues. The skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract are most frequently affected.",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有移植物抗宿主病（GVHD），这是一种通常发生在异体骨髓移植术后的疾病。然而，GVHD也可能发生在富含淋巴细胞的器官（如肝脏）移植或输注未照射的血液之后。\n\n受GVHD影响的患者通常由于原发性疾病或免疫抑制药物而严重免疫缺陷。这使得来自移植物的具有免疫功能的供者T细胞得以存活并迁移到宿主组织中，在那里它们将宿主MHC抗原识别为异物并变得敏感。激活后，供者CD4+和CD8+ T细胞（而非B细胞）参与宿主细胞的破坏（选项A）。\n\n任何器官都可能成为GVHD的靶标，但皮肤、肝脏和胃肠道（GI）是最常受影响的。GVHD的早期体征包括弥漫性斑丘疹，其易于发生于手掌和足底，在严重情况下可能脱屑。胃肠道受累会导致腹泻、肠道出血和腹痛。肝损伤将表现为肝功能检查异常。在这种情况下，供肝不会受到显著影响，因为供者T细胞将肝脏视为自体。\n\n（选项C和D）在宿主T细胞和B细胞对移植物MHC抗原致敏后，会发生急性和慢性移植物排斥反应。由此产生的免疫反应导致移植物衰竭，而不会显著影响其他器官系统。该患者的皮肤和胃肠道表现使GVHD更有可能。\n\n（选项E）如果组织受者有针对供者ABO抗原的抗体，超急性排斥反应将在移植后数分钟内发生。移植物血管痉挛和闭塞发生，导致缺血和坏死。\n\n教育目标：\n移植物抗宿主病可能发生在富含淋巴细胞的器官（如肝脏）移植后。在供者器官中发现的T淋巴细胞对受者的MHC抗原变得敏感，随后攻击宿主的组织。皮肤、肝脏和胃肠道是最常受影响的。"
