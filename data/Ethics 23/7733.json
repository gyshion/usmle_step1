The patient greets the gastroenterologist and has a brief conversation before leaving. The hospitalist arrives to the cafeteria and says, \"I saw you talking to my old neighbor. He's a close family friend, and I heard that he has colon cancer. I've been really worried about him, especially since his wife had a stroke recently. Are you treating him?\"",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Confidentiality is a basic tenet of medical ethics and a prerequisite for a trusting physician-patient relationship. Physicians are ethically obligated to protect patient privacy and maintain confidentiality in most situations, including during interactions with other physicians who are not directly involved in the patient's medical care.\n\nThe hospitalist has asked the gastroenterologist whether a certain man, a former neighbor and close family friend, is being treated by the gastroenterologist. Because the inquiry is based on personal and not professional interest or medical necessity, the most appropriate response by the gastroenterologist is to avoid divulging the man's protected health information, such as his diagnosis, treatment, and whether he is, in fact, the gastroenterologist's patient (Choice A). Identifying the man as a patient and admitting to treating him could indirectly confirm a diagnosis of colon cancer, which is a breach of patient privacy because sharing this information is not medically necessary. Therefore, the most appropriate response is for the physician to state that they cannot say whether or not the patient is under their care.\n\n(Choice B) Although this statement does not directly admit to treating the patient, it insinuates that the patient has a serious medical diagnosis, which violates patient confidentiality. In addition, encouraging the hospitalist to \"check in\" with the patient is not advisable because the patient may not wish to share his diagnosis or receive support from others at this time.\n\n(Choice D) The gastroenterologist is not required to lie to protect patient confidentiality; a more neutral statement that neither confirms nor denies a therapeutic relationship with the patient is sufficient.\n\n(Choice E) To protect patient privacy, discussion of protected health information should take place in a private location rather than a public area (eg, cafeteria, elevator). However, because the hospitalist is not directly involved in the patient's care, the gastroenterologist cannot discuss whether or not the patient is receiving treatment.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatient confidentiality prohibits physicians from disclosing a patient's protected health information (eg, diagnosis, treatment) to anyone not directly involved in the patient's medical care, including physician colleagues. Physicians should not identify their patients when it is not medically necessary because doing so is a breach of patient privacy.",
    "zh": "保密是医学伦理学的一项基本原则，也是建立信任的医患关系的前提。在大多数情况下，医生在伦理上都有义务保护患者的隐私并维护保密性，包括与其他未直接参与患者医疗护理的医生进行互动时。\n\n住院医师问肠胃病学家，一个名叫某男士的、前邻居兼亲密家人朋友，是否正在接受肠胃病学家的治疗。因为询问是基于个人而非专业兴趣或医疗必要性，肠胃病学家的最合适的回应是避免透露该男士的受保护健康信息，例如他的诊断、治疗，以及他是否确实是肠胃病学家的病人（选项A）。将该男士确认为病人并承认正在治疗他，可能间接证实结肠癌的诊断，这违反了患者隐私，因为分享此信息不是医疗必需的。因此，医生最合适的回答是声明他们不能说病人是否正在接受他们的护理。\n\n（选项B）尽管此声明并未直接承认正在治疗病人，但它暗示病人有严重的医学诊断，这违反了患者的保密性。此外，鼓励住院医师与病人“核实”是不可取的，因为病人可能不希望分享他的诊断或此时接受来自他人的支持。\n\n（选项D）肠胃病学家不需要撒谎来保护患者的保密性；一个更中立的声明，既不证实也不否认与病人的治疗关系就足够了。\n\n（选项E）为了保护患者隐私，受保护的健康信息的讨论应在私人场所进行，而不是公共区域（例如，自助餐厅，电梯）。但是，由于住院医师未直接参与病人的护理，肠胃病学家不能讨论病人是否正在接受治疗。\n\n教育目标：\n患者保密性禁止医生向任何未直接参与患者医疗护理的人（包括医生同事）透露患者的受保护健康信息（例如，诊断、治疗）。医生不应在没有医疗必要的情况下识别他们的病人，因为这样做会违反患者隐私。"
