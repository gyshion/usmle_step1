    "en": "A 64-year-old man is being evaluated due to nagging right shoulder pain that radiates to the ipsilateral arm. The patient also has weakness in the right upper extremity. Symptoms started 2 months ago and have progressively worsened. He has a 40-pack-year smoking history. On neurologic examination, the patient is awake, alert, and oriented and follows commands. He has partial right-sided ptosis with fully intact extraocular movements. The pupils are asymmetric in dim light with 2 mm on the right and 4 mm on the left, but both are reactive to light. The right upper extremity has 3/5 strength and absent deep tendon reflexes. This patient's autonomic dysfunction is most likely caused by injury to which of the following structures?",

    "en": "This patient's smoking history, unilateral upper limb pain, and areflexic weakness with ipsilateral Horner syndrome (HS) (eg, ptosis, miosis) are highly suggestive of Pancoast tumor. Pancoast tumors are usually non-small cell lung cancers (eg, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma) that arise near the superior sulcus (groove produced by the subclavian artery). Clinical manifestations are determined by the extent of local spread:\n\n* Compression and invasion of the BRACHIAL PLEXUS can cause ipsilateral shoulder pain, upper limb paresthesia, and areflexic arm weakness (ie, lower motor neuron pattern due to a peripheral nerve).\n* Involvement of the CERVICAL SYMPATHETIC GANGLION, an AUTONOMIC GANGLION in the lower neck that carries sympathetic innervation to the eye, may lead to partial ptosis (denervation of superior tarsal muscle) and miosis (interruption of sympathetic fibers to the dilator pupillae muscle). Pupil asymmetry is more prominent in dim light because the increased sympathetic tone exacerbates the defect. Anhidrosis (loss of sweating) completes the classic HS triad.\n\n(Choice A) The first-order neuron of the sympathetic pathway to the eye begins in the hypothalamus, so a cortical lesion would not cause HS. Although cortical damage could cause unilateral weakness, it would have an upper motor neuron pattern (ie, increased deep tendon reflexes).\n\n(Choice B) Although a lesion in the hypothalamus (which is part of the subcortical gray matter) could conceivably lead to HS, it would not explain this patient's arm pain and weakness.\n\n(Choice C) Brainstem lesions can lead to HS because first-order sympathetic neurons descend in the lateral brainstem. However, brainstem lesions typically result in crossed signs (eg, contralateral body hemiparesis or sensory loss with ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits). In addition, upper (not lower) motor neuron weakness would be seen in the extremities.\n\n(Choice D) Although a spinal cord lesion could cause HS and unilateral weakness, the weakness would have an upper motor neuron pattern (ie, increased deep tendon reflexes) and likely impact all neurologic function below the level of the lesion (ie, the leg would also be impacted).\n\n(Choice F) A vagus nerve (CN X) lesion may cause ipsilateral paralysis of the soft palate, pharynx, and larynx, producing hoarseness, dysarthria, dysphagia, and loss of the gag reflex (efferent limb). CN X does not provide innervation to the eye or arm.\n\nEducational objective:\nA tumor of the lung apex (Pancoast tumor) can compress both the brachial plexus and the stellate ganglion of the sympathetic chain, leading to lower motor neuron arm weakness and ipsilateral Horner syndrome.",
    "zh": "该患者的吸烟史、单侧上肢疼痛以及伴有同侧Horner综合征(HS)（例如，眼睑下垂，瞳孔缩小）的无反射性无力高度提示Pancoast肿瘤。Pancoast肿瘤通常是非小细胞肺癌（例如，鳞状细胞癌、腺癌），起源于上沟（由锁骨下动脉产生的沟）附近。临床表现取决于局部扩散的程度：\n\n* 压迫和侵犯臂丛神经可引起同侧肩部疼痛、上肢感觉异常和无反射性手臂无力（即，由于周围神经引起的下运动神经元模式）。\n* 颈交感神经节（颈下部的一个自主神经节，携带对眼睛的交感神经支配）的受累可能导致部分眼睑下垂（上睑提肌去神经支配）和瞳孔缩小（交感神经纤维中断至瞳孔放大肌）。在昏暗的光线下，瞳孔不对称更加明显，因为交感神经张力增加会加剧这种缺陷。无汗症（无出汗）完成了经典的HS三联征。\n\n（选项A）通往眼睛的交感神经通路的第一个神经元起源于下丘脑，因此皮质病变不会引起HS。尽管皮质损伤可能导致单侧无力，但它将具有上运动神经元模式（即，深腱反射增强）。\n\n（选项B）尽管下丘脑（属于皮质下灰质）的病变可能导致HS，但它不能解释该患者的臂痛和无力。\n\n（选项C）脑干病变可导致HS，因为一级交感神经元在侧脑干中下降。然而，脑干病变通常会导致交叉征象（例如，对侧身体偏瘫或感觉丧失伴同侧颅神经缺陷）。此外，四肢会出现上（而非下）运动神经元无力。\n\n（选项D）尽管脊髓病变可能导致HS和单侧无力，但无力将具有上运动神经元模式（即，深腱反射增强），并且可能影响病变水平以下的所有神经功能（即，腿也会受到影响）。\n\n（选项F）迷走神经（CN X）病变可能导致软腭、咽和喉的同侧麻痹，引起声音嘶哑、构音障碍、吞咽困难和呕吐反射丧失（传出支）。CN X不为眼睛或手臂提供神经支配。\n\n教育目标：\n肺尖的肿瘤（Pancoast肿瘤）可以压迫臂丛神经和交感链的星状神经节，导致下运动神经元手臂无力和同侧Horner综合征。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of Horner syndrome and its association with Pancoast tumors, specifically identifying the anatomical structures involved in its pathogenesis. It requires correlating clinical signs and symptoms with potential underlying pathologies and their anatomical locations.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the triad of Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) and linking it with the patient's other symptoms of shoulder and arm pain and weakness. Considering the patient's smoking history, a Pancoast tumor is a strong differential diagnosis, and understanding how such a tumor affects adjacent structures like the sympathetic chain is key to identifying the correct answer.",
    "zh": "本题考察对Horner综合征的理解及其与Pancoast肿瘤的关系，特别是确定其发病机制中涉及的解剖结构。它需要将临床体征和症状与潜在的潜在病理及其解剖位置相关联。\n\n解决此问题的思路包括识别Horner综合征的三联征（眼睑下垂、瞳孔缩小、无汗症），并将其与患者的其他肩部和手臂疼痛以及无力的症状联系起来。考虑到患者的吸烟史，Pancoast肿瘤是一个强有力的鉴别诊断，了解这种肿瘤如何影响交感神经链等相邻结构是确定正确答案的关键。"
