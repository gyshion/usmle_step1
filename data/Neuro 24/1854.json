    "en": "A 6-month-old girl is brought to the clinic for a routine care appointment. The patient has had no illnesses, although the mother says that she has trouble latching when breastfeeding. She can roll over when prone but cannot roll from the supine position or sit unsupported. The patient was born vaginally after an uncomplicated pregnancy. Vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, she has a head circumference above the 97th percentile for age and a full anterior fontanelle. At birth, the patient's head circumference was at the 50th percentile. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. CT scan of the head reveals significant dilation of the lateral ventricles. {{exhibit_1}} If this patient's condition is left uncorrected, which of the following complications is most likely to develop?",
    "zh": "一名6个月大的女婴因常规护理预约前来就诊。患者没有患过疾病，但母亲说她在母乳喂养时有衔接困难。她俯卧时可以翻身，但不能从仰卧位翻身或无人支撑地坐着。患者在无并发症的妊娠后阴道分娩。生命体征在正常范围内。体格检查显示，她的头围高于同龄人的第97百分位数，前囟饱满。出生时，患者的头围在第50百分位数。其余体格检查无特殊。头部CT扫描显示侧脑室明显扩张。{{exhibit_1}} 如果不纠正该患者的病情，最有可能出现以下哪种并发症？"

    "en": "The patient presents with macrocephaly, a bulging fontanelle, and delayed gross motor milestones, which are consistent with CONGENITAL HYDROCEPHALUS. Hydrocephalus is caused by the abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, typically due to impaired drainage from structural malformations (eg, aqueductal stenosis, Chiari malformations, Dandy-Walker syndrome) or postinfectious fibrosis (eg, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, meningitis), or obstruction from intraventricular hemorrhage. The CT scan shows significant dilation of the lateral ventricles, confirming hydrocephalus. {{exhibit_2}} In infants, hydrocephalus typically leads to an enlarging head circumference (macrocephaly), developmental delay, and poor feeding. Increased intracranial pressure may not be obvious due to the open fontanelles allowing for skull expansion. Muscle spasticity and hyperreflexia can result from upper motor neuron injury caused by stretching of the periventricular pyramidal tracts due to the increased ventricular size. Seizures can also occur. Treatment involves surgical placement of a shunt, most commonly a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choice A) Lower extremity hyporeflexia would result from damage to the lower motor neurons; hydrocephalus impacts the upper motor neurons.\n(Choice B) A medulloblastoma can lead to compression of the cerebral aqueduct and result in obstructive hydrocephalus that spares the fourth ventricle. However, hydrocephalus does not predispose to development of medulloblastoma.\n(Choice C) Meningitis can lead to fibrosis that obstructs the flow of CSF and leads to hydrocephalus. Patients with implanted shunt devices are also at increased risk for meningitis. However, untreated hydrocephalus does not increase the risk for meningitis.\n(Choice E) Subarachnoid hemorrhage can cause inflammation and resulting fibrosis of the arachnoid granulations, leading to impaired resorption of CSF. Therefore, subarachnoid hemorrhage can be a cause, but not a consequence, of hydrocephalus. {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "患者表现出巨头畸形、前囟饱满和Gross运动里程碑延迟，这与先天性脑积水一致。脑积水是由脑脊液 (CSF) 在脑中异常积聚引起的，通常是由于结构畸形（例如，导水管狭窄、Chiari 畸形、Dandy-Walker 综合征）或感染后纤维化（例如，巨细胞病毒、弓形虫病、脑膜炎）引流受损，或室管内出血引起的阻塞。CT扫描显示侧脑室明显扩张，证实了脑积水。{{exhibit_2}} 在婴儿中，脑积水通常会导致头围增大（巨头畸形）、发育迟缓和喂养不良。由于开放的前囟允许颅骨扩张，颅内压增高可能不明显。肌肉痉挛和反射亢进可能是由于脑室周围锥体束的牵张导致上运动神经元损伤所致。也可能发生癫痫发作。治疗涉及手术放置分流器，最常见的是脑室腹腔分流器。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(选项A) 下肢反射减退将由下运动神经元的损伤引起；脑积水影响上运动神经元。\n(选项B) 髓母细胞瘤可导致大脑导水管受压，并导致不影响第四脑室的阻塞性脑积水。然而，脑积水并不会使人易患髓母细胞瘤。\n(选项C) 脑膜炎可导致纤维化，从而阻塞 CSF 的流动并导致脑积水。植入分流装置的患者也面临脑膜炎的风险增加。然而，未经治疗的脑积水不会增加脑膜炎的风险。\n(选项E) 蛛网膜下腔出血可引起炎症并导致蛛网膜颗粒的纤维化，从而导致 CSF 的再吸收受损。因此，蛛网膜下腔出血可能是脑积水的原因，而不是结果。{{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of congenital hydrocephalus, its clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and potential complications. It requires the integration of patient history, physical examination findings, and imaging results to diagnose the condition and predict its long-term sequelae.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key features suggestive of hydrocephalus, such as macrocephaly, bulging fontanelle, and ventricular dilation on imaging. Then, recall the pathophysiology of hydrocephalus and how increased intracranial pressure and ventricular enlargement can affect neurological structures, leading to complications like muscle spasticity.",
