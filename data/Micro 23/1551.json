    "en": "A 29-year-old woman comes to the office with malaise, fever, and extremely painful genital lesions. She has never had such symptoms before. She is sexually active with a new partner. On examination, the patient has several tiny, thin-walled vesicles on an erythematous base and exquisitely tender, shallow ulcers on the labia. Tender inguinal lymphadenopathy is present. Tzanck smear of the genital lesions shows multinucleated giant cells. A drug is prescribed that can be used to manage this acute episode and prevent future episodes of this patient's condition.",
    "zh": "一名29岁的女性前来就诊，主诉不适、发热以及极度疼痛的生殖器病变。她从未有过此类症状。她与一位新伴侣有性生活。体格检查显示，患者在红斑基底上出现数个细小的、薄壁的疱疹，并在阴唇上有极度触痛的浅表溃疡。存在腹股沟淋巴结肿大。生殖器病变的Tzanck涂片显示多核巨细胞。处方了一种药物，可用于控制此次急性发作并预防患者未来再次发作。"

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's new genital rash and positive Tzanck smear are consistent with a primary genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, likely due to HSV-2. ANTIVIRAL DRUGS for the treatment of primary genital herpes include acyclovir, valacyclovir (acyclovir prodrug with better oral bioavailability), and famciclovir. Acyclovir treatment during a primary episode can reduce duration of viral shedding, time to lesional healing, constitutional symptoms, and local pain. Chronic daily suppressive therapy (lower dose) can be used in patients who have recurrent episodes.\n\nIn infected host cells, acyclovir (a NUCLEOSIDE ANALOG) is converted into acyclovir monophosphate principally via virus-encoded thymidine kinase. Cellular enzymes then convert the monophosphate into acyclovir triphosphate, which competes with deoxyguanosine triphosphate for viral DNA polymerase. When acyclovir triphosphate becomes incorporated into the replicating viral DNA chain, viral DNA synthesis is terminated.\n\nAcyclovir does not significantly impact uninfected cells in vitro as uptake into these cells is poor, phosphorylation in the absence of viral thymidine kinase is minimal, and cellular α-DNA polymerase has significantly less affinity for acyclovir triphosphate than does viral DNA polymerase.\n\n(Choice B) Inhibition of viral protease activity is the mechanism of action for drugs such as indinavir, an antiretroviral used in HIV treatment.\n\n(Choice C) Prevention of virion release from infected cells is the mechanism of action for drugs such as neuraminidase inhibitors (eg, oseltamivir), which are used in the early treatment of influenza.\n\n(Choice D) Drugs such as enfuvirtide and maraviroc, antiretrovirals used in HIV treatment, prevent viral entry into the target cells. Docosanol, a topical agent that prevents viral entry, is sometimes used for herpes labialis, not genital HSV.\n\n(Choice E) Upregulation of interferon synthesis in infected cells is accomplished by many interleukins.\n\nEducational objective:\nAntiviral drugs currently recommended for the treatment of primary genital herpes include the nucleoside analogs (eg, acyclovir). These are incorporated into newly replicating viral DNA and ultimately terminate viral DNA chain synthesis.",
    "zh": "该患者的新发阴部皮疹和Tzanck涂片阳性与原发性生殖器单纯疱疹病毒（HSV）感染一致，很可能由HSV-2引起。用于治疗原发性生殖器疱疹的抗病毒药物包括阿昔洛韦、伐昔洛韦（阿昔洛韦的前药，具有更好的口服生物利用度）和泛昔洛韦。在原发性发作期间使用阿昔洛韦治疗可以缩短病毒脱落时间、病灶愈合时间、全身症状和局部疼痛。对于反复发作的患者，可以使用慢性每日抑制治疗（较低剂量）。\n\n在受感染的宿主细胞中，阿昔洛韦（一种核苷类似物）主要通过病毒编码的胸苷激酶转化为阿昔洛韦单磷酸。然后，细胞酶将单磷酸转化为阿昔洛韦三磷酸，后者与脱氧鸟苷三磷酸竞争病毒DNA聚合酶。当阿昔洛韦三磷酸掺入复制的病毒DNA链中时，病毒DNA合成终止。\n\n阿昔洛韦对体外未感染细胞没有显著影响，因为这些细胞的摄取较差，在没有病毒胸苷激酶的情况下磷酸化作用很小，并且细胞α-DNA聚合酶对阿昔洛韦三磷酸的亲和力远低于病毒DNA聚合酶。\n\n（选项B）抑制病毒蛋白酶活性是诸如印地那韦等药物的作用机制，印地那韦是一种用于HIV治疗的抗逆转录病毒药物。\n\n（选项C）阻止病毒颗粒从受感染细胞中释放是诸如神经氨酸酶抑制剂（如奥司他韦）等药物的作用机制，这些药物用于流感的早期治疗。\n\n（选项D）诸如恩夫韦地和马拉维罗等药物，是用于HIV治疗的抗逆转录病毒药物，可阻止病毒进入靶细胞。二十二烷醇是一种阻止病毒进入的局部用药，有时用于唇疱疹，而非生殖器HSV。\n\n（选项E）通过许多白细胞介素来实现上调受感染细胞中干扰素的合成。\n\n教学目标：\n目前推荐用于治疗原发性生殖器疱疹的抗病毒药物包括核苷类似物（例如，阿昔洛韦）。这些药物被掺入新复制的病毒DNA中，最终终止病毒DNA链的合成。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of antiviral medications, specifically acyclovir, in the treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. It requires understanding how acyclovir inhibits viral DNA replication within infected cells.\n\nThe best approach is to recall the mechanism of action of commonly used antiviral drugs. Acyclovir, a nucleoside analog, is activated by viral thymidine kinase and then inhibits viral DNA polymerase, leading to termination of viral DNA synthesis.",
