  "explanation": {
    "en": "Defense mechanisms are unconscious means of responding and adapting to situations to minimize anxiety and promote self-preservation. Splitting is a defense mechanism that involves experiencing the self or others in extremes, either all positive or all negative, which allows \"bad\" qualities to be completely separated from the \"good.\" Although splitting provides a less complicated way of looking at people and situations, it prevents the integration of positive and negative qualities into a cohesive whole, resulting in unpredictable fluctuations between the two extremes.\n\nIn this situation, the patient initially idealizes the surgeon but later characterizes her as the opposite extreme when frustrated and disappointed that she is running late. Splitting is commonly seen in borderline personality disorder and can contribute to the unstable relationships and mood instability that exemplify this disorder.\n\n(Choice A) Acting out refers to the expression of unacceptable thoughts or impulses through actions (eg, if this patient reacted by tearing up her discharge paperwork or throwing her food tray at the nurse).\n(Choice B) In displacement, negative feelings associated with a person or situation are transferred to a less threatening object or person (eg, if this patient said the nurse was \"terrible\" and unresponsive to her needs when in fact it is how she feels about the surgeon).\n(Choice C) Passive aggression involves expressing hostility indirectly in an unassertive way (eg, if this patient expressed her anger by remaining noncommunicative during the discharge process or deliberately neglected to sign her discharge papers).\n(Choice D) In projection, one's own unacceptable thoughts or feelings are perceived as coming from someone else (eg, if this patient on the day of discharge felt that the surgeon was angry with her).\n(Choice E) Reaction formation is the redirection of an unacceptable impulse into its opposite (eg, if this patient sent the physician a thank-you note and lavish gift instead of expressing her anger).\n\nEducational objective:\nSplitting is a defense mechanism that involves organizing experiences of the self or others into extremes to keep positive and negative aspects separated. It is commonly seen in patients with borderline personality disorder.",
    "zh": "防御机制是应对和适应情况以最大限度地减少焦虑和促进自我保护的无意识手段。分裂是一种防御机制，涉及以极端方式体验自我或他人，要么完全积极，要么完全消极，这允许将“坏”品质与“好”完全区分开来。虽然分裂提供了一种不太复杂的方式来看待人和事，但它阻止了积极和消极品质整合为一个有凝聚力的整体，导致在两个极端之间不可预测的波动。\n\n在这种情况下，患者最初理想化了外科医生，但后来在感到沮丧和失望时将她描述为相反的极端，因为她迟到了。分裂通常见于边缘型人格障碍，并可能导致这种障碍所体现的不稳定的人际关系和情绪不稳定。\n\n（选项 A）宣泄是指通过行动表达不可接受的想法或冲动（例如，如果该患者通过撕毁出院文件或将她的餐盘扔给护士来做出反应）。\n（选项 B）在移置中，与某人或某种情况相关的负面情绪被转移到威胁较小的物体或人身上（例如，如果该患者说护士“太糟糕了”，并且对她的需求毫无反应，而实际上这是她对外科医生的感觉）。\n（选项 C）被动攻击涉及以非对抗性的方式间接表达敌意（例如，如果该患者在出院过程中保持沉默，或故意不签署出院文件来表达她的愤怒）。\n（选项 D）在投射中，一个人自己不可接受的想法或感觉被认为是来自其他人（例如，如果该患者在出院当天感到外科医生对她很生气）。\n（选项 E）反向形成是将不可接受的冲动重定向到其相反方向（例如，如果该患者向医生发送感谢信和丰厚的礼物，而不是表达她的愤怒）。\n\n教育目标：\n分裂是一种防御机制，涉及将自我或他人的体验组织成极端方式，以保持积极和消极的方面分开。 它常见于患有边缘型人格障碍的患者。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of defense mechanisms, specifically identifying the most appropriate defense mechanism to explain a patient's behavior that shifts from idealization to devaluation.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves analyzing the patient's contradictory statements about the surgeon, recognizing the shift from extreme positive regard to extreme negative regard, and matching this pattern to the definition of the defense mechanisms provided in the options.",
