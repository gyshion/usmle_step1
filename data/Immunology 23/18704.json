    "en": "A 32-year-old man comes to the clinic for follow-up due to Crohn disease. The patient was initially diagnosed 3 years ago and achieved disease remission following a course of high-dose glucocorticoids. He remained in remission until 2 months ago, when he experienced an acute flare of diarrhea and abdominal pain that required a brief hospitalization and {{exhibit_1}} course of high-dose glucocorticoids. The patient completed a prescribed glucocorticoid taper earlier this week and says that his symptoms have returned to \"about normal.\" Azathioprine maintenance therapy is started to help prevent future flares. Which of the following most accurately describes the expected effects of this new medication on immune function?",

    "en": "Azathioprine is an immunosuppression drug that inhibits purine nucleotide synthesis and incorporates false purine nucleotides into DNA and RNA. These effects reduce the proliferation of both B and T lymphocytes. The reduced number of activated B lymphocytes leads to reduced immunoglobulin levels, and the reduced number of activated T lymphocytes leads to reduced IL-2 activity. Common adverse effects include pancytopenia (ie, anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia) and increased susceptibility to infection. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "硫唑嘌呤是一种免疫抑制药物，它抑制嘌呤核苷酸的合成，并将错误的嘌呤核苷酸掺入DNA和RNA中。这些作用减少了B淋巴细胞和T淋巴细胞的增殖。活化的B淋巴细胞数量减少导致免疫球蛋白水平降低，而活化的T淋巴细胞数量减少导致IL-2活性降低。常见的不良反应包括全血细胞减少（即贫血、白细胞减少和血小板减少）以及对感染的易感性增加。{{exhibit_2}}"
