    "en": "A 46-year-old woman with a history of hiatal hernia and severe gastroesophageal reflux undergoes antireflux surgery. The reflux symptoms were refractory to medical therapy, so an endoscopic fundoplication procedure is performed. During surgery, the hiatal defect is repaired, and the gastric fundus is mobilized and wrapped around the lower esophagus to reinforce the lower esophageal sphincter. No esophageal or gastric injuries occurred, but a neural structure traversing the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm was inadvertently injured. Which of the following is the most likely potential effect of this operative injury?",

  "correct_answer": "A",

    "en": "The correct answer is A: Delayed gastric emptying (44%)\n\nFundoplication is a surgical procedure used to treat refractory gastroesophageal reflux associated with an esophageal hiatal hernia. In the procedure, the esophageal hiatus is tightened, and the gastric fundus is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter, thereby preventing gastric acid from entering the esophagus.\n\nHowever, the ANTERIOR and POSTERIOR VAGAL TRUNKS (branches of the vagus nerve) also pass through the esophageal hiatus and are vulnerable to injury during fundoplication. These nerves supply parasympathetic innervation to the gastrointestinal tract and stimulate gastric muscle contraction and motility. Injury to the vagal trunks can lead to DELAYED GASTRIC EMPTYING (ie, gastroparesis), manifesting with abdominal pain, early satiety, and postprandial emesis.\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice B) The phrenic nerve innervates the diaphragm; it originates from the C3-C5 nerve roots and passes through the mediastinum between the heart and the lungs. It is unlikely to be injured during fundoplication because its terminal motor branches transit the VENAL CAVA FORAMEN, not the esophageal hiatus.\n\n(Choice C) Tonic contraction of the pelvic floor muscles (eg, levator ani) is necessary for preventing fecal incontinence. They receive PARASYMPATHETIC INNERVATION from the pelvic splanchnic nerves, not the vagus nerve, and their function would be unaffected by vagal injury.\n\n(Choice D) The vagus nerve stimulates gastric parietal cell production of hydrochloric acid; injury may therefore lead to decreased gastric acid secretion (ie, hypochlorhydria), not increased secretion.\n\n(Choice E) Intestinal peristalsis is mediated largely by the enteric nervous system. Although vagus nerve injury may cause transient intestinal dysmotility due to sudden loss of parasympathetic input, it would not cause long-term dysfunction.\n\nEducational objective:\nBranches of the vagus nerve (ie, anterior and posterior vagal trunks) pass through the esophageal hiatus. Damage to these branches, which can occur during esophageal hiatal hernia repair (eg, fundoplication), may result in delayed gastric emptying and gastric hypochlorhydria.\n\n{{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "正确答案是A：胃排空延迟 (44%)\n\n胃底折叠术是一种用于治疗与食管裂孔疝相关的难治性胃食管反流病的外科手术。 在该手术中，收紧食管裂孔，并将胃底包裹在食管下括约肌周围，从而阻止胃酸进入食管。\n\n然而，ANTERIOR 和 POSTERIOR VAGAL TRUNKS（迷走神经的分支）也通过食管裂孔，并且在胃底折叠术期间容易受到损伤。 这些神经向胃肠道提供副交感神经支配，并刺激胃肌收缩和蠕动。 迷走神经干的损伤可导致胃排空延迟（即，胃轻瘫），表现为腹痛、早饱感和餐后呕吐。\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项 B) 膈神经支配膈肌； 它起源于 C3-C5 神经根，穿过纵隔，位于心脏和肺之间。 它不太可能在胃底折叠术期间受伤，因为它的末端运动分支通过 VENAL CAVA FORAMEN，而不是食管裂孔。\n\n(选项 C) 盆底肌（例如，提肛肌）的紧张收缩对于预防大便失禁是必要的。 它们接受来自盆腔内脏神经的副交感神经支配，而不是迷走神经，它们的功能不会受到迷走神经损伤的影响。\n\n(选项 D) 迷走神经刺激胃壁细胞产生盐酸； 因此，损伤可能导致胃酸分泌减少（即，低氯胃酸症），而不是分泌增加。\n\n(选项 E) 肠蠕动主要由肠神经系统介导。 尽管迷走神经损伤可能由于副交感神经输入的突然丧失而导致短暂的肠道运动功能障碍，但它不会导致长期功能障碍。\n\n教育目标：\n迷走神经的分支（即，anterior 和 posterior vagal trunks）穿过食管裂孔。 在食管裂孔疝修补术（例如，胃底折叠术）期间，这些分支受损可能导致胃排空延迟和胃酸缺乏。\n\n{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the anatomical structures passing through the esophageal hiatus and the consequences of vagal nerve injury during fundoplication. Specifically, it assesses the understanding of how damage to the anterior and posterior vagal trunks can lead to delayed gastric emptying.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the anatomy of the esophageal hiatus and the structures that pass through it. Recognize that the vagal trunks are vulnerable during fundoplication and that their injury can disrupt parasympathetic innervation to the gastrointestinal tract, leading to gastroparesis.",
