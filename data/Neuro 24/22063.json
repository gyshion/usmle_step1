  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is E. This patient has a homogeneously enhancing **EXTRATUNORAL TUMOR** at the cerebellopontine angle, leading to compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) resulting in unilateral, progressive hearing loss. Pathologically, this may be a vestibular schwannoma or a **MENINGIOMA**. Although imaging findings can help differentiate between the two (eg, extension into internal auditory canal [schwannoma], dural enhancement [meningioma]), histologic analysis is often required for definitive diagnosis.\n\nMeningiomas are considered benign primary brain tumors arising from meningothelial cells and are more commonly found in middle-aged to elderly women. They can cause significant neurologic symptoms if they become large enough to compress neurovascular structures. Classically, meningiomas at the **CEREBELLOPONTINE ANGLE** cause progressive sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and imbalance or disequilibrium. With continued growth, they can cause facial weakness (facial nerve [CN VII]) and facial numbness (trigeminal nerve [CN V]). Treatment is typically surgical resection. Histology shows cells arranged in lobules or whorls, often with psammoma bodies. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) Arteriovenous malformations are congenital lesions that frequently present with headaches and seizures in children and young adults. On MRI, they often appear as hypointense lesions (due to flow voids) with a honeycomb appearance.\n\n(Choice B) Astrocytomas are pediatric CNS tumors that originate from astrocytes (the dominant glial cell in the brain). Because of this, they develop in the brain parenchyma rather than an extraaxial location.\n\n(Choice C) Ependymomas arise from the ependymal lining of the ventricles, often from the roof of the fourth ventricle in children or the intramedullary space of the spinal cord in adults. They would not be located in the cerebellopontine angle. In addition, intracranial ependymomas typically present with progressive headaches and signs of increased intracranial pressure due to obstructive hydrocephalus.\n\n(Choice D) Medulloblastomas typically present in children (most commonly age 5-9) with vomiting, headache, and cerebellar dysfunction. They are typically located along the cerebellar midline (rather than the cerebellopontine angle) and may compress the fourth ventricle, causing obstructive hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure.\n\n**Educational objective:**\nTumors at the cerebellopontine angle can cause unilateral progressive hearing loss due to compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII). These tumors are most likely vestibular schwannomas or meningiomas; histologic analysis is often required to differentiate between them. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}",
    "zh": "正确答案是 E。该患者在桥小脑角处有一个均匀强化的**脑外肿瘤**，导致前庭蜗神经 (CN VIII) 受压迫，导致单侧进行性听力损失。从病理学上讲，这可能是前庭神经鞘瘤或**脑膜瘤**。尽管影像学检查结果可以帮助区分两者（例如，延伸到内听道 [神经鞘瘤]，硬脑膜增强 [脑膜瘤]），但通常需要组织学分析才能做出明确诊断。\n\n脑膜瘤被认为是源自脑膜细胞的良性原发性脑肿瘤，更常见于中年至老年女性。如果它们变得足够大以压迫神经血管结构，则会导致明显的神经系统症状。典型情况下，**桥小脑角**的脑膜瘤会导致进行性感音神经性听力损失、耳鸣和不平衡或失衡。随着持续生长，它们会导致面部无力（面神经 [CN VII]）和面部麻木（三叉神经 [CN V]）。治疗通常是手术切除。组织学显示细胞呈小叶或漩涡状排列，通常伴有砂粒体。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n(选项 A) 动静脉畸形是先天性病变，常表现为儿童和年轻人的头痛和癫痫发作。在 MRI 上，它们通常显示为低信号病变（由于血流空隙），呈蜂窝状外观。\n\n(选项 B) 星形细胞瘤是源自星形胶质细胞（大脑中占主导地位的神经胶质细胞）的儿科中枢神经系统肿瘤。因此，它们发生在大脑实质中而不是脑外位置。\n\n(选项 C) 室管膜瘤源自脑室的室管膜内壁，通常源自儿童的第四脑室顶部或成人的脊髓髓内间隙。它们不会位于桥小脑角。此外，颅内室管膜瘤通常表现为进行性头痛和由于梗阻性脑积水引起的颅内压增高的征象。\n\n(选项 D) 髓母细胞瘤通常出现在儿童（最常见于 5-9 岁）中，表现为呕吐、头痛和小脑功能障碍。它们通常位于小脑正中线（而不是桥小脑角），并且可能压迫第四脑室，导致梗阻性脑积水和颅内压增高。\n\n**教育目标：**\n桥小脑角的肿瘤可因压迫前庭蜗神经 (CN VIII) 导致单侧进行性听力损失。这些肿瘤最可能是前庭神经鞘瘤或脑膜瘤；通常需要组织学分析来区分它们。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to diagnose a cerebellopontine angle tumor based on clinical presentation and imaging findings. It specifically assesses knowledge of the differential diagnosis for unilateral hearing loss and the characteristic features of meningiomas and other common brain tumors in this location.\n\nTo solve this question, one must correlate the patient's symptoms of progressive unilateral hearing loss with the location of the lesion on the MRI. The differential diagnosis for cerebellopontine angle masses should be considered, and the typical clinical and imaging features of each option should be evaluated to determine the most likely diagnosis.",
