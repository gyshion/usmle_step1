Other medical conditions are well-controlled hypertension and stable coronary artery disease. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. The patient is educated to avoid taking over-the-counter NSAIDs immediately prior to surgery due to risk of excessive perioperative bleeding. He is also instructed to discontinue low-dose aspirin at least 5 days prior to surgery.",

    "en": "Antipletlet medications {{exhibit_1}}\n\nCyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which help convert arachidonic acid to thromboxane A₂ and prostaglandins, exist in 2 primary forms, which is constitutively expressed in physiologically functioning cells. The major product of COX-1 in platelets is thromboxane A₂, which promotes platelet activation and aggregation (eg, increased glycoprotein IIb/IIIa expression).\n\nCOX-2, which is expressed in an inducible manner in response to cytokine release by immune cells (eg, macrophages). Major products of this enzyme are prostaglandins, some of which promote fever, inflammation, and pain sensitivity.\n\nAspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), primarily inhibits COX-1 when administered in low doses (ie, 81-324 mg/day). Aspirin is unique compared to other NSAIDs because this inhibition is irreversible (via acetylation), resulting in a sustained decrease in thromboxane A₂ production by platelets for the duration of their lifespan (ie, 3-7 days). Therefore, aspirin has a prolonged antithrombotic effect and is commonly used to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with coronary artery disease. Because this inhibition of platelet aggregation lasts for the platelet lifespan, preoperative aspirin discontinuation is recommended at least 5 days prior to surgery to avoid excessive bleeding.\n\nHigher aspirin doses significantly inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, thereby also exhibiting antipyretic and analgesic effects due to decreased prostaglandin production. However, other NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen) are more commonly used for these indications because of a better efficacy and safety profile; notably, these medications reversibly inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 and therefore can be discontinued immediately prior to surgery.\n\n(Choices A and C) Aspirin and its active metabolite salicylate are transported to various tissues in a highly protein-bound state (ie, bound to albumin). However, neither a delayed release from albumin nor persistence of active metabolites would explain the sustained antithrombotic effect (>5 days) because salicylate undergoes glucuronidation by the liver and elimination from the body within a day (half-life of 3-5 hr).\n\n(Choice D) Anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, rivaroxaban) are major inhibitors of hepatic coagulation factor synthesis; however, aspirin does not affect coagulation factor synthesis in a clinically significant manner.\n\n(Choice E) Selective inhibition of the inducible form of COX (ie, COX-2) describes the mechanism of action of selective COX-2 inhibitors (eg, celecoxib). However, aspirin is nonselective in its inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2.\n\nEducational objective:\nAspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that primarily and irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) when given in low doses. Because irreversible COX-1 inhibition decreases platelet thromboxane A₂ production for the duration of their lifespan (ie, 3-7 days), preoperative aspirin discontinuation is recommended at least 5 days prior to surgery to avoid excessive bleeding. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "抗血小板药物 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n环氧合酶(COX)酶，有助于将花生四烯酸转化为血栓素A₂和前列腺素，存在两种主要形式，这两种形式在生理功能细胞中组成性表达。血小板中COX-1的主要产物是血栓素A₂，它促进血小板活化和聚集（例如，糖蛋白IIb/IIIa表达增加）。\n\nCOX-2 以可诱导的方式表达，以响应免疫细胞（例如巨噬细胞）释放的细胞因子。该酶的主要产物是前列腺素，其中一些促进发烧、炎症和疼痛敏感性。\n\n阿司匹林，一种非甾体抗炎药(NSAID)，主要抑制COX-1，当以低剂量（即81-324 mg/天）给药时。与其他NSAIDs相比，阿司匹林是独一无二的，因为这种抑制是不可逆的（通过乙酰化），导致血小板产生的血栓素A₂持续减少，持续时间为其寿命（即3-7天）。因此，阿司匹林具有持久的抗血栓作用，常用于降低冠心病患者的心血管风险。由于这种对血小板聚集的抑制持续血小板寿命，建议术前至少在手术前5天停用阿司匹林，以避免过度出血。\n\n较高剂量的阿司匹林会显着抑制COX-1和COX-2，从而也表现出解热和镇痛作用，这归因于前列腺素产量的减少。然而，其他NSAIDs（例如布洛芬）更常用于这些适应症，因为它们具有更好的疗效和安全性；值得注意的是，这些药物可逆地抑制COX-1和COX-2，因此可以在手术前立即停用。\n\n（选项A和C）阿司匹林及其活性代谢物水杨酸盐以高度蛋白结合状态（即与白蛋白结合）转运到各种组织。然而，白蛋白的延迟释放或活性代谢物的持续存在都不能解释持续的抗血栓作用（>5天），因为水杨酸盐通过肝脏进行葡萄糖醛酸化，并在一天内从体内消除（半衰期3-5小时）。\n\n（选项D）抗凝剂（例如，华法林，利伐沙班）是肝脏凝血因子合成的主要抑制剂；然而，阿司匹林不会以临床显着的方式影响凝血因子合成。\n\n（选项E）选择性抑制COX的诱导形式（即COX-2）描述了选择性COX-2抑制剂（例如，塞来昔布）的作用机制。然而，阿司匹林在抑制COX-1和COX-2方面没有选择性。\n\n教育目标：\n阿司匹林是一种非甾体抗炎药，主要在低剂量给药时不可逆地抑制环氧合酶-1（COX-1）。由于不可逆的COX-1抑制作用会降低血小板血栓素A₂的产生，持续时间为血小板的寿命（即3-7天），建议术前至少在手术前5天停用阿司匹林，以避免过度出血。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the mechanism of action of aspirin and the rationale for its discontinuation prior to surgery. It assesses understanding of irreversible COX-1 inhibition and its effect on platelet function. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1, leading to a prolonged effect on platelet function. Discontinuation is necessary to allow for the production of new, functional platelets before surgery.",
