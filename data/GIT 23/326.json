    "en": "A 6-year-old girl is brought to the office due to intermittent abdominal cramps, bloating, and diarrhea for 2 months. She also has excessive flatulence, which typically occurs after meals. The patient has had no fever or vomiting. She eats a well-balanced diet and takes no medications or vitamins. Vital signs are appropriate for age. Examination shows a mildly distended abdomen with no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. Laboratory evaluation reveals elevated tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Which of the following locations should be biopsied to confirm the diagnosis in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibodies likely has celiac disease. This chronic, malabsorptive disorder is caused by an immune-mediated reaction to dietary gliadin (the major component of gluten) found in wheat, barley, and rye.\n\nIn patients with celiac disease, gliadin triggers an inflammatory reaction within the small intestine that leads to the classic symptoms of abdominal pain, distention, flatulence, and diarrhea. Laboratory evaluation usually reveals antibodies against TTG, a crosslinking enzyme that interacts with glutamine-rich proteins (including exogenous gliadin). Endoscopy with biopsy characteristically shows villus atrophy, lymphocytic infiltration of the intraepithelial cells, and crypt hyperplasia. Biopsy of the duodenum and proximal jejunum are most likely to confirm the diagnosis because these areas of the intestine are exposed to the highest concentration of gliadin.\n\n(Choice A) Helicobacter pylori infection, which predisposes to gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, can cause abdominal pain (often postprandial) and bloating, and gastric biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. However, elevated TTG antibodies are not associated with H pylori.\n\n(Choices C, D, and E) Because celiac disease primarily involves the proximal small bowel, biopsies from the distal jejunum and terminal ileum may be normal in patients with celiac disease and are not recommended; the colon is not affected in celiac disease.\n\nEducational objective:\nCeliac disease is caused by an immune-mediated reaction to gluten and classically leads to chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Diagnosis is confirmed by elevated tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody levels and duodenal biopsy showing villus flattening, intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration, and crypt hyperplasia.",
    "zh": "该患者出现慢性胃肠道症状，且组织转谷氨酰胺酶 (TTG) 抗体升高，很可能患有乳糜泻。这种慢性吸收不良疾病是由对膳食麦醇溶蛋白（麸质的主要成分）的免疫介导反应引起的，存在于小麦、大麦和黑麦中。\n\n在乳糜泻患者中，麦醇溶蛋白会在小肠内引发炎症反应，导致腹痛、腹胀、胀气和腹泻等典型症状。实验室评估通常显示针对 TTG 的抗体，TTG 是一种与谷氨酰胺丰富的蛋白质（包括外源性麦醇溶蛋白）相互作用的交联酶。内镜检查和活检通常显示绒毛萎缩、上皮内淋巴细胞浸润和隐窝增生。十二指肠和近端空肠活检最有可能确诊，因为这些肠道区域接触到的麦醇溶蛋白浓度最高。\n\n（选项 A）幽门螺杆菌感染会诱发胃炎和消化性溃疡病，可引起腹痛（通常为餐后）和腹胀，胃活检可确诊。但是，TTG 抗体升高与幽门螺杆菌无关。\n\n（选项 C、D 和 E）由于乳糜泻主要累及近端小肠，因此，对乳糜泻患者的末端空肠和末端回肠活检结果可能正常，不建议进行活检；结肠不受乳糜泻的影响。\n\n教育目标：\n乳糜泻是由对麸质的免疫介导反应引起的，通常会导致慢性胃肠道症状。通过升高的组织转谷氨酰胺酶 IgA 抗体水平和十二指肠活检显示绒毛扁平、上皮内淋巴细胞浸润和隐窝增生，可以确诊。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of celiac disease presentation, diagnostic testing, and the pathophysiology of gluten-induced enteropathy. It requires understanding the typical location of intestinal damage in celiac disease.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the symptoms of malabsorption (diarrhea, bloating, flatulence) and the elevated TTG antibodies, which suggest celiac disease. Recall that the duodenum and proximal jejunum are the most affected areas in celiac disease, making a biopsy of the duodenum the most appropriate next step.",
    "zh": "本题考察对乳糜泻的表现、诊断性检查以及麸质诱导性小肠病变的病理生理学的了解。它要求了解乳糜泻中肠道损伤的典型位置。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要识别吸收不良的症状（腹泻、腹胀、胀气）和 TTG 抗体升高，这些都提示乳糜泻。 回忆一下，十二指肠和近端空肠是乳糜泻中最受影响的区域，因此对十二指肠进行活检是最合适的下一步。"
