    "en": "4 day old boy born to a 23 year old woman is brought to the office for evaluation of poor feeding and vomiting. The pregnancy was uneventful and the mother had a normal delivery. Family history is noncontributory. The patient's temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 60/30 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 56/min. Physical examination reveals a lethargic newborn with exaggerated deep tendon reflexes and clonus. Further investigation reveals that the patient has an inherited condition that results in impaired transport of ornithine from the cytosol to the mitochondria.",

    "en": "Impaired transport of ornithine into the mitochondria can be caused by ornithine translocase deficiency, which results in a defect in the HEPATIC UREA CYCLE. The urea cycle converts ammonia, which is generated from the CATABOLISM OF AMINO ACIDS, into urea for excretion in urine. Urea cycle defects cause AMMONIA to accumulate in the blood, resulting in progressive lethargy, vomiting, seizures, and cerebral edema (may cause hyperreflexia and abnormal posturing when severe) in infancy and early childhood; milder defects caused by partial enzyme deficiencies may not manifest until adulthood.\n\nEffective treatment of urea cycle disorders requires balancing dietary PROTEIN INTAKE and metabolic requirements. PROTEIN RESTRICTION is the main treatment for urea cycle disorders, such that the body receives the essential amino acids needed for growth and development but not in excess such that excessive ammonia is formed. Medications that provide an alternate pathway to excrete nitrogen (eg, phenylacetate) are also used to help remove ammonia from the blood.\n\n(Choice A) Restriction of branched-chain amino acids (eg, valine, leucine, isoleucine) is used to treat maple syrup urine disease (branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency) and propionic acidemia (propionyl-CoA carboxylase).\n\n(Choice B) Fructose and sucrose restriction is the treatment for fructose 1-phosphate aldolase (aldolase B) deficiency. This condition causes vomiting and hypoglycemia in infants after fruit or juice is introduced.\n\n(Choice C) Galactose and lactose are excluded from the diet in patients with classic galactosemia (absent galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase). Galactosemia presents in neonates with jaundice, vomiting, poor feeding, lethargy, hypoglycemia, and galactose-1-phosphate accumulation.\n\n(Choice D) Medium-chain triglycerides are restricted in medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, a condition characterized by lethargy, seizures, and hypoketotic hypoglycemia following a period of fasting.\n\n(Choice E) A phenylalanine-free diet is recommended in patients with phenylketonuria (phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency). Failure to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine leads to accumulation of phenylalanine and intellectual disability if the condition is left untreated.\n\n(Choice G) Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) can be used to treat homocystinuria, which is caused by a defect in vitamin B6-dependent cystathionine synthase. This condition is characterized by elevated homocysteine levels, ectopia lentis, intellectual disability, Marfanoid habitus, and increased occurrence of thromboembolic events.\n\nEducational objective:\nOrnithine transport into mitochondria is necessary for proper function of the urea cycle, which is the major disposal pathway for waste nitrogen generated by catabolism of amino acids. Urea cycle defects typically cause neurological damage due to the accumulation of ammonia. Protein restriction improves this condition by reducing the amount of amino acid turnover.",
    "zh": "鸟氨酸进入线粒体的转运受损，可能由鸟氨酸转运酶缺乏引起，这导致肝脏尿素循环缺陷。尿素循环将由氨基酸分解代谢产生的氨转化为尿素，通过尿液排出。尿素循环缺陷导致血液中氨的积累，导致婴儿和幼儿出现进行性嗜睡、呕吐、癫痫发作和脑水肿（严重时可能导致反射亢进和异常姿势）；由部分酶缺乏引起的较轻微缺陷可能直到成年期才显现出来。\n\n有效治疗尿素循环障碍需要平衡膳食蛋白质摄入量和代谢需求。限制蛋白质摄入是治疗尿素循环障碍的主要方法，这样身体可以获得生长和发育所需的必需氨基酸，但不会过量，从而不会形成过多的氨。提供另一种途径来排泄氮的药物（例如，苯乙酸苯酯）也被用于帮助从血液中清除氨。\n\n（选项 A）限制支链氨基酸（例如，缬氨酸、亮氨酸、异亮氨酸）用于治疗枫糖尿症（支链α-酮酸脱氢酶缺乏症）和丙酸血症（丙酰基辅酶A羧化酶缺乏症）。\n\n（选项 B）果糖和蔗糖限制是治疗果糖1-磷酸醛缩酶（醛缩酶B）缺乏症的方法。这种情况在婴儿引入水果或果汁后引起呕吐和低血糖症。\n\n（选项 C）经典半乳糖血症（缺乏半乳糖-1-磷酸尿苷转移酶）患者的饮食中不含半乳糖和乳糖。半乳糖血症在新生儿中表现为黄疸、呕吐、喂养困难、嗜睡、低血糖和半乳糖-1-磷酸积累。\n\n（选项 D）限制中链甘油三酯用于中链酰基辅酶A脱氢酶缺乏症，该病的特征是在禁食一段时间后出现嗜睡、癫痫发作和低酮性低血糖症。\n\n（选项 E）建议苯丙酮尿症（苯丙氨酸羟化酶缺乏症）患者采用无苯丙氨酸饮食。未能将苯丙氨酸转化为酪氨酸会导致苯丙氨酸积累，如果不及时治疗，则会导致智力障碍。\n\n（选项 G）吡哆醇（维生素B6）可用于治疗高半胱氨酸尿症，高半胱氨酸尿症是由维生素B6依赖性胱硫醚合酶缺陷引起的。这种情况的特征是高半胱氨酸水平升高、晶状体异位、智力障碍、马凡样体型和血栓栓塞事件发生率增加。\n\n教育目标：\n鸟氨酸进入线粒体是尿素循环正常功能所必需的，尿素循环是氨基酸分解代谢产生的废氮的主要清除途径。尿素循环缺陷通常会导致神经系统损伤，原因是氨的积累。限制蛋白质摄入通过减少氨基酸的转化来改善这种情况。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of urea cycle disorders, specifically hyperammonemia and its management through dietary protein restriction. The question requires understanding the link between ornithine transport, the urea cycle, and the resulting ammonia buildup in these disorders. \n\nTo solve this question, identify the link between ornithine transport and the urea cycle. Recognize that impaired ornithine transport disrupts the urea cycle, leading to ammonia accumulation. Recall that protein restriction is the primary treatment for managing hyperammonemia in urea cycle disorders.",
