    "en": "A newborn is being evaluated in the nursery. The patient was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 23-year-old woman. The mother developed dark terminal facial hair and a deepened voice during the pregnancy. The delivery was unremarkable, and the patient's vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows ambiguous genitalia and clitoromegaly. Laboratory studies reveal elevated serum levels of testosterone and androstenedione. Karyotype testing shows a 46,XX genotype. Ultrasound of the newborn shows a normal-sized uterus. This infant's presentation is most likely due to deficiency of which of the following enzymes?",

    "en": "This genotypically female (46,XX) infant with ambiguous genitalia was born to a mother who developed masculinizing features during pregnancy, findings which are consistent with aromatase deficiency. Aromatase, a key enzyme in estrogen synthesis, normally converts androstenedione to estrone and testosterone to estradiol in various body tissues, including the gonads, adrenal glands, and adipose tissue. However, the majority of fetal estrogen is synthesized by aromatase within the fetal placenta.\n\nAromatase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by HIGH ANDROGEN (and corresponding LOW ESTROGEN) levels in the fetus and placenta. Lack of aromatase allows fetal androgens to cross the placenta and enter the maternal circulation, resulting in MATERNAL GESTATIONAL VIRILIZATION (eg, acne, hirsutism, deep voice).\n\nNewborn females with aromatase deficiency have normal internal genitalia but AMBIGUOUS EXTERNAL GENITALIA (eg, clitoromegaly). At puberty, estrogen synthesis is impaired due to absent ovarian aromatase, which results in primary amenorrhea, osteoporosis, and tall stature due to delayed fusion of the epiphyses. Males with aromatase deficiency have phenotypically normal genitalia but develop tall stature and osteoporosis as adults.\n\n(Choice A) 5-Alpha reductase deficiency results in decreased synthesis of dihydrotestosterone, which is responsible for the development of external male genitalia (eg, scrotum, penis). Affected males have underdeveloped genitalia, whereas females are unaffected at birth.\n\n(Choice B) 17-Alpha hydroxylase deficiency is a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Symptoms result from decreased production of glucocorticoids and androgens (ambiguous genitalia in males) and increased production of mineralocorticoids (hypertension, hypokalemia). Females have phenotypically normal genitalia.\n\n(Choice C) 21-Hydroxylase deficiency is the most common type of congenital adrenal hyperplasia and is associated with salt wasting and adrenal crises due to decreased aldosterone and cortisol synthesis. Increased androgen production causes ambiguous genitalia in females. Unlike this case, however, maternal virilization does not occur due to intact placental aromatase activity, which prevents androgens from entering the maternal circulation.\n\n(Choice E) HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway; statins inhibit this enzyme and reduce endogenous cholesterol synthesis. It is not involved in sexual differentiation.\n\nEducational objective:\nAromatase is responsible for converting androgens into estrogens. Deficiency of this enzyme causes accumulation of androgens during pregnancy, resulting in ambiguous external genitalia in newborn females and maternal gestational virilization.",
    "zh": "这种基因型为女性 (46,XX) 且外生殖器模糊的新生儿，其母亲在怀孕期间出现了男性化特征，这些发现与芳香化酶缺乏症一致。芳香化酶是雌激素合成的关键酶，通常将雄烯二酮转化为雌酮，将睾酮转化为雌二醇，这些反应发生在各种身体组织中，包括性腺、肾上腺和脂肪组织。然而，大多数胎儿雌激素是由胎儿胎盘内的芳香化酶合成的。\n\n芳香化酶缺乏症是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是胎儿和胎盘中雄激素水平高（且相应的雌激素水平低）。缺乏芳香化酶使得胎儿雄激素穿过胎盘进入母体循环，导致母体妊娠期男性化（如痤疮、多毛症、声音低沉）。\n\n患有芳香化酶缺乏症的新生儿女性具有正常的内部生殖器，但外生殖器模糊（如阴蒂肥大）。在青春期，由于卵巢中缺乏芳香化酶，雌激素合成受损，导致原发性闭经、骨质疏松症，以及由于骨骺融合延迟而导致身材高大。患有芳香化酶缺乏症的男性具有表型正常的生殖器，但成年后会发育为身材高大和骨质疏松症。\n\n(选项 A) 5-α 还原酶缺乏症导致二氢睾酮的合成减少，二氢睾酮负责男性外生殖器（如阴囊、阴茎）的发育。受影响的男性生殖器发育不全，而女性在出生时不受影响。\n\n(选项 B) 17-α 羟化酶缺乏症是一种先天性肾上腺皮质增生症。症状源于糖皮质激素和雄激素产生减少（男性外生殖器模糊）以及盐皮质激素产生增加（高血压、低钾血症）。女性的表型正常。\n\n(选项 C) 21-羟化酶缺乏症是最常见的先天性肾上腺皮质增生症，与因醛固酮和皮质醇合成减少而引起的失盐和肾上腺危象有关。雄激素产生增加会导致女性外生殖器模糊。然而，与本例不同的是，由于胎盘芳香化酶活性完整，母体男性化并未发生，这阻止了雄激素进入母体循环。\n\n(选项 E) HMG-CoA 还原酶是胆固醇合成途径中的限速酶；他汀类药物抑制该酶并减少内源性胆固醇的合成。它不参与性分化。\n\n教育目标：\n芳香化酶负责将雄激素转化为雌激素。这种酶的缺乏会导致怀孕期间雄激素的积累，导致新生儿女性外生殖器模糊和母体妊娠期男性化。"
