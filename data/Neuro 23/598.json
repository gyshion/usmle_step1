    "en": "A 61-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being found unresponsive on a sidewalk. Paramedics noted that the patient's breath smelled of alcohol and that he had vomitus in his mouth. The patient also has agonal respirations, and cardiac monitoring shows pulseless electrical activity. Resuscitation efforts are unsuccessful, and he is pronounced dead on arrival. Autopsy shows that the cause of death is airway occlusion by aspirated vomitus. In addition, foci of hemorrhage and necrosis are seen in the mammillary bodies and gray matter surrounding the third and fourth ventricles. {{exhibit_1}} This patient's brain findings are most likely associated with a decrease in which of the following?",

    "en": "This patient's autopsy shows foci of hemorrhage and necrosis in the mammillary bodies and periaqueductal gray matter, findings characteristic of WERNICKE ENCEPHALOPATHY. This condition classically presents with the triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion but can lead to coma and death if untreated. Wernicke encephalopathy occurs due to chronic THIAMINE DEFICIENCY, which is common in patients with ALCOHOL USE DISORDER. Thiamine (vitamin B1) participates in glucose metabolism and is a cofactor for several enzymes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase, and transketolase. Transketolase, an enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, helps convert ribulose-5-phosphate (derived from glucose) to glycolytic intermediates (eg, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate). Therefore, thiamine deficiency impairs glucose utilization, which can have catastrophic effects on the CNS as the brain always requires some glucose. Thiamine deficiency is often diagnosed clinically in patients with a history of heavy alcohol use or malnutrition and signs of Wernicke encephalopathy; the diagnosis can be confirmed with a baseline ERYTHROCYTE TRANSKETOLASE ACTIVITY that is low but increases after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate. Treatment involves thiamine supplementation with glucose; glucose administration alone may precipitate or worsen Wernicke encephalopathy due to rapid thiamine consumption. {{exhibit_2}} (Choice A) Erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is necessary for production of NADPH and proper functioning of the erythrocyte antioxidant system. Decreased G6PD levels cause intermittent hemolytic anemia due to oxidative stress. (Choices C and E) The metabolism of ethanol to acetyl-CoA consumes NAD+ and increases NADH/NAD+; therefore, NADH would likely be elevated in this patient. In addition, without NAD+, pyruvate dehydrogenase is unable to convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and instead diverts pyruvate to the anaerobic glycolysis pathway, which ultimately increases lactate (not decreases) production. (Choice D) Methylmalonic acid, a product of fatty acid oxidation, is converted to succinyl-CoA by the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (and uses vitamin B12 as a cofactor). Consequently, methylmalonic acid levels are increased in vitamin B12 deficiency. Educational objective: Chronic thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency impairs glucose use, particularly in mammillary bodies, as seen in Wernicke encephalopathy. This occurs due to decreased activity of the enzymes that use thiamine as a cofactor (eg, transketolase). Low erythrocyte transketolase activity that increases after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate is diagnostic.",
    "zh": "这位患者的尸检显示乳头体和导水管周围灰质中有出血和坏死的病灶，这些发现是WERNICKE脑病（WERNICKE ENCEPHALOPATHY）的特征。 这种疾病的典型表现是眼肌麻痹、共济失调和意识模糊，但如果不治疗，可能导致昏迷和死亡。 Wernicke脑病是由于慢性硫胺素缺乏引起的，这在患有酒精使用障碍的患者中很常见。硫胺素（维生素B1）参与葡萄糖代谢，是几种酶的辅因子，包括丙酮酸脱氢酶、α-酮戊二酸脱氢酶、支链α-酮酸脱氢酶和转酮醇酶。 转酮醇酶是磷酸戊糖途径中的一种酶，有助于将核糖-5-磷酸（源自葡萄糖）转化为糖酵解中间体（例如，甘油醛-3-磷酸）。 因此，硫胺素缺乏会损害葡萄糖利用，这可能对中枢神经系统产生灾难性影响，因为大脑始终需要一些葡萄糖。 硫胺素缺乏症通常在有大量饮酒或营养不良病史以及Wernicke脑病体征的患者中通过临床诊断； 诊断可以通过基线红细胞转酮醇酶活性低但添加焦磷酸硫胺素后增加来确认。 治疗涉及补充硫胺素和葡萄糖； 单独使用葡萄糖可能会因硫胺素快速消耗而诱发或加重Wernicke脑病。 {{exhibit_2}} (选项A) 红细胞葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶 (G6PD) 催化磷酸戊糖途径中的限速步骤，这对于产生 NADPH 和红细胞抗氧化系统的正常功能是必需的。 G6PD 水平降低会导致由于氧化应激引起的间歇性溶血性贫血。 (选项 C 和 E) 乙醇代谢为乙酰辅酶 A 会消耗 NAD+ 并增加 NADH/NAD+； 因此，该患者的 NADH 可能会升高。 此外，如果没有 NAD+，丙酮酸脱氢酶将无法将丙酮酸转化为乙酰辅酶 A，而是将丙酮酸转移到无氧糖酵解途径，这最终会增加乳酸（而不是减少）的产生。 (选项 D) 甲基丙二酸是脂肪酸氧化的产物，由酶甲基丙二酰辅酶A变位酶转化为琥珀酰辅酶A（并使用维生素B12作为辅助因子）。 因此，维生素B12缺乏症患者的甲基丙二酸水平升高。 教育目标：慢性硫胺素（维生素B1）缺乏会损害葡萄糖的利用，特别是在乳头体中，如Wernicke脑病所见。 这是由于使用硫胺素作为辅助因子的酶（例如，转酮醇酶）的活性降低所致。 添加焦磷酸硫胺素后增加的低红细胞转酮醇酶活性具有诊断意义。"

It assesses the ability to link autopsy findings of brain damage to specific biochemical deficiencies.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recognize the autopsy findings as characteristic of Wernicke encephalopathy, recall that this condition is caused by thiamine deficiency, and then identify the enzyme whose activity is directly affected by thiamine and is used diagnostically for this deficiency. The pentose phosphate pathway and the role of transketolase are key elements.",
