    "en": "Experimental animals are immunized to protein fragments derived from peripheral nerve myelin. Subsequent analysis finds evidence of a T-cell response as well as production of autoantibodies against nonprotein antigens. This leads to segmental demyelination of peripheral nerves in the animals. The experimentally induced condition is most analogous to which of the following?",

    "en": "Demyelination of peripheral nerves in response to immune challenge with a myelin-like substance is a pathogenic mechanism similar to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS is thought to be due to molecular mimicry, in which an infectious agent contains a ganglioside-like substance in its lipopolysaccharide layer. Antibodies formed against this substance and activated T-cells cross-react with the ganglioside components of myelin and Schwann cells. Segmental demyelination and an endoneurial inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes and macrophages are seen on light microscopy. {{exhibit_1}} GBS manifests as ascending, symmetric muscle weakness that often occurs after a gastrointestinal (eg, Campylobacter jejuni) or upper respiratory infection. Deep tendon reflexes are decreased or absent (areflexia), and the paralysis may ascend to the cranial nerves (particularly cranial nerve VII). Paralysis of respiratory muscles is fatal without supportive care.\n\n(Choice A) Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked muscular dystrophy that affects boys and is caused by a frameshift mutation of the dystrophin gene. Clinical features include progressive weakness and a waddling gait with onset in childhood. Muscle biopsy shows degeneration of muscle fibers and replacement with fat and connective tissue; peripheral nerves are not involved.\n\n(Choice C) Lambert-Eaton syndrome, often seen as a paraneoplastic syndrome in patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung, presents with weakness that improves with muscular repetition. It is caused by autoantibodies that react with the voltage-gated calcium channels on the presynaptic membrane, hampering the release of acetylcholine. The axons are not affected.\n\n(Choice D) Beriberi (thiamine deficiency) is characterized by weakness, areflexia, pain, and paresthesias that are worse in the distal lower limbs. Beriberi can cause demyelination of peripheral nerves; however, unlike Guillain-Barré syndrome, no endoneurial inflammation is present.\n\n(Choice E) Subacute combined degeneration occurs due to vitamin B12 deficiency and leads to degeneration of dorsal columns and lateral cerebrospinal tracts. Patients develop distal, progressive weakness and ataxia but the symptoms are slowly progressive (unlike GBS, which progresses rapidly). In addition, subacute combined degeneration is associated with spasticity, paresthesias, and a macrocytic anemia.\n\n(Choice F) Werdnig-Hoffman syndrome (spinal muscle atrophy type 1) is due to degeneration of the anterior horn cells that is caused by a mutation in the SMN1 gene. Werdnig-Hoffman syndrome causes symmetric progressive weakness, but the weakness is more prominent proximal>distal and typically occurs in childhood.",
    "zh": "对类似于髓磷脂的物质进行免疫攻击而导致的周围神经脱髓鞘，是一种类似于格林-巴利综合征（GBS）的致病机制。GBS被认为是由分子模拟引起的，即感染因子在其脂多糖层中含有神经节苷脂样物质。针对这种物质形成的抗体和活化的T细胞会与髓磷脂和许旺细胞的神经节苷脂成分发生交叉反应。在光学显微镜下可见节段性脱髓鞘和由淋巴细胞和巨噬细胞组成的神经内膜炎症浸润。{{exhibit_1}} GBS表现为上升性、对称性肌肉无力，通常发生在胃肠道（例如，空肠弯曲菌）或上呼吸道感染后。深腱反射减弱或消失（反射消失），并且麻痹可能上升至脑神经（特别是脑神经VII）。在没有支持治疗的情况下，呼吸肌麻痹是致命的。\n\n（选项A）杜氏肌营养不良症是一种X连锁肌营养不良症，影响男孩，由肌营养不良蛋白基因的移码突变引起。临床特征包括进行性无力和蹒跚步态，起病于儿童时期。肌肉活检显示肌纤维变性并被脂肪和结缔组织取代；周围神经未受累。\n\n（选项C）兰伯特-伊顿综合征，通常见于小细胞肺癌患者的副肿瘤综合征，表现为肌无力，随着肌肉重复而改善。它是由与突触前膜上的电压门控钙离子通道反应的自身抗体引起的，从而阻碍乙酰胆碱的释放。轴突不受影响。\n\n（选项D）脚气病（硫胺素缺乏症）的特征是无力、反射消失、疼痛和感觉异常，这些症状在远端下肢更严重。脚气病可引起周围神经脱髓鞘；然而，与格林-巴利综合征不同，不存在神经内膜炎症。\n\n（选项E）亚急性联合变性发生于维生素B12缺乏，并导致背柱和侧脑脊髓束的变性。患者出现远端进行性无力和共济失调，但症状进展缓慢（与GBS不同，GBS进展迅速）。此外，亚急性联合变性与痉挛、感觉异常和大细胞性贫血有关。\n\n（选项F）脊髓性肌萎缩症（1型）是由于前角细胞变性所致，由SMN1基因突变引起。脊髓性肌萎缩症引起对称性进行性无力，但无力更明显近端>远端，通常发生在儿童时期。"
