    "en": "Cavernous hemangioma is the most common benign liver tumor, typically presenting in adults 30-50 years of age. These benign tumors are thought to be congenital malformations that enlarge by ectasia, not hyperplasia or hypertrophy. Hemangiomas may occur singly or in multiples and are well-circumscribed masses of spongy consistency, typically measuring less than 5 cm in width. Microscopically, these tumors consist of cavernous, blood-filled vascular spaces of variable size lined by a single epithelial layer (arrow). Coliagenous scars or fibrous nodules may be seen in association with thrombosis. Most patients are asymptomatic, although some will complain of abdominal pain and right upper quadrant fullness. Prognosis is usually excellent, with surgical resection an option for those patients who are symptomatic or who have compression of adjacent structures.\n\n(Choice A) On rare occasion, giant hemangiomas are found to be malignant vascular tumors. The vast majority of hemangiomas are benign lesions, however.\n\n(Choice C) Hepatic adenomas can regress with the discontinuation of oral contraceptives, but hemangiomas are not similarly affected.\n\n(Choice D) Hepatocellular carcinoma (not hemangioma) can be associated with hemochromatosis.\n\n(Choice E) Biopsy of a suspected hemangioma is not advisable, as the procedure has been known to cause fatal hemorrhage and is of low diagnostic yield.\n\nEducational objective:\nCavernous hemangioma is the most common benign liver tumor. Microscopically, these tumors consist of cavernous, blood-filled vascular spaces of variable size lined by a single epithelial layer. The biopsy of a suspected hemangioma is not advisable, as the procedure has been known to cause fatal hemorrhage and is of low diagnostic yield. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "海绵状血管瘤是最常见的良性肝肿瘤，通常见于 30-50 岁的成年人。这些良性肿瘤被认为是先天性畸形，通过扩张而非增生或肥大而增大。血管瘤可以单个或多个出现，是边界清楚的、海绵状的肿块，通常宽度小于 5 厘米。镜下，这些肿瘤由大小不等的充满血液的血管腔隙组成，腔隙由单层上皮细胞（箭头）衬覆。可观察到与血栓形成相关的胶原瘢痕或纤维结节。大多数患者无症状，但有些人会抱怨腹痛和右上腹饱胀感。预后通常良好，对于有症状或压迫邻近结构的患者，手术切除是一种选择。\n\n（选项 A）在极少数情况下，巨大血管瘤被发现是恶性血管肿瘤。然而，绝大多数血管瘤是良性病变。\n\n（选项 C）肝腺瘤可在停用口服避孕药后消退，但血管瘤不会受到类似影响。\n\n（选项 D）肝细胞癌（而非血管瘤）可能与血色病有关。\n\n（选项 E）不建议对疑似血管瘤进行活检，因为该手术已知会导致致命性出血，且诊断价值低。\n\n教育目的：\n海绵状血管瘤是最常见的良性肝肿瘤。镜下，这些肿瘤由大小不等的充满血液的血管腔隙组成，腔隙由单层上皮细胞衬覆。不建议对疑似血管瘤进行活检，因为该手术已知会导致致命性出血，且诊断价值低。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the characteristics, diagnosis, and management of cavernous hemangiomas, the most common benign liver tumor. It also assesses understanding of the risks associated with biopsy of these lesions.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the typical presentation and microscopic features of cavernous hemangiomas. Rule out other liver lesions based on clinical context and imaging. Remember that biopsy is generally avoided due to the risk of hemorrhage.",
