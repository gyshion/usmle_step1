    "en": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to severe headache, nausea, and vomiting for the past several hours. The headache is pounding and localized to the left side. She also describes bright spots in her vision prior to headache onset. The patient has had similar episodes occasionally since adolescence. Physical examination shows normal pupils and fundi, but the patient has discomfort to bright light. There is no facial droop, extremity weakness, or sensory loss. The patient is treated with metoclopramide and diphenhydramine. Which of the following is the most likely reason diphenhydramine was used in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient with a normal neurologic examination has unilateral headache associated with nausea and vomiting, photophobia, and a visual aura (eg, flashing lights), features that are consistent with MIGRAINE HEADACHE.\n\nSevere migraine headache with nausea and vomiting is typically treated with a serotonin 1B/1D agonist (ie, triptans) or a DOPAMINE RECEPTOR BLOCKER (eg, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) to abort the migraine and treat associated nausea and vomiting. Dopamine receptor blockers have both antiemetic and analgesic effects on migraine headaches by antagonizing central dopamine D2 RECEPTORS in the midbrain and striatum.\n\nDopamine receptor blockade in the basal ganglia can also cause excess cholinergic activity that manifests as significant EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS, such as ACUTE DYSTONIC REACTION (eg, torticollis, oculogyric crisis). Therefore, diphenhydramine can be co-administered with metoclopramide or prochlorperazine to prevent such reactions due to its anticholinergic activity. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) The 5HT3 receptor antagonists ondansetron and granisetron have a low risk of QT prolongation leading to torsade de pointes. However, administration of diphenhydramine does not decrease this risk.\n\n(Choice B) Metoclopramide has prokinetic activity (eg, enhances gastric emptying) and can be useful in the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with diabetic gastroparesis. However, administration of diphenhydramine would decrease this prokinetic effect due to its anticholinergic activity (eg, reduced gut motility).\n\n(Choice D) Diphenhydramine is a first-generation (H1) antihistamine used to treat urticaria, which can occur with allergic drug reactions. However, it is not used to prevent occurrence of allergic reactions.\n\n(Choice E) Rebound headache can occur with excessive use (>10 days a month) of certain abortive migraine medications (eg, triptans, analgesics). Dopamine receptor antagonists are not typically associated with rebound headache.",
    "zh": "该患者神经系统检查正常，伴有单侧头痛、恶心和呕吐、畏光和视觉先兆（例如闪光），这些特征与偏头痛相符。\n\n严重的偏头痛伴有恶心和呕吐通常用血清素1B/1D激动剂（即曲坦类药物）或多巴胺受体阻滞剂（例如甲氧氯普胺、氯丙嗪）治疗，以终止偏头痛并治疗相关的恶心和呕吐。多巴胺受体阻滞剂通过拮抗中脑和纹状体中的中枢多巴胺D2受体，对偏头痛具有止吐和镇痛作用。\n\n基底神经节中的多巴胺受体阻滞也可引起过度的胆碱能活性，表现为明显的锥体外系症状，如急性肌张力障碍反应（例如斜颈、眼球危象）。因此，苯海拉明可以与甲氧氯普胺或氯丙嗪合用，以防止因其抗胆碱能活性引起的此类反应。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项 A) 5HT3受体拮抗剂昂丹司琼和格拉司琼导致QT间期延长的风险较低，QT间期延长可导致尖端扭转型室速。然而，使用苯海拉明并不能降低这种风险。\n\n(选项 B) 甲氧氯普胺具有促动力活性（例如，增强胃排空），可用于治疗与糖尿病性胃轻瘫相关的恶心和呕吐。然而，使用苯海拉明会因其抗胆碱能活性（例如，减少肠道蠕动）而降低这种促动力作用。\n\n(选项 D) 苯海拉明是一种第一代（H1）抗组胺药，用于治疗荨麻疹，荨麻疹可发生于药物过敏反应。然而，它不用来预防过敏反应的发生。\n\n(选项 E) 反跳性头痛可发生在过度使用某些偏头痛急性治疗药物（>每月10天）（例如曲坦类药物、镇痛药）时。多巴胺受体拮抗剂通常与反跳性头痛无关。"
