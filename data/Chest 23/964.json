    "en": "A 3-year-old boy who recently immigrated to the United States is brought to the emergency department with fever, malaise, and a painful, swollen right knee. He is hypotensive and tachycardic. Medical history is significant for a recent episode of acute otitis media and several vaccinations that are not up to date. Arthrocentesis of the right knee shows cloudy synovial fluid. Gram stain of {{exhibit_1}} aspirate reveals pleomorphic, gram-negative coccobacilli. Cultures performed on a blood agar plate supplemented with a disk containing hematin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) grow colonies only near the disk. The organism responsible for this patient's condition most likely produces which of the following virulence factors?",

    "en": "The patient's presentation, including fever, malaise, swollen knee, and gram-negative coccobacilli on joint fluid analysis, is highly suggestive of septic arthritis caused by *Haemophilus influenzae*. The growth pattern on the blood agar plate, requiring both X factor (hematin) and V factor (NAD+), is characteristic of *H. influenzae*. Specifically, *H. influenzae* type b (Hib) is a significant cause of invasive disease, including septic arthritis, in unvaccinated children. The polysaccharide capsule of Hib is a major virulence factor that prevents phagocytosis, allowing the organism to evade the host immune system and cause invasive disease. The provided exhibit {{exhibit_2}} illustrates how the encapsulated bacterium is protected from phagocytosis. The other options are less likely: Cytotoxic exotoxins are not a primary virulence factor for *H. influenzae* causing this type of infection. Fimbriae are involved in attachment but are not the primary factor for invasive disease in this context. Hemolysins are produced by some bacteria but are not the key virulence factor for *H. influenzae* in septic arthritis. Hyaluronidase is an enzyme that aids in spread but is not the defining virulence factor for invasive *H. influenzae* disease.",
    "zh": "患者的临床表现，包括发烧、不适、膝盖肿胀以及关节液分析中的革兰阴性杆菌，高度提示由流感嗜血杆菌（*Haemophilus influenzae*）引起的化脓性关节炎。在血琼脂平板上的生长模式，需要X因子（血红素）和V因子（NAD+），是流感嗜血杆菌的特征。具体来说，b型流感嗜血杆菌（Hib）是未接种疫苗的儿童中侵袭性疾病（包括化脓性关节炎）的重要病因。Hib的多糖荚膜是主要的毒力因子，可防止吞噬作用，使病原体逃避免疫系统并引起侵袭性疾病。提供的{{exhibit_2}}说明了荚膜细菌如何受到保护免受吞噬作用。其他选项的可能性较小：细胞毒性外毒素不是导致此类感染的流感嗜血杆菌的主要毒力因子。菌毛参与附着，但不是在这种情况下侵袭性疾病的主要因素。溶血素由某些细菌产生，但不是流感嗜血杆菌在化脓性关节炎中的关键毒力因子。透明质酸酶是一种有助于扩散的酶，但不是侵袭性流感嗜血杆菌疾病的决定性毒力因子。"

Gram stain shows gram-negative coccobacilli, and cultures indicate the organism requires X and V factors for growth, consistent with *Haemophilus influenzae*. The most likely virulence factor responsible for invasive disease, such as septic arthritis, in *H. influenzae* is its polysaccharide capsule, which prevents phagocytosis.",
