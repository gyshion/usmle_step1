    "en": "Pathogenesis of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis {{exhibit_2}}\nIt is thought that alcohol-related chronic pancreatitis develops in part due to alcohol-induced secretion of protein-rich fluid. These proteinaceous secretions can precipitate within the pancreatic ducts, forming ductal plugs that may calcify and be detectable on abdominal imaging.\nDuctal obstruction by such concretions may cause exocrine insufficiency due to atrophy of the pancreatic acinar cells and pancreatic fibrosis. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (eg, failure to secrete adequate amylases, proteases, and lipases) leads to malabsorption with consequent diarrhea/steatorrhea. Weight loss and bulky, frothy stools are typical clinical findings. This patient's abdominal pain is most likely due to the pancreatitis itself.\n(Choice A) Bile salt malabsorption typically occurs with conditions affecting the terminal ileum (eg, ileal resection, Crohn ileitis). Patients may have diarrhea as a result of excessive bile salt accumulation in the colon (cholerheic enteropathy).\n(Choice C) Portal hypertension (eg, due to liver cirrhosis) causes varices at sites of portocaval anastomoses, leading to anorectal varices, caput medusae over the abdomen, and esophageal varices. Bleeding esophageal varices can cause hematemesis and melena. Ascites is another sign of portal hypertension.\n(Choice D) Gastrinomas (duodenal/pancreatic gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors) cause hydrochloric acid hypersecretion, which can result in multiple and/or refractory peptic ulcers. Patients may also have diarrhea/malabsorption as digestive enzymes become deactivated by high gastric acid output.\n(Choice E) Celiac disease classically presents with malabsorption due to immune-mediated enteropathy involving the proximal small intestine. This condition is triggered by the ingestion of foods containing gluten (eg, wheat).\n(Choice F) Chronic alcohol use may result in the interference of nutrient/vitamin absorption due to intestinal mucosal injury. However, this patient's abdominal pain and epigastric calcifications suggest that his diarrhea is most likely a consequence of chronic pancreatitis.",
    "zh": "慢性酒精性胰腺炎的发病机制 {{exhibit_2}}。\n据认为，酒精相关的慢性胰腺炎部分是由于酒精诱导分泌富含蛋白质的液体而发展起来的。这些蛋白质分泌物会在胰管内沉淀，形成管内栓子，可能发生钙化，并在腹部影像学检查中检测到。\n此类凝块引起的管道阻塞可能由于胰腺腺泡细胞萎缩和胰腺纤维化而导致外分泌功能不全。胰腺外分泌功能不全（例如，无法分泌足够的淀粉酶、蛋白酶和脂肪酶）导致吸收不良，进而引起腹泻/脂肪泻。体重减轻和大量泡沫状粪便是典型的临床表现。该患者的腹痛很可能由胰腺炎本身引起。\n（选项A）胆盐吸收不良通常发生在影响回肠末端（例如，回肠切除术、克罗恩病性回肠炎）的情况下。患者可能因结肠内胆盐过度积聚而出现腹泻（胆汁性肠病）。\n（选项C）门脉高压（例如，由肝硬化引起）导致门体分流吻合部位出现静脉曲张，从而导致肛门直肠静脉曲张、腹部脐周静脉曲张和食管静脉曲张。食管静脉曲张出血可引起呕血和黑便。腹水是门脉高压的另一个征象。\n（选项D）胃泌素瘤（十二指肠/胰腺胃泌素分泌神经内分泌肿瘤）引起盐酸过度分泌，这可能导致多发性和/或难治性消化性溃疡。患者也可能因消化酶被高胃酸输出量失活而出现腹泻/吸收不良。\n（选项E）乳糜泻通常表现为由于涉及近端小肠的免疫介导性肠病引起的吸收不良。这种情况是由摄入含有麸质的食物（例如，小麦）触发的。\n（选项F）长期饮酒可能由于肠黏膜损伤而导致营养素/维生素吸收受到干扰。然而，该患者的腹痛和剑突区钙化表明，他的腹泻很可能是慢性胰腺炎的后果。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of chronic pancreatitis, its etiology (alcohol abuse), clinical presentation (abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss), and diagnostic findings (epigastric calcifications). It also requires differentiating chronic pancreatitis from other causes of diarrhea and malabsorption.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's history of alcohol use and the presence of epigastric calcifications, which are suggestive of chronic pancreatitis. Rule out other causes of diarrhea based on their typical presentations and associated findings.",
