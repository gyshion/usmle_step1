    "en": "The distribution and appearance of this patient's rash is characteristic of scabies. Scabies is due to an infestation by Sarcoptes scabiei, a mite that burrows into the epidermis and deposits eggs. Weeks after initial infection, patients develop a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction to the mite, mite feces, and mite eggs. Presentation includes erythematous papules that are intensely pruritic, particularly at night. The classic distribution of lesions includes the extremities (eg, interdigital web spaces, flexor wrist surfaces, feet), axillae, umbilicus, and genitalia.\n\nScabies is highly contagious and spreads via direct person-to-person contact, and history often reveals a roommate or family member with a similar rash. Although less common, fomite transmission (eg, clothing) can also occur because mites survive 2-3 days off the skin.\n\n(Choice A) Folliculitis from exposure to water contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa presents as tender, pruritic papules or pustules on exposed areas, and symptoms typically self-resolve within 2 weeks. This patient's rash duration and distribution make this diagnosis unlikely.\n\n(Choice B) Incomplete vaccination against varicella-zoster virus (VZV) increases the risk for chickenpox, which presents with fever (not seen here) followed by a pruritic, vesicular rash. Lesions are not common on the soles, and the rash typically crusts over and resolves in 1-2 weeks. VZV reactivation can present as herpes zoster, which may begin as erythematous papules but are typically painful and limited to a single dermatome.\n\n(Choice C) Hiking in wooded areas increases the risk for poison ivy exposure or tick-borne diseases (eg, Lyme disease). Although contact dermatitis due to poison ivy causes an intensely pruritic rash, lesions are often linear (where the plant touched the skin) and on exposed surfaces. In addition, the rash typically resolves within 2-3 weeks. Lyme disease causes erythema migrans, an expanding macular rash not seen in this patient.\n\n(Choice E) Syphilis, which causes a painless genital ulcer, spreads via sexual contact, and manifestations of secondary syphilis include a maculopapular rash involving the palms and soles. Unlike this case, however, most patients also have constitutional symptoms (eg, fever) and lymphadenopathy.\n\nEducational objective:\nScabies causes an intensely pruritic, papular rash involving the hands, feet, and genitalia. Transmission is via direct person-to-person contact, and history often reveals a roommate or family member with a similar rash. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}",
    "zh": "该患者皮疹的分布和外观是疥疮的特征。疥疮是由疥螨（Sarcoptes scabiei）引起的感染，疥螨钻入表皮并产卵。初次感染几周后，患者对螨虫、螨虫粪便和螨虫卵产生迟发型IV型超敏反应。表现包括红斑性丘疹，奇痒难耐，尤其是在夜间。病变的典型分布包括四肢（例如，指间蹼、屈腕表面、足部）、腋窝、脐部和生殖器。\n\n疥疮具有高度传染性，通过直接的人际接触传播，病史中常显示室友或家庭成员有类似的皮疹。虽然不太常见，但也可以发生通过污染物（例如衣服）的传播，因为螨虫可以在离开皮肤后存活2-3天。\n\n（选项A）接触受铜绿假单胞菌污染的水引起的毛囊炎表现为暴露部位出现触痛性、瘙痒性丘疹或脓疱，并且症状通常在2周内自愈。该患者的皮疹持续时间和分布使该诊断不太可能。\n\n（选项B）未完成的针对水痘-带状疱疹病毒（VZV）的疫苗接种会增加患水痘的风险，水痘的症状为发烧（此处未见），随后出现瘙痒性水疱性皮疹。病变在足底并不常见，皮疹通常结痂并在1-2周内消退。VZV再激活可表现为带状疱疹，可能开始为红斑性丘疹，但通常疼痛并局限于单个皮节。\n\n（选项C）在树木繁茂的地区徒步旅行会增加接触毒葛或蜱传疾病（例如，莱姆病）的风险。尽管接触毒葛引起的接触性皮炎会引起奇痒难耐的皮疹，但病变通常呈线状（植物接触皮肤的地方）并位于暴露的表面。此外，皮疹通常在2-3周内消退。莱姆病引起游走性红斑，这是一种在该患者身上未见的扩展性斑丘疹。\n\n（选项E）梅毒会导致无痛的生殖器溃疡，通过性接触传播，二期梅毒的表现包括累及手掌和足底的斑丘疹。然而，与此病例不同的是，大多数患者也有全身症状（例如，发烧）和淋巴结病。\n\n教育目标：\n疥疮引起奇痒难耐的丘疹，累及手、足和生殖器。通过直接的人际接触传播，病史中常显示室友或家庭成员有类似的皮疹。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of scabies presentation, transmission, and diagnosis. It requires recognizing the characteristic pruritic rash involving specific body areas and understanding the importance of close contact in transmission.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key features of the rash (intense pruritus, distribution) and consider the transmission routes. The history of a roommate with a similar rash strongly supports the diagnosis of scabies due to its contagious nature.",
