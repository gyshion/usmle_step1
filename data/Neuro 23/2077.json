  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Lacunes are small (<15 mm) cavitary infarcts located within the basal ganglia, posterior limb of the internal capsule, pons, and cerebellum. The infarcts result from occlusion of the SMALL PENETRATING ARTERIES that supply these deep brain structures (eg, lenticulostriate arteries), most commonly in the setting of chronic uncontrolled HYPERTENSION or DIABETES MELLITUS.\n\nLipohyalinosis and microatheromas are believed to be the primary causes of lacunar infarcts. Lipohyalinosis occurs secondary to leakage of plasma proteins through damaged endothelium and is characterized by hyaline thickening of the vascular wall, collagenous sclerosis, and accumulation of mural foamy macrophages. Microatheromas result from atherosclerotic accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages within the intimal layer of a penetrating artery near its origin off the parent vessel. These changes predispose to small-vessel occlusion and infarction of CNS tissue with liquefactive necrosis and the formation of a fluid-filled cavity.\n\n(Choice A) Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the CNS. The CNS lesions in multiple sclerosis do not form cavities; instead, they appear grossly as pink patches in the white matter tracts.\n\n(Choices B and C) Embolism due to carotid atherosclerosis or mitral valve disease (eg, bacterial endocarditis) most commonly causes CORTICAL INFARCTS. Although small embolic fragments (ie, microemboli) released from atherosclerotic lesions or valvular disease may be the cause of some lacunar infarcts, lipohyalinosis/microatheromas are a much more common etiology.\n\n(Choice E) Malignant neoplasms tend to cause space-occupying lesions rather than small cavities. The center of a large tumor may cavitate due to insufficient perfusion, with resultant necrosis and hemorrhage.\n\nEducational objective:\nLacunar infarctions are the result of small-vessel occlusion (due to lipohyalinosis and microatheroma formation) in the penetrating vessels supplying the deep brain structures. Uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes mellitus are major risk factors for this condition.",
    "zh": "腔隙性梗死是指位于基底神经节、内囊后肢、脑桥和小脑内的小（<15 毫米）空洞性梗死。这些梗死是由于为这些脑深部结构（如豆纹动脉）供血的 小穿透动脉 闭塞所致，最常见于慢性、未控制的高血压或糖尿病。\\n\n脂肪透明变性和微动脉粥样硬化被认为是腔隙性梗死的主要原因。脂肪透明变性继发于血浆蛋白通过受损的内皮细胞渗漏，其特征是血管壁透明样增厚、胶原硬化和壁内泡沫巨噬细胞的积聚。微动脉粥样硬化是由于含脂巨噬细胞在穿透动脉起源于母血管的内膜层内发生动脉粥样硬化聚集所致。这些变化易导致小血管闭塞和中枢神经系统组织梗死，伴有液化性坏死和充满液体的空腔形成。\\n\n（选项 A）多发性硬化症是一种中枢神经系统的自身免疫性脱髓鞘疾病。多发性硬化症的中枢神经系统病变不会形成空腔；相反，它们在宏观上表现为白质束中的粉红色斑块。\\n\n（选项 B 和 C）由于颈动脉粥样硬化或二尖瓣疾病（如细菌性心内膜炎）引起的栓塞最常导致 皮质梗死。尽管来自动脉粥样硬化病变或瓣膜病的微小栓子（即微栓子）可能是某些腔隙性梗死的原因，但脂肪透明变性/微动脉粥样硬化是更常见的病因。\\n\n（选项 E）恶性肿瘤倾向于引起占位性病变而非小腔。由于灌注不足，大肿瘤的中心可能会空腔化，导致坏死和出血。\\n\n教育目标：\\n腔隙性梗死是为脑深部结构供血的穿透血管发生小血管闭塞（由于脂肪透明变性和微动脉粥样硬化形成）的结果。未控制的高血压和糖尿病是该病的主要危险因素。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of lacunar infarcts, their etiology (lipohyalinosis and microatheromas), and their association with chronic hypertension and diabetes mellitus. It also requires differentiating lacunar infarcts from other causes of brain lesions, such as multiple sclerosis, embolic infarcts, and malignant neoplasms.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the description of small cavities in deep brain structures as lacunar infarcts. Recall that lipohyalinosis and microatheromas are the primary causes, often linked to uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes. Eliminate other options based on their typical presentations and lesion characteristics.",
