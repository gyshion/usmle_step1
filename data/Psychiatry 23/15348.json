    "en": "A 61-year-old woman comes to the office due to insomnia. She has had difficulty falling asleep since her divorce was finalized 2 months ago and she relocated to a new state to be closer to her daughter and grandchildren. The patient's sleep is restless and she is frequently awakened by household noises. During this time, she has also felt anxious and tense. The patient is overwhelmed by financial worries and the responsibilities of living on her own. Although previously outgoing, she now avoids opportunities to meet new people and socializes only with her daughter. The patient has no psychiatric history but does have a history of hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine. Physical examination is unremarkable. TSH is 1.6 μIU/mL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient developed anxiety symptoms in the setting of a recent stressor (eg, divorce and relocation); the absence of previous anxiety and brief duration make ADJUSTMENT DISORDER the most appropriate diagnosis. Adjustment disorder involves emotional or behavioral symptoms (eg, anxiety, depression, disturbance of conduct) developing within 3 months of an IDENTIFIABLE stressor and lasting no longer than 6 months once the stressor or its consequences cease. Symptoms in an adjustment disorder must be DISTRESSING and IMPAIRING (eg, this patient seeks medical attention for insomnia and is socially isolative) but are insufficient to meet full criteria for another mental disorder.\n(Choice A) In acute stress disorder, the symptoms of re-experiencing (ie, intrusive memories and flashbacks), avoidance, negative mood, dissociation, and hyperarousal last from 3 days to 1 month following a life-threatening traumatic event. This patient's symptoms do not meet the criteria for this disorder, and her stressor is not life-threatening.\n(Choices C and E) Although untreated thyroid conditions and excessive doses of levothyroxine may cause mood and sleep disturbance, this patient's hypothyroidism is adequately controlled, as evidenced by her normal TSH level.\n(Choice D) Although anxiety, tension, and poor sleep are symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, this diagnosis requires that symptoms last ≥ 6 months.\n(Choice F) A normal stress response is differentiated from an adjustment disorder by milder symptoms, lack of marked distress, and lack of social or occupational impairment. This patient's significant distress and impairment make adjustment disorder the correct diagnosis.\nEducational objective: Adjustment disorder involves emotional or behavioral symptoms occurring within 3 months of an identifiable stressor. The diagnosis is indicated when the patient has significant distress and impairment but does not meet full criteria for another mental disorder.",
    "zh": "这位患者在最近的应激源（例如，离婚和搬迁）的情况下出现了焦虑症状；既往无焦虑史且病程较短，使得适应障碍成为最合适的诊断。适应障碍涉及在可识别的应激源发生后3个月内出现的 emotional 或 behavioral 症状（例如，焦虑、抑郁、行为障碍），并且一旦应激源或其后果停止，持续时间不超过6个月。适应障碍的症状必须是痛苦的且损害的（例如，该患者因失眠就医，且社会隔离），但不足以满足另一种精神疾病的全部诊断标准。\n(选项A) 在急性应激障碍中，再次体验症状（即，侵入性记忆和闪回）、回避、负面情绪、解离和过度警觉持续3天到1个月，发生于威胁生命的创伤事件之后。该患者的症状不符合此疾病的标准，并且她的应激源并非威胁生命的。\n(选项C和E) 尽管未经治疗的甲状腺疾病和过量剂量的左旋甲状腺素可能导致情绪和睡眠障碍，但该患者的甲状腺功能减退症得到了充分控制，这从她的正常TSH水平可以看出。\n(选项D) 虽然焦虑、紧张和睡眠差是广泛性焦虑障碍的症状，但此诊断需要症状持续≥6个月。\n(选项F) 正常应激反应与适应障碍的区别在于症状较轻，缺乏明显痛苦，以及缺乏社会或职业损害。该患者的明显痛苦和损害使得适应障碍成为正确的诊断。\n教育目标：适应障碍涉及在可识别的应激源发生后3个月内出现的 emotional 或 behavioral 症状。当患者有明显的痛苦和损害，但未满足另一种精神疾病的全部标准时，应诊断为适应障碍。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of adjustment disorder, its diagnostic criteria, and differentiation from other anxiety-related disorders and normal stress responses. It requires recognizing the presence of an identifiable stressor, the timing and nature of the symptoms, and the degree of distress and impairment.\nTo solve this question, identify the key elements of the clinical vignette: the precipitating stressor, the onset and duration of symptoms, the specific symptoms experienced, and the impact on the patient's functioning. Then, compare these findings to the diagnostic criteria for each of the provided options, paying close attention to the differentiating features of adjustment disorder.",
    "zh": "此问题考察对适应障碍的理解，包括其诊断标准以及与其他焦虑相关障碍和正常应激反应的区别。它要求识别可识别的应激源的存在、症状的时间和性质以及痛苦和损害的程度。\n要解决此问题，请确定临床摘要的关键要素：诱发应激源、症状的起病和持续时间、所经历的特定症状以及对患者功能的影响。然后，将这些发现与每个提供的选项的诊断标准进行比较，并密切注意适应障碍的鉴别特征。"
