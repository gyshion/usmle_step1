    "en": "This young patient has a history of recurrent respiratory infections caused by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive. These findings, along with a family history of early sibling death from pulmonary infection, suggest a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Steatorrhea and failure to thrive occur as a result of malabsorption due to obstructive fibrosis and progressive insufficiency of the exocrine pancreas. Pancreatic lipase supplementation is likely to improve this patient's condition by enhancing macronutrient and vitamin absorption.\n\n(Choice A) Agents that decrease gastrointestinal motility (eg, opiates such as loperamide) can help decrease the volume of diarrhea by slowing intestinal transit time and allowing greater net fluid resorption. However, antimotility agents would not improve the deficiencies in nutrient absorption.\n\n(Choice B) A gluten-free diet is the mainstay of treatment for celiac sprue but would be unlikely to help this patient's malabsorption.\n\n(Choice C) Metronidazole is effective only for diarrhea due to infectious causes (eg, giardiasis). This patient's diarrhea is more likely due to malabsorption secondary to cystic fibrosis.\n\n(Choice D) Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that decreases gut motility, blood flow, and endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function. Octreotide decreases secretion of pancreatic enzymes into the intestine and could therefore aggravate this patient's malabsorptive diarrhea and associated nutritional deficiencies.\n\n(Choice F) 5-aminosalicylates (eg, sulfasalazine, mesalamine) are used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. They work by inhibiting cytokine, prostaglandin, and leukotriene synthesis during inflammation. This patient's diarrhea and weight loss are not caused by inflammation.\n\nEducational objective:\nIn a young Caucasian patient, the combination of recurrent respiratory infections with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, diarrhea, and failure to thrive suggests a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis causes steatorrhea and failure to thrive due to malabsorption secondary to pancreatic insufficiency, which can be corrected by pancreatic enzyme supplementation.",
    "zh": "这位年轻患者有由绿脓杆菌引起的反复呼吸道感染、慢性腹泻和生长迟缓的病史。这些发现，以及早年因肺部感染而死亡的兄弟姐妹的家族史，提示诊断为囊性纤维化。脂肪泻和生长迟缓是由于梗阻性纤维化和外分泌胰腺进行性功能不全导致的吸收不良所致。补充胰脂肪酶可能会通过增强常量营养素和维生素的吸收来改善该患者的病情。\n\n（选项 A）减少胃肠蠕动的药物（例如，阿片类药物，如洛哌丁胺）可以通过减缓肠道转运时间并允许更大的净液体再吸收来帮助减少腹泻量。然而，止动剂不会改善营养吸收的不足。\n\n（选项 B）无麸质饮食是治疗乳糜泻的主要方法，但不太可能帮助该患者的吸收不良。\n\n（选项 C）甲硝唑仅对由感染引起的腹泻有效（例如，贾第虫病）。该患者的腹泻更可能是由于继发于囊性纤维化的吸收不良。\n\n（选项 D）奥曲肽是一种生长抑素类似物，可降低肠道蠕动、血流量以及内分泌和外分泌胰腺功能。奥曲肽减少胰酶向肠道的分泌，因此可能会加重该患者的吸收不良性腹泻和相关的营养缺乏症。\n\n（选项 F）5-氨基水杨酸盐（例如，柳氮磺胺吡啶、美沙拉嗪）用于治疗炎症性肠病，如克罗恩病和溃疡性结肠炎。它们通过在炎症期间抑制细胞因子、前列腺素和白三烯的合成而起作用。该患者的腹泻和体重减轻不是由炎症引起的。\n\n教育目标：\n在年轻的白种人患者中，反复呼吸道感染伴绿脓杆菌、腹泻和生长迟缓的组合提示诊断为囊性纤维化。囊性纤维化会导致脂肪泻和生长迟缓，这是由于继发于胰腺功能不全的吸收不良所致，可以通过补充胰酶来纠正。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cystic fibrosis presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment. The key is to recognize the classic triad of recurrent respiratory infections, chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive, along with the family history. \n\nThe best approach is to consider the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Given the suspicion for cystic fibrosis, the diarrhea and failure to thrive are likely due to pancreatic insufficiency, which can be addressed with pancreatic enzyme supplementation.",
