    "en": "A 27-year-old man is brought to a family therapist by his wife following a violent outburst in which he nearly injured her. They were having what seemed like a minor argument about her being late when he suddenly flew into a rage, started shouting, and threw several plates against the wall. His wife is now threatening to leave him because similar episodes keep happening despite his promise to control his anger. The patient is remorseful and says, \"I have been getting into trouble because of my temper since high school. Once I get angry, I feel out of control and it's impossible to stop.\" The patient has no medical history. He drinks beer and uses cannabis to relax approximately 2-3 times a month.",

    "en": "This patient's repetitive outbursts of impulsive aggression that are grossly disproportionate to the situation is suggestive of INTERMITTENT EXPLOSIVE DISORDER (IED), an impulse control disorder. Patients with IED often feel a sense of heightened arousal or tension that quickly escalates to rage and UNCONTROLLABLE IMPULSES to be verbally or PHYSICALLY AGGRESSIVE. Outbursts may provide an immediate sense of relief that is usually followed by remorse. Patients can be assaultive and destroy property, resulting in significant functional impairment due to interpersonal difficulties, school suspension, job loss, and legal problems.\n\nIED is not diagnosed if the violent behavior is premeditated or better explained as a manifestation of another disorder, such as a manic episode of bipolar disorder or substance intoxication. Treatment consists of cognitive-behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\n\n(Choices A and D) Aggressive behavior is common in antisocial personality disorder and conduct disorder, but it is often premeditated with the goal of intimidating others. This patient's behavior is not premeditated, and he does not show other antisocial features such as lawbreaking, lying, chronic irresponsibility, and lack of remorse. Conduct disorder is diagnosed in children, whereas antisocial personality disorder is diagnosed in patients age ≥18.\n\n(Choice B) Patients with acute mania can be verbally or physically aggressive. However, this patient does not show other features of mania necessary for this diagnosis (ie, euphoric mood, increased energy and goal-directed activity, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, grandiosity).\n\n(Choice C) Patients with borderline personality disorder may become enraged in response to interpersonal conflicts but are not typically aggressive physically. This patient lacks other characteristic borderline features (eg, suicidal behavior, feelings of emptiness, fears of abandonment).\n\n(Choice E) Patients with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder may also present with frequent verbal or physical outbursts. However, this is a childhood diagnosis that requires an onset age <10 and persistent irritability or anger between episodes.\n\n(Choice G) Phencyclidine intoxication can present with violent behavior and is typically associated with nystagmus. It is unlikely to explain his pattern of impulsive, angry outbursts since high school.\n\nEducational objective: Intermittent explosive disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of explosive verbal or physical aggression. The aggressive behaviors are impulsive and grossly out of proportion to the provocation.",
    "zh": "该患者反复出现与情况严重不符的冲动性攻击爆发，提示为间歇性爆发障碍 (IED)，这是一种冲动控制障碍。 IED 患者通常会感到高度兴奋或紧张，并迅速升级为愤怒和无法控制的冲动，从而导致言语或身体攻击。爆发可能会带来即时的缓解感，但通常随后是悔恨。患者可能会攻击他人并破坏财产，由于人际关系困难、停学、失业和法律问题，导致严重的社会功能损害。\n\n如果暴力行为是有预谋的，或者更能解释为另一种障碍的表现，例如双相情感障碍的躁狂发作或物质中毒，则不诊断为 IED。治疗包括认知行为疗法和选择性血清素再摄取抑制剂的药物治疗。\n\n（选项 A 和 D）攻击性行为在反社会型人格障碍和品行障碍中很常见，但通常是有预谋的，目的是恐吓他人。该患者的行为并非有预谋的，并且他没有表现出其他反社会特征，例如违法、撒谎、长期不负责任和缺乏悔恨。品行障碍在儿童中诊断，而反社会型人格障碍在年龄 ≥18 岁的患者中诊断。\n\n（选项 B）患有急性躁狂症的患者可能会出现言语或身体攻击。但是，该患者没有表现出此诊断所需的其他躁狂特征（即，欣快情绪、精力增加和目标导向活动、睡眠需求减少、语速快、夸大妄想）。\n\n（选项 C）边缘型人格障碍患者可能会因人际冲突而暴怒，但通常不会出现身体攻击。该患者缺乏其他典型的边缘型特征（例如，自杀行为、空虚感、害怕被抛弃）。\n\n（选项 E）破坏性心境失调障碍患者也可能表现为频繁的言语或身体爆发。然而，这是一种儿童诊断，需要发病年龄 <10 岁，并且在发作之间持续存在易怒或愤怒。\n\n（选项 G）苯环利定中毒可表现为暴力行为，并且通常与眼球震颤有关。它不太可能解释他自高中以来冲动、愤怒爆发的模式。\n\n教育目标：间歇性爆发障碍的特征是反复出现爆发性言语或身体攻击。攻击性行为是冲动的，并且与挑衅行为严重不成比例。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the diagnosis of impulse control disorders, specifically differentiating Intermittent Explosive Disorder from other conditions that may present with aggression or outbursts. It requires understanding the core features of IED, such as impulsivity, disproportionate aggression, and remorse, and contrasting them with the diagnostic criteria of other psychiatric disorders.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully analyze the patient's presentation, focusing on the nature of the outbursts (impulsive vs. premeditated), the trigger (minor argument), the severity (violent, nearly injured wife), the pattern (recurrent, since high school), and the patient's subjective experience (feeling out of control, remorse). Then, systematically rule out other diagnoses based on their defining characteristics and the absence of those features in the patient's vignette.",
