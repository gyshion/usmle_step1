    "en": "A 46-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to progressive dyspnea over the last 2 days. The patient's exercise tolerance has decreased dramatically and she had to sleep in a sitting position last night. She has no history of cardiovascular disease. The patient does not use tobacco or alcohol. Family history is unremarkable. Blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg and pulse is 105/min and regular. The apical impulse is hyperdynamic. Cardiac auscultation reveals a diminished S1 and an apical holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla. Diffuse pulmonary crackles are heard bilaterally. There is no peripheral edema. ECG shows sinus tachycardia but is otherwise unremarkable. Which of the following would most likely increase the ratio of forward flow volume to regurgitant flow volume in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient's dyspnea, orthopnea, and crackles on lung auscultation are consistent with decompensated left-sided heart failure; the apical holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla suggests MITRAL REGURGITATION (MR) as a contributing factor. In patients with MR, some of the blood in the left ventricle is pumped forward through the aortic valve (forward stroke volume), and some is forced backward through the incompetent mitral valve (regurgitant stroke volume). The amount of blood flowing down each pathway is determined by the relative contribution of the resistance of each pathway to the total left ventricular afterload:\n\n*   Resistance to forward flow is primarily determined by the pressure in the aorta (systolic blood pressure).\n*   Resistance to regurgitant flow is determined by the mitral valve orifice size during systole and the degree of left atrial compliance. In chronic MR, the left atrium becomes more compliant and the lower left atrial pressures facilitate greater regurgitant flow.\n\nLeft atrial pressure remains relatively constant over the short term, but aortic pressure can vary significantly with changes in SYSTEMIC VASCULAR RESISTANCE. A reduction in systemic vascular resistance leads to reduced systemic blood pressure and an increase in the ratio of forward to regurgitant blood flow. Pharmacologic vasodilators (eg, nitroprusside) therefore help to increase forward cardiac output and reduce pulmonary congestion in patients with MR.\n\n(Choices A and E) A decrease in heart rate leads to an increase in venous return to the left ventricle (preload) due to increased diastolic filling time. This causes an absolute increase in both forward and regurgitant blood flow (stroke volume increases in accordance with the Frank-Starling mechanism), but the ratio of forward to regurgitant flow is unlikely to significantly change.\n\n(Choice C) A reduction in venous return to the left ventricle decreases stroke volume with absolute reductions in both forward and regurgitant flow, but is unlikely to significantly affect the ratio of forward to regurgitant flow.\n\n(Choice D) An increase in left ventricular contractility increases stroke volume and leads to an increase in both forward and regurgitant blood flow. However again, as the relative resistance of each pathway is unchanged, the ratio of forward to regurgitant blood flow remains essentially the same.\n\nEducational objective:\nIn patients with mitral regurgitation, left ventricular afterload is determined by the balance of resistance between forward flow (aortic pressure) and regurgitant flow (left atrial pressure). A reduction in systemic vascular resistance increases the ratio of forward to regurgitant blood flow and improves cardiac output. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该患者的呼吸困难、端坐呼吸和肺部听诊的爆裂音与失代偿性左心衰竭一致；向腋窝放射的心尖全收缩期杂音提示二尖瓣反流(MR)是一个促成因素。在MR患者中，左心室中的一部分血液通过主动脉瓣向前泵出（前向射血量），一部分血液被迫通过功能不全的二尖瓣向后流出（反流射血量）。流经每条途径的血量取决于每条途径的阻力对总左心室后负荷的相对贡献：\n\n*   前向血流的阻力主要由主动脉内的压力（收缩压）决定。\n*   反流的阻力由收缩期二尖瓣口的大小和左心房顺应性决定。在慢性MR中，左心房变得更顺应，较低的左心房压力促进更大的反流。\n\n左心房压力在短期内保持相对恒定，但主动脉压力会随着全身血管阻力（SYSTEMIC VASCULAR RESISTANCE）的变化而发生显着变化。全身血管阻力的降低会导致全身血压降低，并增加正向血流量与反流血流量之比。因此，药物性血管扩张剂（例如，硝普钠）有助于增加MR患者的正向心输出量，并减轻肺充血。\n\n（选项A和E）心率降低会导致静脉回流到左心室的增加（前负荷），这是由于舒张充盈时间延长所致。这会导致前向和反流血流量的绝对增加（射血量根据Frank-Starling机制增加），但正向血流量与反流血流量之比不太可能发生显着变化。\n\n（选项C）静脉回流到左心室的减少会降低射血量，并导致前向和反流血流量的绝对减少，但不太可能显着影响正向血流量与反流血流量之比。\n\n（选项D）左心室收缩力的增加会增加射血量，并导致前向和反流血流量的增加。然而，同样，由于每条途径的相对阻力没有变化，正向血流量与反流血流量之比基本保持不变。\n\n教学目标：\n在二尖瓣反流患者中，左心室后负荷由前向血流（主动脉压力）和反流（左心房压力）之间的阻力平衡决定。全身血管阻力的降低增加了正向血流量与反流血流量之比，并改善了心输出量。{{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of mitral regurgitation pathophysiology and how afterload affects forward and regurgitant flow volumes. The key is understanding that decreasing systemic vascular resistance (SVR) reduces aortic pressure, which in turn decreases the resistance to forward flow, thereby increasing the ratio of forward to regurgitant flow in mitral regurgitation.",
