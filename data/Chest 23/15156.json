    "en": "An 8-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department due to worsening shortness of breath and chest tightness for the past 2 hours. On physical examination, the patient speaks in short sentences. Lung auscultation reveals diffuse wheezing. During the evaluation, the patient is instructed to take a deep breath and blow as hard as possible into the mouthpiece of a hand-held device. The measured airflow rate is significantly lower than expected. Treatment with an inhaled medication is begun. A repeat evaluation several minutes later shows an increase in the airflow rate.",
    "zh": "一名8岁女孩因过去2小时呼吸困难和胸闷加重而被送往急诊科。体格检查显示，患者说话断断续续。肺部听诊显示弥漫性喘息。在评估期间，指示患者深吸一口气，然后尽可能用力地吹入手持设备的吹嘴。测得的气流速率明显低于预期。开始使用吸入药物治疗。几分钟后的复查显示气流速率增加。"

    "en": "This patient's acute-onset shortness of breath and chest tightness are consistent with the AIRWAY SPASM and BRONCHOCONSTRICTION that occurs in ASTHMA. She received a BRONCHODILATOR to reduce airway resistance and increase airway flow. In asthma, bronchodilation is typically accomplished with a BETA-2 RECEPTOR AGONIST (eg, albuterol); these drugs work by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells, leading to an increase in cyclic AMP and consequent SMOOTH MUSCLE RELAXATION (decrease in smooth muscle tone).\n\n(Choices A and B) Corticosteroids, both inhaled (eg, budesonide, fluticasone) and systemic (eg, prednisone), modify gene transcription to reduce the airway inflammatory response in patients with asthma. Corticosteroids are also used to stimulate alveolar surfactant production and reduce the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants.\n\n(Choice D) Inhaled antibiotics (eg, tobramycin) are used to reduce lower-airway bacterial load in patients with cystic fibrosis.\n\n(Choice E) Several medications, including endothelin receptor antagonists (eg, bosentan), phosphodiesterase inhibitors (eg, sildenafil), and prostacyclin analogs, are used to lower pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of asthma pathophysiology and the mechanism of action of bronchodilators, specifically beta-2 agonists. It requires understanding how these medications reverse bronchoconstriction to improve airflow.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the patient's asthma presentation and linking the inhaled medication (likely a beta-2 agonist) to its effect on bronchial smooth muscle tone, leading to relaxation and increased airflow. {{exhibit_1}}",
