    "en": "Researchers are studying various cellular processes in normal and diseased states to find new anticancer drug targets. They develop a medication that inhibits an intracellular enzyme that converts adenosine to inosine. With drug use, accumulation of enzyme substrates in the neoplastic cells leads to DNA strand breaks and subsequent apoptosis.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is a highly conserved enzyme that plays a crucial role in purine metabolism. ADA removes the amino group from adenosine/deoxyadenosine and replaces it with a keto group, leading to the formation of inosine/deoxyinosine. These compounds are subsequently converted into nontoxic waste products (hypoxanthine and uric acid) and are excreted.\n\nADA inhibition results in the metabolism of deoxyadenosine through an alternate pathway, whereby it is phosphorylated into the toxic metabolite deoxyadenosine triphosphate. Elevated intracellular levels of deoxyadenosine triphosphate activate the caspase system and also inhibit ribonucleotide reductase from converting ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, which depletes cells of DNA precursors. This ultimately results in the inhibition of DNA synthesis/repair and subsequent apoptosis.\n\nAlthough all human cells contain ADA, developing lymphocytes are among the most mitotically active cells; the inhibition/absence of ADA is highly LYMPHOCTOTOXIC. Therefore, ADA inhibitors (eg, cladribine) can be used to treat LYMPHOCYTE-DERIVED cancers such as hairy cell leukemia. Similarly, children born with mutations to both ADA genes have dramatic B- and T-lymphocyte impairment, leading to the most severe form of severe combined immunodeficiency. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices B, C, and E) Malignant melanoma is an aggressive melanocyte tumor that metastasizes early and is associated with high mortality rates when diagnosed at an advanced stage. Ovarian teratoma is an ovarian germ cell tumor that can be benign (mature) or malignant (immature). Soft tissue sarcoma is a mesenchymal tumor that tends to grow slowly over time. These tumors are not derived from lymphocytes cells and are not generally responsive to ADA inhibition.\n\n(Choice D) Small cell lung cancer is a fast-growing neuroendocrine tumor that is most common in smokers. Fast-growing tumors are more likely to express elevated levels of ADA; however, ADA inhibition is primarily cytotoxic to lymphocyte-derived tumors and has not been shown to be of significant benefit to other cancer types.\n\nEducational objective:\nAdenosine deaminase (ADA) inhibition/absence is highly lymphocytotoxic. Medications that block ADA are used to treat lymphocyte-derived cancers. Inherited gene mutations in ADA lead to the autosomal recessive disease of severe combined immunodeficiency.",
    "zh": "腺苷脱氨酶 (ADA) 是一种高度保守的酶，在嘌呤代谢中起关键作用。ADA从腺苷/脱氧腺苷中去除氨基，并用酮基取代，从而形成肌苷/脱氧肌苷。这些化合物随后转化为无毒的废物（次黄嘌呤和尿酸）并被排出。\n\nADA 抑制导致脱氧腺苷通过另一条途径代谢，即被磷酸化为有毒代谢物脱氧腺苷三磷酸。细胞内脱氧腺苷三磷酸水平升高会激活半胱天冬酶系统，并抑制核糖核苷酸还原酶将核糖核苷酸转化为脱氧核糖核苷酸，从而耗尽细胞中的 DNA 前体。这最终导致DNA合成/修复的抑制和随后的细胞凋亡。\n\n虽然所有人类细胞都含有 ADA，但发育中的淋巴细胞是增殖活性最高的细胞之一；ADA的抑制/缺失具有高度的淋巴细胞毒性。因此，ADA 抑制剂（例如，克拉屈滨）可用于治疗淋巴细胞来源的癌症，如毛细胞白血病。同样，出生时ADA基因均发生突变的儿童有显著的 B 细胞和 T 细胞功能障碍，导致最严重的重症联合免疫缺陷病。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项 B、C 和 E）恶性黑色素瘤是一种侵袭性黑素细胞肿瘤，早期发生转移，晚期诊断时死亡率高。卵巢畸胎瘤是一种卵巢生殖细胞肿瘤，可为良性（成熟）或恶性（未成熟）。软组织肉瘤是一种间充质肿瘤，随着时间的推移往往生长缓慢。这些肿瘤并非源自淋巴细胞，通常对 ADA 抑制反应不佳。\n\n（选项 D）小细胞肺癌是一种生长迅速的神经内分泌肿瘤，在吸烟者中最常见。生长迅速的肿瘤更有可能表达高水平的 ADA；然而，ADA 抑制主要对淋巴细胞来源的肿瘤具有细胞毒性，并且尚未显示出对其他类型癌症有显著益处。\n\n教育目标：\n腺苷脱氨酶 (ADA) 抑制/缺失具有高度的淋巴细胞毒性。阻断 ADA 的药物用于治疗淋巴细胞来源的癌症。ADA 中的遗传基因突变会导致常染色体隐性遗传疾病——重症联合免疫缺陷病。"
