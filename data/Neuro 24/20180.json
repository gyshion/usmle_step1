    "en": "A 2-day-old girl is brought to the office for her initial newborn visit. The patient was born at 39 weeks gestation via a difficult home delivery. Birth weight was 4 kg (8 lb 13 oz). The parents report that the infant has been breastfeeding well but has been only minimally moving her right arm compared to the left. Vital signs are normal. On examination, the right upper extremity is held in adduction and internal rotation with the elbow extended, forearm pronated, and wrist flexed. Moro and biceps reflexes are absent in the right arm; grasp reflex is intact. The remainder of the examination is normal. Which of the following is the most likely site of this patient's injury?",

    "en": "This patient most likely has an injury to the C5 and C6 nerve roots of the brachial plexus, causing Erb-Duchenne palsy. Infants with Erb-Duchenne palsy have weakness of the deltoid and infraspinatus muscles (innervated by C5) and the biceps and wrist extensors (innervated by C6). This leads to predominance of the opposing muscles and results in the affected arm being held in adduction and internal rotation with the forearm pronated and the wrist flexed (ie, waiter's tip posture). In some patients, the C7 nerve root is also involved, leading to weak finger extension and fingers held in a flexed position. Patients typically have decreased or absent Moro and biceps reflexes, but the grasp reflex remains intact.\n\nIn this patient, the brachial plexus injury likely occurred during the difficult home delivery. Erb-Duchenne palsy is commonly associated with shoulder dystocia, which occurs when the fetal shoulder becomes impacted behind the pubic symphysis during delivery, possibly resulting in excessive traction on the head and neck and injury to the brachial plexus nerve roots.\n\n(Choice A) Hemisection of the cervical spinal cord can cause Brown-Séquard syndrome, which is characterized by ipsilateral hemiparesis at and below the level of the spinal cord injury (along with sensory deficits). In contrast to Erb-Duchenne palsy, Brown-Séquard syndrome would cause upper and lower extremity hemiparesis.\n\n(Choice C) Injury to the C8 and T1 nerve roots results in Klumpke palsy, which is characterized by loss of wrist/metacarpophalangeal joint flexion and interphalangeal joint extension, leading to clawhand posture and absent (vs intact) grasp reflex.\n\n(Choice D) A medial cord injury affects the median and ulnar nerves. In addition to innervating the wrist flexors, the median and ulnar nerves innervate all the intrinsic muscles of the hand. Injury would lead to wrist extension (vs flexion) and an absent (vs intact) grasp reflex.\n\n(Choice E) A posterior cord injury would cause axillary and radial nerve deficits. Although this would lead to arm adduction and internal rotation (loss of axillary-innervated deltoid and teres minor function) and wrist flexion (loss of radial-innervated wrist extension), a posture of elbow flexion (loss of radial-innervated elbow extension) would be expected.",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有臂丛神经 C5 和 C6 神经根损伤，导致 Erb-Duchenne 麻痹。患有 Erb-Duchenne 麻痹的婴儿出现三角肌和冈下肌（由 C5 支配）以及肱二头肌和腕伸肌（由 C6 支配）的无力。这导致对抗肌的占优势，并导致受影响的臂处于内收和内旋位，前臂旋前，腕部屈曲（即，服务员尖端姿势）。在某些患者中，C7 神经根也受累，导致手指伸展无力，手指处于屈曲位。患者通常表现为 Moro 氏和肱二头肌反射减弱或消失，但抓握反射保持完整。\n\n在该患者中，臂丛神经损伤很可能发生在困难的家庭分娩期间。 Erb-Duchenne 麻痹通常与肩难产有关，肩难产是指胎儿肩膀在分娩期间撞击在耻骨联合后方，这可能导致头部和颈部过度牵引并损伤臂丛神经根。\n\n(选项 A) 颈髓半切可引起 Brown-Séquard 综合征，其特征是在脊髓损伤水平及以下出现同侧轻偏瘫（伴有感觉缺陷）。与 Erb-Duchenne 麻痹相比，Brown-Séquard 综合征会导致上肢和下肢轻偏瘫。\n\n(选项 C) C8 和 T1 神经根损伤会导致 Klumpke 麻痹，其特征是腕/掌指关节屈曲和指间关节伸展丧失，导致爪形手姿势和抓握反射消失（对比完整）。\n\n(选项 D) 内侧束损伤会影响正中神经和尺神经。除了支配腕屈肌外，正中神经和尺神经还支配手的所有内在肌。损伤会导致腕伸展（对比屈曲）和抓握反射消失（对比完整）。\n\n(选项 E) 后束损伤会导致腋神经和桡神经缺陷。虽然这会导致手臂内收和内旋（腋神经支配的三角肌和冈下肌功能丧失）和腕屈曲（桡神经支配的腕伸展丧失），但预计肘部屈曲（桡神经支配的肘伸展丧失）的姿势。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of brachial plexus injuries in neonates, specifically differentiating Erb-Duchenne palsy from other types of nerve injuries based on clinical presentation and affected nerve roots. It requires correlating specific muscle weaknesses and reflex abnormalities with the anatomical location of the injury within the brachial plexus.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the characteristic posture and reflex deficits described in the vignette, recognize the \"waiter's tip\" posture, and then map these findings to the specific nerve roots (C5 and C6) responsible for innervating the affected muscles and reflexes.",
