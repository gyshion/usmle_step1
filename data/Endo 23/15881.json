    "en": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the office for follow-up of type 2 diabetes mellitus. She was diagnosed with diabetes 6 months ago. Lifestyle modification was initially advised, but the patient had no significant glycemic improvement. One month ago, the patient was started on metformin; however, she has been experiencing abdominal discomfort and diarrhea attributed to the therapy. She has no other medical conditions. BMI is 28 kg/m². Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory tests show hemoglobin A1c is 8.2%. After further discussion and with medication affordability taken into consideration, metformin is discontinued and glipizide is prescribed. Compared to metformin, this new therapy is most likely to increase the risk of which of the following?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Sulfonylureas inhibit the ATP-sensitive potassium channel on the pancreatic beta cell membrane, inducing depolarization and L-type calcium channel opening. The increased Ca²+ influx stimulates beta cell INSULIN RELEASE independent of blood glucose concentrations (eg, even when blood glucose levels are normal or low). Therefore, a main associated risk is HYPOGLYCEMIA. Circumstances that can lead to hypoglycemia include exercise, missed meals, or initiation of additional antidiabetic medications. Longer-acting sulfonylureas (eg, glyburide) are more prone to causing hypoglycemia than shorter-acting drugs (eg, glipizide) and are therefore not preferred.\n\n(Choice A) Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) helps regulate glucose by slowing gastric emptying and increasing insulin release in response to food intake. Pharmacologic GLP-1 agonists (eg, exenatide) lower blood glucose and promote weight loss; these agents are associated with acute pancreatitis.\n\n(Choice B) In patients with poor oral intake (eg, gastroenteritis) or in those who are on concurrent diuretics (eg, furosemide), osmotic diuresis caused by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors can lead to additional dehydration, resulting in acute kidney injury. In the long term, however, SGLT2 inhibitors have renoprotective effects and are recommended in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\n\n(Choice D) Metformin can decrease absorption of vitamin B₁₂, leading to B₁₂ deficiency in long-term use. Sulfonylureas do not have a significant effect on vitamin B₁₂ metabolism.\n\n(Choice E) SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, dapagliflozin) decrease renal reabsorption of glucose, leading to increased urinary glucose loss and lower blood glucose levels. The excess glucose in the urine can increase the risk of urinary tract infections and vulvovaginal candidiasis.\n\nEducational objective:\nSulfonylureas inhibit the ATP-sensitive potassium channel on the pancreatic beta cell membrane, inducing depolarization and L-type calcium channel opening. The increased Ca²+ influx stimulates beta cell insulin release independent of blood glucose concentrations, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia when meals are missed or during exercise.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the adverse effects of different antidiabetic medications, specifically comparing metformin to sulfonylureas like glipizide. It requires understanding the mechanisms of action and potential complications of each drug class.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that sulfonylureas stimulate insulin release regardless of blood glucose levels, leading to a higher risk of hypoglycemia compared to metformin, which primarily reduces hepatic glucose production and increases peripheral glucose uptake.",
