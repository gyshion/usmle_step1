    "en": "A 58-year-old woman is postoperative day 1 from a robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy with extensive lymph node dissection for endometrial adenocarcinoma. The patient reports burning abdominal pain that tracks to her inner thigh. The pain significantly increases with cough or sneeze, and there has been no relief with pain medication. On physical examination, there is decreased sensation over the inner thigh and mons pubis, but sensation is intact over the gluteal region. The laparoscopic port sites are clean and intact, but they are very tender to palpation and low on the abdomen. Injection of local anesthetic 3 cm from the anterior superior iliac spine provides immediate relief. Which of the following nerves is most likely injured?",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is C. During gynecologic-based laparoscopic procedures, ports are placed on the anterior abdominal wall between the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS). Because the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves course through the abdominal oblique muscles near the ASIS, they are at risk for injury during laparoscopic surgery. In these cases, nerve injury is usually due to nerve entrapment rather than complete nerve transection. Therefore, patients typically have paresthesia or sharp burning pain that is worse with increased intraabdominal pressure (which increases pressure around the entrapped nerve) and improves with abdominal flexion (which decreases pressure around the nerve).\n\nAlthough the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves have a similar course over the anterior abdominal wall near the ASIS, they can be distinguished based on the location of the sensory deficits:\n\n*   The iliohypogastric nerve arises from T12-L1 nerve roots and innervates the skin overlying the suprapubic/hypogastric and lateral gluteal regions. Therefore, patients with this injury classically have decreased sensation over the gluteal region (not seen in this patient) (Choice B).\n\n*   In contrast, the ilioinguinal nerve arises from the L1 nerve root and innervates the labia majora (anterior scrotum), mons pubis (base of penis), and medial thigh, resulting in sensory denervation in these regions.\n\nWhen injury to these nerves is suspected, diagnosis can be confirmed if local anesthetic injected close to the ASIS resolves the symptoms.\n\n(Choice A) The superior hypogastric plexus is connected to the inferior hypogastric plexus via the hypogastric nerve, which transmits sympathetic input to pelvic viscera. Direct nerve injury during laparoscopic pelvic surgery is uncommon; however, the inferior plexus can be injured during hysterectomy, resulting in short-term postoperative urinary retention.\n\n(Choice D) Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injury typically results in sensory loss to the anterior and lateral thigh. It runs along the posterior abdominal wall and can be injured during pelvic lymph node dissection. However, injury to this nerve is unlikely in this patient whose symptoms improved after local anesthetic injection over the anterior abdominal wall.\n\n(Choice E) Pudendal nerve injury can occur during operative vaginal deliveries because the pudendal nerve courses around the ischial spine. This injury classically presents with perineal pain that worsens with sitting.\n\nEducational objective:\nDuring gynecologic laparoscopic surgery, the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves are at risk for injury. Patients with an ilioinguinal nerve injury typically have paresthesia to the upper medial thigh, mons pubis, and labia majora.",
    "zh": "正确答案是C。在妇科腹腔镜手术中，穿刺孔位于髂前上棘(ASIS)之间的腹前壁上。由于髂腹下神经和髂腹股沟神经在ASIS附近的腹斜肌中走行，因此在腹腔镜手术中存在损伤风险。在这些情况下，神经损伤通常是由于神经卡压而不是完全的神经切断。因此，患者通常会出现感觉异常或剧烈灼痛，并且随着腹内压的增加而加重（这会增加被卡压神经周围的压力），并且随着腹部屈曲而改善（这会降低神经周围的压力）。\n\n尽管髂腹下神经和髂腹股沟神经在ASIS附近的腹前壁上走行相似，但可以根据感觉缺失的位置进行区分：\n\n*   髂腹下神经起自T12-L1神经根，支配覆盖耻骨上/下腹和臀外侧区域的皮肤。因此，患有这种损伤的患者通常会出现臀部区域感觉减退（在本患者中未见）（选项B）。\n\n*   相比之下，髂腹股沟神经起自L1神经根，支配大阴唇（阴囊前部）、阴阜（阴茎底部）和大腿内侧，导致这些区域的感觉神经支配缺失。\n\n当怀疑这些神经受损时，如果将局部麻醉剂注入靠近ASIS的位置可缓解症状，即可确诊。\n\n（选项A）上腹下丛通过下腹神经与下腹下丛相连，下腹神经将交感神经输入传递到盆腔内脏。在腹腔镜盆腔手术中直接神经损伤并不常见；然而，在子宫切除术中，下丛可能会受到损伤，导致短期术后尿潴留。\n\n（选项D）股外侧皮神经损伤通常导致大腿前部和外侧感觉丧失。它沿着腹后壁走行，在盆腔淋巴结清扫术中可能受损。然而，对于这种在腹前壁注射局部麻醉剂后症状有所改善的患者来说，这种神经损伤不太可能发生。\n\n（选项E）阴部神经损伤可能发生在产钳阴道分娩中，因为阴部神经绕着坐骨棘走行。这种损伤的典型表现为会阴疼痛，坐着时加重。\n\n教育目标：\n在妇科腹腔镜手术中，髂腹股沟神经和髂腹下神经有损伤风险。髂腹股沟神经损伤的患者通常会出现大腿内侧上部、阴阜和大阴唇感觉异常。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of iatrogenic nerve injuries that can occur during laparoscopic gynecologic surgery, specifically focusing on the sensory innervation patterns of the anterior abdominal wall nerves and their clinical presentation. It requires correlating the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings with the anatomical distribution of specific nerves.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the anatomical location of the laparoscopic ports and the potential nerves at risk. Then, by carefully analyzing the sensory deficits described (inner thigh and mons pubis) and the relief obtained with local anesthetic injection near the ASIS, the most likely injured nerve can be identified by matching the symptoms to the known innervation territories of the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves.",
