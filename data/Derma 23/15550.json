    "en": "A 3-year-old girl is brought to the office due to 2 days of fever and rash. Her mother says that she has also been refusing to eat or drink. She has no prior medical conditions and is up to date with recommended vaccinations. None of the other family members have had recent febrile illness, but the patient recently started attending day care. Temperature is 38.3 C (101 F). Physical examination shows multiple small vesicles and ulcers with an erythematous base on the buccal mucosa and tongue. There are similar vesicular lesions on the distal extremities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's rash?",

    "en": "This patient's vesicular rash on the buccal mucosa, tongue, and distal extremities likely indicates hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), a common childhood illness caused by species of enterovirus (eg, Coxsackievirus). Transmission largely occurs via the fecal-oral route, and outbreaks are common in day cares and elementary schools. The virus initially replicates in gastrointestinal lymphatic tissue and subsequently disseminates through the reticuloendothelial system and bloodstream to other organs (eg, heart, liver, brain, skin). Patients generally develop low-grade fever and the following mucocutaneous findings:\n\n*   Oral enanthem – painful, erythematous vesicles and ulcers on the tongue and buccal mucosa, which may lead to refusal to eat or drink\n*   Skin exanthem – maculopapular or vesicular lesions on the hands, feet, and extremities\n\nMost cases can be managed with supportive care and resolve spontaneously within a week. However, viral shedding in the stool continues for >6 weeks, which can propagate transmission.\n\n(Choice A) Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by autoantibody-mediated acantholysis, which leads to the formation of painful mucus membrane and cutaneous erosions. However, the palms and soles are generally spared and HFMD is far more common in children.\n\n(Choice C) Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a hypersensitivity reaction that is typically triggered by medication (eg, allopurinol) or infection (eg, *Mycoplasma*). It is characterized by necrosis and detachment of the epidermis, leading to high fever; hemorrhagic oral erosions; and coalescing, erythematous skin macules/bullae with purpuric centers.\n\n(Choice D) Scarlet fever is a delayed-type immune response to a pyrogenic exotoxin produced by *Streptococcus pyogenes*. Patients usually have a history of streptococcal infection (eg, pharyngitis, cellulitis) and then develop a diffuse, erythematous, papular rash that has a \"sandpaper\" quality. Vesicles are not typically seen, and the oral cavity is not usually involved.\n\n(Choice E) Kawasaki disease is an inflammatory childhood vasculitis that primarily affects medium-sized blood vessels. Patients generally have high fever, mucositis (eg, red lips, strawberry tongue), and a macular or targetoid rash. The presence of vesicles and ulcers makes this diagnosis unlikely.\n\nEducational objective:\nHand-foot-and-mouth disease is a common childhood illness characterized by painful, vesicular mouth lesions; ulcers on the extremities; and low-grade fever. It is caused by the ingestion and subsequent dissemination of an enterovirus (eg, Coxsackievirus). {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者颊粘膜、舌部和远端四肢出现的水疱性皮疹可能表明患有手足口病（HFMD），这是一种常见的儿童疾病，由肠病毒（例如，柯萨奇病毒）引起。其传播途径主要为粪口途径，并在日托中心和小学中易发生暴发。病毒最初在胃肠道淋巴组织中复制，随后通过网状内皮系统和血液传播到其他器官（例如，心脏、肝脏、大脑、皮肤）。患者通常会出现低热和以下粘膜皮肤表现：\n\n*   口腔内疹 – 舌头和颊粘膜上出现疼痛性红斑性水疱和溃疡，可能导致拒绝进食或饮水\n*   皮肤外疹 – 手、足和四肢出现斑丘疹或水疱性病变\n\n大多数病例可以通过支持治疗进行管理，并在1周内自发缓解。然而，粪便中的病毒排出可持续>6周，这可能会传播疾病。\n\n（选项A）寻常型天疱疮的特征是自身抗体介导的棘层松解，这会导致形成疼痛的粘膜和皮肤糜烂。然而，手掌和足底通常不受影响，而且HFMD在儿童中更为常见。\n\n（选项C）史蒂文斯-约翰逊综合征是一种超敏反应，通常由药物（例如，别嘌呤醇）或感染（例如，支原体）触发。其特征是表皮坏死和脱落，导致高热；出血性口腔糜烂；以及融合的红斑性皮肤斑丘疹/大疱，伴有紫癜中心。\n\n（选项D）猩红热是对由化脓性链球菌产生的产热外毒素的迟发型免疫反应。患者通常有链球菌感染史（例如，咽炎、蜂窝组织炎），然后出现弥漫性、红斑性、丘疹状皮疹，具有“砂纸”样质地。通常不会出现水疱，口腔通常也不会受到影响。\n\n（选项E）川崎病是一种炎症性儿童血管炎，主要影响中型血管。患者通常会出现高热、粘膜炎（例如，红唇、草莓舌）和斑丘疹或靶形皮疹。水疱和溃疡的存在使得该诊断不太可能。\n\n教育目标：\n手足口病是一种常见的儿童疾病，其特征是口部出现疼痛性水疱性病变；四肢出现溃疡；以及低热。它是由摄入和随后传播肠病毒（例如，柯萨奇病毒）引起的。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the presentation, etiology, and transmission of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), a common childhood illness caused by enteroviruses. It also requires differentiating HFMD from other conditions with similar presentations, such as pemphigus vulgaris, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, scarlet fever, and Kawasaki disease. \n\nTo solve this question, focus on the patient's age, the presence of vesicular lesions in the mouth and on the extremities (hands and feet), and the recent attendance at day care. These findings are highly suggestive of HFMD, making disseminated enteroviral infection the most likely diagnosis.",
