    "en": "A 23-year-old African American man comes to the emergency department due to back and lower extremity pain for 2 days. He has had several similar episodes over the last 15 years that have required hospitalization. His pain is not responsive to over-the-counter analgesics, and review of his prior records shows that he has needed treatment with opioids for adequate pain relief. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. On physical examination, he has scleral icterus and tenderness over his lower back and long bones of his thighs. Laboratory evaluation shows a hemoglobin level of 6.7 g/dL.",

    "en": "This patient with frequent episodes of bony pain likely has sickle cell disease (SCD), an autosomal recessive condition characterized by hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusion. The hemolytic anemia causes jaundice (due to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia) and promotes formation of pigmented gallstones. Vaso-occlusion by sickled red blood cells occurs in various tissues, causing hypoxia and acidosis (vaso-occlusive pain episodes). Microvascular occlusion nearly always affects the spleen due to the trapping of sickle cells by the rigid splenic cords; autoinfarction begins in early childhood and can precipitate splenic sequestration crisis in infants. However, repeated infarction eventually leads to significant scarring, fibrosis, and atrophy of the spleen, which would likely be present in this adult patient.\n\nAsplenic patients are more susceptible to infections with encapsulated bacteria (eg, group B Streptococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Salmonella typhi).\n\n(Choice A) Splenic congestion occurs during a splenic sequestration crisis (marked hemoglobin decrease, rapidly enlarging spleen), which develops due to vaso-occlusion within the cords of Billroth and splenic pooling of erythrocytes. However, repeated infarction leads to functional asplenia and autosplenectomy (splenic atrophy) by late childhood/adolescence.\n\n(Choices B and D) Splenic cyst formation typically occurs due to infection. Splenic infiltration can be seen with metastatic neoplasms but is not a feature of SCD.\n\n(Choice E) The white pulp of the spleen is composed of lymphoid tissue. Lymphoid hyperplasia may represent infection or malignancy.\n\nEducational objective:\nSickle cell disease is characterized by repeated splenic infarctions that ultimately result in splenic atrophy and fibrosis, a process that is typically complete by late childhood/adolescence. After autosplenectomy, patients are predisposed to infections with encapsulated bacterial organisms.",
    "zh": "这位经常出现骨痛的患者可能患有镰状细胞病 (SCD)，这是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是溶血性贫血和血管闭塞。溶血性贫血会导致黄疸（由于非结合型高胆红素血症）并促进色素性胆结石的形成。镰状红细胞引起的血管闭塞发生在各种组织中，导致缺氧和酸中毒（血管闭塞性疼痛发作）。微血管闭塞几乎总是影响脾脏，因为镰状细胞被刚性的脾索捕获；自发性梗塞发生在幼儿时期，并可能在婴儿期诱发脾隔离危象。然而，反复梗死最终会导致脾脏的显着瘢痕形成、纤维化和萎缩，这很可能出现在这位成年患者身上。\n\n无脾患者更容易感染荚膜细菌（例如，B族链球菌、流感嗜血杆菌、肺炎链球菌、脑膜炎奈瑟菌、伤寒沙门氏菌）。\n\n（选项 A）脾脏充血发生在脾脏隔离危象期间（血红蛋白显着降低，脾脏迅速增大），这是由于比尔罗氏索内的血管闭塞和红细胞在脾脏聚集而引起的。然而，反复梗死会导致功能性无脾症和自发性脾切除术（脾脏萎缩），这通常发生在儿童晚期/青春期。\n\n（选项 B 和 D）脾囊肿的形成通常是由于感染引起的。脾脏浸润可见于转移性肿瘤，但不是 SCD 的特征。\n\n（选项 E）脾脏的白髓由淋巴组织组成。淋巴样增生可能代表感染或恶性肿瘤。\n\n教育目标：\n镰状细胞病的特征是反复的脾梗死，最终导致脾脏萎缩和纤维化，这个过程通常在儿童晚期/青春期完成。在自发性脾切除术后，患者易患有荚膜细菌感染。"

It requires understanding the long-term consequences of sickle cell disease on the spleen.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's presentation as suggestive of sickle cell disease.
