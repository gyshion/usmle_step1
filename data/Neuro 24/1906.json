    "en": "A 68-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to confusion and lower extremity weakness. Her symptoms began 2 days ago with fever, headache, malaise, and myalgias. Today, the patient became confused and had difficulty ambulating due to left lower extremity weakness. The patient has a history of lymphoma in remission, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She drinks alcohol socially but does not use tobacco or recreational drugs. She is visiting her family in Texas for the summer and has never traveled outside the United States. Temperature is 38.3 C (101 F), blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 96/min. The patient is oriented to place and person only and has a coarse hand tremor. There is flaccid paralysis of the left lower extremity with preserved sensation. CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities. Lumbar puncture is performed, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytc pleocytosis and elevated protein. Cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction testing yields viral RNA.",

    "en": "This patient presents with acute confusion, fever, and asymmetric flaccid paralysis, which are consistent with neuroinvasive West Nile virus (WNV) infection. WNV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA flavivirus transmitted by female mosquitoes (Culex spp.), most commonly in the summer in warmer regions such as the southern United States, Latin America, and Africa. Most WNV infections are asymptomatic or present with a flu-like illness (fever, headache, myalgias), often with a maculopapular or morbilliform rash on the back and chest. Neuroinvasive infection is an uncommon complication of WNV but has a 10% fatality rate. It occurs most commonly in older patients and those with a history of malignancy or organ transplant, and is characterized by meningitis (ie, headache, meningismus) and/or encephalitis (altered mental status). The presence of acute-onset asymmetric flaccid paralysis is highly suggestive of WNV, particularly if the patient demonstrates concurrent parkinsonian features (eg, rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, postural instability).\n\n(Choices A and D) HIV, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus can be transmitted via blood transfusion or sexual contact, whereas herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 are transmitted through sexual or oral contact. Although these viruses can cause aseptic meningitis and encephalitis, asymmetric flaccid paralysis is more suggestive of WNV.\n\n(Choice C) Varicella, mumps, and adenoviruses are spread via respiratory secretions (eg, droplets, aerosols) and are capable of causing aseptic meningitis or encephalitis, but paralysis is rare. Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, which can cause ascending paralysis; however, Guillain-Barré is not typically associated with fever at the time of symptom onset or viral RNA in the CSF.",
    "zh": "该患者表现为急性意识模糊、发烧和不对称的弛缓性麻痹，这与神经侵袭性西尼罗病毒(WNV)感染一致。WNV是一种正链单链RNA黄病毒，通过雌性蚊子（库蚊属）传播，最常见于夏季，在温暖地区如美国南部、拉丁美洲和非洲。大多数WNV感染无症状或表现为类似流感的疾病（发烧、头痛、肌痛），通常伴有背部和胸部的斑丘疹或麻疹样皮疹。神经侵袭性感染是WNV不常见的并发症，但死亡率高达10%。它最常发生在老年患者以及有恶性肿瘤或器官移植病史的患者中，其特征是脑膜炎（即头痛、脑膜刺激征）和/或脑炎（精神状态改变）。急性起病的非对称性弛缓性麻痹高度提示WNV，尤其是当患者表现出伴随的帕金森病特征（例如，僵硬、运动迟缓、震颤、姿势不稳）。\n\n（选项A和D）HIV、巨细胞病毒和EB病毒可以通过输血或性接触传播，而单纯疱疹病毒1型和2型通过性接触或口腔接触传播。虽然这些病毒可引起无菌性脑膜炎和脑炎，但非对称性弛缓性麻痹更提示WNV。\n\n（选项C）水痘、腮腺炎和腺病毒通过呼吸道分泌物（如飞沫、气溶胶）传播，并能引起无菌性脑膜炎或脑炎，但麻痹罕见。流感嗜血杆菌和肺炎支原体与格林-巴利综合征相关，后者可引起上升性麻痹；然而，格林-巴利综合征通常与症状出现时的发烧或脑脊液中的病毒RNA无关。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of neuroinvasive West Nile virus infection, including its clinical presentation, transmission, and differential diagnosis. It requires integrating patient symptoms, history, and laboratory findings to identify the causative agent and its mode of transmission.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the constellation of symptoms suggestive of a neurotropic viral infection, specifically the combination of fever, confusion, and asymmetric flaccid paralysis. Then, considering the patient's travel history and the epidemiology of infectious diseases, one can narrow down the differential diagnosis. Finally, knowledge of the transmission routes of various viral agents is crucial to select the correct answer.",
