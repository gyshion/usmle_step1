    "en": "A 63-year-old man comes to the office due to 3 months of increasing cough with occasional hemoptysis, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss. The patient recently emigrated from South Africa, where he had worked for many years in the gold mines. He has a history of silicosis that was diagnosed 10 years ago. Vital signs show a low-grade fever. Physical examination reveals diffuse, fine crackles with right upper lobe predominance. Chest x-ray shows diffuse, small nodules; hilar adenopathy with prominent calcifications; and a cavitary lung lesion in the right upper lobe. A sputum sample is sent for appropriate staining and culture. This patient's increased susceptibility to the current infection is best explained by which of the following factors?",

    "en": "This patient with a history of silicosis has developed hemoptysis, night sweats, weight loss, and a cavitary lung lesion in the upper lobe; this is highly suggestive of tuberculosis infection. Silicosis is an occupational lung disease that occurs after inhalation of crystalline silica and is characterized by multiple rounded nodules located in the upper lobes. Patients may also develop calcification of the rim of hilar lymph nodes (eggshell calcification).\n\nSilicosis is associated with increased risk of mycobacterial infections, particularly Mycobacterium tuberculosis, due to impaired macrophage function. It is thought that macrophage phagolysosomes are disrupted by internalized silica particles, leading to impaired phagocytosis and increased apoptosis.\n\n(Choice A) Although interstitial fibrosis can be caused by silicosis, fibrosis alone would not greatly predispose to microbial infection. In fact, scarred areas of lung would be less accessible and may limit spread of microbial pathogens.\n\n(Choices B and D) Th2 cells are important for mediating humoral immunity and combating parasitic infections. However, humoral immunity does not play a major role in eliminating mycobacterial infections due to the intracellular survivability of these pathogens.\n\n(Choice E) Impaired mucociliary clearance, which occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis, can result in recurrent pulmonary infections due to impaired pathogen clearance. However, mucociliary clearance is not directly impaired by silicosis.",
    "zh": "这名有矽肺病史的患者出现了咯血、盗汗、体重下降和上叶空洞性肺损伤；这高度提示结核病感染。矽肺病是一种职业性肺病，发生在吸入结晶二氧化硅后，其特征是上叶中有多个圆形结节。患者还可能出现肺门淋巴结边缘钙化（蛋壳样钙化）。\n\n矽肺病与分枝杆菌感染的风险增加有关，特别是结核分枝杆菌，这归因于巨噬细胞功能受损。据认为，巨噬细胞吞噬溶酶体被内化的二氧化硅颗粒破坏，导致吞噬作用受损和细胞凋亡增加。\n\n（选项A）虽然间质性纤维化可由矽肺病引起，但仅纤维化并不会大大增加微生物感染的易感性。事实上，肺部疤痕区域的通透性较差，并可能限制微生物病原体的传播。\n\n（选项B和D）Th2细胞对于介导体液免疫和对抗寄生虫感染很重要。然而，由于这些病原体的细胞内生存能力，体液免疫在消除分枝杆菌感染中不起主要作用。\n\n（选项E）黏液纤毛清除功能受损，发生在囊性纤维化患者中，由于病原体清除受损，可导致反复发生的肺部感染。然而，矽肺病不会直接损害黏液纤毛清除。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of silicosis and its association with increased risk of mycobacterial infections, specifically tuberculosis, due to impaired macrophage function. It assesses the understanding of how inhaled silica particles disrupt macrophage phagocytosis and apoptosis, leading to increased susceptibility to infection.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation suggestive of tuberculosis in a patient with a history of silicosis. Understand that silicosis impairs macrophage function, which is crucial for eliminating mycobacteria. Eliminate options that do not directly relate to the pathophysiology of silicosis and its impact on the immune response to mycobacterial infections.",
