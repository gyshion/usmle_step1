    "en": "A 38-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to 2 days of headache, nausea, and photophobia. She has had migraines since her early 20s but has had more frequent episodes over the last few years. The current headache is more severe than usual, and ibuprofen did not relieve the pain. A flu-like illness preceded the symptoms. Temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F), blood pressure is 144/86 mm Hg, and pulse is 110/min. The patient appears lethargic. Cranial nerves, sensation, and motor functions are normal. She reports neck pain when instructed to touch the chest with her chin. No skin rash is present. Noncontrast CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities.",

    "en": "Although migraine headaches are often associated with photophobia and nausea, this patient's fever, stiff neck, and lethargy make BACTERIAL MENINGITIS the far more likely diagnosis. Bacterial meningitis is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. These pathogens colonize the host's mucous membranes, spread into the bloodstream (likely facilitated by this patient's preceding viral infection), and penetrate the blood-brain barrier. A lack of humoral components (eg, complement system, immunoglobulins) within the central nervous system allows bacteria to rapidly proliferate within the cerebrospinal fluid. The resultant inflammatory response causes the classic triad of symptoms: HIGH FEVER (>38 C [100.4 F]), STIFF NECK, and ALTERED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS. A generalized severe headache is also usually present.\n\nPatients with suspected bacterial meningitis require urgent blood cultures, empiric antibiotics, and LUMBAR PUNCTURE with cerebrospinal fluid analysis to confirm the diagnosis, identify the underlying pathogen, and determine antibiotic sensitivity.\n\n(Choice A) 100% oxygen can be used to abort cluster headaches, which are seen primarily in men and are usually characterized by severe orbital or periorbital pain, restless agitation, and autonomic symptoms (eg, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, ptosis, miosis). Fever and nuchal rigidity would be atypical.\n\n(Choices C, E, and F) Metoclopramide and sumatriptan can be used to abort acute migraines; topiramate is an effective treatment for the prevention of chronic migraines. Migraines are usually characterized by a unilateral throbbing headache with or without associated symptoms such as nausea, aura, or photophobia. Fever, nuchal rigidity, and lethargy would be atypical.\n\n(Choice D) Brain imaging may be performed prior to lumbar puncture to evaluate for signs of elevated intracranial pressure (increases the risk of cerebral herniation). However, this patient had a negative head CT and further evaluation with MRI is not needed.\n\nEducational objective: The classic triad of fever, stiff neck, and altered mentation should raise suspicion for acute bacterial meningitis. Evaluation requires prompt blood cultures, empiric antibiotics, and lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis.",
    "zh": "虽然偏头痛通常与畏光和恶心有关，但该患者的发烧、颈部僵硬和嗜睡使得细菌性脑膜炎成为更可能的诊断。细菌性脑膜炎最常由肺炎链球菌和脑膜炎奈瑟菌引起。这些病原体定植于宿主的粘膜，扩散到血流中（可能由该患者之前的病毒感染促进），并穿透血脑屏障。中枢神经系统中缺乏体液成分（如补体系统、免疫球蛋白）使得细菌能够在中枢神经系统中迅速增殖。由此产生的炎症反应导致经典的症状三联征：高烧（>38摄氏度[100.4华氏度]）、颈部僵硬和意识水平改变。通常也会出现普遍的严重头痛。\n\n怀疑患有细菌性脑膜炎的患者需要紧急血培养、经验性抗生素和腰椎穿刺以及脑脊液分析，以确认诊断、识别潜在的病原体并确定抗生素敏感性。\n\n（选项A）100%氧气可用于中止丛集性头痛，这种头痛主要见于男性，通常的特征是严重的眼眶或眶周疼痛、烦躁不安和自主神经症状（例如，流泪、鼻漏、上睑下垂、瞳孔缩小）。发烧和颈项强直是不典型的。\n\n（选项C、E和F）甲氧氯普胺和舒马曲坦可用于中止急性偏头痛；托吡酯是预防慢性偏头痛的有效治疗方法。偏头痛通常的特征是单侧搏动性头痛，伴有或不伴有相关症状，如恶心、先兆或畏光。发烧、颈项强直和嗜睡是不典型的。\n\n（选项D）脑部影像学检查可以在腰椎穿刺前进行，以评估颅内压升高的迹象（增加脑疝的风险）。然而，该患者的头部CT阴性，不需要进一步的MRI评估。\n\n教学目标：发烧、颈部僵硬和精神状态改变的经典三联征应引起对急性细菌性脑膜炎的怀疑。评估需要及时进行血培养、经验性抗生素治疗和腰椎穿刺以及脑脊液分析。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to differentiate between a severe migraine and acute bacterial meningitis based on clinical presentation, including key symptoms like fever, stiff neck, and lethargy, and to identify the appropriate next diagnostic step for suspected meningitis.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the red flags for meningitis (fever, nuchal rigidity, altered mental status) that override the patient's history of migraines, and understanding that lumbar puncture is the definitive diagnostic test for meningitis.",
    "zh": "此题考察了基于临床表现区分严重偏头痛和急性细菌性脑膜炎的能力，包括发烧、颈部僵硬和嗜睡等关键症状，并确定疑似脑膜炎的适当的下一步诊断步骤。\n\n解决此题的方法包括识别脑膜炎的危险信号（发烧、颈项强直、精神状态改变），这些信号优先于患者的偏头痛病史，并理解腰椎穿刺是脑膜炎的明确诊断试验。"
