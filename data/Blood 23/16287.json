    "en": "This patient with exertional dyspnea, fatigue, conjunctival pallor, and a systolic ejection murmur has symptomatic anemia. The peripheral blood smear findings of macrocytosis (abnormally large red blood cells) and a hypersegmented neutrophil {{exhibit_2}} indicate likely megaloblastic anemia. This condition sometimes arises in older individuals who take antacids for gastroesophageal reflux disease, as gastric acid is required for proper vitamin B₁₂ absorption.\n\nVitamin B₁₂ acts as a cofactor in the recycling of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate (reduced form of folate), which serves as a one-carbon donor in the synthesis of amino acids, purines, and thymidine monophosphate. Therefore, folate or vitamin B₁₂ deficiency reduces available purines and thymidine, which impairs DNA synthesis and causes cell cycle arrest (in S-phase) or apoptotic cell death.\n\nHematopoietic cells are primarily affected due to their high replication rate. In these cells, nuclear division slows relative to cytoplasmic maturation (nuclear-cytoplasmic dyssynchrony), which results in megaloblastic changes (eg, macrocytosis, hypersegmented neutrophils); in addition, increased apoptosis causes anemia and mild thrombocytopenia/leukopenia.\n\nAlthough vitamin B₁₂ deficiency also commonly presents with neurologic findings (eg, symmetric paresthesia, gait problems), patients can develop significant hematologic changes with no noticeable neuropsychiatric symptoms.\n\n(Choice B) Iron deficiency anemia is associated with impaired production of heme; however, peripheral blood smear would show microcytosis (not macrocytosis), and hypersegmented neutrophils would not be seen. {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(Choice C) Chronic kidney disease can reduce production of erythropoietin in peritubular fibroblasts of the kidney, which causes normocytic anemia due to reduced erythropoiesis. However, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are not typically seen, and peripheral blood smear would not show megaloblastic changes. {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choice D) Aplastic anemia is associated with destruction of hematopoietic stem cells and replacement of the bone marrow with fat cells. Although patients usually have pancytopenia, peripheral blood smear would not show hypersegmented neutrophils. {{exhibit_5}}\n\n(Choice E) Primary myelofibrosis is a myeloproliferative neoplasm that results in fibrosis of the bone marrow. Anemia is common but patients usually have dacrocytes (tear-drop red blood cells) and nucleated red blood cells on peripheral blood smear, not macrocytosis, and hypersegmented neutrophils. {{exhibit_6}}\n\n(Choice F) Aortic stenosis can cause traumatic hemolysis due to red blood cell shearing. However, peripheral smear generally shows schistocytes, and thrombocytopenia/leukopenia would be unusual.\n\nEducational objective:\nVitamin B₁₂ is an essential cofactor in the recycling of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, which is required for amino acid, purine, and thymidine synthesis. Deficiency primarily affects hematopoiesis and is marked by impaired nuclear maturation, leading to macrocytic red blood cells and hypersegmented neutrophils; increased apoptosis often also leads to anemia and mild thrombocytopenia/leukopenia.",
