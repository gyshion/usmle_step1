    "en": "Researchers are developing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis. The test is designed to detect the presence of serum antibodies against citrullinated proteins. Two test populations with a differing prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis are selected. The researchers plan to assess the test's performance in the 2 populations by comparing a number of diagnostic test parameters.",

    "en": "Positive predictive values are performance measures of diagnostic tests that are dependent on the prevalence of disease in a population of interest. The positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that someone who tests positive actually has the disease. It is calculated by dividing the number of true-positive results by the total number of positive results (ie, TP / [TP + FP]). The number of true-positive results depends on the sensitivity, and the number of false-positive results depends on the specificity; the relative proportion of each is determined by the prevalence of disease in the population.\n\nPopulations with a lower disease prevalence have fewer true-positive results and higher numbers of false positives, so the PPV decreases. As disease prevalence increases, the number of true positives also increases, while the number of false positives decreases, resulting in a higher PPV. Similarly, the negative predictive value increases as the disease prevalence decreases.\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices A and B) Positive and negative likelihood ratios indicate how a particular positive or negative test result influences the pretest probability of having a disease. Likelihood ratios >1 indicate that the test result is associated with the presence of the disease; likelihood ratios <1 mean that the test result is associated with the absence of the disease. Because positive and negative likelihood ratios are based on sensitivity and specificity, they are not affected by disease prevalence.\n\n(Choices D and E) Sensitivity and specificity are not affected by disease prevalence. This is because sensitivity is calculated using true positives and false negatives (only people with the disease), and specificity is calculated using true negatives and false positives (only people without the disease). In this case, the same test (with the same sensitivity and specificity characteristics) has been used on 2 different populations with a differing prevalence.",
    "zh": "阳性预测值是诊断测试的性能指标，它取决于目标人群中疾病的患病率。阳性预测值 (PPV) 是检测呈阳性的人实际患有该疾病的概率。它通过将真阳性结果的数量除以阳性结果的总数（即 TP / [TP + FP]）来计算。真阳性结果的数量取决于敏感度，假阳性结果的数量取决于特异度；每个结果的相对比例由人群中疾病的患病率决定。\n\n疾病患病率较低的人群具有较少的真阳性结果和较多的假阳性结果，因此 PPV 降低。随着疾病患病率的增加，真阳性结果的数量也会增加，而假阳性结果的数量会减少，从而导致 PPV 升高。同样，随着疾病患病率的降低，阴性预测值也会增加。\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项 A 和 B）阳性和阴性似然比表示特定的阳性或阴性测试结果如何影响患有疾病的测试前概率。似然比 >1 表示测试结果与疾病的存在相关；似然比 <1 表示测试结果与疾病的缺失相关。由于阳性和阴性似然比基于敏感度和特异度，因此它们不受疾病患病率的影响。\n\n（选项 D 和 E）敏感度和特异度不受疾病患病率的影响。这是因为敏感度是使用真阳性和假阴性（只有患有该疾病的人）计算的，特异度是使用真阴性和假阳性（只有未患有该疾病的人）计算的。在这种情况下，同一测试（具有相同的敏感度和特异度特征）已用于患病率不同的 2 个人群。"

Understanding that PPV is prevalence-dependent is key.\n\nTo solve this type of question, remember the formulas for sensitivity, specificity, and PPV.
