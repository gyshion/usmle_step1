  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's autopsy reveals a slitlike tear in the anterior left ventricular (LV) wall that is consistent with LV free-wall rupture, an uncommon but devastating mechanical complication of transmural myocardial infarction (MI) that occurs up to 2 weeks following the event (frequently within 5 days). She likely had significant CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS and experienced a transmural (ST-segment elevation) MI during her previous hospitalization.\n\nFollowing MI, the infarcted myocardium becomes akinetic and does not move with the remaining healthy myocardium, creating additional shear stress on the myocardial wall. Coagulative necrosis and enzymatic lysis of connective tissue also weaken the myocardial wall to the extent that it may be unable to contain the high LV pressures. If rupture occurs, it leads to abrupt filling of the pericardial space with blood and rapid development of CARDIAC TAMPONADE. Patients can experience chest pain and shortness of breath followed by hypotension and shock that can rapidly progress to CARDIAC ARREST.\n\n(Choices B, C, and E) Prolonged alcohol consumption, recent viral infection, and repeated blood transfusions (ie, iron overload) are all potential causes of dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy can lead to cardiac arrest and death via generation of a malignant arrhythmia (ie, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation); however, autopsy is expected to reveal an enlarged heart with eccentric hypertrophy of the LV and no tears in the myocardium.\n\n(Choice D) Recurrent bacterial pharyngitis can lead to recurrent episodes of rheumatic fever, which can cause inflammatory damage to both the myocardium and valvular endocardium. Death most commonly results from decompensated heart failure caused by valvular dysfunction; gross findings on autopsy are expected to show an enlarged heart with degenerated valves.\n\nEducational objective:\nLeft ventricular (LV) free-wall rupture is an uncommon but devastating mechanical complication of transmural myocardial infarction that occurs up to 2 weeks following the event (frequently within 5 days). Rupture leads to cardiac tamponade that causes hypotension and shock with rapid progression to cardiac arrest. Autopsy typically reveals a slitlike tear at the site of infarction in the LV wall. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者的尸检显示前侧左心室 (LV) 壁出现裂隙样撕裂，这与 LV 游离壁破裂一致，这是一种不常见但具有破坏性的透壁性心肌梗死 (MI) 的机械并发症，发生于事件发生后 2 周内（通常在 5 天内）。她可能患有严重的冠状动脉粥样硬化，并且在之前的住院期间经历了透壁性（ST 段抬高）心肌梗死。\n\n在心肌梗死后，梗死的心肌变得无动力，并且不会与剩余的健康心肌一起移动，从而在心肌壁上产生额外的剪切应力。凝固性坏死和连接组织的酶解也会削弱心肌壁，以至于它可能无法承受高 LV 压力。如果发生破裂，会导致血液突然填充心包腔并迅速发展为心脏压塞。患者可能会出现胸痛和呼吸短促，随后出现低血压和休克，并可能迅速进展为心脏骤停。\n\n（选项 B、C 和 E）长期饮酒、近期病毒感染和反复输血（即铁超载）都是扩张型心肌病 (DCM) 的潜在原因。扩张型心肌病可能通过产生恶性心律失常（即室性心动过速或颤动）导致心脏骤停和死亡；然而，尸检预计将显示心脏增大，伴有 LV 的离心性肥大，心肌中没有撕裂。\n\n（选项 D）复发性细菌性咽炎可导致复发性风湿热，这可能导致心肌和瓣膜心内膜的炎症性损伤。死亡最常见的原因是由于瓣膜功能障碍导致的心力衰竭失代偿；尸检的大体发现预计将显示心脏增大，伴有瓣膜退变。\n\n教育目标：\n左心室 (LV) 游离壁破裂是透壁性心肌梗死一种不常见但具有破坏性的机械并发症，发生于事件发生后 2 周内（通常在 5 天内）。破裂会导致心脏压塞，导致低血压和休克，并迅速进展为心脏骤停。尸检通常显示在 LV 壁的梗死部位出现裂隙样撕裂。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the complications of myocardial infarction, specifically left ventricular free wall rupture, and the underlying risk factors that predispose patients to this condition. It requires understanding of the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction and its potential mechanical complications.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the autopsy findings as indicative of left ventricular free wall rupture.
