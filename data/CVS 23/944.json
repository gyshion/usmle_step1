    "en": "A 52-year-old man comes to the office with concerns about a \"heart problem.\" Three years ago, the patient was told during a routine physical examination that he had a heart murmur. Currently, he has no specific complaints, but he mentions that he has become tired more easily in the past year. He has no chest pain or lower extremity swelling or significant medical history. The patient was healthy as a child and received all his childhood vaccinations. Blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg and pulse is 80/min and regular. Physical examination reveals a holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex of the heart that radiates to the axilla. The lungs are clear on auscultation and abdominal examination is unremarkable.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "A holosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the axilla is consistent with MITRAL REGURGITATION (MR). The murmur is generated by regurgitant blood flow from the left ventricle back to the left atrium during systole. This results in elevated pressure and blood volume in the left atrium, which increases the amount of blood reentering the left ventricle during diastole; an audible S3 gallop occurs when the left ventricle is unable to accommodate the excess blood flow.\n\nAn S3 is generated by the sudden cessation of blood flow into the left ventricle during the passive filling phase of diastole. A higher volume of blood flow or a more dilated left ventricle is more likely to produce an S3, and although an S3 can be a normal finding in healthy young adults, it is usually a pathologic finding in older adults that is classically associated with heart failure. In patients with MR, an S3 is the best indicator of severe MR with left-sided volume overload; the absence of an S3 can be used to exclude severe chronic MR.\n\n(Choice B) An S4 is a low-frequency diastolic sound that occurs during the atrial kick of ventricular diastole, and it reflects blood colliding with a stiff ventricular wall. It often indicates pathology such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (eg, due to hypertension or aortic stenosis).\n\n(Choice C) A mid-systolic click is characteristic of mitral valve prolapse. It is caused by sudden tensing of the chordae tendineae as they are pulled taut by the valve leaflets ballooning into the left atrium. The timing of the click varies with left ventricular volume; it occurs earlier in systole with physical maneuvers that decrease left ventricular volume.\n\n(Choice D) An opening snap is an early diastolic sound heard after S2 in patients with mitral or tricuspid stenosis. The S2-to-opening snap interval is the time between the closure of the aortic valve and the abrupt halting of leaflet motion during opening of a stenotic mitral valve; a shorter S2-to-opening snap interval is indicative of more severe mitral stenosis.\n\n(Choice E) Pulmonic valve stenosis delays pulmonic valve closure leading to widened splitting of S2. The splitting is further accentuated by the increase in venous return to the right side of the heart that occurs with inspiration.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients with severe mitral regurgitation develop left-sided volume overload with an S3 gallop due to the large volume of regurgitant flow reentering the ventricle during mid-diastole. The absence of an S3 gallop excludes severe chronic MR.",
    "zh": "在心尖处出现向腋窝放射的全收缩期杂音，与二尖瓣反流(MR)一致。杂音是由收缩期从左心室回流到左心房的反流血流产生的。这导致左心房压力和血容量升高，从而增加了舒张期重新进入左心室的血量；当左心室无法容纳过多的血流量时，就会出现可闻及的S3奔马律。\n\nS3是由舒张期被动充盈期血液突然停止流入左心室产生的。较高的血流量或扩张的左心室更有可能产生S3，虽然S3在健康的年轻人中可能是正常发现，但它通常是老年人的一种病理发现，经典地与心力衰竭相关。在MR患者中，S3是严重MR伴左侧容量超负荷的最佳指标；没有S3可以用来排除严重的慢性MR。\n\n(选项B) S4是一种低频舒张期声音，发生在心室舒张期的心房收缩期间，它反映了血液与僵硬的心室壁的碰撞。它通常表明病理情况，如肥厚型心肌病或向心性左心室肥大（例如，由于高血压或主动脉瓣狭窄）。\n\n(选项C) 收缩中期喀喇音是二尖瓣脱垂的特征。它是由腱索突然收紧引起的，当它们被瓣叶膨胀到左心房时拉紧。喀喇音的时间随左心室容积而变化；它在收缩早期发生，伴随着减少左心室容积的体格检查操作。\n\n(选项D) 开放性拍击音是一种早期舒张期声音，在二尖瓣或三尖瓣狭窄患者的S2后听到。S2到开放性拍击音的间隔是主动脉瓣关闭和瓣叶在狭窄二尖瓣开放期间突然停止运动之间的时间；较短的S2到开放性拍击音间隔表明二尖瓣狭窄更严重。\n\n(选项E) 肺动脉瓣狭窄延迟肺动脉瓣关闭，导致S2分裂加宽。分裂在吸气时因回心血量增加而进一步增强。\n\n教育目标：\n严重二尖瓣反流的患者会因大量反流血流在中舒张期重新进入心室而出现左侧容量超负荷，并伴有S3奔马律。没有S3奔马律可以排除严重的慢性MR。"
