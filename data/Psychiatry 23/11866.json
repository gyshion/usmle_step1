    "en": "A 40-year-old woman comes to the office due to worsening anxiety and insomnia over the past 3 months. She says, \"I'm really worried that something is wrong with me. I was never a particularly anxious person, but now I feel anxious all the time. Sometimes I feel panicky for no reason; my heart races and I break out in a sweat. The only benefit is that I have lost 5 pounds (2.3 kg) without even trying.\" The patient has no significant medical or psychiatric history. She drinks 2-3 glasses of wine per week and does not smoke or use illicit drugs. Blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg and pulse is 112/min. On physical examination, the patient is restless and has warm, moist skin and mild hand tremor bilaterally. Mental status examination is notable for a frightened stare, anxious mood, and rapid speech.",

    "en": "Anxiety and insomnia are nonspecific symptoms that can be due to a variety of medical and psychiatric disorders. Diagnosis of PRIMARY ANXIETY DISORDERS requires RULING OUT MEDICAL ILLNESS and substance-induced etiologies (due to medications, drugs of abuse, or toxins). Chronic anxiety and insomnia (as seen in generalized anxiety disorder) and panic attacks (as seen in panic disorder) can be symptoms of a medical illness or SUBSTANCE INTOXICATION OR WITHDRAWAL.\n\nThe new onset of anxiety in this patient with no psychiatric history and PROMINENT PHYSICAL FINDINGS on examination suggests that anxiety is more likely due to another medical condition (ie, the anxiety is a direct physiological effect of the medical condition) than to a primary anxiety disorder. Specifically, this patient's weight loss without trying; tachycardia; warm, moist skin; tremor; frightened stare (possible eyelid retraction); and restlessness are consistent with HYPERTHYROIDISM. Other medical conditions known to present with anxiety symptoms include hypoglycemia, pheochromocytoma, hypercortisolism, and cardiac arrhythmias. Common substance-induced etiologies include sympathomimetic drugs, caffeine, stimulant intoxication, and alcohol and sedative-hypnotic withdrawal.\n\n(Choice A) Alcohol withdrawal can present with anxiety, insomnia, tremulousness, palpitations, and diaphoresis. However, the extent of this patient's alcohol use would not result in dependence and withdrawal.\n\n(Choices C and E) Primary anxiety disorders should not be diagnosed when anxiety symptoms are caused by a medical condition. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about multiple issues. Symptoms must persist for at least 6 months, whereas this patient's symptoms have lasted only 3 months. Panic disorder involves recurrent, unexpected panic attacks.\n\n(Choices D and F) These disorders involve either having a serious undiagnosed medical illness (illness anxiety disorder) or excessive preoccupation with one or more somatic symptoms (somatic symptom disorder). They would not be diagnosed in this patient, who has legitimate concerns about symptoms that have not yet been evaluated.\n\nEducational objective: The differential diagnosis of anxiety includes medical conditions and substance-induced etiologies (eg, intoxication, withdrawal). Primary anxiety disorders are not diagnosed when anxiety is caused by the physiological effects of a medical condition (eg, hyperthyroidism) or drug.",
    "zh": "焦虑和失眠是非特异性症状，可能由多种内科和精神疾病引起。诊断原发性焦虑障碍需要排除内科疾病和物质诱因（由于药物、滥用药物或毒素）。慢性焦虑和失眠（如在广泛性焦虑障碍中可见）以及惊恐发作（如在惊恐障碍中可见）可能是内科疾病或物质中毒或戒断的症状。\n\n该患者新发焦虑，无精神病史，体格检查有明显的体征，提示焦虑更可能由另一种内科疾病引起（即，焦虑是内科疾病的直接生理效应），而不是原发性焦虑障碍。具体来说，该患者未经尝试的体重减轻、心动过速、温暖潮湿的皮肤、震颤、惊恐的表情（可能眼睑回缩）和烦躁不安，都与甲状腺功能亢进症一致。其他已知会引起焦虑症状的内科疾病包括低血糖症、嗜铬细胞瘤、皮质醇增多症和心律失常。常见的物质诱因包括拟交感神经药物、咖啡因、兴奋剂中毒以及酒精和镇静催眠药戒断。\n\n（选项A）酒精戒断可表现为焦虑、失眠、震颤、心悸和出汗。然而，该患者的饮酒量不会导致依赖和戒断。\n\n（选项C和E）当焦虑症状是由内科疾病引起的时，不应诊断为原发性焦虑障碍。广泛性焦虑障碍的特征是对多个问题过度、无法控制的担忧。症状必须持续至少6个月，而该患者的症状仅持续了3个月。惊恐障碍涉及反复、意想不到的惊恐发作。\n\n（选项D和F）这些障碍涉及患有严重、未诊断的内科疾病（疾病焦虑症）或过度关注一种或多种躯体症状（躯体症状障碍）。 这种情况下不应诊断，患者对尚未评估的症状有合理的担忧。\n\n教育目标：焦虑的鉴别诊断包括内科疾病和物质诱因（例如，中毒、戒断）。 当焦虑是由内科疾病（例如，甲状腺功能亢进症）或药物的生理效应引起的时，不诊断原发性焦虑障碍。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the differential diagnosis of anxiety symptoms, emphasizing the importance of ruling out medical and substance-induced causes before diagnosing a primary anxiety disorder. It assesses the ability to interpret clinical presentation and physical findings in the context of common etiologies of anxiety.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first consider the broad differential for anxiety, including primary psychiatric disorders, medical conditions, and substance use. The presence of new-onset anxiety with significant physical findings in a patient with no prior psychiatric history strongly suggests a medical etiology. Evaluating the specific symptoms and physical exam findings for clues to underlying medical conditions is crucial.",
