    "en": "A 28-year-old, previously healthy woman comes to the office for evaluation of a raised, pigmented skin lesion on her leg. The patient has had no itching or pain and cannot remember how long she has had the lesion. She has used tanning machines a few times but denies excessive sun exposure. The patient is particularly concerned about the risk for malignancy because her father was recently diagnosed with skin cancer. The skin lesion is shown in the image below: {{exhibit_1}}\n\nBiopsy of the lesion reveals nests of round, uniform cells at the basal portion of the epidermis that extend into the underlying dermis. The cells contain inconspicuous nucleoli and show no mitotic activity.",

    "en": "Melanocytic nevi are benign neoplasms composed of round, uniform melanocytes (nevus cells) that are mitotically quiescent. They are typically <6 mm in diameter and have a regular outline with a symmetric, sharply demarcated border and a homogeneous surface. Melanocytic nevi are progressive lesions that typically mature through the following phases:\n\n1.  Junctional nevi are characterized by aggregates of nevus cells limited to the dermoepidermal junction (Choice C). They typically appear as flat, black to brown macules with darker color in the center than in the periphery and preserved skin markings.\n\n2.  Compound nevi form as the aggregates of nevus cells extend into the dermis. They are raised papules with uniform brown to tan pigmentation. This patient’s lesion is a compound nevus because it has both dermal and epidermal involvement.\n\n3.  Intradermal nevi are older lesions in which the epidermal nests of nevus cells have been lost. The remaining dermal nevus cells lose tyrosinase activity and produce little to no pigment. Intradermal nevi are often skin-colored, dome-shaped, and sometimes pedunculated.\n\n(Choices A and D) Malignant melanoma is characterized by irregular and asymmetric borders with variable coloration, diameter ≥6 mm, and evolution over time. Melanomas typically expand superficially at first but may extend vertically into the dermis and subcutaneous tissues, portending a poor prognosis. Compared to nevus cells, melanoma cells are larger, contain irregular nuclei with prominent nucleoli, and have greater mitotic activity. Atypical (dysplastic) nevi can resemble melanoma clinically but typically have less extreme features. The melanocytes commonly show cellular atypia and form nests in the epidermis that fuse with nests in adjacent rete ridges.\n\n(Choice E) Pigmented basal cell carcinoma can present as papules, nodules, or plaques with rolled borders on sun-exposed areas. They can have varying degrees of pigmentation due to functional melanocytes within the lesion. The tumor cells resemble basal epidermal cells but extend into the dermis and often form nests with a palisading arrangement (ie, parallel alignment) of peripheral cells.\n\n(Choice F) Seborrheic keratosis forms a hyperpigmented lesion with well-circumscribed borders, a dull surface, and a “stuck-on” appearance. On microscopic examination, the lesions are composed of small cells resembling basal cells, with variable pigmentation, hyperkeratosis, and keratin-containing cysts.",
    "zh": "黑素细胞痣是由圆形、一致的黑素细胞（痣细胞）组成的良性肿瘤，其有丝分裂处于静止状态。它们通常直径<6 mm，具有规则的轮廓，对称、界限分明的边界和均匀的表面。黑素细胞痣是进行性病变，通常通过以下阶段成熟：\n\n1. 交界痣的特征是痣细胞聚集体仅限于真皮-表皮交界处（选项C）。它们通常表现为扁平的黑色到棕色斑点，中心颜色比周围颜色深，并且保留皮肤纹理。\n\n2. 随着痣细胞聚集体延伸到真皮，形成混合痣。它们是隆起的丘疹，具有均匀的棕色到棕褐色色素沉着。该患者的病变是混合痣，因为它同时累及真皮和表皮。\n\n3. 皮内痣是较老的病变，其中表皮中痣细胞巢已经消失。剩余的真皮痣细胞失去酪氨酸酶活性，几乎不产生色素。皮内痣通常呈肤色、圆顶状，有时有蒂。\n\n（选项A和D）恶性黑色素瘤的特征是不规则和不对称的边界，颜色多变，直径≥6 mm，并且随时间推移而演变。黑色素瘤通常首先在表面扩展，但可以垂直延伸到真皮和皮下组织，预示着预后不良。与痣细胞相比，黑色素瘤细胞较大，包含具有明显核仁的不规则核，并且具有更大的有丝分裂活性。非典型（发育不良）痣在临床上可能类似于黑色素瘤，但通常具有不那么极端的特征。黑素细胞通常表现出细胞异型性，并在表皮中形成巢，与相邻的钉突中的巢融合。\n\n（选项E）色素性基底细胞癌可在暴露于阳光下的区域表现为丘疹、结节或斑块，边缘卷曲。由于病变内功能性黑素细胞的存在，它们可以具有不同程度的色素沉着。肿瘤细胞类似于基底表皮细胞，但延伸到真皮中，并且通常形成巢，外周细胞呈栅栏状排列（即平行排列）。\n\n（选项F）脂溢性角化病形成一个色素沉着过度病变，具有边界清楚、表面暗淡和“黏附”外观。在显微镜检查下，这些病变由类似于基底细胞的小细胞组成，具有可变的色素沉着、过度角化和含角蛋白的囊肿。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the different types of melanocytic nevi and their characteristic features, including junctional, compound, and intradermal nevi. It also tests the ability to differentiate these benign lesions from malignant melanoma, atypical nevi, pigmented basal cell carcinoma, and seborrheic keratosis.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully analyze the clinical description and the biopsy findings. The presence of round, uniform cells at the basal portion of the epidermis extending into the dermis, along with inconspicuous nucleoli and no mitotic activity, is characteristic of a compound nevus. Rule out other options based on their distinct clinical and histological features.",
