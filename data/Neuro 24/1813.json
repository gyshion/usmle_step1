The patient was texting on her cell phone and was not wearing a seatbelt during the incident. She has no known medical problems and takes no medications. Her temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 155/90 mm Hg, pulse is 62/min, and respirations are 10/min. A linear skull fracture at the junction of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and sphenoid bones is seen on head CT scan. {{exhibit_1}} A branch of which of the following arteries is most likely severed in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient has suffered a fracture at the pterion, a region where the frontal, parietal, temporal, and sphenoid bones meet. The bone is thin in this region, and fractures there risk lacerating the MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY and causing an EPIDURAL HEMATOMA. Epidural hematomas require prompt treatment as they are under systemic arterial pressure and can expand rapidly, leading to elevated intracranial pressure (can cause Cushing reflex, brain herniation (eg, uncal herniation with oculomotor nerve palsy), and death.\n\nThe middle meningeal artery is a branch of the MAXILLARY ARTERY (one of the terminal branches of the external carotid artery), which enters the skull at the foramen spinosum and supplies the dura mater and periosteum.\n\n(Choice A) The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery, which courses over the mandible anterior to the insertion of the masseter muscle to supply the oral, nasal, and buccal regions.\n\n(Choice C) The middle cerebral artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery and supplies much of the parietal and temporal regions of the brain. Injury to this artery or its branches can cause subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\n(Choice D) The occipital artery arises opposite the facial artery from the external carotid, coursing posteriorly instead of anteriorly. This vessel supplies the posterior scalp and the sternocleidomastoid muscles.\n\n(Choice E) The ophthalmic artery is the first branch of the internal carotid artery, supplying the eye and orbital contents as well as the eyelids, forehead, and nose. The internal carotid artery has no branches in the neck.\n\n(Choice F) The sphenopalatine artery is a branch of the third part of the maxillary artery and supplies much of the nasal mucosa. It anastomoses with branches of the ophthalmic and facial arteries within the anterior part of the nasal septum in a region known as Kiesselbach's plexus (a frequent site of nosebleeds).\n\nEducational objective:\nThe middle meningeal artery is a branch of the maxillary artery, which enters the skull at the foramen spinosum and courses intracranially deep to the pterion (where the frontal, parietal, temporal, and sphenoid bones meet). Skull fractures at this site may cause laceration of this vessel, leading to an epidural hematoma. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者在翼点处发生了骨折，翼点是额骨、顶骨、颞骨和蝶骨相遇的区域。该区域的骨头很薄，骨折有割伤脑膜中动脉和引起硬膜外血肿的风险。硬膜外血肿需要及时治疗，因为它们处于全身动脉压力下，会迅速扩大，导致颅内压升高（可引起库欣反射、脑疝（例如，钩回疝伴动眼神经麻痹）和死亡）。\n\n脑膜中动脉是上颌动脉的分支（颈外动脉的终末分支之一），通过棘孔进入颅内，供应硬脑膜和骨膜。\n\n（选项A）面动脉是颈外动脉的分支，沿下颌骨前行，在咬肌附着点前方，供应口腔、鼻腔和颊部区域。\n\n（选项C）大脑中动脉是颈内动脉的分支，供应大脑的顶叶和颞叶的大部分区域。这条动脉或其分支的损伤可引起蛛网膜下腔出血或脑内出血。\n\n（选项D）枕动脉从颈外动脉发出，与面动脉相对，向后走行而不是向前走行。该血管供应后枕部和胸锁乳突肌。\n\n（选项E）眼动脉是颈内动脉的第一个分支，供应眼睛和眼眶内容物，以及眼睑、前额和鼻子。颈内动脉在颈部没有分支。\n\n（选项F）蝶腭动脉是上颌动脉第三部分的分支，供应大部分鼻粘膜。它与眼动脉和面动脉的分支在鼻中隔前部的吻合，该区域被称为基塞尔巴赫丛（经常发生鼻出血的部位）。\n\n教育目标：\n脑膜中动脉是上颌动脉的分支，它通过棘孔进入颅内，在翼点（额骨、顶骨、颞骨和蝶骨相遇的地方）深处走行。该部位的颅骨骨折可能会导致该血管撕裂，从而导致硬膜外血肿。{{exhibit_2}}"
