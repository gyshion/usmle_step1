    "en": "A 47-year-old, previously healthy man is transported to the emergency department after he was involved in a high-speed, head-on motor vehicle collision. The patient was wearing a seat belt; he did not hit his head or lose consciousness. However, he has had chest pain and shortness of breath since the incident. On arrival, blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg and pulse is 115/min. Bruising and tenderness are noted over the anterior chest wall. Neck veins are flat, and the trachea is central. Breath sounds are symmetric, and heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There are no significant extremity injuries, but bilateral femoral pulses are weak compared to the radial pulses. Chest x-ray reveals a widened mediastinum {{exhibit_1}}. While being prepared for surgery, the patient becomes unresponsive. The pulse is no longer detectable, and the cardiac monitor demonstrates sinus tachycardia. Despite aggressive resuscitation efforts, the patient dies. Autopsy examination is most likely to reveal an injury involving which of the following areas of the thoracic aorta?",

    "en": "Rapid deceleration during a high-speed motor vehicle collision can lead to BLUNT AORTIC INJURY (BAI) due to a combination of forces (eg, shearing) on the aorta. These forces can affect some or all of the layers (ie, intima, media, adventitia). Most patients exsanguinate rapidly (due to full-thickness injury that ruptures the adventitia); however, in a minority of cases (~20%), delayed rupture can allow survival until surgical treatment. A high index of suspicion is crucial because symptoms may be nonspecific (eg, chest pain, shortness of breath).\n\nDepending on the extent and location of vessel injury, some findings suggestive of BAI include:\n\n*   Widened mediastinum\n*   Pulse discrepancy between the upper and lower extremities (similar to aortic coarctation)\n*   Intrascapular murmur (due to aortic flow impingement)\n\nBAI occurs most often at TRANSITION ZONES between mobile and fixed portions of the aorta. The most common site of injury is the AORTIC ISTHMUS (C), which is tethered by the ligamentum arteriosum and is relatively immobile compared to the adjacent descending aorta; the isthmus is particularly susceptible to BAI due to intrinsic weakness of the aortic wall in this area.\n\n(Choices A and B) The aortic root (A) and the ascending aorta near the arch (B) are both transition zones and can be damaged by high-speed traumatic injury. However, these areas are affected less often than the aortic isthmus. In addition, this patient's circulation is preserved in the upper extremities compared to the lower extremities, which is more characteristic of an injury distal to the brachiocephalic and left subclavian arteries. Injury to the proximal aorta is classically associated with complications such as hemopericardium (eg, jugular vein distension), coronary artery dissection (eg, ST-segment elevation), and aortic valve disruption (eg, diastolic regurgitation murmur).\n\n(Choices D and E) The distal thoracic aorta is also susceptible to injury just proximal to the diaphragm due to tethering at the diaphragmatic hiatus. However, this is a less common site for traumatic rupture than the more proximal portions of the aorta. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "高速机动车碰撞期间的快速减速可能由于作用于主动脉的各种力量（例如，剪切力）导致钝性主动脉损伤（BAI）。这些力量会影响部分或全部血管壁层（即，内膜、中膜、外膜）。大多数患者会迅速失血（由于全层损伤导致外膜破裂）；然而，在少数病例（约 20%）中，延迟破裂可以存活到手术治疗。高度怀疑至关重要，因为症状可能没有特异性（例如，胸痛、呼吸短促）。\n\n根据血管损伤的范围和位置，一些提示 BAI 的发现包括：\n\n*   纵隔增宽\n*   上下肢之间的脉搏差异（类似于主动脉缩窄）\n*   肩胛间杂音（由于主动脉血流受阻）\n\nBAI 最常发生在主动脉的活动部分和固定部分之间的过渡区。最常见的损伤部位是主动脉峡部 (C)，该部位通过动脉韧带固定，相对于相邻的降主动脉相对固定；由于该区域主动脉壁的固有薄弱，峡部特别容易受到 BAI 的影响。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）主动脉根部 (A) 和靠近弓部的升主动脉 (B) 都是过渡区，可能会因高速创伤而受损。然而，这些区域受到的影响不如主动脉峡部。此外，与下肢相比，该患者的上肢循环得到保留，这更像是锁骨下动脉和左侧锁骨下动脉远端的损伤。近端主动脉的损伤通常与并发症相关，如心包积血（例如，颈静脉扩张）、冠状动脉夹层（例如，ST 段抬高）和主动脉瓣破坏（例如，舒张期反流杂音）。\n\n（选项 D 和 E）远端胸主动脉也容易在靠近膈肌处因膈肌裂孔处的系带而受伤。然而，这比主动脉更近端的部分发生创伤性破裂的情况要少见。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of blunt aortic injury (BAI) following high-speed motor vehicle collisions, including common injury locations and associated clinical findings. The key is to recognize the widened mediastinum and pulse discrepancy, which are suggestive of BAI, and to know that the aortic isthmus is the most common site of injury.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the mechanism of injury (rapid deceleration), the clinical findings (widened mediastinum, pulse discrepancy), and the anatomical locations most susceptible to injury in the aorta. Remember that the aortic isthmus is a transition zone and is tethered, making it prone to shearing forces.",
