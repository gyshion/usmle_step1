    "en": "A 75-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to 2 hours of left-sided chest pain and dyspnea. The patient has lived in a skilled nursing facility since developing right-sided hemiplegia, hemi-sensory loss, and aphasia 4 months ago. He has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. As an ECG is being obtained, the patient develops ventricular fibrillation and dies despite resuscitative efforts. An autopsy is performed; a coronal section of the brain is shown in the image below.",
    "zh": "一名75岁男性因左侧胸痛和呼吸困难2小时被送往急诊科。患者自4个月前出现右侧偏瘫、偏身感觉缺失和失语后，一直住在技术护理机构。他有糖尿病、高血压和高胆固醇血症病史。在进行心电图检查时，患者发生室颤，尽管进行了复苏，仍不幸去世。进行了尸检；脑的冠状切面如下图所示。"

    "en": "The coronal section of this patient's brain shows a cystic lesion caused by ISCHEMIC STROKE involving the left cerebral hemisphere (eg, cortex, subcortical white matter, putamen). Neuropathology coronal sections are oriented with the right side of the brain on the examiner's right side.\n\nThrombosis of atherosclerotic plaques involving the cerebral arteries can result in vessel occlusion with tissue hypoxia and subsequent necrosis. Ischemic neuronal injury initially causes intense cytoplasmic eosinophilia (\"red neurons\") followed by neutrophil infiltration a day later. After several days, macrophages/microglia are recruited to phagocytize the necrotic debris and predominate in the ensuing 2-3 weeks. Around this time, the periphery of the necrotic area becomes populated with new blood vessels and proliferating astrocytes that form a network of cytoplasmic extensions (reactive gliosis). Several MONTHS to YEARS after brain infarction, the necrotic area appears as a cystic cavity surrounded by a wall composed of dense fibers formed by ASTROCYTIC PROCESSES (glial scar).\n\n(Choice B) Ependymal cells are ciliated glial cells that line the ventricles and central canal of the central nervous system and make up the choroid plexus. These cells produce cerebrospinal fluid but do not directly participate in glial scar formation around old infarcts.\n\n(Choice C) Large ischemic strokes may result in perivascular fibroblast infiltration with fibrotic scar formation within the core of the lesion. However, this region remains separated from normal brain parenchyma by a wall of reactive gliosis, which protects viable neuronal tissue from being damaged by the fibrotic inflammatory response.\n\n(Choice D) Oligodendrocytes are the myelin-producing cells of the central nervous system and do not directly participate in glial scar formation around old infarcts.\n\n(Choice E) The meninges (eg, pia mater) are separated from the cystic cavity created after ischemic stroke by a gliotic tissue layer (derived from the cortex) and do not participate in glial scar formation.\n\n(Choice F) Schwann cells are myelin-producing cells that help guide axonal repair and regeneration in the peripheral nervous system.",
    "zh": "该患者大脑的冠状切面显示由缺血性卒中引起的囊性病变，累及左侧大脑半球（例如，皮质、皮质下白质、豆状核）。神经病理学冠状切面以检查者的右侧显示大脑的右侧。\n\n累及脑动脉的动脉粥样硬化斑块血栓形成可导致血管闭塞，伴有组织缺氧和随后的坏死。缺血性神经元损伤最初会导致强烈的细胞质嗜酸性变（“红神经元”），随后在中性粒细胞浸润一天后发生。几天后，巨噬细胞/小胶质细胞被募集来吞噬坏死碎片，并在随后的2-3周内占主导地位。大约在这个时候，坏死区域的周围被新的血管和增殖的星形胶质细胞填充，这些星形胶质细胞形成细胞质延伸的网络（反应性神经胶质增生）。脑梗死后几个月到几年，坏死区域呈现为囊性空腔，周围由星形胶质细胞突起（神经胶质瘢痕）形成的致密纤维壁包围。\n\n（选项B）室管膜细胞是衬于中枢神经系统脑室和中央管并构成脉络丛的纤毛状神经胶质细胞。这些细胞产生脑脊液，但不会直接参与旧梗死灶周围的神经胶质瘢痕形成。\n\n（选项C）大范围缺血性卒中可能导致血管周围成纤维细胞浸润，并在病变核心内形成纤维性瘢痕。然而，该区域与正常脑实质保持分离，由反应性神经胶质增生壁隔开，从而保护活神经元组织免受纤维性炎症反应的损伤。\n\n（选项D）少突胶质细胞是中枢神经系统的髓鞘生成细胞，不直接参与旧梗死灶周围的神经胶质瘢痕形成。\n\n（选项E）脑膜（例如，软脑膜）通过神经胶质组织层（源自皮质）与缺血性卒中后形成的囊性空腔分隔开，不参与神经胶质瘢痕形成。\n\n（选项F）许旺细胞是髓鞘生成细胞，有助于周围神经系统中轴突的修复和再生。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the long-term sequelae of ischemic stroke and the cellular composition of glial scars. Specifically, it assesses the understanding that astrocytes are the primary cells responsible for forming the glial scar that surrounds a cystic cavity after a significant ischemic event.\n\nTo answer this question correctly, recognize that the patient had a stroke months prior, leading to cystic changes. Recall that glial scars are formed by astrocytes in response to injury in the central nervous system.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对缺血性卒中长期后遗症和神经胶质瘢痕细胞组成的了解。具体来说，它评估了对星形胶质细胞是形成神经胶质瘢痕的主要细胞的理解，神经胶质瘢痕包围着严重缺血事件后的囊性空腔。\n\n要正确回答这个问题，需要认识到患者几个月前曾中风，导致囊性变化。回想一下，神经胶质瘢痕是由星形胶质细胞响应中枢神经系统的损伤而形成的。"
