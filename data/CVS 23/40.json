    "en": "The cause of death was most likely an acute myocardial infarction. In myocardial infarction, changes on light microscopy are usually not apparent until 4 hours after the onset of severe ischemia. Although a variable waviness of myofibrils at the border of the infarct (due to myofibril relaxation) might be observed before this, more definite signs of early coagulative necrosis, such as cytoplasmic eosinophilia and nuclear pyknosis, take at least 4 hours to develop.\n\nOther potentially lethal causes of chest pain, diaphoresis, and palpitations/tachycardia include aortic dissection and/or rupture, massive pulmonary embolism, and tension pneumothorax. The chest pain of aortic dissection is typically tearing in nature and often radiates to the back. Dyspnea is typically the most prominent symptom in the event of a pulmonary embolus or tension pneumothorax.\n\n(Choices A & B) Cytoplasmic hypereosinophilia on light microscopy is one of the earliest signs of coagulative necrosis of cardiac myocytes. It begins approximately 4 hours after the onset of lethal ischemia. Light microscopy may also reveal edema and punctate hemorrhages in infarcted myocardium starting also at about 4 hours after the ischemic event.\n\n(Choice C) An interstitial infiltrate of neutrophils around a zone of myocardial infarction is not seen until 1 to 3 days after the onset of severe ischemia.\n\n(Choice D) Extensive macrophage phagocytosis of the dead cells generally does not develop until at least 5 days after myocardial infarction, and is most prominent during post-infarction days 7 to 10.\n\n(Choice E) Fibrovascular granulation tissue with neovascularization generally begins to develop 7 days after myocardial infarction, and is most prominent on post-infarction days 10 to 14.\n\n(Choice F) Increased collagen deposition and decreased cellularity in a zone of infarcted myocardium is not generally evident until 2 weeks post-infarction. Fibrosis continues during weeks 2 to 8, producing a dense collagenous scar by two months post-infarction.\n\nEducational objective:\nAfter the onset of severe ischemia leading to myocardial infarction (MI), early signs of coagulative necrosis do not become apparent on light microscopy until 4 hours after the onset of MI.",
    "zh": "死亡原因很可能是急性心肌梗死。在心肌梗死中，光学显微镜下的变化通常在严重缺血发生4小时后才会出现。虽然在此之前可能会观察到梗死边界处肌原纤维的波浪状变化（由于肌原纤维松弛），但更明确的早期凝固性坏死迹象，如细胞质嗜酸性增强和核固缩，至少需要4小时才能发展。\n\n其他可能致命的胸痛、出汗和心悸/心动过速的原因包括主动脉夹层和/或破裂、大块肺栓塞和张力性气胸。主动脉夹层引起的胸痛通常呈撕裂样，并且经常向后背放射。在发生肺栓塞或张力性气胸的情况下，呼吸困难通常是最突出的症状。\n\n(选项 A 和 B) 光学显微镜下细胞质嗜酸性增强是心肌细胞凝固性坏死的最早迹象之一。它大约在致命性缺血发生4小时后开始。光学显微镜也可能显示梗死心肌的水肿和点状出血，这些也大约在缺血事件发生4小时后开始。\n\n(选项 C) 中性粒细胞在心肌梗死区域周围的间质浸润要到严重缺血发生1到3天后才会出现。\n\n(选项 D) 巨噬细胞广泛吞噬死亡细胞通常要到心肌梗死后至少5天才会发生，并且在梗死后第7到10天最为明显。\n\n(选项 E) 伴有新生血管形成的纤维血管肉芽组织通常在心肌梗死后7天开始形成，在梗死后第10到14天最为明显。\n\n(选项 F) 梗死心肌区域的胶原沉积增加和细胞减少通常在梗死后2周才会出现。纤维化在第2到8周持续进行，在梗死后两个月产生致密的胶原瘢痕。\n\n教育目标：\n在发生导致心肌梗死 (MI) 的严重缺血后，光学显微镜下凝固性坏死的早期迹象在 MI 发生4小时后才会变得明显。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize the microscopic changes in myocardial tissue following an acute myocardial infarction at different time points. Specifically, it assesses the understanding that significant microscopic changes are not immediately apparent within the first few hours after the onset of ischemia.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to remember the timeline of histological changes in myocardial infarction. Since the patient died only two hours after symptom onset, the myocardium would likely appear normal under light microscopy because the characteristic features of coagulative necrosis take at least 4 hours to develop.",
    "zh": "本题测试识别急性心肌梗死后不同时间点心肌组织微观变化的能力。具体而言，它评估了对以下情况的理解：在缺血发生后的最初几个小时内，没有明显的微观变化。\n\n解决此问题的关键是记住心肌梗死组织学变化的发生时间。由于患者在出现症状后仅两小时死亡，因此在光学显微镜下心肌可能看起来正常，因为凝固性坏死的特征至少需要4小时才能显现。"
