  "explanation": {
    "en": "The cranial vault is formed by the cranial bones and divided into compartments by the dural folds (ie, falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli). Because the cranial vault is rigid, there is minimal space for brain expansion if a rapidly enlarging mass (eg, hemorrhage, tumor) or severe, generalized edema (eg, traumatic brain injury) develops. As a result, portions of the brain may protrude through the openings in the dural folds, often according to the following herniation patterns:\n\n*   Subfalcine: herniation of the cingulate gyrus under the falx cerebri\n*   Uncal: herniation of the medial temporal lobe (ie, uncus) through the tentorial notch\n*   Tonsillar: herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum\n\nThis patient with compression of the anterior medial temporal lobe against the free margin of the tentorium cerebelli has uncal herniation. As uncal herniation progresses, the following may occur:\n\n*   Ipsilateral oculomotor nerve (CN III) compression leads to an ipsilateral fixed and dilated pupil. Paralysis of the oculomotor muscles occurs later and leads to ptosis and a down-and-out position of the ipsilateral eye.\n*   Ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery compression leads to contralateral homonymous hemianopsia with macular sparing.\n*   Compression of the ipsilateral cerebral peduncle of the midbrain against the tentorium may occur, damaging descending corticospinal tracts and causing contralateral hemiparesis.\n*   As the midbrain is pushed toward the contralateral side, the contralateral cerebral peduncle may also become compressed against the tentorium, causing ipsilateral hemiparesis (false localizing sign).\n\nWithout prompt treatment, further pressure on the midbrain can cause downward brainstem displacement (eg, central herniation) and brainstem hemorrhages (ie, Duret hemorrhages) from stretching and rupture of paramedian branches of the basilar artery. This is usually fatal.\n\n(Choices A, B, D, E, F, and G) None of the other cranial nerves become compressed due to uncal herniation.\n\nEducational objective:\nUncal herniation is a possible complication of an expanding ipsilateral mass lesion (eg, hemorrhage, tumor). The first sign of uncal herniation is a fixed, dilated pupil on the side of the lesion. Contralateral or ipsilateral hemiparesis and contralateral homonymous hemianopsia with macular sparing may also occur.",
    "zh": "颅腔由颅骨构成，并由硬脑膜褶（即大脑镰、小脑幕）分隔成隔室。由于颅腔是刚性的，如果快速增大的肿块（如出血、肿瘤）或严重的全身性水肿（如脑外伤）发生，脑的扩张空间很小。因此，脑的某些部分可能会通过硬脑膜褶的开口突出，通常按照以下脑疝模式：\n\n*   大脑镰下疝：扣带回在大脑镰下疝出\n*   钩回疝：内侧颞叶（即钩回）通过小脑幕切迹疝出\n*   扁桃体疝：小脑扁桃体通过枕骨大孔疝出\n\n该患者前内侧颞叶受压迫小脑幕游离缘，患有钩回疝。随着钩回疝的进展，可能会发生以下情况：\n\n*   同侧动眼神经（CN III）受压导致同侧瞳孔固定和扩大。动眼肌麻痹发生较晚，导致同侧眼睑下垂和眼球向下和向外的位置。\n*   同侧后脑动脉受压导致对侧同向性偏盲，黄斑保留。\n*   中脑同侧大脑脚受压迫小脑幕可能会发生，损害下行皮质脊髓束，引起对侧轻偏瘫。\n*   当中脑被推向对侧时，对侧大脑脚也可能受到小脑幕的压迫，引起同侧轻偏瘫（假性定位征）。\n\n如不及时治疗，对中脑的进一步压迫可导致脑干向下移位（例如，中央疝）和脑干出血（即杜雷出血），这是由于基底动脉的旁正中分支的牵拉和破裂所致。这通常是致命的。\n\n（选项 A、B、D、E、F 和 G）由于钩回疝，其他脑神经均未受到压迫。\n\n教育目标：\n钩回疝是同侧扩张性病灶（如出血、肿瘤）的可能并发症。钩回疝的第一个体征是病变侧瞳孔固定、扩大。也可能出现对侧或同侧轻偏瘫和对侧同向性偏盲伴黄斑保留。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of uncal herniation and its effects on cranial nerves, specifically the oculomotor nerve. Uncal herniation, caused by a mass effect in the temporal lobe, compresses the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve, leading to a fixed and dilated pupil. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical scenario as uncal herniation based on the description of the hemorrhage and compression. Recall that uncal herniation classically affects the oculomotor nerve (CN III) due to its proximity to the uncus of the temporal lobe.",
    "zh": "本题考察对钩回疝及其对脑神经，特别是动眼神经的影响的了解。钩回疝是由颞叶的占位效应引起的，压迫同侧动眼神经，导致瞳孔固定和扩大。\n\n要解决这个问题，根据对出血和压迫的描述，将临床情况识别为钩回疝。回想一下，由于颞叶钩回的邻近性，钩回疝通常会影响动眼神经（CN III）。"
