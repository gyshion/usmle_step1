    "en": "A 77-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department with severe lightheadedness and near-syncope, which began earlier in the day. Over the past several months, she has experienced occasional episodes of lightheadedness and feeling unsteady, which she attributed to \"old age.\" The patient has not had chest pain, shortness of breath, or lower extremity swelling. She was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago and has been taking losartan. The patient does not take any other medications. She lives alone and is independent in her daily activities. An ECG obtained in the emergency department is shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}. Cell degeneration in which of the following locations is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",

    "en": "This elderly patient with recent lightheadedness and near-syncope has an ECG showing bradycardia with dropped P waves; these findings are consistent with SICK SINUS SYNDROME. Sick sinus syndrome most commonly results from age-related degeneration of the sinoatrial node, which is located on the right atrial wall and is responsible for initiating normal cardiac conduction. Impaired signaling from the sinoatrial node can markedly slow the rate of ventricular contraction, leading to reduced cardiac output and symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, lightheadedness, presyncope, and syncope.\n\nTypical ECG findings include bradycardia, sinus pauses (delayed P waves), and sinus arrest (prolonged delay of a P wave such that the P wave is dropped). Because the atrioventricular node triggers conduction based on its own pacemaker if it does not receive a timely signal from the sinoatrial node, sinus arrest will lead to a junctional escape beat (narrow QRS complex preceded by a long pause and no P wave). Sick sinus syndrome can also cause brief periods of atrial tachycardia (eg, atrial fibrillation) alternating with bradycardia.\n\n(Choice A) The inferior portion of the interatrial septum contains the His bundle. Conduction abnormalities in this region can manifest as varying degrees of atrioventricular block with prolongation of the PR interval (first degree), dropped QRS complexes (second degree), or dissociation of P waves and QRS complexes (third degree).\n\n(Choice B) Conduction through the interventricular septum mostly involves the left and right bundle branches. Conduction abnormalities in this region can lead to bundle branch blocks; the QRS complex is widened in bundle branch block due to impaired synchronization of ventricular depolarization.\n\n(Choice C) After initiation in the sinoatrial node, conduction propagates through the cardiomyocytes of the left atrial wall to stimulate left atrial contraction. Abnormal electrical foci can develop in the nearby pulmonary veins, which is a common trigger for atrial fibrillation.\n\n(Choice D) Conduction abnormalities may originate in ischemic areas of the left ventricular free wall, leading to ventricular tachycardia.\n\nEducational objective:\nSick sinus syndrome results from degeneration (usually age-related) of the sinoatrial node, leading to impaired conduction and reduced cardiac output with symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, lightheadedness, presyncope, and syncope. ECG typically demonstrates bradycardia with sinus pauses (delayed P waves), sinus arrest (dropped P waves), and junctional escape beats. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}",
    "zh": "这位近期出现头晕和接近晕厥的老年患者的心电图显示心动过缓，伴有P波脱落；这些发现与病态窦房结综合征一致。病态窦房结综合征最常见的原因是与年龄相关的窦房结退变，窦房结位于右心房壁上，负责启动正常的心脏传导。来自窦房结的信号受损会显著减缓心室收缩的速率，导致心输出量减少，并引起呼吸困难、疲劳、头晕、晕厥前和晕厥等症状。\n\n典型的心电图表现包括心动过缓、窦性停搏（P波延迟）和窦性停搏（P波长时间延迟，导致P波脱落）。由于房室结如果没有及时收到来自窦房结的信号，将根据其自身的起搏器触发传导，因此窦性停搏将导致交界性逸搏（窄QRS波群，之前有长停顿且无P波）。病态窦房结综合征也可引起阵发性房性心动过速（例如，房颤）与心动过缓交替出现。\n\n(选项A) 房间隔的下部包含希氏束。该区域的传导异常可表现为不同程度的房室传导阻滞，伴有PR间期延长（一度）、QRS波群脱落（二度）或P波和QRS波群分离（三度）。\n\n(选项B) 通过室间隔的传导主要涉及左、右束支。该区域的传导异常可导致束支传导阻滞；由于心室去极化同步性受损，束支传导阻滞时QRS波群增宽。\n\n(选项C) 在窦房结起始后，传导通过左心房壁的心肌细胞传播，以刺激左心房收缩。异常电灶可在附近的肺静脉中形成，这是房颤的常见诱因。\n\n(选项D) 传导异常可能起源于左心室游离壁的缺血区域，导致室性心动过速。\n\n教学目标：\n病态窦房结综合征是由于窦房结退变（通常与年龄相关）导致，导致传导受损和心输出量减少，并伴有呼吸困难、疲劳、头晕、晕厥前和晕厥等症状。心电图通常显示心动过缓，伴有窦性停搏（P波延迟）、窦性停搏（P波脱落）和交界性逸搏。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}"
