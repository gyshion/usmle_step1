  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "During aerobic exercise, there is vasoconstriction of splanchnic arterioles and a larger degree of vasodilation of skeletal muscle arterioles, which shunts blood to exercising muscle and leads to overall reduced SVR. In addition, venoconstriction of capacitance veins mobilizes stored blood to increase venous return (ie, increased preload), and myocardial contractility is also increased. Both the increased preload and increased myocardial contractility increase stroke volume, which in combination with increased heart rate, markedly increases cardiac output. {{exhibit_1}}\nThe reduced SVR during aerobic exercise facilitates decreased DBP but it is somewhat offset by mobilization of a higher percentage of blood from the venous to the arterial circulation (due to venoconstriction and increased heart rate), resulting in slightly decreased or unchanged DBP. The increased stroke volume leads to increased PP, and consequently increased SBP.\n\n(Choice A) Decreased DBP and unchanged PP results in decreased SBP. Such changes are expected with reduced SVR and no change in stroke volume.\n\n(Choice B) Increased DBP and decreased PP can result in unchanged SBP. Such changes are expected with increased SVR and decreased stroke volume.\n\n(Choice D) Increased DBP and unchanged PP results in increased SBP. Such changes are expected with increased SVR and no change in stroke volume.\n\n(Choice E) Increased DBP and increased PP results in greatly increased SBP. Such changes occur with resistance exercise (eg, heavy weightlifting) as SVR is increased due to arteriolar compression by vigorously contracting muscles, and stroke volume is increased due to increased venous return and myocardial contractility.\n\nEducational objective:\nDiastolic blood pressure (DBP) is largely determined by systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and pulse pressure is largely determined by stroke volume. During aerobic exercise, reduced SVR leads to slightly decreased or unchanged DBP, and increased stroke volume leads to increased pulse pressure and systolic blood pressure.",
    "zh": "在有氧运动期间，内脏小动脉收缩，骨骼肌小动脉舒张程度更大，这会将血液分流到正在运动的肌肉，并导致整体SVR降低。此外，容量静脉的静脉收缩动员储存的血液以增加静脉回流（即，前负荷增加），心肌收缩力也会增加。前负荷增加和心肌收缩力增加都会增加每搏输出量，这与心率增加相结合，显着增加心输出量。{{exhibit_1}} \n有氧运动期间SVR的降低有助于降低舒张压，但由于从静脉到动脉循环中动员了更高比例的血液（由于静脉收缩和心率增加），因此在一定程度上被抵消，导致舒张压略有下降或不变。每搏输出量的增加导致脉压增加，从而导致收缩压升高。\n\n（选项A）舒张压降低，脉压不变会导致收缩压降低。这种变化是预期SVR降低且每搏输出量不变的情况。\n\n（选项B）舒张压升高，脉压降低会导致收缩压不变。这种变化是预期SVR升高且每搏输出量降低的情况。\n\n（选项D）舒张压升高，脉压不变会导致收缩压升高。这种变化是预期SVR升高且每搏输出量不变的情况。\n\n（选项E）舒张压升高，脉压增加会导致收缩压大大升高。这些变化发生在阻力运动（例如，举重）中，因为SVR由于剧烈收缩的肌肉对小动脉的压迫而增加，并且由于静脉回流和心肌收缩力的增加而导致每搏输出量增加。\n\n教育目标：\n舒张压 (DBP) 主要由全身血管阻力 (SVR) 决定，脉压主要由每搏输出量决定。在有氧运动期间，SVR降低导致舒张压略有下降或不变，每搏输出量的增加导致脉压和收缩压升高。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of physiological changes in blood pressure components (systolic, diastolic, pulse pressure) during aerobic exercise. It requires knowledge of how systemic vascular resistance, stroke volume, and heart rate influence blood pressure.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to recall that aerobic exercise leads to decreased systemic vascular resistance and increased stroke volume. This results in increased systolic and pulse pressure, while diastolic pressure remains relatively unchanged or slightly decreased.",
