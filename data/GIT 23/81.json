    "en": "A 75-year-old hospitalized man is evaluated for abdominal pain and fever. The patient was admitted 2 weeks ago due to necrotizing fasciitis of the gluteal region and severe sepsis. He has been treated with surgical debridements, intravenous antibiotics, and fluids. For the past 2 days, the patient has had right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and recurrent fever. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His temperature is 38.8 C (102 F). Physical examination shows marked tenderness over the right subcostal area. Leukocyte count is 18,000/mm³ compared to 9,600/mm³ 2 days ago. Laparoscopic surgery is planned.",

    "en": "This patient likely has acute acalculous cholecystitis, an acute inflammation of the gallbladder in the absence of gallstones. Acalculous cholecystitis most commonly occurs in critically ill patients (eg, those with sepsis, severe burns, trauma, immunosuppression) and is associated with high mortality. The condition is thought to arise secondary to gallbladder stasis and ischemia, which cause inflammation of and injury to the gallbladder wall.\n\nClinical manifestations may be subtle, especially in those who are sedated or intubated. Fever, right upper quadrant pain, a positive Murphy's sign, leukocytosis, and mild elevations in liver function tests are often present. Physical examination may demonstrate jaundice and a palpable right upper quadrant mass. The diagnostic study of choice is an ultrasound, which may show signs of acute cholecystitis (eg, an edematous and enlarged gallbladder) and no gallstones.\n\n(Choice A) Choledochal cysts are congenital dilatations of the common bile duct that typically present during childhood (age <10) with recurrent abdominal pain and jaundice.\n\n(Choice B) Chronic cholecystitis results from repeated mild attacks of acute cholecystitis, which leads to thickening of the gallbladder wall. Ultrasound typically demonstrates a shrunken, fibrosed gallbladder.\n\n(Choice C) Liver fluke infection usually affects individuals from endemic areas (eg, Southeast Asia) and presents acutely with fever, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and eosinophilia. Infection of the biliary tree is associated with the formation of brown pigment gallstones, not acute acalculous cholecystitis.\n\n(Choice E) Pigment gallstones are categorized as black (typically secondary to intravascular hemolysis) or brown (typically secondary to biliary infection). These gallstones are associated with acute calculous cholecystitis, not acute acalculous cholecystitis.\n\n(Choice F) Porcelain gallbladder is usually found incidentally on abdominal radiograph as a rim of calcium deposits outlining the gallbladder. The condition is associated with chronic cholecystitis and may increase the risk of gallbladder carcinoma.\n\nEducational objective:\nAcute acalculous cholecystitis is an acute inflammation of the gallbladder in the absence of gallstones. It typically occurs in critically ill patients (eg, those with sepsis, severe burns, trauma, immunosuppression) due to gallbladder stasis and ischemia. Clinical findings may be subtle and include fever, right upper quadrant pain, and leukocytosis.",
    "zh": "该患者很可能患有急性无结石性胆囊炎，这是一种在没有胆结石的情况下发生的胆囊急性炎症。无结石性胆囊炎最常见于危重患者（例如，患有脓毒症、严重烧伤、外伤、免疫抑制的患者），并且与高死亡率相关。这种疾病被认为继发于胆囊淤滞和缺血，导致胆囊壁的炎症和损伤。\n\n临床表现可能很轻微，尤其是在镇静或插管的患者中。通常会出现发热、右上腹疼痛、墨菲征阳性、白细胞增多和肝功能轻度升高。体格检查可能会显示黄疸和右上腹可触及肿块。首选的诊断研究是超声检查，超声检查可能会显示急性胆囊炎的征象（例如，水肿和肿大的胆囊）并且没有胆结石。\n\n（选项A）胆管囊肿是胆总管的先天性扩张，通常在儿童时期（年龄<10岁）出现，表现为反复腹痛和黄疸。\n\n（选项B）慢性胆囊炎是由于反复的轻度急性胆囊炎发作引起的，导致胆囊壁增厚。超声检查通常显示萎缩、纤维化的胆囊。\n\n（选项C）肝吸虫感染通常影响来自流行地区（例如，东南亚）的个体，并急性表现为发热、右上腹疼痛、黄疸和嗜酸性粒细胞增多。胆道感染与棕色色素性胆石的形成有关，而不是急性无结石性胆囊炎。\n\n（选项E）色素性胆石分为黑色（通常继发于血管内溶血）或棕色（通常继发于胆道感染）。这些胆石与急性结石性胆囊炎有关，而不是急性无结石性胆囊炎。\n\n（选项F）瓷器胆囊通常在腹部X线片上偶然发现，表现为勾勒胆囊轮廓的钙沉积边缘。这种情况与慢性胆囊炎有关，并可能增加患胆囊癌的风险。\n\n教育目标：\n急性无结石性胆囊炎是在没有胆结石的情况下发生的胆囊急性炎症。它通常发生在危重患者（例如，患有脓毒症、严重烧伤、外伤、免疫抑制的患者）中，是由于胆囊淤滞和缺血引起的。临床发现可能很轻微，包括发热、右上腹疼痛和白细胞增多。"

Acalculous cholecystitis is an acute inflammation of the gallbladder in the absence of gallstones, typically occurring in critically ill patients. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's risk factors (sepsis, recent surgery), symptoms (fever, RUQ pain), and lab findings (leukocytosis) as suggestive of acalculous cholecystitis.
