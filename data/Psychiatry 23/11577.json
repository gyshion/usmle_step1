    "en": "A 46-year-old woman comes to the office for follow-up after an episode of alcoholic pancreatitis. She was hospitalized 4 weeks ago for abdominal pain and concurrently underwent treatment with benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal. Prior to hospitalization, the patient was drinking 3 L of boxed wine daily; however, she has remained abstinent since discharge. She is interested in medication for her alcohol use disorder, but lives alone and is worried that her cravings will overwhelm her self control.",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "In addition to psychosocial interventions (eg, motivational interviewing, Alcoholics Anonymous), several medications are available to treat ALCOHOL USE DISORDER, including naltrexone and acamprosate. Naltrexone blocks the MU-OPIOID RECEPTOR and inhibits the rewarding and reinforcing effects of alcohol, helping to reduce cravings and improving motivation to quit. The long-acting depot form (given as monthly injections) is useful for patients at risk for nonadherence with daily administration. Acamprosate, another abstinence-promoting drug, works by modulating glutamate neurotransmission at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.\n(Choice A) The aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor disulfiram is considered a second-line treatment for alcohol use disorder because of poorer efficacy (effectiveness depends on supervised administration). When alcohol is ingested by a patient taking disulfiram, acetaldehyde accumulates and causes unpleasant adverse effects (eg, nausea, vomiting, flushing, sweating, headache).\n(Choice B) Antagonism at postsynaptic dopamine receptors is the mechanism of action of antipsychotic medications. Antipsychotics are not effective in treating alcohol use disorder.\n(Choice D) Varenicline acts as a partial neuronal nicotinic receptor agonist and prevents the nicotine stimulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system associated with nicotine addiction.\n(Choice E) Serotonin reuptake inhibition is the mechanism of action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. Although they have shown some efficacy in reducing alcohol use in patients with alcohol use disorder who have comorbid depression, they are not useful for alcohol cessation in patients without comorbid depression.\nEducational objective:\nThe opioid antagonist naltrexone is a first-line pharmacotherapy for moderate-to-severe alcohol use disorder, and works by preventing the reinforcing effects of alcohol use.",
    "zh": "除了心理社会干预（例如，动机性访谈、匿名戒酒会）外，还有几种药物可用于治疗酒精使用障碍，包括纳曲酮和阿坎酸。纳曲酮阻断μ-阿片受体，抑制酒精的奖励和强化作用，有助于减少渴求感并提高戒酒的动机。长效储库型（每月注射一次）适用于有每日依从性风险的患者。阿坎酸是另一种促进戒断的药物，通过调节谷氨酸在N-甲基-D-天冬氨酸受体上的神经传递起作用。\n(选项A) 乙醛脱氢酶抑制剂双硫仑被认为是治疗酒精使用障碍的二线治疗药物，因为其疗效较差（疗效取决于监督给药）。当服用双硫仑的患者摄入酒精时，乙醛会积聚并引起不愉快的副作用（例如，恶心、呕吐、潮红、出汗、头痛）。\n(选项B) 突触后多巴胺受体拮抗是抗精神病药物的作用机制。抗精神病药对治疗酒精使用障碍无效。\n(选项D) 伐尼克兰作为部分神经元烟碱受体激动剂，可防止尼古丁刺激与尼古丁成瘾相关的中脑边缘多巴胺系统。\n(选项E) 5-羟色胺再摄取抑制是选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂抗抑郁药的作用机制。虽然它们在减少合并抑郁症的酒精使用障碍患者的酒精使用方面显示出一定的疗效，但它们对没有合并抑郁症的患者戒酒无用。\n教育目标：\n阿片类受体拮抗剂纳曲酮是治疗中重度酒精使用障碍的一线药物，其作用是防止酒精使用的强化作用。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of pharmacotherapy options for alcohol use disorder, specifically the mechanisms of action of different medications and their efficacy in managing cravings and promoting abstinence.\nTo solve this question, identify the patient's condition (alcohol use disorder with cravings) and recall the primary medications used for treatment. Evaluate the mechanism of action for each option and determine which best addresses the patient's symptoms of craving and desire for self-control.",
