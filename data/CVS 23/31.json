    "en": "This patient died from an intracranial hemorrhage due to a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Hypertension, genetic conditions (eg, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), and lifestyle factors (eg, cigarette smoking) increase the risk of aneurysm development. **Coarctation of the aorta** is a congenital cardiac defect associated with secondary hypertension and is a **risk factor** for **cerebral aneurysm** development.\n\nCoarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aortic arch near the ligamentum arteriosum (remnant of ductus arteriosus) with localized medial and intimal hyperplasia. Critical coarctation (severe narrowing) often presents in the neonatal period with heart failure and cardiogenic shock. However, less severe narrowing allows for distal (but decreased) perfusion to the lower extremities and may present with only asymptomatic **upper extremity hypertension** in children or adults. Additional symptoms due to this differential in blood pressure include headache, epistaxis, chest pain, and lower extremity claudication.\n\nComplications of aortic coarctation include cerebral and aortic aneurysm. Cerebral aneurysm with life-threatening rupture causing **subarachnoid hemorrhage** is likely due to chronic hypertension. Aortic aneurysms usually develop near the site of coarctation due to embryologic vessel wall abnormalities and may lead to dissection or fatal rupture.\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices B, C, D, and F) Patent ductus arteriosus and atrial and ventricular septal defects create a left-to-right intracardiacal shunt that, if untreated, may lead to right-to-left shunting (ie, Eisenmenger syndrome) due to pulmonary hypertension. This may increase risk of a paradoxical thromboembolism from the venous to arterial circulation directly to the brain, causing an ischemic stroke. However, neither condition is associated with cerebral aneurysm or intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n(Choice E) Tetralogy of Fallot is characterized by pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, an overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Almost all patients have cyanosis in infancy or hypercyanotic episodes (ie, tet spells) in early childhood. This patient's age makes this diagnosis unlikely. In addition, risk of intracranial hemorrhage is not increased with tetralogy of Fallot, regardless of age.\n\nEducational objective:\nAdults with coarctation of the aorta often have chronic hypertension and are at increased risk of developing life-threatening aneurysms of the aorta (eg, dissection, rupture) and cerebral vessels (ie, intracranial hemorrhage).",
