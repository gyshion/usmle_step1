    "en": "A 44-year-old man comes to the office due to several weeks of difficulty walking and frequent falls. He has had no headache or visual impairment but reports episodes of sharp, stabbing pain in his extremities. The patient has HIV acquired from unprotected sexual contact and is nonadherent with treatments. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F). Neurologic examination shows 5/5 motor power in all extremities. Deep-tendon reflexes are absent at the knee and ankle bilaterally. Proprioception and vibration sensation are reduced throughout the lower extremities. He has a wide-based gait and a positive Romberg sign.",

    "en": "This patient's sensory ataxia and lancinating pains raise suspicion for TABES DORSALIS, a late form of NEUROSYPHILIS that usually manifests several years or decades after initial infection with Treponema pallidum. Tabes dorsalis is characterized by a slow degeneration of nerve fibers in the DORSAL COLUMN of the spinal cord and DORSAL NERVE ROOTS, which leads to diminished vibratory, proprioception, and discriminative touch sensation. Common manifestations include: Sensory ataxia: Wide-based gait and loss of equilibrium when the patient's eyes are closed (positive Romberg sign); due to damaged lower extremity proprioception. Absent deep-tendon reflexes: Due to damaged dorsal nerve roots. Lancinating pains: Sharp, stabbing pains that may last minutes or hours; the exact cause is unclear. Spirochetal damage to the midbrain tectum also commonly results in Argyll Robertson pupil. This finding is marked by small, irregularly shaped pupils that fail to constrict to light but that constrict normally to accommodation (light-near dissociation). Most patients with tertiary syphilis will have a positive VDRL and mild lymphocytic pleocytosis on cerebrospinal fluid analysis.\n\n(Choice A) Central nervous system infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an acid-fast bacillus, is usually characterized by headache, vomiting, cranial nerve deficits, and confusion. Lancinating pains and altered lower extremity sensation would be atypical.\n\n(Choice B) Herpes simplex encephalitis primarily affects the temporal lobe and causes fever, headache, impaired consciousness, and seizures.\n\n(Choice C) Cryptococcal meningitis can be diagnosed by examining the cerebrospinal fluid for encapsulated yeasts using India ink. However, cryptococcal meningitis usually manifests with fever, malaise, and headache. Lancinating pains, absent deep-tendon reflexes, and altered sensation would be atypical.\n\n(Choice D) JC virus is a polyomavirus that replicates in oligodendrocytes (glial cells). Reactivation of JC virus causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which occurs primarily in severely immunocompromised patients (e.g., AIDS, lymphoma, leukemia) and causes progressive dementia, motor deficits, and visual impairment.\n\n(Choice F) Patients with untreated HIV are at high risk for cerebral toxoplasmosis, which usually manifests with headache, confusion, fever, and focal neurologic deficits. MRI of the brain usually reveals ring-enhancing lesions.\n\nEducational objective: Tabes dorsalis, a late form of neurosyphilis, causes progressive degeneration of the dorsal columns and dorsal roots of the spinal cord. Manifestations include loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation, severe lancinating pains, and sensory ataxia (eg, wide-based gait, positive Romberg sign). Many patients also have Argyll Robertson pupils.",
    "zh": "该患者的感觉性共济失调和刺痛提示TABES DORSALIS，即神经梅毒的晚期表现，通常在感染梅毒螺旋体后数年或数十年出现。Tabes dorsalis的特征是脊髓后柱和背根神经纤维缓慢退变，导致振动觉、本体感觉和辨别性触觉减退。常见表现包括：感觉性共济失调：步态宽基，闭眼时失去平衡（Romberg征阳性）；这是由于下肢本体感觉受损所致。深腱反射消失：由于背根神经受损。刺痛：尖锐的、刺痛，可能持续数分钟或数小时；确切病因尚不清楚。螺旋体对中脑盖的损伤也常导致阿-罗瞳孔。此发现的特征是瞳孔小而形状不规则，对光反应迟钝，但对调节反应正常（光-近分离）。大多数三期梅毒患者的脑脊液分析VDRL试验呈阳性，轻度淋巴细胞增多。\n\n(选项A) 结核分枝杆菌（一种抗酸杆菌）引起的中枢神经系统感染通常以头痛、呕吐、颅神经功能障碍和意识模糊为特征。刺痛和下肢感觉改变是不典型的。\n\n(选项B) 单纯疱疹性脑炎主要影响颞叶，引起发热、头痛、意识障碍和癫痫发作。\n\n(选项C) 隐球菌性脑膜炎可通过脑脊液墨汁染色检查有无包膜酵母菌进行诊断。然而，隐球菌性脑膜炎通常表现为发热、不适和头痛。刺痛、深腱反射消失和感觉改变是不典型的。\n\n(选项D) JC病毒是一种在少突胶质细胞（神经胶质细胞）中复制的多瘤病毒。JC病毒的再激活会导致进行性多灶性白质脑病，主要发生在严重免疫功能低下的患者（如艾滋病、淋巴瘤、白血病）中，并引起进行性痴呆、运动功能障碍和视力障碍。\n\n(选项F) 未经治疗的HIV感染患者发生脑弓形虫病的风险很高，通常表现为头痛、意识模糊、发热和局灶性神经功能缺损。脑MRI通常显示环形强化病灶。\n\n教学目标：Tabes dorsalis，即神经梅毒的晚期形式，导致脊髓后柱和背根进行性变性。表现包括本体感觉和振动觉丧失，严重的刺痛和感觉性共济失调（如步态宽基、Romberg征阳性）。许多患者也有阿-罗瞳孔。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of tabes dorsalis, a late manifestation of neurosyphilis, particularly in the context of HIV infection. It requires correlating clinical signs and symptoms such as sensory ataxia, absent deep-tendon reflexes, and lancinating pains with the underlying pathophysiology of dorsal column and root degeneration.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the constellation of neurological deficits suggestive of posterior column involvement. Then, consider the differential diagnosis for these symptoms in an immunocompromised patient, with a strong emphasis on tertiary syphilis. Finally, identify the diagnostic test that would confirm neurosyphilis, specifically tabes dorsalis.",
    "zh": "此题考察了对Tabes dorsalis的理解，Tabes dorsalis是神经梅毒的晚期表现，尤其是在HIV感染的背景下。它需要将感觉性共济失调、深腱反射消失和刺痛等临床体征和症状与后柱和根部变性的潜在病理生理学联系起来。\n\n要解决这个问题，首先必须认识到提示后柱受累的神经系统缺陷的组合。然后，考虑在免疫功能低下的患者中出现这些症状的鉴别诊断，重点是三期梅毒。最后，确定可以确诊神经梅毒，特别是Tabes dorsalis的诊断性检查。"
