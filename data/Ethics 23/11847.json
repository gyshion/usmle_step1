    "en": "A 46-year-old woman is hospitalized due to severe depression and fatigue. She has no other medical problems. Routine laboratory tests are ordered and the patient is started on antidepressant medication. After a week, her depression improves slightly and she is discharged home to continue with outpatient care. However, the patient remains severely fatigued and is unable to return to her job, forcing her to take a leave of absence. At her follow-up appointment 2 weeks later, review of the hospital record by the outpatient physician reveals a TSH level of 15.2 µU/mL that was never addressed by the inpatient physician. Subsequent evaluation and treatment with thyroid hormone result in rapid improvement of her depression and fatigue.",

    "en": "Hypothyroidism is a known cause of depression and is routinely screened for with a TSH level. This patient's elevated level (normal: 0.5-5.0 µU/mL) should have been detected during hospitalization and prompted further workup. The inpatient physician's failure to note and address the abnormality is a preventable medical error that resulted in delayed diagnosis. Preventable medical errors involve harm to the patient by an act of commission or omission rather than from the underlying disease and are the result of failure to follow evidence-based best practice guidelines.\n\n(Choice A) Malpractice is a legal determination; it involves situations in which the treatment provided is below the accepted standard of practice and has resulted in injury or death to the patient. It is not a category of medical error but rather refers to the consequence of many different types of errors that result in harm.\n\n(Choice B) A near miss is a medical error that is recognized before any harm is done to the patient (eg, a patient is prescribed a lethal dose of medication, but the error is caught by the pharmacist). In contrast, the patient in this case has been harmed by the delay in appropriate diagnosis and treatment.\n\n(Choice C) This error would have been prevented if the physician had adhered to the standard of care. A non-preventable adverse event is a complication that cannot be prevented given the current state of medical knowledge (eg, an allergic reaction to a medication in a patient with no known drug allergies).\n\n(Choice E) A sentinel event is an unexpected occurrence involving death or serious physical or psychological injury (eg, inpatient suicide, death of a full-term infant, retained object after surgery) that requires immediate investigation.",
    "zh": "甲状腺功能减退症是抑郁症的已知病因，通常通过TSH水平进行筛查。该患者的TSH水平升高（正常范围：0.5-5.0 µU/mL）应在住院期间被发现并促使进一步检查。住院医师未能注意到并处理这种异常是一种可预防的医疗错误，导致诊断延迟。可预防的医疗错误涉及通过作为或不作为对患者造成损害，而不是源于潜在疾病，并且是未能遵循循证最佳实践指南的结果。\n\n（选项A）医疗事故是一种法律认定；它涉及提供的治疗低于公认的实践标准，并导致患者受伤或死亡。它不是医疗错误的类别，而是指导致损害的许多不同类型错误的结果。\n\n（选项B）未遂事件是在对患者造成任何损害之前就被识别出的医疗错误（例如，给患者开具了致命剂量的药物，但错误被药剂师发现）。相比之下，本例中的患者因延迟适当的诊断和治疗而受到损害。\n\n（选项C）如果医生遵守护理标准，则可以预防此错误。不可预防的不良事件是根据目前的医学知识无法预防的并发症（例如，对没有已知药物过敏的患者的药物过敏反应）。\n\n（选项E）警戒事件是指涉及死亡或严重的身体或精神损伤的意外事件（例如，住院自杀，足月婴儿死亡，术后残留异物），需要立即调查。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to categorize medical errors based on their preventability and consequences. It requires understanding the definitions of malpractice, near miss, preventable adverse event, and sentinel event.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the physician's failure to address the elevated TSH level during hospitalization was a preventable error that led to a delayed diagnosis and harm to the patient. This aligns with the definition of a preventable adverse event.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了根据医疗错误的可预防性和后果对其进行分类的能力。它要求理解医疗事故、未遂事件、可预防的不良事件和警戒事件的定义。\n\n解决这个问题的关键是认识到医生在住院期间未能处理TSH水平升高是一个可预防的错误，导致了诊断延迟并对患者造成了损害。这与可预防的不良事件的定义相符。"
