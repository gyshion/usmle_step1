    "en": "A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police and emergency medical services personnel due to aggressive behavior toward his girlfriend. She reports that he has no history of medical or psychiatric illness and that this behavior is new. During transport, the patient was combative and difficult to restrain. He currently appears agitated, disoriented, and confused and seems to be responding to internal stimuli. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 170/96 mm Hg, pulse is 118/min, and respirations are 20/min. Nystagmus and ataxia are present on initial neurologic examination. The patient does not cooperate with urine toxicology testing. His symptoms begin to resolve after 8 hours in the emergency department. He has very poor recollection of the previous night's events.",

    "en": "This patient's combative behavior, confusion, poor judgment, memory loss, and hallucinations, accompanied by nystagmus and ataxia on physical examination, are consistent with PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP) intoxication. PCP is a hallucinogen that works primarily as an N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist, as well as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor. PCP was originally developed as an anesthetic, but its use was discontinued due to its adverse effects in humans.\n\nModerate amounts of PCP cause DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS, including detachment and withdrawal. At higher doses, it can induce agitation, HALLUCINATIONS, and VIOLENT BEHAVIOR. Ataxia and NYSTAGMUS (both horizontal and vertical) are other distinguishing symptoms of PCP abuse. Hospital urine toxicology screens usually test for PCP.\n\n(Choice A) Signs and symptoms of cocaine intoxication include tachycardia, hypertension, blurry vision, euphoria, and agitation, typically lasting ≤1 hour. Ischemic effects (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke) can occur due to severe vasoconstriction.\n\n(Choice B) The benzodiazepine diazepam is a central nervous system depressant that produces mild euphoria and relaxation and has significant abuse potential. Intoxication can cause mild amnesia, sedation, slurred speech, respiratory depression, hypotension, and bradycardia.\n\n(Choice C) Heroin intoxication can produce euphoria, lethargy, and coma. Examination shows constricted pupils, decreased bowel sounds, low-normal blood pressure and heart rate, and life-threatening respiratory depression.\n\n(Choice D) Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent hallucinogen with unpredictable effects, including euphoria, depersonalization, and visual illusions. Most patients are oriented and perceive that the effects are due to the drug ingestion. Nystagmus is not present.\n\n(Choice E) Intoxication with the stimulant methamphetamine causes tachycardia, hypertension, agitation, diaphoresis, and hallucinations. Violent behavior may also be seen with its abuse, but nystagmus is less common. Methamphetamine intoxication typically lasts for up to 20 hours, longer than intoxication with PCP.\n\n(Choice G) Marijuana is a cannabinoid that produces euphoria and perceptual distortions. Other findings include increased appetite, red eyes, slowed reflexes, dizziness, and impaired coordination. Nystagmus is not common.\n\nEducational objective: Phencyclidine (PCP) is a hallucinogen that causes dissociative symptoms, agitation, hallucinations, and violent behavior. Ataxia, nystagmus, and memory loss are other distinguishing symptoms of PCP abuse.",
    "zh": "该患者的攻击行为、意识模糊、判断力差、记忆力丧失和幻觉，伴有眼球震颤和共济失调体格检查结果，与苯环利定（PCP）中毒一致。PCP是一种致幻剂，主要作为N-甲基-D-天冬氨酸谷氨酸受体拮抗剂以及单胺再摄取抑制剂。PCP最初被开发为麻醉剂，但由于其对人体的副作用，其使用已被停止。\n\n中等剂量的PCP会导致分离症状，包括脱离和戒断。在高剂量下，它会引起激动、幻觉和暴力行为。共济失调和眼球震颤（水平和垂直）是PCP滥用的其他显著症状。医院尿液毒理学筛查通常检测PCP。\n\n(选项A) 可卡因中毒的体征和症状包括心动过速、高血压、视力模糊、欣快和激动，通常持续时间≤1小时。由于严重的血管收缩，可能会发生缺血性影响（例如，心肌梗死、中风）。\n\n(选项B) 苯二氮卓类药物地西泮是一种中枢神经系统抑制剂，可产生轻度欣快感和放松，并具有显著的滥用潜力。中毒可引起轻度遗忘、镇静、言语不清、呼吸抑制、低血压和心动过缓。\n\n(选项C) 海洛因中毒可引起欣快、嗜睡和昏迷。检查显示瞳孔缩小、肠蠕动音减弱、血压和心率偏低正常，以及危及生命的呼吸抑制。\n\n(选项D) 麦角酸二乙酰胺（LSD）是一种强效致幻剂，具有不可预测的作用，包括欣快、人格解体和视觉错觉。大多数患者定向力良好，并认为这些影响是由于药物摄入所致。不存在眼球震颤。\n\n(选项E) 兴奋剂甲基苯丙胺中毒会导致心动过速、高血压、激动、出汗和幻觉。滥用时也可能出现暴力行为，但眼球震颤不太常见。甲基苯丙胺中毒通常持续长达20小时，比PCP中毒持续时间更长。\n\n(选项G) 大麻是一种大麻素，可产生欣快感和感知扭曲。其他发现包括食欲增加、眼睛发红、反射迟缓、头晕和协调性受损。眼球震颤不常见。\n\n教育目标：苯环利定（PCP）是一种致幻剂，可引起分离症状、激动、幻觉和暴力行为。共济失调、眼球震颤和记忆力丧失是PCP滥用的其他显著症状。"

    "en": "This question tests the recognition of acute intoxication with phencyclidine (PCP) based on a patient's presentation of agitation, disorientation, confusion, combative behavior, nystagmus, and ataxia, with subsequent resolution of symptoms within hours and poor memory of the event.\n\nTo solve this question, one must correlate the constellation of psychiatric and neurological symptoms, including the presence of nystagmus and ataxia, with the known clinical features of various drug intoxications. The rapid resolution of symptoms and amnesia are also key differentiating factors.",
