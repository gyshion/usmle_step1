    "en": "A 53-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to fever and progressive weakness over the last 2 weeks. Yesterday, he also developed shortness of breath. The patient emigrated from Eastern Europe 2 years ago and says he was diagnosed with \"heart disease\" in the distant past, but he does not recall any details. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Despite receiving appropriate medical care, the patient expires during hospitalization. On autopsy, gross examination of his heart shows large, friable masses on the mitral valve with extensive destruction of cuspal tissue.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's presentation - fever, progressive weakness, and dyspnea (due to valvular regurgitation) - along with the presence of vegetations on the mitral valve is consistent with INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS (IE). Predisposing factors for IE include valvular abnormalities (eg, rheumatic heart disease, mitral valve prolapse, prosthetic valves, congenital heart disease) and conditions that promote bacteremia/fungemia (eg, intravenous drug use, dental procedures).\n\nThis patient likely had a remote history of RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE (immigrant from developing region, history of heart disease) with underlying degeneration of the mitral valve due to chronic valvular inflammation and scarring.\n\n(Choice A) Myocardial hypertrophy is seen in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and, in general, does not predispose to IE.\n\n(Choice B) Myocardial fibrosis is associated with infiltrative cardiomyopathy (sarcoidosis, amyloidosis), Chagas disease, myocarditis, and prior myocardial infarction. It does not lead to increased risk of IE.\n\n(Choice C) Pericardial effusion occurs as a result of inflammation of the pericardium (acute or chronic pericarditis) and has no association with the risk of IE.\n\n(Choice D) Rupture of chordae tendineae is a complication of endocarditis or myocardial infarction; it is not a risk factor for development of IE.\n\nEducational objective:\nChronic valvular inflammation and scarring associated with rheumatic heart disease predispose to an increased risk of infective endocarditis, which is characterized by valvular vegetations with destruction of the underlying cardiac tissue.",
    "zh": "该患者的表现——发热、进行性虚弱和呼吸困难（由于瓣膜反流）——以及二尖瓣上赘生物的存在，与感染性心内膜炎 (IE) 相符。IE 的易感因素包括瓣膜异常（如风湿性心脏病、二尖瓣脱垂、人工瓣膜、先天性心脏病）和促进菌血症/真菌血症的病症（如静脉注射吸毒、牙科手术）。\n\n该患者可能既往有风湿性心脏病病史（来自发展中地区的移民，有心脏病史），由于慢性瓣膜炎症和瘢痕形成，导致二尖瓣潜在的退行性变。\n\n（选项 A）心肌肥大见于高血压、主动脉瓣狭窄和肥厚型心肌病的患者，一般来说，它不是IE的易感因素。\n\n（选项 B）心肌纤维化与浸润性心肌病（结节病、淀粉样变性）、恰加斯病、心肌炎和既往心肌梗死有关。它不会导致IE风险增加。\n\n（选项 C）心包积液是心包炎症（急慢性心包炎）的结果，与IE风险无关。\n\n（选项 D）腱索断裂是心内膜炎或心肌梗死的并发症；它不是发生IE的危险因素。\n\n教育目标：\n与风湿性心脏病相关的慢性瓣膜炎症和瘢痕形成会增加感染性心内膜炎的风险，其特征是瓣膜赘生物伴有潜在的心脏组织破坏。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the predisposing factors for infective endocarditis, particularly the association with rheumatic heart disease and valvular abnormalities. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of infective endocarditis and linking it to the patient's history and autopsy findings.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to identify the most likely underlying condition that would lead to valvular damage and subsequent infection. Rheumatic heart disease, resulting in valvular inflammation and scarring, is a common predisposing factor, especially in individuals from regions where the disease is prevalent.",
