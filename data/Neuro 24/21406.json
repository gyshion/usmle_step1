    "en": "A 4-day-old girl is seen in the clinic for follow-up after discharge from the newborn nursery. She was born at 38 weeks gestation via uncomplicated vaginal delivery. On examination, the patient is well appearing and is moving all extremities. Tone and reflexes are normal. A deep sacral pit is noted with a hair tuft over the midline lumbosacral region. The remainder of the examination is normal. A spinal ultrasound is obtained and reveals a low-lying conus medullaris at L5 with a thickened filum terminale. Failure of which of the following embryologic processes is most likely associated with this patient's findings?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient presents with findings suggestive of a closed spinal dysraphism, specifically spina bifida occulta. The presence of a sacral pit with a hair tuft, a low-lying conus medullaris, and a thickened filum terminale are all indicative of this condition. Closed spinal dysraphisms result from incomplete closure of the neural tube or surrounding structures during embryonic development. The most common cause of closed spinal dysraphisms, including spina bifida occulta with these associated findings, is failure of VERTEBRAL ARCH FUSION. This process typically occurs at the L5-S1 level and leads to the vertebral defect that can be associated with cutaneous manifestations like a sacral pit and hair tuft. The low-lying conus medullaris and thickened filum terminale suggest an OCCULT TETHERED CORD, which is often found in conjunction with closed spinal dysraphisms. \n\n(Choice A) Anterior neural tube closure is part of primary neurulation. Failure of this process leads to anencephaly, an open NTD characterized by absence of major portions of the skull and forebrain. This is not consistent with the patient's findings.\n\n(Choice B) The myelencephalon is the precursor of the medulla oblongata; it does not divide into separate hemispheres. Impairment in its development would result in fetal brainstem dysfunction and would likely be fatal. This is not related to the patient's spinal findings.\n\n(Choice C) Neural crest cells are the progenitors for the peripheral (not central) nervous system. Hirschsprung disease is a disorder of neural crest cell migration and results in an aganglionic colonic segment, often causing intestinal obstruction. Spinal cord abnormalities and a cutaneous lumbosacral finding would not be seen.\n\n(Choice D) Failure of notochord separation from the underlying endoderm leads to neurenteric cysts (eg, spinal tumors with gastrointestinal epithelium) rather than spinal dysraphism. \n\nEducational objective: Closed spinal dysraphism (spina bifida occulta or closed neural tube defect) often presents with cutaneous lumbosacral findings (eg, deep pit, hemangioma, tuft of hair) in the newborn period. Pathogenesis involves failure of VERTEBRAL ARCH FUSION, and imaging may suggest an underlying TETHERED CORD (eg, low-lying conus medullaris, thickened filum terminale).",
    "zh": "患者的临床表现提示隐性脊柱裂，特别是隐性脊柱裂。骶窝伴毛发丛、圆锥体位置偏低和终丝增厚都表明存在这种情况。闭合型脊柱裂是由于胚胎发育过程中神经管或周围结构未完全闭合所致。闭合型脊柱裂（包括具有这些相关发现的隐性脊柱裂）最常见的原因是椎弓融合失败。这个过程通常发生在L5-S1水平，并导致椎骨缺陷，这可能与皮肤表现相关，如骶窝和毛发丛。圆锥体位置偏低和终丝增厚提示隐性脊髓拴系，这通常与闭合型脊柱裂合并存在。\n\n（选项 A）前神经管闭合是原神经管形成的一部分。这个过程的失败会导致无脑畸形，这是一种开放性神经管缺陷，其特征是缺乏大部分颅骨和前脑。这与患者的发现不符。\n\n（选项 B）髓脑是延髓的前体；它不会分裂成独立的半球。其发育受损会导致胎儿脑干功能障碍，并且可能致命。这与患者的脊柱发现无关。\n\n（选项 C）神经嵴细胞是周围（而非中枢）神经系统的祖细胞。先天性巨结肠是神经嵴细胞迁移障碍，导致无神经节细胞的结肠段，常引起肠梗阻。不会出现脊髓异常和皮肤腰骶部发现。\n\n（选项 D）脊索与下方的内胚层分离失败会导致神经肠囊肿（例如，具有胃肠上皮的脊髓肿瘤）而不是脊柱裂。\n\n教学目标：闭合型脊柱裂（隐性脊柱裂或闭合型神经管缺陷）在新生儿期常表现为皮肤腰骶部发现（例如，深凹陷、血管瘤、毛发丛）。发病机制涉及椎弓融合失败，影像学检查可能提示潜在的脊髓拴系（例如，圆锥体位置偏低、终丝增厚）。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the embryologic origins of closed spinal dysraphisms, specifically spina bifida occulta, and their associated clinical and imaging findings. It requires correlating cutaneous manifestations and ultrasound findings with specific developmental failures.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key clinical features suggestive of a closed spinal dysraphism (sacral pit, hair tuft, low-lying conus medullaris, thickened filum terminale). Recall the embryologic processes involved in neural tube and vertebral development and determine which failure best explains these findings, focusing on vertebral arch fusion as the primary cause of spina bifida occulta.",
