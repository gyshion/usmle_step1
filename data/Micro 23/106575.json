    "en": "A 3-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department due to 2 days of worsening dysuria and urinary frequency. She is fully toilet-trained, and the parents say that she cries every time she urinates. The patient has had no fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. A small amount of urine is obtained via clean-catch collection. Because of the limited volume, only urinalysis is performed; it shows positive leukocyte esterase and negative nitrites. The patient is prescribed an oral antibiotic, with the first dose given prior to discharge. The following morning, she is taken immediately to the clinic for a follow-up appointment. Another sample is obtained, and urinalysis is now positive for both leukocyte esterase and nitrites. Which of the following factors is most likely responsible for the new urinalysis findings?",

    "en": "This patient with dysuria and urinary leukocyte esterase and nitrites likely has a URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI), which is most commonly caused by fecal flora (e.g. ESCHERICHIA COLI). Females are at increased risk because the urethra is shorter and closer to the anus. Bacterial growth of a single pathogenic organism on urine culture is typically diagnostic. However, URINE DIPSTICK is usually performed initially because it rapidly assesses for UTI pending culture results.\n\nThe most specific dipstick finding for bacterial UTI is NITRITES. Pathophysiology involves production of nitrate reductase by certain bacteria (e.g. E. COLI, KLEBSIELLA, PROTEUS); this bacterial enzyme reduces normal urinary nitrate (NO3-) to nitrite (NO2-). The level of nitrites correlates with the INCUBATION TIME OF BACTERIA in the bladder.\n\nIn patients with UTI caused by nitrate reductase-producing bacteria, dipstick analysis performed on the FIRST VOIDED URINE in the morning is usually POSITIVE due to prolonged overnight bacterial incubation (>4 hr), allowing nitrites to accumulate. In contrast, specimens obtained DURING THE DAY may show FALSE NEGATIVE results, as in this patient’s initial sample, because of the shorter duration of urine in the bladder and urinary frequency.\n\n(Choice A) A first-morning void is typically more (not less) concentrated than a sample obtained during the day. Detection of urinary nitrites is more likely in concentrated than in dilute urine; this is likely related to relatively decreased oral intake of fluids, and therefore urinary frequency as well, leading to a prolonged duration of bacteria in the bladder.\n\n(Choice B) Leukocyte esterase, another common dipstick finding in UTIs, is released by lysed neutrophils/macrophages and is a marker of white blood cell activity and inflammation. However, nitrite production is not related to white blood cell activity.\n\n(Choice D) Antibiotic-resistant organisms can lead to persistent abnormalities on urine studies despite empiric antibiotic therapy. However, resistance would not affect bacteria’s ability to produce nitrate reductase, and therefore does not explain this patient’s new finding of nitrites.\n\n(Choice E) Bacterial contaminants can alter culture results due to the prolonged incubation time of the test. However, the short duration between urine collection and dipstick analysis is insufficient for nitrite production from contaminants. Moreover, contaminants that can produce nitrites are typically from the stool, not the skin.\n\nEducational objective:\nNitrites on dipstick are highly specific for urinary tract infections. False negative results can occur when the incubation time of nitrate reductase-producing bacteria in the bladder is insufficient (eg, frequent urination) to allow for accumulation of bacterial metabolites.",
    "zh": "该患者出现排尿困难，尿白细胞酯酶和亚硝酸盐阳性，可能患有尿路感染（UTI），通常由粪便菌群（例如，大肠埃希菌）引起。女性的风险增加，因为尿道较短且更靠近肛门。尿培养中单一病原体的细菌生长通常具有诊断意义。然而，通常首先进行尿液试纸检测，因为它可以在培养结果出来之前快速评估UTI。\n\n细菌性UTI最特异的试纸检测结果是亚硝酸盐。病理生理学涉及某些细菌（例如，大肠杆菌、克雷伯菌、变形杆菌）产生硝酸盐还原酶；这种细菌酶将正常的尿硝酸盐（NO3-）还原为亚硝酸盐（NO2-）。亚硝酸盐的水平与细菌在膀胱中的孵育时间相关。\n\n在由产生硝酸盐还原酶的细菌引起的UTI患者中，在早晨首次排尿时进行的试纸分析通常呈阳性，这归因于过夜细菌的长时间孵育（>4小时），从而使亚硝酸盐积累。相比之下，在白天获得的样本可能显示假阴性结果，如该患者的初始样本所示，因为尿液在膀胱中的停留时间和尿频较短。\n\n（选项 A）早晨第一次排尿通常比白天获得的样本更浓缩（而非更稀释）。在浓缩尿液中检测到尿亚硝酸盐的可能性高于稀释尿液；这可能与相对减少的液体摄入量以及尿频有关，从而导致细菌在膀胱中停留的时间延长。\n\n（选项 B）白细胞酯酶是UTI中另一种常见的试纸检测结果，由溶解的嗜中性粒细胞/巨噬细胞释放，是白细胞活性和炎症的标志。然而，亚硝酸盐的产生与白细胞活性无关。\n\n（选项 D）耐药菌会导致尿液检查持续异常，尽管经验性抗生素治疗。然而，耐药性不会影响细菌产生硝酸盐还原酶的能力，因此无法解释该患者新的亚硝酸盐阳性结果。\n\n（选项 E）细菌污染物会由于测试的延长孵育时间而改变培养结果。然而，尿液收集和试纸分析之间的时间不足以使污染物产生亚硝酸盐。此外，可以产生亚硝酸盐的污染物通常来自粪便，而不是皮肤。\n\n教育目标：\n试纸检测中的亚硝酸盐对尿路感染具有高度特异性。当膀胱中产生硝酸盐还原酶的细菌的孵育时间不足（例如，尿频）以允许细菌代谢物积累时，可能会出现假阴性结果。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of urinary tract infection diagnosis using urine dipstick, specifically the significance of nitrites and factors affecting their detection. It emphasizes the importance of bacterial incubation time in the bladder for nitrite production and the potential for false negative results with frequent urination.\n\nTo solve this question, understand that nitrites are produced by bacteria in the urine. Recognize that the first morning void typically has a longer incubation time, allowing for more nitrite production, and that frequent urination can lead to false negative results due to insufficient incubation time.",
