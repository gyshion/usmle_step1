    "en": "This patient with atrial fibrillation has most likely had an embolic stroke. Her visual deficit involves the same half of the visual fields in both eyes (homonymous hemianopia) with sparing of the central portion of vision (macular sparing), a common manifestation of posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stroke. The PCA supplies the occipital lobe, which contains the primary visual cortex. The primary visual cortex of each hemisphere receives information about the contralateral visual field from the ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus via the optic radiations. The upper bank of the primary visual cortex is separated from the lower bank by the calcarine fissure; the upper cuneus gyrus receives information from the lower visual field, while the bottom lingual gyrus receives information from the upper visual field (similar to right-left contralateral processing).\n\nOcclusion of the PCA leads to ischemic injury to the occipital lobe, producing contralateral homonymous hemianopia. The macula is often spared because collateral blood is supplied by the middle cerebral artery to the occipital pole, which processes central visual information.\n\n(Choice A) Anterior cerebral artery occlusion manifests as contralateral weakness and sensory deficits that predominantly affect the lower extremity. Personality or executive dysfunction can also be seen due to damage to the prefrontal cortex.\n\n(Choice B) Occlusion of the central retinal artery leads to sudden, painless, complete loss of vision, but only in one eye.\n\n(Choice C) Middle cerebral artery stroke is characterized by contralateral motor and sensory deficits (more pronounced in the upper than lower limb). Homonymous hemianopia can also occur due to damage to the optic radiations; however, affected patients would likely have prominent motor weakness.\n\n(Choice E) Occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery classically leads to lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome. It is characterized by loss of pain and temperature sensation in the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral bulbar weakness, vertigo, ataxia, and Horner's syndrome.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe most common finding with posterior cerebral artery stroke is contralateral homonymous hemianopia. The macula is often spared because there is collateral circulation from the middle cerebral artery to the occipital pole, the area that processes central vision.",
    "zh": "该房颤患者很可能发生了栓塞性卒中。她的视觉缺陷累及双眼相同的视野半侧（同向偏盲），并保留了中心视力（黄斑保留），这是大脑后动脉（PCA）卒中的常见表现。PCA 供应枕叶，枕叶包含主要视觉皮层。每个半球的主要视觉皮层通过视放射接收来自同侧外侧膝状体的关于对侧视野的信息。主要视觉皮层的上部与下部被距状裂分隔开；上楔叶接收来自下视野的信息，而下舌回接收来自上视野的信息（类似于右-左对侧处理）。\n\nPCA 闭塞导致枕叶缺血性损伤，产生对侧同向偏盲。黄斑通常得到保留，因为有来自大脑中动脉到枕极的侧支血供，枕极处理中心视觉信息。\n\n(选项 A) 大脑前动脉闭塞表现为对侧肢体无力和感觉缺失，主要影响下肢。由于对前额叶皮层的损害，也可出现人格或执行功能障碍。\n\n(选项 B) 视网膜中央动脉闭塞导致突然、无痛、完全的单眼视力丧失。\n\n(选项 C) 大脑中动脉卒中的特征是对侧运动和感觉缺失（在上肢比下肢更明显）。由于视放射损伤，也可能发生同向偏盲；然而，受影响的患者可能会有明显的运动无力。\n\n(选项 E) 小脑后下动脉闭塞通常导致延髓外侧（Wallenberg）综合征。其特征是对侧身体和同侧面部的疼痛和温度感觉丧失、同侧球部无力、眩晕、共济失调和 Horner 综合征。\n\n教育目标：\n大脑后动脉卒中最常见的发现是对侧同向偏盲。由于有来自大脑中动脉到枕极（处理中心视觉的区域）的侧支循环，黄斑通常得到保留。"
