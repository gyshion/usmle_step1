    "en": "A 67-year-old man is admitted to the hospital due to acute right-sided weakness. Medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease, for which the patient underwent placement of 2 stents in the left anterior descending artery. He also has intermittent claudication that limits exercise capacity. The patient's antihypertensive regimen includes chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and lisinopril, which he takes as prescribed. He is an ex-smoker with a 35-pack-year history. Blood pressure is 180/110 mm Hg and pulse is 80/min. Serum creatinine is 1.6 mg/dL. CT scan of the head reveals hemorrhage of the left basal ganglia, and renal ultrasound shows that the right kidney is 7 cm long and the left kidney is 11 cm long. Which of the following mechanisms most likely explains the renal morphology in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient has an intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the setting of severe, refractory hypertension. He has coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease (claudication) with multiple risk factors (eg, smoking, hyperlipidemia) for diffuse atherosclerosis. The elevated serum creatinine and the renal ultrasound demonstrating a small (atrophic) right kidney suggest that the patient's refractory hypertension is most likely due to unilateral renal artery stenosis {{exhibit_1}}.\n\nThe most common cause of renal artery stenosis is obstruction by atheromatous plaque at the origin of the renal artery, leading to unilateral renal ischemia. The ischemic kidney secretes high levels of renin, which activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and results in systemic hypertension that is often difficult to control despite aggressive antihypertensive therapy. Eventually, the stenosis may also cause renal atrophy due to oxygen and nutrient deprivation. On histologic examination, the atrophic kidney shows crowded glomeruli, tubulointerstitial atrophy and fibrosis, and often, focal inflammatory infiltrates.\n\n(Choice A) Congenital renal hypoplasia is a failure of the kidneys to develop to normal size. Involvement is unilateral in most cases. However, this condition does not cause secondary hypertension.\n\n(Choice B) Unilateral denervation of a kidney, either during or after development, is not known to have significant trophic effects (affecting kidney growth or morphology).\n\n(Choice C) The role of trophic hormones in renal development remains unclear. Still, a deficiency of such hormones would be expected to produce bilateral renal dysplasia.\n\n(Choice E) Aging is associated with loss of nephron mass as a result of variable degrees of arteriolosclerosis, focal glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. These processes produce symmetric, not unilateral, decrements in kidney size and functional capacity.\n\nEducational objective:\nRenal artery stenosis is most often due to atherosclerosis. It can cause severe, refractory hypertension due to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Over time, renal atrophy may occur due to chronic oxygen and nutrient deprivation. Histologic examination may show crowded glomeruli, tubulointerstitial atrophy and fibrosis, and focal inflammatory infiltrates.",
    "zh": "该患者在高血压难治的背景下出现实质内出血。他患有冠心病和周围血管疾病（跛行），并且存在弥漫性动脉粥样硬化的多种危险因素（例如，吸烟、高脂血症）。血清肌酐升高和肾脏超声显示右肾缩小（萎缩）表明该患者的难治性高血压最可能由单侧肾动脉狭窄引起 {{exhibit_1}}。\n\n肾动脉狭窄最常见的原因是肾动脉起始处的粥样硬化斑块阻塞，导致单侧肾脏缺血。缺血的肾脏分泌高水平的肾素，激活肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统，导致全身性高血压，尽管积极的降压治疗，也往往难以控制。最终，狭窄还可能由于氧气和营养物质的剥夺而导致肾脏萎缩。组织学检查显示，萎缩的肾脏显示肾小球拥挤，肾小管间质萎缩和纤维化，并且经常出现局灶性炎症浸润。\n\n(选项A) 先天性肾发育不全是指肾脏未能发育到正常大小。大多数情况下，仅涉及单侧。然而，这种情况不会导致继发性高血压。\n\n(选项B) 肾脏的单侧神经支配缺失，无论是在发育期间还是之后，均未知具有显著的营养作用（影响肾脏生长或形态）。\n\n(选项C) 营养激素在肾脏发育中的作用尚不清楚。尽管如此，此类激素的缺乏预计会产生双侧肾发育不良。\n\n(选项E) 衰老与肾单位数量减少相关，这是由于不同程度的动脉硬化、局灶性肾小球硬化和肾小管间质纤维化所致。这些过程导致肾脏大小和功能容量的对称性降低，而不是单侧降低。\n\n教育目标：\n肾动脉狭窄最常由动脉粥样硬化引起。由于肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统的激活，它可导致严重、难治性高血压。随着时间的推移，由于慢性氧气和营养物质的剥夺，可能发生肾脏萎缩。组织学检查可能显示肾小球拥挤，肾小管间质萎缩和纤维化，以及局灶性炎症浸润。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of renal artery stenosis, its etiology (atherosclerosis), and its consequences, including refractory hypertension and renal atrophy due to ischemia. It also requires differentiating unilateral renal atrophy from other causes of kidney size abnormalities.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's risk factors for atherosclerosis, the presence of refractory hypertension, and the unilateral difference in kidney size. Consider renal artery stenosis as a cause of secondary hypertension and renal atrophy, leading to oxygen and nutrient deprivation.",
