    "en": "A 1-week-old boy is brought to the office for his first primary care visit following an uncomplicated vaginal delivery at 40 weeks gestation. The patient was born to a 30-year-old woman who took prenatal vitamins throughout the pregnancy. The nursery course was uncomplicated, and he was discharged at approximately 30 hours of life following observation of appropriate breastfeeding, voiding, and stooling. Weight, length, and head circumference are at the 50th percentile. Physical examination shows a grade II/VI harsh, holosystolic murmur best heard at the left-mid to left-lower sternal border. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. Review of medical records shows absence of the murmur at birth. This patient's findings are most likely due to which of the following embryologic events?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's harsh, holosystolic murmur is characteristic of ventricular septal defect (VSD), occurring due to inadequate development of the interventricular septum. This septum is composed of muscular and membranous portions; failed fusion of any of its derivative parts results in VSD. The associated murmur may not be audible immediately after birth due to high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) that limits left-to-right shunting through the VSD; it typically develops over the ensuing days as PVR declines (as in this case).\n\n*   Small VSDs are typically asymptomatic due to the small volume of shunted blood, but turbulent flow through this narrow connection causes a harsh, holosystolic murmur at the left-mid to left-lower sternal border. Unlike larger defects, small VSDs usually undergo spontaneous closure.\n*   Moderate to large VSDs lead to pulmonary overcirculation and left-s dec volume overload that can cause heart failure (eg, diaphoresis, failure to thrive); larger shunts increase the risk. Because of relatively unrestricted flow compared to smaller defects, auscultation typically demonstrates a softer or no murmur. Chronic left-to-right shunting can also eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension with shunt reversal and resulting cyanosis (Eisenmenger syndrome).\n\n(Choices A and B) Atrial septal defect (ASD) can occur due to failed fusion of the septum primum and endocardial cushions (primum ASD) or to arrested growth of the septum secundum (secundum ASD); it permits left-to-right shunting. The characteristic systolic ejection murmur best heard over the second intercostal space is caused by right-sided volume overload and increased flow across the pulmonic valve.\n\n(Choice C) Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occurs due to failed obliteration of the vascular connection between the pulmonary artery and aorta and allows left-to-right shunting. Like VSD, a PDA murmur typically increases in intensity as PVR declines following birth; the continuous murmur is best heard at the left upper sternal border.\n\n(Choice E) Malalignment of the infundibular septum can cause varying degrees of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, as in tetralogy of Fallot. Patients typically have a large VSD and a murmur created by flow through the partially obstructed RVOT (crescendo-decrescendo murmur best heard along the left mid to upper sternal border).\n\nEducational objective:\nVentricular septal defect occurs due to insufficient development of the interventricular septum and commonly presents with a holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border as pulmonary vascular resistance declines in the neonatal period. Presentation varies from asymptomatic murmur (small defect) to heart failure (large defect).",
    "zh": "该患者的粗糙的全收缩期杂音是室间隔缺损 (VSD) 的特征，是由于室间隔发育不足引起的。该间隔由肌肉部分和膜性部分组成；任何其衍生部分的融合失败都会导致 VSD。相关的杂音在出生后可能无法立即听到，这是因为肺血管阻力 (PVR) 较高，限制了通过 VSD 的左向右分流；它通常在随后的几天内随着 PVR 降低而发生（如本例）。\n\n*   小的 VSD 通常无症状，因为分流的血量较少，但通过这种狭窄连接的湍流会引起在左中至左下胸骨旁听诊到的粗糙的全收缩期杂音。与较大的缺损不同，小的 VSD 通常会自发闭合。\n*   中度至重度 VSD 导致肺过度循环和左心室容量超负荷，这可能导致心力衰竭（例如，出汗、生长迟缓）；较大的分流会增加风险。由于流速相对不受限制，与较小的缺损相比，听诊通常显示杂音较柔和或无杂音。慢性的左向右分流最终也可能导致肺动脉高压，伴有分流逆转和随之而来的紫绀（艾森门格综合征）。\n\n（选项 A 和 B） 房间隔缺损 (ASD) 可因原始间隔和心内膜垫融合失败（原发性 ASD）或继发间隔生长停滞（继发性 ASD）而发生；它允许左向右分流。在第二肋间隙听诊到的特征性收缩期喷射性杂音是由右侧容量超负荷和跨肺动脉瓣的血流增加引起的。\n\n（选项 C） 动脉导管未闭 (PDA) 是由于肺动脉和主动脉之间的血管连接未能闭合而发生的，并允许左向右分流。与 VSD 一样，PDA 杂音的强度通常会随着出生后 PVR 的降低而增加；连续性杂音最好在左上胸骨旁听到。\n\n（选项 E） 漏斗间隔错位可导致不同程度的右心室流出道 (RVOT) 梗阻，如法洛四联症。患者通常有大的 VSD 和一个由流经部分阻塞的 RVOT 产生的杂音（最常在左中至上胸骨旁听诊到的渐强-减弱杂音）。\n\n教育目标：\n室间隔缺损是由于室间隔发育不足引起的，通常表现为新生儿期肺血管阻力降低时在左下胸骨旁的全收缩期杂音。表现从无症状杂音（小缺损）到心力衰竭（大缺损）不等。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of congenital heart defects, specifically ventricular septal defect (VSD), and its embryological origin and clinical presentation. It requires understanding the relationship between the murmur characteristics, timing of presentation, and the underlying embryological defect.\n\nThe best approach is to correlate the murmur description (harsh, holosystolic at the left lower sternal border) with the most likely underlying cardiac defect. Consider the timing of murmur appearance (after birth as PVR decreases) and the embryological development of the heart to narrow down the options to the correct embryologic event.",
