    "en": "A 42-year-old man comes to the office due to progressive fatigue, nausea, and itchiness. On review of systems, the patient admits that he occasionally has bloody stools. Medical history is unremarkable. Examination shows scleral icterus. Percutaneous liver biopsy is performed, and histologic analysis of the tissue sample reveals fibrous obliteration of intrahepatic bile ducts with concentric replacement by connective tissue.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with fatigue, nausea, pruritus, and scleral icterus has characteristic biopsy findings associated with PRIMARY SCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS (PSC), a chronic disorder characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and stricture of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. Histologic features include FIBROUS OBLITERATION OF THE BILE DUCTS as well as CONCENTRIC PERIDUCTAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE deposition, which resembles an onion skin-like pattern {{exhibit_1}}. PSC affects men disproportionately and has a strong association with ULCERATIVE COLITIS, likely explaining this patient's bloody stools.\n\nManifestations of PSC are related to cholestasis and include pruritus, jaundice, and fatigue. Laboratory findings also reflect a CHOLESTATIC PATTERN of liver injury and include elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, direct hyperbilirubinemia, and normal to mildly elevated aminotransferases. The diagnosis is typically confirmed with cholangiography (eg, MR or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) demonstrating multifocal bile duct stricture with segmental dilations.\n\n(Choice A) Autoimmune hepatitis can cause fatigue, pruritus, and jaundice but is characterized histologically by portal and periportal lymphoplasmacytic infiltration {{exhibit_2}}. It is usually diagnosed in women with other autoimmune conditions (eg, celiac disease).\n\n(Choice B) Cytomegalovirus infection can cause hepatitis; however, microscopy typically reveals large cells with basophilic intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions (eg, owl's eye appearance) {{exhibit_3}}. In addition, it typically occurs in immunocompromised individuals (eg, transplant patients).\n\n(Choice C) Hemochromatosis leads to excessive hepatic iron storage, which results in visible iron deposits within hepatocytes {{exhibit_4}}. It is typically associated with diabetes, skin hyperpigmentation, arthralgias, and cardiomyopathy.\n\n(Choice D) Primary biliary cholangitis also causes cholestasis with jaundice and pruritus; however, it is characterized histologically by inflammation and granulomatous destruction of the small bile ducts (eg, florid duct lesions) {{exhibit_5}}. In addition, it is much more common in women and is not usually associated with inflammatory bowel disease. {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "该患者出现疲劳、恶心、瘙痒和巩膜黄染，具有与原发性硬化性胆管炎 (PSC) 相关的特征性活检结果，PSC 是一种以肝内和肝外胆管炎症、纤维化和狭窄为特征的慢性疾病。组织学特征包括胆管纤维性闭塞以及结缔组织同心性分布，类似于洋葱皮样改变 {{exhibit_1}}。PSC 影响男性比例过高，并与溃疡性结肠炎密切相关，这可能解释了该患者的便血。\n\nPSC 的表现与胆汁淤积有关，包括瘙痒、黄疸和疲劳。实验室检查结果也反映出肝损伤的胆汁淤积模式，包括碱性磷酸酶水平升高、直接胆红素血症和转氨酶正常或轻度升高。通常通过胆管造影（例如，MR 或内镜逆行胰胆管造影）确诊，显示多灶性胆管狭窄伴节段性扩张。\n\n(选项 A) 自身免疫性肝炎可引起疲劳、瘙痒和黄疸，但其组织学特征为门管区和门周淋巴浆细胞浸润 {{exhibit_2}}。它通常在患有其他自身免疫性疾病的女性中诊断（例如，乳糜泻）。\n\n(选项 B) 巨细胞病毒感染可引起肝炎；然而，显微镜检查通常显示具有嗜碱性细胞质内和核内包涵体的大细胞（例如，猫头鹰眼外观） {{exhibit_3}}。此外，它通常发生在免疫功能低下的人群中（例如，移植患者）。\n\n(选项 C) 血色病导致肝内铁过量储存，导致肝细胞内出现可见的铁沉积 {{exhibit_4}}。它通常与糖尿病、皮肤色素沉着过度、关节痛和心肌病有关。\n\n(选项 D) 原发性胆汁性胆管炎也引起胆汁淤积，出现黄疸和瘙痒；然而，它的组织学特征是小胆管炎症和肉芽肿性破坏（例如，明显的导管病变） {{exhibit_5}}。此外，它在女性中更为常见，并且通常与炎症性肠病无关。 {{exhibit_6}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the clinical presentation, diagnostic findings, and associations of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). It requires recognizing the characteristic histologic features of PSC on liver biopsy and its association with ulcerative colitis.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key findings of fibrous obliteration of intrahepatic bile ducts with concentric replacement by connective tissue on liver biopsy, along with the patient's history of bloody stools, suggesting ulcerative colitis. This combination strongly points towards PSC.",
