    "en": "A 41-year-old woman, gravida 3 para 2, at 34 weeks gestation comes to the office for a routine prenatal visit. For the past 2 weeks, the patient has had increasing pain over the pubic symphysis that is unrelieved with acetaminophen or warm compresses. She has had no dysuria, hematuria, contractions, or vaginal bleeding. The patient has hypothyroidism that is well controlled with levothyroxine. Vital signs are normal. Examination shows a tender, slightly widened pubic symphysis. Sensation is intact. Which of the following hormones is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's pain?",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a slightly widened pubic symphysis, a common but often painful adaptation of pregnancy that occurs due to increased relaxin levels.\n\nRelaxin is a hormone produced by the corpus luteum (in the first trimester) and the placenta (in the second and third trimesters). Its primary role during pregnancy is to promote physiologic changes to the maternal musculoskeletal system. Relaxin causes increased ligament elasticity, which is of particular importance in the pubic symphysis and sacroiliac joints. The increased laxity of these pelvic joints increases pelvic mobility, widens the pelvic outlet, and changes the angle of the ilium to the sacrum – all of which facilitate vaginal delivery.\n\nAlthough these musculoskeletal adaptations are physiologic, in some patients (particularly those who are multiparous or obese) there is excessive or asymmetric joint laxity, which leads to joint destabilization and pain over the pubic symphysis or the sacroiliac joints.\n\n(Choices A and C) During pregnancy, growth hormone secretion by the maternal pituitary gland is gradually replaced by placental growth hormone (PGH) secreted by placental syncytiotrophoblasts. PGH directly stimulates placental development and promotes fetal growth by mobilizing maternal energy stores (eg, increasing gluconeogenesis, lipolysis).\n\n(Choice B) Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is secreted by placental syncytiotrophoblasts. The role of hCG is to signal the ovary to maintain the corpus luteum for continued progesterone production in early pregnancy.\n\n(Choice D) Oxytocin is a hormone released from the maternal pituitary gland; its primary role in pregnancy is to stimulate uterine contractions during labor.",
    "zh": "该患者耻骨联合略有增宽，这是妊娠期间常见的但通常伴有疼痛的适应性改变，其发生是由于松弛素水平升高。\n\n松弛素是由黄体（在妊娠早期）和胎盘（在妊娠中晚期）产生的激素。它在妊娠期间的主要作用是促进母体肌肉骨骼系统的生理变化。松弛素引起韧带弹性增加，这对耻骨联合和骶髂关节尤为重要。这些骨盆关节的松弛度增加会增加骨盆活动度，扩大骨盆出口，并改变髂骨与骶骨的角度——所有这些都有助于阴道分娩。\n\n尽管这些肌肉骨骼适应是生理性的，但在某些患者（尤其是经产妇或肥胖患者）中，存在过度或不对称的关节松弛，这会导致关节不稳定，并引起耻骨联合或骶髂关节上方疼痛。\n\n（选项 A 和 C）在妊娠期间，母体垂体产生的生长激素分泌逐渐被胎盘合体滋养层细胞分泌的胎盘生长激素 (PGH) 所取代。 PGH通过动员母体能量储存（例如，增加糖异生、脂解）直接刺激胎盘发育并促进胎儿生长。\n\n（选项 B）人绒毛膜促性腺激素 (hCG) 由胎盘合体滋养层细胞分泌。hCG 的作用是向卵巢发出信号，以维持黄体，从而在妊娠早期持续产生孕酮。\n\n（选项 D）催产素是从母体垂体释放的激素；其在妊娠期间的主要作用是刺激分娩时的子宫收缩。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of hormonal changes during pregnancy and their effects on the musculoskeletal system, specifically the cause of pelvic girdle pain. It assesses knowledge of the role of relaxin in joint laxity and its contribution to pubic symphysis pain.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key clinical features: a pregnant patient with pain and tenderness over the pubic symphysis, and a slightly widened pubic symphysis on examination. Recall the hormonal milieu of pregnancy and the specific functions of each hormone listed in the options, focusing on those that affect connective tissues and joints.",
