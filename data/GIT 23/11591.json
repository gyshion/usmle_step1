    "en": "A 30-year-old man with a year-long history of heartburn comes to the office due to worsening substernal burning. The symptoms are particularly intense at night. Recently, the patient has also started noticing pain with swallowing food, although there is no sensation of food getting stuck in his throat. The patient initially treated himself with over-the-counter calcium carbonate antacid, but the treatment has become less effective recently. He has no other chronic medical conditions. Recent HIV testing was negative. The patient takes no other medications. He drinks 2 or 3 beers each evening and smokes a pack of cigarettes daily. BMI is 34 kg/m². Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy is planned. This patient's recent worsening of symptoms is most likely related to which of the following?",
    "zh": "一名30岁男性，有1年反酸病史，因胸骨后灼热感加重前来就诊。症状在夜间尤为剧烈。最近，患者还开始注意到吞咽食物时疼痛，尽管没有食物卡在喉咙里的感觉。患者最初使用非处方碳酸钙抗酸剂自我治疗，但最近治疗效果变差。他没有其他慢性疾病。最近的HIV检测结果为阴性。患者没有服用其他药物。他每天晚上喝2到3杯啤酒，并且每天吸一包香烟。BMI为34 kg/m²。生命体征在正常范围内。体格检查未发现异常。计划进行食管胃十二指肠镜检查。该患者最近症状恶化的最可能原因与以下哪项有关？"

    "en": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is caused by the retrograde flow of acidic stomach contents through the lower esophageal sphincter into the esophagus. Patients with GERD typically experience postprandial substernal burning pain or reflux (regurgitation of acid and/or undigested foods).\n\nAlthough uncomplicated GERD is not associated with significant esophageal mucosal injury, prolonged epithelial exposure to highly acidic secretions can result in epithelial damage and complications, such as:\n\n*   Erosive esophageal disease with development of esophageal ulcers, which is often marked by a worsening of baseline GERD symptoms and the development of odynophagia (painful swallowing).\n*   Barrett esophagus, characterized by the replacement of normal stratified squamous epithelium with metaplastic columnar epithelium in the distal esophagus. This metaplastic change results from long-standing GERD, but typically does not produce any new symptoms (eg, no odynophagia) (Choice A).\n*   Esophageal stricture, which typically develops in the setting of a healing esophageal ulcer when collagen fibers contract and cause narrowing of the esophageal lumen. Strictures are associated with a sensation of food getting stuck in the esophagus but do not cause odynophagia (as no active ulceration is present) (Choice E).\n\n(Choice C) Infectious esophagitis presents with odynophagia and can be caused by a number of pathogens, including cytomegalovirus, Candida, and herpes simplex virus. However, it usually develops in immunocompromised patients (eg, HIV, corticosteroid therapy); this patient's odynophagia is more likely the result of erosive esophagitis secondary to chronic GERD.\n\n(Choice D) Although this patient has risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma (ie, GERD, tobacco use) and squamous cell carcinoma (ie, alcohol and tobacco use), accompanying symptoms such as weight loss and dysphagia (caused by mechanical obstruction of food by the tumor) are expected. This patient's young age, relatively short duration of GERD, and presence of odynophagia and heartburn as sole symptoms make malignancy less likely.\n\nEducational objective:\nNew-onset odynophagia in the setting of gastroesophageal reflux disease should raise suspicion for erosive esophagitis (eg, esophageal ulcers).",
    "zh": "胃食管反流病（GERD）是由酸性胃内容物通过食管下括约肌逆行流入食管引起的。GERD患者通常会经历餐后胸骨后灼热痛或反流（反酸和/或未消化的食物反流）。\n\n尽管单纯性GERD与食管粘膜损伤无关，但上皮长期暴露于高酸性分泌物中可导致上皮损伤和并发症，例如：\n\n*   糜烂性食管疾病，伴有食管溃疡的发生，这通常以GERD基线症状恶化和吞咽疼痛（吞咽疼痛）为特征。\n*   巴雷特食管，其特征在于正常复层鳞状上皮被远端食管的化生柱状上皮取代。这种化生改变源于长期GERD，但通常不会产生任何新症状（例如，无吞咽疼痛）（选项A）。\n*   食管狭窄，通常发生在食管溃疡愈合的情况下，当胶原纤维收缩并导致食管腔变窄时。狭窄与食物卡在食管中的感觉有关，但不会引起吞咽疼痛（因为不存在活动性溃疡）（选项E）。\n\n（选项C）感染性食管炎表现为吞咽疼痛，可由多种病原体引起，包括巨细胞病毒、念珠菌和单纯疱疹病毒。然而，它通常发生在免疫功能低下的患者中（例如，HIV，皮质类固醇治疗）；该患者的吞咽疼痛更有可能是继发于慢性GERD的糜烂性食管炎的结果。\n\n（选项D）尽管该患者有食管腺癌（即，GERD，烟草使用）和鳞状细胞癌（即，酒精和烟草使用）的危险因素，但预计会出现体重减轻和吞咽困难（由肿瘤引起的食物机械阻塞所致）等伴随症状。该患者的年轻，GERD病程相对较短，以及吞咽疼痛和烧心作为唯一症状的存在使恶性肿瘤的可能性降低。\n\n教育目标：\n在胃食管反流病的情况下，新出现的吞咽疼痛应引起对糜烂性食管炎（例如，食管溃疡）的怀疑。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its complications, specifically erosive esophagitis. It also assesses the ability to differentiate between various causes of odynophagia.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the patient's history of heartburn, risk factors for GERD (alcohol, smoking, obesity), and the new symptom of odynophagia. This combination points towards erosive esophagitis as the most likely cause.",
