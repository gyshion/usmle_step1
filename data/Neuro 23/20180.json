The parents report that the infant has been breastfeeding well but has been only minimally moving her right arm compared to the left. Vital signs are normal. On examination, the right upper extremity is held in adduction and internal rotation with the elbow extended, forearm pronated, and wrist flexed. Moro and biceps reflexes are absent in the right arm; grasp reflex is intact. The remainder of the examination is normal. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient most likely has an injury to the C5 and C6 nerve roots of the brachial plexus, causing Erb-Duchenne palsy. Infants with Erb-Duchenne palsy have weakness of the deltoid and infraspinatus muscles (innervated by C5) and the biceps and wrist extensors (innervated by C6). This leads to predominance of the opposing muscles and results in the affected arm being held in adduction and internal rotation with the forearm pronated and the wrist flexed (i.e. waiter's tip posture). In some patients, the C7 nerve root is also involved, leading to weaker finger extension and fingers held in a flexed position. Patients typically have decreased or absent Moro and biceps reflexes, but the grasp reflex remains intact.\n\nIn this patient, the brachial plexus injury likely occurred during the difficult home delivery. Erb-Duchenne palsy is commonly associated with shoulder dystocia, which occurs when the fetal shoulder becomes impacted behind the pubic symphysis during delivery, possibly resulting in excessive traction on the head and neck and injury to the brachial plexus nerve roots. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}\n\n(Choice A) Hemisection of the cervical spinal cord can cause Brown-Séquard syndrome, which is characterized by ipsilateral hemiparesis at and below the level of the spinal cord injury (along with sensory deficits). In contrast to Erb-Duchenne palsy, Brown-Séquard syndrome would cause upper and lower extremity hemiparesis.\n\n(Choice C) Injury to the C8 and T1 nerve roots results in Klumpke palsy, which is characterized by loss of wrist/metacarpophalangeal joint flexion and interphalangeal joint extension, leading to clawhand posture and absent (vs intact) grasp reflex.\n\n(Choice D) A medial cord injury affects the median and ulnar nerves. In addition to innervating the wrist flexors, the median and ulnar nerves innervate all the intrinsic muscles of the hand. Injury would lead to wrist extension (vs flexion) and an absent (vs intact) grasp reflex.\n\n(Choice E) A posterior cord injury would cause axillary and radial nerve deficits. Although this would lead to arm adduction and internal rotation (loss of axillary-innervated deltoid and teres minor function) and wrist flexion (loss of radial-innervated wrist extension), a posture of elbow flexion (loss of radial-innervated elbow extension) would be expected.\n\nEducational objective:\nInjury to the C5 and C6 nerve roots causes Erb-Duchenne palsy, which is characterized by waiter's tip posture. The affected arm may have decreased or absent Moro and biceps reflexes; grasp reflex remains intact.",

It assesses the ability to differentiate this condition from other neurological injuries based on physical exam findings.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic \"waiter's tip\" posture, absent Moro and biceps reflexes, and intact grasp reflex.
