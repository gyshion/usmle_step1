    "en": "A 42-year-old woman comes to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain. She was moving furniture in her summer house 2 days ago when she experienced sharp pain in the left side of the sternum that quickly subsided. Since then, the patient has had episodic pain with deep inspiration or trunk movement. She has no fever or cough. The patient has a history of hypertension. Her father died of myocardial infarction at age 67. She does not use tobacco or illicit drugs. Blood pressure is 146/85 mm Hg in the right arm and 142/80 mm Hg in the left arm, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 12/min. She has localized tenderness to palpation at the left sternal border. Lungs are clear to auscultation, and cardiac examination reveals normal heart sounds without gallops or murmurs. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There is no peripheral edema.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's chest pain is most likely due to costosternal syndrome (also known as costochondritis or anterior chest wall syndrome) involving the regional chest wall. It usually occurs after repetitive activity and involves the upper costal cartilage at the costochondral or costosternal junctions. The pain is typically reproduced with palpation and worsened with movement or changes in position (eg, horizontal arm flexion). Patients typically do not have palpable warmth, swelling, or erythema.\n\n(Choices A, G, and I) Conditions causing inflammation of the pleura or pericardium can cause sharp pain worsened with inspiration. Pericarditis often follows an upper respiratory viral syndrome. The pain of pericarditis is typically worse when lying flat and relieved by leaning forward. Examination may show a pericardial friction rub. Pulmonary embolism can cause pleural inflammation with chest pain. However, such cases are typically due to large emboli and are associated with significant hypoxia and shortness of breath. Pneumonia usually presents with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. None of these conditions would be associated with focal tenderness of the chest wall.\n\n(Choice B) Aortic dissection causes sudden, tearing chest pain radiating to the back and blood pressure disparity between the arms. This patient's episodic pain makes this less likely. Blood pressure will normally vary mildly between arms; a difference in systolic or diastolic blood pressure <10 mm Hg is not considered significant.\n\n(Choices D and E) Gastroesophageal reflux disease typically causes postprandial or nocturnal burning pain in the upper abdomen and chest. Esophageal spasm can cause chest pain with meals or swallowing.\n\n(Choice F) Panic disorder is usually a diagnosis of exclusion and can present with episodic chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Patients usually have intense fear/anxiety, and chest wall tenderness is not seen.\n\n(Choice H) Pulmonary arterial hypertension usually presents with exertional dyspnea, lethargy, and fatigue. Other symptoms, such as exertional chest pain, syncope, and peripheral edema, are generally seen in advanced disease.\n\n(Choice J) Unstable angina is characterized by exertional chest pressure, often radiating to the arm or jaw. Local chest tenderness does not rule out a cardiac cause of chest pain but is unusual.\n\nEducational objective:\nCostosternal syndrome (costochondritis) usually occurs after repetitive activity and is characterized by pain that is reproducible with palpation and worsened with movement or changes in position.",
    "zh": "该患者的胸痛最可能由于累及区域胸壁的肋骨胸骨综合征（也称为肋软骨炎或前胸壁综合征）引起。它通常发生在重复活动后，涉及肋软骨或肋骨胸骨交界处的上肋软骨。疼痛通常可在触诊时复现，并在活动或体位改变时加重（例如，水平手臂屈曲）。患者通常没有可触及的温暖、肿胀或红斑。\n\n(选项 A, G, 和 I) 导致胸膜或心包发炎的疾病可引起吸气时加重的剧烈疼痛。心包炎常继发于上呼吸道病毒综合征。心包炎的疼痛通常在平躺时加重，向前倾斜时缓解。体格检查可能会显示心包摩擦音。肺栓塞可引起胸膜炎症，伴有胸痛。然而，此类病例通常由大栓子引起，并伴有明显的低氧血症和呼吸急促。肺炎通常表现为发烧、咳嗽和呼吸急促。这些情况均与胸壁局灶性压痛无关。\n\n(选项 B) 主动脉夹层引起突发性撕裂样胸痛，放射至背部，并且两臂之间的血压差异。该患者的阵发性疼痛使得这种情况不太可能发生。血压通常在两臂之间轻微变化；收缩压或舒张压的差异<10 mmHg不被认为是显著的。\n\n(选项 D 和 E) 胃食管反流病通常会导致餐后或夜间上腹部和胸部灼痛。食管痉挛可引起进食或吞咽时的胸痛。\n\n(选项 F) 惊恐障碍通常是一种排除性诊断，可表现为阵发性胸痛、呼吸急促和心悸。患者通常有强烈的恐惧/焦虑感，并且未见胸壁压痛。\n\n(选项 H) 肺动脉高压通常表现为劳力性呼吸困难、嗜睡和疲劳。其他症状，如劳力性胸痛、晕厥和周围水肿，通常见于晚期疾病。\n\n(选项 J) 不稳定型心绞痛的特征是劳力性胸闷，常放射至手臂或下颌。局部胸部压痛并不能排除心脏病引起的胸痛，但并不常见。\n\n教育目标：\n肋骨胸骨综合征（肋软骨炎）通常发生在重复活动后，其特征是触诊时可复现的疼痛，并在活动或体位改变时加重。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of costochondritis (costosternal syndrome), its typical presentation, and differentiating it from other causes of chest pain. It requires understanding the clinical features that distinguish musculoskeletal chest pain from cardiac, pulmonary, or gastrointestinal etiologies.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the patient's history of recent activity, the nature of the pain (reproduced with palpation and movement), and the absence of systemic symptoms. Rule out other causes of chest pain based on their characteristic presentations.",
