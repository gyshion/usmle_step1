    "en": "In the experiment described above, the poly-A tail on mature mRNA is most likely to bind the latex beads because the adenine residues in this tail would form complementary base pairs with the repeated deoxythymidine residues fixed to the beads. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nMature mRNA refers to mRNA that has been processed and is ready for nuclear export and translation into protein. mRNA processing (post-transcriptional modification) involves the following steps:\n\n1. 5' capping: A 7-methyl-guanosine cap is added to the 5' end of the mRNA.\n\n2. Polyadenylation: A poly-A tail (chain of adenine residues) is added to most eukaryotic mRNA molecules by poly-A polymerase. Poly-A tails are not transcribed from the DNA template. Instead, a consensus sequence (AAUAAA) located near the 3' end of the RNA molecule directs the addition of the poly-A tail. This tail protects the mRNA from degradation within the cytoplasm after it exits the nucleus.\n\n3. Splicing: The initial mRNA transcript (pre-mRNA) contains sequences from coding and noncoding regions of DNA, known as exons and introns, respectively. Spliceosomes (complexes of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins [snRNPs] and other proteins) remove introns containing GU at the 5' splice site and AG at the 3' splice site (Choice E).\n\n(Choice A) Aminoacyl-tRNA is tRNA charged with its amino acid. The cloverleaf structure of tRNA consists of a 3' CCA tail (amino acid binding site); a T loop abundant in ribothymidine, pseudouridine, and cytidine residues; a D loop rich in dihydrouridine residues; and an anticodon loop.\n\n(Choice C) DNA promoter regions help initiate transcription by binding transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. Promoter regions contain consensus sequences that are typically AT-rich (eg, TATA and CAAT boxes) or GC-rich (eg, GC box).\n\n(Choice D) Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a component of the ribosome that catalyzes peptide bond formation during translation.\n\n(Choice F) Telomeres are located at the ends of chromosomes and contain TTAGGG repeats, which are added by the enzyme telomerase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase). Critical shortening in telomere length is thought to signal programmed cell death.\n\nEducational objective: The poly-A tail is not transcribed from DNA; instead, it is added as a post-transcriptional modification downstream of the consensus sequence (AAUAAA) located near the 3' end of the mRNA molecule. This tail protects mRNA from degradation within the cytoplasm after it exits the nucleus.",
    "zh": "在上述实验中，成熟mRNA上的poly-A尾巴最有可能与乳胶珠结合，因为该尾巴中的腺嘌呤残基将与固定在珠上的重复脱氧胸苷残基形成互补碱基对。 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n成熟mRNA指的是已经经过加工并准备好进行核输出和翻译成蛋白质的mRNA。mRNA加工（转录后修饰）涉及以下步骤：\n\n1. 5'加帽：一个7-甲基鸟苷帽添加到mRNA的5'端。\n\n2. 多腺苷酸化：通过poly-A聚合酶将poly-A尾（腺嘌呤残基链）添加到大多数真核mRNA分子中。Poly-A尾不是从DNA模板转录而来。相反，位于RNA分子3'端附近的共有序列（AAUAAA）指导poly-A尾的添加。该尾巴保护mRNA在离开细胞核后免受细胞质内的降解。\n\n3. 剪接：最初的mRNA转录本（前mRNA）包含来自DNA编码区和非编码区的序列，分别称为外显子和内含子。剪接体（由小核核糖核蛋白[snRNPs]和其他蛋白质组成的复合物）去除在5'剪接位点含有GU和在3'剪接位点含有AG的内含子（选项E）。\n\n（选项A）氨酰-tRNA是携带其氨基酸的tRNA。tRNA的三叶草结构由3'CCA尾（氨基酸结合位点）组成；一个富含核糖胸苷、假尿苷和胞苷残基的T环；一个富含二氢尿苷残基的D环；和一个反密码子环。\n\n（选项C）DNA启动子区域通过结合转录因子和RNA聚合酶II来帮助启动转录。启动子区域包含通常富含AT（例如，TATA和CAAT盒子）或富含GC（例如，GC盒子）的共有序列。\n\n（选项D）核糖体RNA (rRNA) 是核糖体的一个组成部分，在翻译过程中催化肽键的形成。\n\n（选项F）端粒位于染色体的末端，包含TTAGGG重复序列，这些序列由端粒酶（RNA依赖性DNA聚合酶）添加。端粒长度的严重缩短被认为是程序性细胞死亡的信号。\n\n教育目标：poly-A尾不是从DNA转录而来的；相反，它是在位于mRNA分子3'端附近的共有序列（AAUAAA）下游作为转录后修饰添加的。该尾巴保护mRNA在离开细胞核后免受细胞质内的降解。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of mRNA processing, specifically the function and composition of the poly-A tail and its ability to bind to complementary sequences. It also tests understanding of the structure and function of other types of nucleic acids.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the repeated deoxythymidine residues on the latex beads will bind most strongly to a nucleic acid with a complementary sequence. The poly-A tail of mature mRNA, which consists of adenine residues, is the most likely candidate for strong binding.",
    "zh": "本题考察对mRNA加工的知识，特别是poly-A尾的功能和组成及其与互补序列结合的能力。 同时也考察对其他类型核酸的结构和功能的理解。\n\n解决这个问题的关键是认识到乳胶珠上的重复脱氧胸苷残基将与具有互补序列的核酸结合最强。 成熟mRNA的poly-A尾由腺嘌呤残基组成，是最有可能发生强结合的候选者。"
