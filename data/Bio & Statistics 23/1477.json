    "en": "An 18-year-old man comes to the urgent care clinic due to painful erythema affecting his extremities, trunk, and face. He is vacationing in Florida and spent 5 hours at a Gulf coast beach earlier in the day. The patient did not apply any sunscreen as it was cloudy. The physician explains that cloud cover does not afford a high degree of protection against the sun, especially with prolonged exposure in highly reflective environments like the beach. He is advised to wear protective clothing and apply sunscreen to prevent recurrence.",
    "zh": "一名18岁男性因影响四肢、躯干和面部的疼痛性红斑来急诊就诊。他正在佛罗里达州度假，当天早些时候在墨西哥湾沿岸海滩待了5个小时。由于阴天，患者没有涂抹任何防晒霜。医生解释说，云层并不能提供高度的防晒保护，尤其是在海滩等高反射环境中长时间暴露的情况下。建议他穿防护服并涂抹防晒霜以防止复发。"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Ultraviolet rays damage DNA primarily through formation of abnormal covalent bonds between adjacent thymine or cytosine residues (PYRIMIDINE DIMERS). The presence of pyrimidine dimers interferes with base recognition during transcription and replication, and DNA MUTATIONS can result if the damage is not repaired.\n\nPyrimidine dimers are removed by NUCLEOTIDE EXCISION REPAIR. In this process, a specific endonuclease complex detects abnormalities in the DNA structure caused by the formation of DNA photoproducts. The ENDONUCLEASE complex then NICKS the damaged strand on both sides of the pyrimidine dimer, and the defective region is excised. DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA in the place of the damaged DNA, and DNA ligase seals the remaining nick.",
    "zh": "紫外线主要通过相邻胸腺嘧啶或胞嘧啶残基之间异常共价键的形成来损伤DNA（嘧啶二聚体）。嘧啶二聚体的存在干扰转录和复制过程中的碱基识别，如果损伤未修复，则可能导致DNA突变。\n\n嘧啶二聚体通过核苷酸切除修复(NUCLEOTIDE EXCISION REPAIR)被移除。在这个过程中，一个特定的内切酶复合物检测由DNA光产物形成引起的DNA结构异常。然后，内切酶复合物在嘧啶二聚体的两侧对受损链进行切口，并切除缺陷区域。DNA聚合酶在受损DNA的位置合成新的DNA，并且DNA连接酶封闭剩余的切口。"
