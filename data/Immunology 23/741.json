    "en": "This patient's symptoms and biopsy findings are suggestive of acute serum sickness, a condition caused by tissue deposition of circulating immune complexes (type III hypersensitivity). The most common manifestations include fever, pruritic skin rash, and arthralgias that begin 7-14 days after exposure to an antigen. Lymphadenopathy and proteinuria may also occur in some patients. Histologic examination of affected tissues typically shows small vessel vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis and intense neutrophil infiltration. Deposition of IgG and/or IgM complement-fixing antibodies results in localized complement consumption and hypocomplementemia (decreased serum C3 levels).\n\nSerum sickness can occur following administration of antigenic heterologous proteins such as chimeric monoclonal antibodies (eg, rituximab and infliximab) or nonhuman immunoglobulins (eg, venom antitoxins). A serum sickness-like reaction is also associated with the use of certain nonprotein drugs (eg, penicillin, cefaclor, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole).\n\n(Choice A) Anergy to cutaneously applied Candida antigens would be indicative of depressed cell-mediated immunity. Cell-mediated immunity is involved in the pathogenesis of type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity.\n\n(Choice C) Increased serum IgE levels are typically found in atopic individuals prone to IgE-mediated (type I) hypersensitivity reactions. Type I reactions cause vasodilation and tissue edema and inflammatory infiltration; they do not cause vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis.\n\n(Choice D) Deposition of IgA-containing immune complexes is involved in the pathogenesis of Henoch-Schönlein purpura in pediatric patients. IgA does not play an important role in type III hypersensitivity.\n\n(Choice E) Serum sickness causes release of the C5a complement fragment (a neutrophil chemoattractant) at sites of immune complex deposition. This leads to neutropenia (not neutrophilia) due to extensive neutrophilic marginalization and tissue infiltration. In addition, infliximab and other TNF-alpha inhibitors can also cause neutropenia.\n\n(Choice F) Mild thrombocytopenia has been associated with serum sickness due to platelet consumption at the site of active vascular inflammation. However, severe thrombocytopenia is unlikely to occur.\n\nEducational objective:\nSerum sickness is a type III hypersensitivity reaction to nonhuman proteins characterized by vasculitis resulting from tissue deposition of circulating immune complexes. Clinical findings include fever, pruritic skin rash, arthralgias, and low serum C3 and C4 complement levels.",
    "zh": "该患者的症状和活检结果提示急性血清病，这是一种由循环免疫复合物（III 型超敏反应）在组织中沉积引起的疾病。最常见的表现包括发热、瘙痒性皮疹和关节痛，这些症状在接触抗原后 7-14 天开始出现。某些患者也可能出现淋巴结病和蛋白尿。受累组织的组织学检查通常显示小血管炎，伴有纤维蛋白样坏死和强烈的中性粒细胞浸润。IgG 和/或 IgM 补体结合抗体的沉积导致局部补体消耗和低补体血症（血清 C3 水平降低）。\n\n血清病可发生在给予抗原性异源蛋白后，例如嵌合单克隆抗体（如利妥昔单抗和英夫利昔单抗）或非人免疫球蛋白（如蛇毒抗毒素）。某些非蛋白药物（如青霉素、头孢克罗和复方磺胺甲恶唑）的使用也与血清病样反应相关。\n\n（选项 A）对皮肤应用的白色念珠菌抗原无反应表明细胞介导的免疫力低下。细胞介导的免疫力参与 IV 型（迟发型）超敏反应的发病机制。\n\n（选项 C）血清 IgE 水平升高通常见于易患 IgE 介导（I 型）超敏反应的特应性个体。I 型反应引起血管舒张、组织水肿和炎性浸润；它们不会引起伴有纤维蛋白样坏死的血管炎。\n\n（选项 D）含 IgA 的免疫复合物的沉积参与儿童 Henoch-Schönlein 紫癜的发病机制。IgA 在 III 型超敏反应中不起重要作用。\n\n（选项 E）血清病导致 C5a 补体片段（一种中性粒细胞趋化因子）在免疫复合物沉积部位释放。这会导致中性粒细胞减少症（而不是中性粒细胞增多症），原因是中性粒细胞广泛边缘化和组织浸润。此外，英夫利昔单抗和其他 TNF-α 抑制剂也可能导致中性粒细胞减少症。\n\n（选项 F）轻度血小板减少症与血清病有关，原因是血小板在活动性血管炎症部位被消耗。然而，不太可能发生严重的血小板减少症。\n\n教学目标：\n血清病是对非人类蛋白的 III 型超敏反应，其特征是血管炎，由循环免疫复合物的组织沉积引起。临床表现包括发热、瘙痒性皮疹、关节痛以及血清 C3 和 C4 补体水平降低。"

Specifically, it assesses the understanding of complement consumption leading to decreased C3 levels.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of serum sickness following infliximab administration.
