    "en": "The fragmented erythrocytes shown on the slide above are called schistocytes or helmet cells. They are formed by mechanical trauma to erythrocytes as they circulate through the vasculature. This patient's schistocytes are most likely due to erythrocyte damage caused by his aortic valve prosthesis. Artificial (mechanical) valves are more traumatic for RBCs than porcine prostheses and frequently cause hemolysis. Schistocytes can also be formed from narrowing of the microvascular spaces, as seen in disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\nHemolytic anemia due to intravascular erythrocyte destruction results in laboratory findings similar to those in other types of hemolytic anemias, including an increase in serum indirect bilirubin. Intravascular erythrocyte damage also results in free hemoglobin in serum (hemoglobinemia) and urine (hemoglobinuria) as well as increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Haptoglobin is a serum protein that binds to free hemoglobin and promotes its uptake by the reticuloendothelial system. Haptoglobin levels decrease when significant quantities of hemoglobin are released into the circulation, as occurs with intravascular hemolysis.\n\n(Choice A) Increased serum iron occurs in hemochromatosis most classically, but increased serum iron can also be iatrogenic. Hemochromatosis does not cause anemia, but it is associated with cirrhosis and increased incidence of hepatocellular cancer. Hemolysis does not usually have a significant effect on serum iron because the iron released from lysed RBCs remains bound to hemoglobin.\n\n(Choice C) Increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) occurs in megaloblastic anemia (eg, folate/vitamin B12 deficiency) due to the presence of enlarged ovoid erythrocytes. Increased MCV may also occur with other forms of anemia due to a reactive increase in reticulocytes (large, immature RBCs); however, anemia caused by mechanical erythrocyte trauma usually results in decreased MCV due to the presence of small RBC fragments (schistocytes).\n\n(Choice D) A decreased reticulocyte count in the presence of anemia is characteristic of aplastic anemia. In hemolytic anemias, the reticulocyte count is increased to compensate for the increased destruction of RBCs.\n\n(Choice E) A decreased serum albumin level is associated with cirrhosis (decreased production), nephrotic syndrome (urinary loss), and protein-wasting enteropathy (bowel loss).\n\nEducational objective:\nSchistocytes (helmet cells) are fragmented erythrocytes. They occur secondary to mechanical trauma from microangiopathic hemolytic anemias or prosthetic cardiac valves (macroangiopathic). Intravascular hemolytic anemias are characterized by decreased serum haptoglobin levels as well as increased LDH and bilirubin. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "幻灯片上显示的红细胞碎片被称为裂细胞或盔形细胞。它们是由红细胞在血管系统中循环时受到机械损伤而形成的。该患者的裂细胞最可能是由于其主动脉瓣假体导致红细胞损伤所致。人工（机械）瓣膜对红细胞的损伤比猪瓣膜更大，并且经常引起溶血。裂细胞也可能由微血管空间狭窄形成，如弥漫性血管内凝血、溶血性尿毒症综合征和血栓性血小板减少性紫癜。\n\n由于血管内红细胞破坏引起的溶血性贫血会导致类似于其他类型溶血性贫血的实验室检查结果，包括血清间接胆红素的增加。血管内红细胞损伤也会导致血清（血红蛋白血症）和尿液（血红蛋白尿）中出现游离血红蛋白，以及血清乳酸脱氢酶 (LDH) 的升高。结合珠蛋白是一种与游离血红蛋白结合并促进其被网状内皮系统摄取的血清蛋白。当大量血红蛋白释放到循环中时，结合珠蛋白水平会降低，这种情况发生在血管内溶血时。\n\n（选项 A）血清铁水平升高最常见于血色素沉着症，但血清铁水平升高也可能是医源性的。血色素沉着症不会引起贫血，但与肝硬化和肝细胞癌发病率增加有关。溶血通常对血清铁没有显著影响，因为从裂解的红细胞中释放的铁仍然与血红蛋白结合。\n\n（选项 C）平均红细胞体积 (MCV) 增大发生于巨幼细胞性贫血（例如，叶酸/维生素 B12 缺乏症），这是由于存在增大的卵圆形红细胞。MCV 增大也可能发生在其他形式的贫血中，这是由于网织红细胞（大的、未成熟的红细胞）的反应性增加所致；然而，由机械性红细胞损伤引起的贫血通常会导致 MCV 降低，这是由于存在小的红细胞碎片（裂细胞）所致。\n\n（选项 D）在存在贫血的情况下，网织红细胞计数降低是再生障碍性贫血的特征。在溶血性贫血中，网织红细胞计数增加以补偿红细胞破坏的增加。\n\n（选项 E）血清白蛋白水平降低与肝硬化（产生减少）、肾病综合征（尿液丢失）和蛋白丢失性肠病（肠道丢失）有关。\n\n教学目标：\n裂细胞（盔形细胞）是红细胞碎片。它们继发于微血管病性溶血性贫血或人工心脏瓣膜（大血管病变）引起的机械损伤。血管内溶血性贫血的特征是血清结合珠蛋白水平降低以及 LDH 和胆红素升高。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of mechanical hemolytic anemia caused by a prosthetic heart valve and its associated laboratory findings. Specifically, it assesses the understanding of how intravascular hemolysis leads to decreased haptoglobin levels due to the binding and clearance of free hemoglobin.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear, indicating mechanical damage to red blood cells. Connect this finding to the patient's history of aortic valve replacement and understand that prosthetic valves can cause hemolysis. Recall that intravascular hemolysis leads to decreased haptoglobin levels.",
