    "en": "A new biomarker has been identified that allows for the early detection of invasive gastric carcinoma. It has a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 85% when compared to endoscopy with multiple biopsies. The test is used in 2 groups: a population in the United States, where 5 out of 100,000 people have gastric cancer, and a population in China, where 100 out of 100,000 people have been diagnosed with the disease. Which of the following is the most accurate statement concerning this new test?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE (PPV) is defined as the proportion of individuals with positive test results who actually have the disease. PPV depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of a test, but also on the PREVALENCE of the disease in the population being tested. The more common the disease in the population, the more likely it is that a patient with a positive test result actually has the disease. If the disease is relatively common (eg, gastric cancer in China), there is a higher probability that a patient who tests positive actually has the disease (ie, more likely to be a true positive). However, if the disease is relatively uncommon (eg, gastric cancer in the United States), a patient who tests positive will have a lower probability of actually having the disease (ie, more likely to be a false positive).",
    "zh": "阳性预测值 (PPV) 定义为检测结果呈阳性且实际患有该疾病的个体的比例。PPV 不仅取决于检测的敏感性和特异性，还取决于被检测人群中疾病的患病率。一种疾病在人群中越常见，检测结果呈阳性的患者实际患有该疾病的可能性就越大。如果该疾病相对常见（例如，中国的胃癌），那么检测结果呈阳性的患者实际患有该疾病的可能性就越高（即，更有可能为真阳性）。但是，如果该疾病相对不常见（例如，美国的胃癌），检测结果呈阳性的患者实际患有该疾病的可能性就越低（即，更有可能为假阳性）。"

    "en": "1) Positive and negative predictive values depend on disease prevalence in the tested population. The sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test are not affected by disease prevalence. 2) Remember that PPV depends on the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested.",
    "zh": "1) 阳性和阴性预测值取决于被检测人群中疾病的患病率。诊断测试的敏感性和特异性不受疾病患病率的影响。2) 记住 PPV 取决于被检测人群中疾病的患病率。"
