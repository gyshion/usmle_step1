    "en": "A 54-year-old man comes to the emergency department after an episode of bloody vomiting. He has had no fever, chills, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse with multiple previous hospital admissions due to alcohol withdrawal and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. He also has a history of intravenous drug abuse and is currently enrolled in a methadone maintenance program. Blood pressure is 96/62 mm Hg and pulse is 102/min. On examination, the patient appears comfortable but develops dizziness when asked to sit up. There is no jugular venous distension. The abdomen is distended with dullness to percussion at both flanks. The liver is enlarged on palpation, and the tip of the spleen is also palpable. There is trace pedal edema. Laboratory studies show:\n\nHemoglobin 9.7 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 98 fL\nLeukocytes 5,000/mm³\nPlatelets 78,000/mm³",

    "en": "This patient with a history of significant alcohol and intravenous drug abuse has evidence of ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE (ALD). His hematemesis, orthostatic symptoms, and normocytic anemia are likely due to acute bleeding from esophageal varices. Although chronic gastrointestinal blood loss can cause microcytic anemia due to depletion of iron stores and reduced hemoglobin synthesis, acute hemorrhage (as in this patient) is usually associated with normal mean corpuscular volume. ALD also causes thrombocytopenia due to decreased platelet production, increased destruction, and splenic sequestration.\n\nFibrosis and distortion of intrahepatic vasculature in ALD obstructs blood flow through the liver, leading to PORTAL HYPERTENSION. Because the splenic vein is part of the portal circulation, any condition that causes portal hypertension can lead to SPLENOMEGALY with congestive hypersplenism. Venous congestion causes apparent EXPANSION OF THE RED PULP of the spleen, which is composed of blood-filled sinuses and cords lined by reticuloendothelial-type cells.\n\n(Choice A) Extramedullary hematopoiesis results when hematopoietic precursor cells are displaced from the bone marrow and infiltrate the liver and spleen preferentially, resulting in splenomegaly. A common condition in which this occurs is myelofibrosis.\n\n(Choices B and D) Histiocytic proliferation can cause splenomegaly in the setting of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (formerly known as histiocytosis X), but this is a rare disease with highest incidence in childhood. Metastatic tumors (eg, lung, breast, colorectal cancer) can infiltrate the spleen and lead to hypersplenism, but this patient has no history of malignancy. Given this patient's substance abuse history, ALD is much more likely.\n\n(Choice C) Lymphoid follicle expansion can cause hypersplenism in the setting of systemic infections (eg, infectious mononucleosis) or as a result of immunologic diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis [Felty syndrome]).",
    "zh": "该患者有明显的酒精和静脉注射毒品滥用病史，有酒精性肝病（ALD）的证据。他的呕血、直立性症状和正细胞性贫血很可能是由于食管静脉曲张急性出血所致。尽管慢性胃肠道失血可因铁储备耗竭和血红蛋白合成减少而引起小细胞性贫血，但急性出血（如该患者）通常与正常的平均红细胞体积相关。ALD还可导致血小板减少症，原因是血小板生成减少、破坏增加和脾脏滞留。\n\nALD 中肝内血管纤维化和扭曲会阻碍血液流经肝脏，导致门静脉高压。由于脾静脉是门静脉循环的一部分，任何导致门静脉高压的情况都可能导致脾肿大并伴有充血性脾功能亢进。静脉充血导致脾脏红髓明显扩张，红髓由充满血液的窦和被网状内皮细胞覆盖的索组成。\n\n（选项 A）髓外造血是指造血祖细胞从骨髓中移位并优先浸润肝脏和脾脏，导致脾肿大。发生这种情况的常见疾病是骨髓纤维化。\n\n（选项 B 和 D）组织细胞增生可导致朗格汉斯细胞组织细胞增生症（以前称为组织细胞增生症 X）时出现脾肿大，但这是一种罕见疾病，在儿童中的发病率最高。转移瘤（如肺癌、乳腺癌、结直肠癌）可浸润脾脏并导致脾功能亢进，但该患者无恶性肿瘤病史。考虑到该患者的药物滥用史，ALD 更为可能。\n\n（选项 C）淋巴滤泡扩张可导致全身性感染（如传染性单核细胞增多症）或免疫性疾病（如系统性红斑狼疮、类风湿关节炎[Felty 综合征]）导致脾功能亢进。"
