  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The middle ear cavity contains 3 auditory ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes) and 2 skeletal muscles (tensor tympani and stapedius) that participate in the transmission of sound from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea. The stapedius muscle arises from the wall of the tympanic cavity and inserts on the neck of the stapes. It is innervated by the stapedius nerve, a branch of the facial nerve (CN VII). The stapedius muscle functions to stabilize the stapes; paralysis of the muscle (secondary to an injury or lesion to the facial nerve) causes the stapes to oscillate more widely, producing hyperacusis. Patients will typically complain of increased sensitivity to everyday sounds (eg, shutting doors, ringing phones, traffic) and will often withdraw socially as a result. Treatment consists of retraining (or sound) therapy using broadband noise (eg, \"white noise\").\n\nThe tensor tympani muscle arises from the cartilaginous portion of the auditory tube and the adjoining part of the sphenoid bone and inserts into the malleus. It functions to contract the tympanic membrane medially, thereby increasing its tension and dampening sound transmission. It is innervated by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3).\n\nIpsilateral hyperacusis is a common finding associated with Bell's palsy (unilateral/peripheral facial paralysis).\n\n(Choices A, C, D, and E) The accessory (CN XI), glossopharyngeal (CN IX), hypoglossal (CN XII), and vagus (CN X) nerves are not associated with hyperacusis.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe stapedius muscle is innervated by the stapedius nerve (a branch of the facial nerve). Paralysis of the stapedius muscle results in hyperacusis (eg, increased sensitivity to sound). {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "中耳腔包含3个听小骨（锤骨、砧骨和镫骨）和2块骨骼肌（鼓膜张肌和镫骨肌），它们参与声音从鼓膜向耳蜗的传导。镫骨肌起自鼓室壁，止于镫骨颈。它由镫骨神经支配，镫骨神经是面神经（CN VII）的一个分支。镫骨肌的功能是稳定镫骨；肌肉麻痹（继发于面神经的损伤或病变）导致镫骨振动幅度更大，从而产生听觉过敏。患者通常会抱怨对日常声音（例如，关门声、电话铃声、交通噪音）的敏感度增加，并因此经常回避社交。治疗包括使用宽带噪声（例如，“白噪声”）进行再训练（或声音）疗法。\n\n鼓膜张肌起自听管的软骨部分和蝶骨的相邻部分，并插入锤骨。它的功能是使鼓膜向内收缩，从而增加其张力并减弱声音的传递。它由三叉神经的下颌分支（CN V3）支配。\n\n同侧听觉过敏是与贝尔麻痹（单侧/周围性面瘫）相关的常见发现。\n\n（选项 A、C、D 和 E）副神经（CN XI）、舌咽神经（CN IX）、舌下神经（CN XII）和迷走神经（CN X）与听觉过敏无关。\n\n教育目标：\n镫骨肌由镫骨神经（面神经的一个分支）支配。镫骨肌麻痹会导致听觉过敏（例如，对声音的敏感度增加）。{{exhibit_1}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the facial nerve's role in innervating the stapedius muscle and the resulting hyperacusis when the nerve is damaged. It also requires understanding of middle ear anatomy and the function of the stapedius muscle.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that hyperacusis (increased sensitivity to sound) is caused by paralysis of the stapedius muscle, which is innervated by the facial nerve. Therefore, injury to the facial nerve is the most likely cause.",
    "zh": "本题考察了对面神经在支配镫骨肌中的作用以及当神经受损时导致的听觉过敏的知识。它还要求理解中耳解剖结构和镫骨肌的功能。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要认识到听觉过敏（对声音的敏感度增加）是由镫骨肌麻痹引起的，而镫骨肌受面神经支配。因此，面神经损伤是最可能的原因。"
