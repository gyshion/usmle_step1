    "en": "Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is a protein released from the alpha granules of platelets that plays a role in platelet aggregation. It also binds heparin and helps inactivate the molecule. The mechanism of HITT involves the generation of IgG antibodies to these complexes of heparin and PF4. The Fc component of the activated IgG antibodies then binds to additional platelets, resulting in further PF4 release and widespread platelet activation. This leads to a prothrombotic state that places patients at high risk for both arterial and venous thrombosis.\n\n(Choice A) Acquired protein C deficiency occurs early in the course of warfarin therapy, as the inhibition of protein C by warfarin occurs more rapidly than the inhibition of other factors (ie, factors II, VII, IX, X). If not bridged with heparin when starting therapy, patients may develop warfarin-induced skin necrosis due to localized cutaneous thrombus formation.\n\n(Choice C) Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) results from splenic destruction of platelets labeled by IgG antibodies to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors. ITP often causes very low platelet levels and is associated with bleeding complications rather than thrombosis.\n\n(Choice D) Cryoglobulinemia can occur in the setting of autoimmune disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus) or viral infection (eg, hepatitis C) and causes systemic vasculitis characterized by fatigue, arthralgia, and purpuric rash. Marked thrombocytopenia is not typical.\n\n(Choice E) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) results from decreased levels of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13. The classic presentation of TTP is the pentad of fever, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal insufficiency, and neurologic dysfunction.",
    "zh": "血小板因子4 (PF4) 是一种从血小板 α 颗粒释放的蛋白质，在血小板聚集过程中发挥作用。它也与肝素结合并有助于灭活该分子。HITT 的机制涉及产生针对肝素和 PF4 复合物的 IgG 抗体。活化 IgG 抗体的 Fc 部分随后与额外的血小板结合，导致进一步的 PF4 释放和广泛的血小板活化。这会导致血栓形成状态，使患者面临动脉和静脉血栓形成的高风险。\n\n(选项A) 获得性蛋白C缺乏症发生在华法林治疗的早期，因为华法林对蛋白C的抑制比对其他因子（即因子II、VII、IX、X）的抑制发生得更快。如果在开始治疗时没有用肝素进行桥接，患者可能会因局部皮肤血栓形成而发生华法林引起的皮肤坏死。\n\n(选项C) 特发性血小板减少性紫癜 (ITP) 是由于脾脏破坏了被针对糖蛋白 IIb/IIIa 受体的 IgG 抗体标记的血小板。ITP 常常导致血小板水平非常低，并且与出血并发症相关，而不是血栓形成。\n\n(选项D) 冷球蛋白血症可发生在自身免疫性疾病（例如，系统性红斑狼疮）或病毒感染（例如，丙型肝炎）的背景下，并引起以疲劳、关节痛和紫癜性皮疹为特征的全身性血管炎。明显的血小板减少症并不典型。\n\n(选项E) 血栓性血小板减少性紫癜 (TTP) 是由于 von Willebrand 因子切割蛋白酶 ADAMTS13 的水平降低所致。TTP 的典型表现是五联征：发热、血小板减少症、微血管病性溶血性贫血、肾功能不全和神经功能障碍。"

    "en": "The patient likely has heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT), also known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type 2. HITT typically occurs 5-10 days following exposure to heparin products and is characterized by a large drop in platelet count.
