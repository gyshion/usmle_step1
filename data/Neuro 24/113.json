    "en": "Cryptococcus neoformans is a low-virulence yeast with a thick polysaccharide capsule. The organism resides in soil contaminated by bird (eg, pigeon) droppings, and human exposure primarily occurs due to inhalation into the lungs. Alveolar macrophages ingest the yeast, travel to draining lymph nodes, and activate CD4 T-lymphocytes that subsequently promote granuloma formation and enhanced destruction of the pathogen within phagolysosomes. Although a minority of patients clear the organism, most individuals develop life-long latent infection, similar to tuberculosis: those who are severely immunocompromised (eg, AIDS with CD4 count <100/mm3) are at high risk for reactivation.\n\nCryptococcal meningitis primarily occurs when C neoformans reactivates from a latent pulmonary focus, spreads through the circulation, and penetrates the endothelial cells of the cerebral capillaries. Replication within the CNS leads to slowly worsening headache, fever, and confusion. Visualization of the organism (ie, round/oval yeast with a thick capsule) on cerebrospinal fluid samples using India ink stain confirms the diagnosis. Polysaccharide antigen (cryptococcal antigen) testing can also be helpful.\n\n(Choice A) Ingestion of C neoformans in contaminated food can lead to infection. However, this route is much less common than inhalation into the lungs.\n\n(Choice C) Acute bacterial meningitis is caused primarily by pathogens (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae) that colonize the nasopharynx. Manifestations of acute bacterial meningitis usually include the rapid onset fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental state. Cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain will be positive.\n\n(Choice D) Patients who have untreated AIDS often develop multiple opportunistic infections; the white patches on this patient's oral mucosa likely indicate oropharyngeal candidiasis. Superficial Candida infections rarely cause invasive disease. In addition, Candida does not have a thick polysaccharide capsule and is not seen on India ink stain.\n\n(Choice E) Skin bacteria (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes) can cause systemic infection following skin breakdown. Systemic infection from skin fungus (eg, Candida) following skin breakdown is uncommon. This patient's encapsulated yeast on India ink stain indicates Cryptococcus, making inhalation the most likely route of infection.",
    "zh": "新型隐球菌是一种低毒力酵母，具有厚多糖荚膜。这种病原体存在于被鸟类（如鸽子）粪便污染的土壤中，人类接触主要通过吸入进入肺部。肺泡巨噬细胞吞噬酵母，到达引流淋巴结，并激活CD4 T淋巴细胞，随后促进肉芽肿形成，增强病原体在吞噬溶酶体内的破坏。尽管少数患者可以清除病原体，但大多数人会发展为终生潜伏感染，类似于结核病：那些严重免疫功能低下（例如，艾滋病患者，CD4计数<100/mm3）的人群具有高复发风险。\n\n隐球菌性脑膜炎主要发生在新型隐球菌从潜伏肺部病灶复活，通过血液循环扩散，并穿透脑毛细血管的内皮细胞时。在中枢神经系统内复制会导致头痛、发热和意识模糊缓慢恶化。使用墨汁染色法在脑脊液样本中观察到该病原体（即，圆形/卵圆形酵母，具有厚荚膜）证实了诊断。多糖抗原（隐球菌抗原）检测也可能有所帮助。\n\n(选项A) 食用受污染的食物中的新型隐球菌可导致感染。然而，这种途径远不如吸入肺部常见。\n\n(选项C) 急性细菌性脑膜炎主要由定植于鼻咽的病原体（例如，肺炎链球菌、脑膜炎奈瑟菌、流感嗜血杆菌）引起。急性细菌性脑膜炎的临床表现通常包括快速发热、颈部僵硬和精神状态改变。脑脊液革兰染色将呈阳性。\n\n(选项D) 未经治疗的艾滋病患者通常会发生多种机会性感染；该患者口腔黏膜上的白色斑块可能表明口咽念珠菌病。浅表性念珠菌感染很少引起侵袭性疾病。此外，念珠菌没有厚的多糖荚膜，并且在墨汁染色中看不到。\n\n(选项E) 皮肤细菌（例如，金黄色葡萄球菌、化脓性链球菌）可在皮肤破损后引起全身感染。皮肤真菌（例如，念珠菌）在皮肤破损后引起的全身感染并不常见。该患者的墨汁染色显示包膜酵母，提示隐球菌，因此吸入是最可能的感染途径。"
