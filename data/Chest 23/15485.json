    "en": "A 35-year-old man comes to the clinic for evaluation of exertional dyspnea and dry cough for 8 months. Oxygen saturation on room air while lying down is 96% and drops to 88% after 6 minutes of walking. Examination shows fine crackles in both lower lungs. Chest x-ray reveals reticular densities in both lung fields. Lung biopsy shows an infiltration of inflammatory cells, predominantly lymphocytes, as well as poorly formed noncaseating granulomas and moderate alveolar septal fibrosis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "en": "This patient with chronic dyspnea and cough accompanied by characteristic lung biopsy findings most likely has hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). HP is an exaggerated immunologic response to an inhaled antigen; common offending agents include mold, bacteria, animal protein, and chemicals. The condition has variable presentation that is largely dependent on the dose and chronicity of antigen exposure:\n\n*   Acute HP involves abrupt-onset and often recurring episodes of fever, chills, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue that coincide with intermittent high-dose antigen exposure. Leukocytosis is often present. Chest x-ray may be normal or show scattered micronodular opacification.\n*   Chronic HP involves persistent and gradually progressive symptoms (as in this patient) resulting from long-term, moderate-dose antigen exposure. Patients usually have symptoms of cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and weight loss for several months or more. Lung auscultation usually reveals fine crackles, and chest x-ray shows interstitial reticular opacities consistent with the development of pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nThe diagnosis of HP can be aided by pulmonary function testing that reveals a restrictive pattern; the restriction is worse with chronic HP and is accompanied by more severe impairments in gas exchange (eg, hypoxemia, low DLCO). Biopsy in both acute and chronic disease reveals lymphocytic infiltrate with poorly formed noncaseating granulomas created by the walling off of inhaled antigens. Chronic HP is associated with progressive alveolar septal fibrosis. Removal of antigen exposure usually resolves acute disease; however, the fibrosis occurring in chronic disease is often irreversible.\n\n(Choice A) Asthma presents with intermittent cough and dyspnea. Bronchiolar biopsy can reveal noncaseating granulomas, but fibrosis is not typical and eosinophilic infiltrate is expected.\n\n(Choice B) Chronic bronchitis presents with dyspnea and cough and is expected to cause wheezing on lung auscultation. Lymphocytic infiltrate may be present on biopsy, but granulomas are not typical.\n\n(Choice D) Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis can present quite similarly to chronic HP, but affected patients are usually older (eg, age >50) and granulomas are not expected on lung biopsy.\n\n(Choice E) Pulmonary tuberculosis typically presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, night sweats, and weight loss. Lung biopsy demonstrates lymphocytic infiltrate, but caseating (rather than noncaseating) granulomas.\n\nEducational objective:\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis involves an exaggerated immunologic response to an inhaled antigen and can have an acute or chronic presentation. Chronic disease presents with gradually progressive cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and weight loss, and lung biopsy reveals lymphocytic infiltrate, poorly formed noncaseating granulomas, and septal fibrosis.",
    "zh": "这位有慢性呼吸困难和咳嗽的患者，伴有特征性的肺活检结果，最有可能患有超敏性肺炎（HP）。HP是对吸入抗原的过度免疫反应；常见的致病原包括霉菌、细菌、动物蛋白和化学物质。这种情况的临床表现是可变的，这主要取决于抗原暴露的剂量和慢性程度：\n\n*   急性HP涉及突然发作且常反复发作的的发热、寒战、咳嗽、呼吸困难和疲劳，这些与间歇性高剂量抗原暴露同时发生。常出现白细胞增多。胸部X光片可能正常，或显示散在的微结节状不透光影。\n*   慢性HP涉及由长期、中等剂量的抗原暴露引起的持续且逐渐进展的症状（如本患者）。患者通常有咳嗽、呼吸困难、疲劳和体重减轻等症状，持续数月或更长时间。肺部听诊通常显示细湿啰音，胸部X光片显示间质性网状影，这与肺纤维化的发展相符。\n\n可以通过肺功能测试来辅助诊断HP，肺功能测试显示限制性通气模式；慢性HP的限制更严重，并伴有更严重的换气障碍（如低氧血症、低DLCO）。在急性和慢性疾病中，活检都显示淋巴细胞浸润，伴有由隔离吸入抗原产生的形成不良的非干酪性肉芽肿。慢性HP与进行性肺泡间隔纤维化有关。去除抗原暴露通常可解决急性疾病；然而，在慢性病中发生的纤维化通常是不可逆转的。\n\n（选项A）哮喘表现为间歇性咳嗽和呼吸困难。支气管活检可显示非干酪性肉芽肿，但纤维化不典型，预计出现嗜酸性粒细胞浸润。\n\n（选项B）慢性支气管炎表现为呼吸困难和咳嗽，预计会在肺部听诊时引起喘息。活检中可能存在淋巴细胞浸润，但肉芽肿不典型。\n\n（选项D）特发性肺纤维化可以与慢性HP非常相似地呈现，但受影响的患者通常年龄较大（例如，年龄>50岁），并且在肺活检中不应出现肉芽肿。\n\n（选项E）肺结核通常表现为发热、咳嗽、呼吸困难、盗汗和体重减轻。肺活检显示淋巴细胞浸润，但干酪性（而不是非干酪性）肉芽肿。\n\n教学目标：\n超敏性肺炎涉及对吸入抗原的过度免疫反应，并可有急性和慢性表现。慢性疾病表现为逐渐进展的咳嗽、呼吸困难、疲劳和体重减轻，肺活检显示淋巴细胞浸润，形成不良的非干酪性肉芽肿和间隔纤维化。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), including its etiology, clinical presentation (acute vs. chronic), diagnostic findings (imaging, biopsy), and management. It requires differentiating HP from other interstitial lung diseases based on clinical and pathological features.\n\nThe best approach is to carefully analyze the patient's history (chronic dyspnea, cough), physical exam (crackles), imaging (reticular densities), and biopsy findings (noncaseating granulomas, lymphocytic infiltrate, fibrosis). Consider the age of the patient and the presence or absence of other symptoms like fever or wheezing to narrow the differential diagnosis.",
