    "en": "A novel aminoglycoside antibiotic is developed that is intravenously administered and excreted unchanged in urine with an elimination half-life of 4 hours. Two different dosing regimens are tested in a clinical trial: smaller doses given 3 times a day and a higher dose given once a day. The total administered drug amount per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day) is the same in both regimens. Serum drug concentration is monitored in both groups and is shown in the graph below: {{exhibit_1}}\n\nIt is found that both regimens are effective against gram-negative pathogens, with clinical improvement occurring slightly earlier on average with once-daily dosing.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Antibiotics with concentration-dependent killing (eg, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones) have a persistent, suppressive effect on bacterial growth following a limited exposure, resulting in increased killing when drug levels at the site of infection are maximized. The HIGHER the PEAK DRUG LEVEL compared to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the GREATER the ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY. As such, higher-dose, EXTENDED-INTERVAL (ie, once-daily) regimens are frequently used to optimize bacterial killing.\n\nThe therapeutic index (ie, [toxic dose]/[effective dose]) is a measurement of the relative safety of a drug; it is an intrinsic property upon which drug dosing regimens are devised. A relatively high therapeutic index is usually necessary to prevent toxicity with extended-interval dosing because the administered drug amounts lead to higher serum levels than seen with more frequent dosing regimens.\n\nMost drugs exhibit a SIGMOID-SHAPED dose response curve that shows no effect until a threshold concentration is exceeded. After this occurs, the effects increase with increasing drug concentration until a saturation threshold (ie, maximum effect) is reached. In contrast to this sigmoidal response, the risk of cancer following exposure to ionizing radiation shows a LINEAR dose–response relationship (ie, risk increases proportionately with increased exposure).\n\nThe threshold dose is the lowest dose at which drug effects are first seen. In this case, both dosing regimens cause serum concentrations to rise above the MIC. Furthermore, the extended-interval dosing regimen results in less total time above the MIC but still demonstrates effectiveness. Therefore, a low dosing threshold does not explain the effectiveness of extended-interval dosing.\n\nIn this example, both treatment regimens were effective, with extended-interval dosing having a slightly better response time. Because serum concentrations with the extended-interval regimen remain above the MIC for a much shorter period of time compared to multiple-daily dosing, time-dependent killing does not contribute significantly to overall drug efficacy.\n\nEducational objective: Antibiotics exhibiting concentration-dependent killing can be administered using relatively high doses given at lower frequency. This allows for effective microbial killing while preventing adverse effects that may occur with prolonged systemic exposure.",
    "zh": "具有浓度依赖性杀灭作用的抗生素（例如，氨基糖苷类、氟喹诺酮类）在有限暴露后对细菌生长有持续的抑制作用，当感染部位的药物水平达到最大时，杀灭作用会增强。峰值血药浓度相对于最低抑菌浓度 (MIC) 越高，抗菌活性越大。因此，通常使用高剂量、延长给药间隔（即，每日一次）的方案来优化杀菌效果。\n\n治疗指数（即，[毒性剂量]/[有效剂量]）是衡量药物相对安全性的指标；它是制定给药方案所固有的属性。延长给药间隔时，相对较高的治疗指数通常是必要的，因为给药量会导致血清水平高于更频繁的给药方案。\n\n大多数药物表现出S形剂量反应曲线，在超过阈值浓度之前没有作用。达到阈值后，随着药物浓度增加，效果会增加，直到达到饱和阈值（即，最大效果）。与这种S形反应相反，接触电离辐射后患癌症的风险表现出线性剂量-反应关系（即，风险与暴露增加成正比）。\n\n阈值剂量是首次观察到药物效应的最低剂量。在本例中，两种给药方案均导致血清浓度高于MIC。此外，延长给药间隔的方案导致血药浓度高于MIC的总时间减少，但仍显示出有效性。因此，低阈值剂量不能解释延长给药间隔方案的有效性。\n\n在本例中，两种治疗方案均有效，延长给药间隔方案的反应时间略好。由于延长给药间隔方案的血清浓度高于MIC的时间比每日多次给药方案短得多，时间依赖性杀灭对总体的药物疗效贡献不大。\n\n教育目标：表现出浓度依赖性杀灭作用的抗生素可以使用相对高剂量、低频次给药。这使得能够有效杀灭微生物，同时防止可能因长期全身暴露而发生的不良反应。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of antibiotic pharmacodynamics, specifically concentration-dependent killing and its application in extended-interval dosing of aminoglycosides. It requires understanding the relationship between peak drug concentration, MIC, and antimicrobial activity.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that aminoglycosides exhibit concentration-dependent killing. The graph shows that once-daily dosing achieves higher peak concentrations, which is the primary driver of efficacy despite the short half-life. Therefore, selecting the option that highlights concentration-dependent killing is the correct approach.",
