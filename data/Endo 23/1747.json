    "en": "A 54-year-old woman is evaluated for a painless thyroid nodule. She has had no weight changes, heat or cold intolerance, hoarseness, or dyspnea. Medical history is notable for mild hypertension, for which she takes appropriate medications. The patient does not use tobacco or alcohol. Physical examination shows a 3-cm, firm nodule in the right thyroid lobe and enlarged, right cervical lymph nodes. TSH is normal, and fine-needle aspiration of the nodule shows papillary structures with nuclear atypia. Total thyroidectomy is planned. During the surgery, a nearby nerve is injured while ligating an artery entering the superior pole of the thyroid lobe. Which of the following muscles is most likely to be denervated as a result of this injury?",

    "en": "The superior thyroid artery (a branch of the external carotid artery) and the inferior thyroid artery (a branch of the thyrocervical trunk) provide the blood supply to the thyroid and parathyroid glands. The superior thyroid artery and vein and external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve course together in a neurovascular triad that originates superior to the thyroid gland and lateral to the thyroid cartilage. The external branch is at risk of injury during thyroidectomy as it courses just deep to the superior thyroid artery.\n\nThe cricothyroid muscle is the only muscle innervated by this nerve. It originates on the cricoid cartilage and inserts on the lower border of the thyroid cartilage. The cricothyroid muscle acts to tense the vocal cords, and denervation injury may cause a low, hoarse voice with limited range of pitch. The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve does not innervate any muscles but provides sensory innervation to the laryngeal mucosa above the vocal folds.\n\n(Choices A, C, D, and E) The remaining laryngeal muscles are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerves, which also provide sensory innervation to the larynx below the vocal folds. The recurrent laryngeal nerves lie posterior to the thyroid, near the inferior thyroid arteries. These nerves can be injured during thyroidectomy but do not run with the superior thyroid artery at the superior pole of the thyroid. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nEducational objective:\nThe external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is at risk of injury during thyroidectomy due to its proximity to the superior thyroid artery and vein. This nerve innervates the cricothyroid muscle.",
    "zh": "甲状腺上动脉（颈外动脉的分支）和甲状腺下动脉（甲状颈干的分支）为甲状腺和甲状旁腺提供血液供应。甲状腺上动脉、上甲状腺静脉和喉上神经外支一起构成神经血管三联体，该三联体起源于甲状腺上方并位于甲状软骨外侧。喉上神经外支在甲状腺切除术中存在损伤风险，因为它正好位于甲状腺上动脉的深部。\n\n环甲肌是唯一由该神经支配的肌肉。它起源于环状软骨，并附着在甲状软骨的下缘。环甲肌的作用是使声带紧张，去神经支配损伤可能会导致声音低沉、嘶哑，音调范围有限。喉上神经内支不支配任何肌肉，但为声带以上喉部粘膜提供感觉神经支配。\n\n（选项 A、C、D 和 E）其余喉肌由喉返神经支配，喉返神经也为声带以下的喉部提供感觉神经支配。喉返神经位于甲状腺后方，靠近甲状腺下动脉。这些神经在甲状腺切除术中可能受损，但不会与甲状腺上极的甲状腺上动脉一起走行。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n教育目标：\n由于与甲状腺上动脉和静脉的邻近关系，喉上神经外支在甲状腺切除术中存在损伤风险。该神经支配环甲肌。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the anatomy of the thyroid gland and the nerves that innervate the laryngeal muscles, specifically the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve and its relationship to the superior thyroid artery. It also tests the ability to identify which muscle is innervated by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve runs with the superior thyroid artery and innervates the cricothyroid muscle. Injury to this nerve during ligation of the superior thyroid artery during thyroidectomy will result in denervation of the cricothyroid muscle.",
    "zh": "此题考查对甲状腺解剖结构的了解以及支配喉肌的神经，特别是喉上神经外支及其与甲状腺上动脉的关系。它还测试识别由喉上神经外支支配的肌肉的能力。\n\n要解决这个问题，请回忆一下喉上神经外支与甲状腺上动脉一起走行，并支配环甲肌。在甲状腺切除术中结扎甲状腺上动脉时，该神经的损伤将导致环甲肌的去神经支配。"
