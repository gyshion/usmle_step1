    "en": "A 55-year-old woman with advanced metastatic breast cancer comes to the emergency department for evaluation of dyspnea and tachycardia. The resident evaluates the patient and orders an echocardiogram, which confirms the presence of a pericardial effusion. The surgery team is consulted, and the surgical attending informs the patient that a pericardiocentesis is necessary. The attending surgeon asks the surgery resident to obtain informed consent and leaves to start chart review for the next consult that needs to be seen. The surgery resident has neither observed nor performed a pericardiocentesis but has recently read an article about malignant pericardial effusions. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action by the surgery resident?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Informed consent is a process in which a patient agrees to medical treatment based on an adequate understanding of the pertinent facts. The basic elements include:\n\n*   an explanation of the medical condition.\n*   a description of the recommended treatment (and alternate treatment options).\n*   a discussion of the risks and benefits of the recommended treatment (and alternate treatment options).\n*   an opportunity for the patient to ask questions.\n\nInformed consent is best obtained by the physician performing the procedure as that physician is able to adequately explain the procedure and answer any questions. However, in many jurisdictions, informed consent may be delegated to another physician or mid-level provider (eg, physician assistant) on the care team. This team member tasked with obtaining informed consent must also have a thorough understanding of the procedure.\n\nIn this scenario, because of lack of knowledge about this particular procedure, the resident is not qualified to obtain informed consent at this time. The resident should therefore ask the attending (who has adequate and detailed knowledge of the procedure) to return to obtain informed consent.\n\n(Choice A) The emergency department attending does not have responsibility of performing the procedure and therefore should not be expected to obtain informed consent in place of the consulted service.\n\n(Choice C) Patients must be given adequate time to read a consent form, but this is not an appropriate replacement for a direct conversation with the physician. Although some institutions require a witness to be present during signing, this does not otherwise alter the obligations for informed consent.\n\n(Choice D) Patients may ask additional questions regarding treatment after giving consent and may withdraw consent at any time. However, it is unethical to ask a patient to sign an informed consent document prior to an adequate discussion and understanding of the procedure or its alternatives.\n\n(Choice E) The resident should research the procedure before the surgery for educational purposes. However, without any significant experience and/or thorough understanding of a pericardiocentesis, the resident is not in the best position to obtain an adequate informed consent as compared to the attending surgeon, especially for a high-risk procedure.\n\nEducational objective:\nInformed consent should be obtained by a qualified physician performing the recommended procedure. If informed consent is delegated to another provider on the care team, then the team member must thoroughly understand the procedure to adequately explain it and answer the patient's questions.",
    "zh": "知情同意是一个过程，患者在充分了解相关事实的基础上同意接受治疗。基本要素包括：\n\n*   对医学病症的解释。\n*   对推荐治疗方案（及替代治疗方案）的描述。\n*   对推荐治疗方案（及替代治疗方案）的风险和益处的讨论。\n*   让患者有机会提问。\n\n知情同意最好由进行该手术的医生获得，因为该医生能够充分解释该手术并回答任何问题。但是，在许多司法管辖区，知情同意可以委托给护理团队中的另一位医生或中级护理人员（例如，医师助理）。负责获取知情同意的团队成员也必须彻底了解该手术。\n\n在这种情况下，由于缺乏对该特定手术的了解，住院医师目前不具备获取知情同意的资格。因此，住院医师应要求主治医师（对该手术有充分和详细的了解）回来获取知情同意。\n\n(选项 A) 急诊科主治医师没有执行该手术的责任，因此不应期望其代替被会诊的科室获取知情同意。\n\n(选项 C) 患者必须有足够的时间阅读同意书，但这并不能替代与医生的直接对话。虽然一些机构要求在签署时有见证人在场，但这并不会改变知情同意的义务。\n\n(选项 D) 患者在给予同意后可以就治疗提出额外的问题，并且可以随时撤回同意。但是，在没有充分讨论和了解手术或其替代方案之前，要求患者签署知情同意文件是不道德的。\n\n(选项 E) 住院医师应出于教育目的在手术前研究该手术。但是，在没有任何重要经验和/或对心包穿刺术的透彻理解的情况下，与主治外科医生相比，住院医师并没有处于获取充分知情同意的最佳位置，尤其是对于高风险手术。\n\n教育目标：\n知情同意应由执行推荐手术的合格医生获得。如果知情同意被委托给护理团队中的另一位提供者，那么团队成员必须彻底了解该手术，才能充分解释并回答患者的问题。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the informed consent process and the responsibilities of a physician, particularly a resident, in obtaining informed consent for a procedure. It emphasizes the importance of the physician's knowledge and ability to explain the procedure to the patient.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize that the resident's lack of experience with the procedure makes them unqualified to obtain informed consent. Therefore, the resident should defer to the attending surgeon who has the necessary expertise to adequately explain the procedure and answer the patient's questions.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对知情同意过程的理解以及医生（尤其是住院医师）在获取手术知情同意方面的责任。它强调了医生知识和向患者解释手术的能力的重要性。\n\n最好的方法是认识到住院医师缺乏手术经验，这使得他们不具备获取知情同意的资格。因此，住院医师应听从主治外科医生的意见，后者具备充分解释手术并回答患者问题的必要专业知识。"
