  "correct_answer": "G",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "There appears to be an **OUTBREAK** as almost a third of the attendees (28/100) developed diarrhea and vomiting; this is clearly a larger number than expected. The **ATTACK RATE** is the ratio of the number of individuals who become ill divided by the number of individuals who are at risk of contracting that illness; it is often used in outbreak investigations. The attack rate for potato salad corresponds to the proportion of attendees who became ill out of the total number of attendees who had potato salad (alone or in combination with other food items).\n\nTo calculate the attack rate for all attendees who had potato salad, we first need to determine the total number of attendees who consumed potato salad in any form:\nTotal number of attendees who had potato salad = Number of attendees who had potato salad only + number of attendees who had hamburgers and potato salad + number of attendees who had hotdogs and potato salad + number of attendees who had hamburgers, hotdogs, and potato salad\n= 10 + 25 + 8 + 30 = **73**\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of attendees who became ill among those 73 people:\nNumber who became ill among those who had potato salad = Number ill from potato salad only + number ill from hamburgers and potato salad + number ill from hotdogs and potato salad + number ill from hamburgers, hotdogs, and potato salad\n= 3 + 5 + 3 + 14 = **25**\n\nTherefore, the attack rate for potato salad was: (25 ill / 73 exposed) × 100 = **34%**.\n\n**(Choice G) 34% is the correct answer.**\n\n**(Choice A) 8%**: This is the attack rate for hotdogs only (1 ill / 12 ate = 8%). This is incorrect as the question asks for the attack rate among *all* attendees who had potato salad.\n\n**(Choice B) 11%**: This is the attack rate among those who did *not* eat potato salad. There were 27 attendees who did not eat potato salad (15 had hamburgers only + 12 had hotdogs only). Of those, a total of 3 became ill (2 from hamburgers only + 1 from hotdogs only). So, (3 ill / 27 unexposed) × 100 = 11%. This is incorrect as the question specifies attendees who *had* potato salad.\n\n**(Choice C) 13%**: This is the attack rate for hamburgers only (2 ill / 15 ate = 13%). This is incorrect.\n\n**(Choice D) 20%**: This is the attack rate for the combination of hamburgers and potato salad (5 ill / 25 ate = 20%). This is incorrect as it only considers one subset of those who ate potato salad.\n\n**(Choice E) 28%**: This is the **OVERALL ATTACK RATE** for the entire group of 100 attendees (28 ill / 100 attendees = 28%). This is incorrect as it's not specific to potato salad consumers.\n\n**(Choice F) 30%**: This is the attack rate for potato salad only (3 ill / 10 ate = 30%). This is incorrect as the question asks for the rate among *all* attendees who had potato salad, regardless of other food items consumed.\n\n**(Choice H) 47%**: This is the attack rate for the combination of hamburgers, hotdogs, and potato salad (14 ill / 30 ate = 47%). This is incorrect as it only considers one subset of those who ate potato salad.\n\nThe food item responsible for an outbreak often (though not always) has the largest attack rate and the largest difference in attack rates between those who consumed the item and those who did not. In this example, as calculated above, the difference in attack rate between those who had potato salad (34%) and those who did not (11%) was: 34% - 11% = 23%. This large difference suggests potato salad is a likely source of the outbreak. The differences in attack rates were smaller for hamburgers (7%) and hotdogs (18%).\n\n**Educational objective**: The attack rate is the ratio of the number of people who contract an illness divided by the number of people who are at risk of contracting that illness. Understanding how to calculate and interpret attack rates is crucial for **EPIDEMIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS** of **FOODBORNE ILLNESS OUTBREAKS**.",
    "zh": "似乎发生了**爆发**，因为几乎三分之一的参加者 (28/100) 出现了腹泻和呕吐；这显然是一个比预期大的数字。**发病率**是患病人数除以面临感染该疾病风险的人数的比率；它经常用于爆发调查。土豆沙拉的发病率对应于在吃过土豆沙拉（单独或与其他食物组合）的参加者总数中患病参加者的比例。\n\n为了计算所有吃过土豆沙拉的参加者的发病率，我们首先需要确定以任何形式食用土豆沙拉的参加者总数：\n吃过土豆沙拉的参加者总数 = 仅吃土豆沙拉的参加者人数 + 吃过汉堡和土豆沙拉的参加者人数 + 吃过热狗和土豆沙拉的参加者人数 + 吃过汉堡、热狗和土豆沙拉的参加者人数\n= 10 + 25 + 8 + 30 = **73**\n\n接下来，我们需要找到在这 73 人中患病的总人数：\n在吃过土豆沙拉的人中患病的人数 = 仅因土豆沙拉患病的人数 + 因汉堡和土豆沙拉患病的人数 + 因热狗和土豆沙拉患病的人数 + 因汉堡、热狗和土豆沙拉患病的人数\n= 3 + 5 + 3 + 14 = **25**\n\n因此，土豆沙拉的发病率为：(25 人患病 / 73 人暴露) × 100 = **34%**。\n\n**(选项 G) 34% 是正确答案。**\n\n**(选项 A) 8%**：这是仅吃热狗的发病率 (1 人患病 / 12 人食用 = 8%)。这是不正确的，因为问题询问的是吃过*所有*土豆沙拉的参加者的发病率。\n\n**(选项 B) 11%**：这是没有吃土豆沙拉的人的发病率。有 27 位参加者没有吃土豆沙拉（15 人仅吃了汉堡 + 12 人仅吃了热狗）。其中，共有 3 人患病（2 人仅吃了汉堡 + 1 人仅吃了热狗）。所以，(3 人患病 / 27 人未暴露) × 100 = 11%。这是不正确的，因为问题明确指定了*吃过*土豆沙拉的参加者。\n\n**(选项 C) 13%**：这是仅吃汉堡的发病率 (2 人患病 / 15 人食用 = 13%)。这是不正确的。\n\n**(选项 D) 20%**：这是汉堡和土豆沙拉的组合发病率 (5 人患病 / 25 人食用 = 20%)。这是不正确的，因为它只考虑了吃土豆沙拉的人群的一个子集。\n\n**(选项 E) 28%**：这是整个 100 位参加者的**总发病率** (28 人患病 / 100 位参加者 = 28%)。这是不正确的，因为它没有针对土豆沙拉消费者。\n\n**(选项 F) 30%**：这是仅吃土豆沙拉的发病率 (3 人患病 / 10 人食用 = 30%)。这是不正确的，因为问题询问的是*所有*吃过土豆沙拉的参加者的发病率，无论是否食用了其他食物。\n\n**(选项 H) 47%**：这是汉堡、热狗和土豆沙拉的组合发病率 (14 人患病 / 30 人食用 = 47%)。这是不正确的，因为它只考虑了吃土豆沙拉的人群的一个子集。\n\n导致爆发的食物（虽然并非总是如此）通常具有最高的发病率，并且食用该食物的人和未食用该食物的人之间的发病率差异最大。在这个例子中，如上所述，吃过土豆沙拉的人 (34%) 和未吃过土豆沙拉的人 (11%) 之间的发病率差异为：34% - 11% = 23%。这种大的差异表明土豆沙拉是此次爆发的可能来源。汉堡（7%）和热狗（18%）的发病率差异较小。\n\n**教育目标**：发病率是患病人数除以面临感染该疾病风险的人数的比率。了解如何计算和解释发病率对于**食源性疾病爆发**的**流行病学调查**至关重要。"
