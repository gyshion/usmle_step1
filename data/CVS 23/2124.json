    "en": "A 34-year-old woman is being evaluated for fatigue and progressive exertional dyspnea. She goes mountain biking with friends a few times a month and recently noticed that she has to stop and rest more frequently when traveling uphill. The patient has no significant medical history and takes no medications. She occasionally drinks alcohol but does not use tobacco or illicit drugs. Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 72. Lung auscultation is normal. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged coronary sinus.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Most of the venous drainage from the myocardium traverses the coronary sinus (CS), which delivers deoxygenated blood to the right atrium. The CS runs transversely in the left atrioventricular groove on the posterior aspect of the heart, and opens into the right atrium between the inferior vena cava and tricuspid valve at the CS orifice. Because the CS communicates freely with the right atrium, it will become dilated by any factor that causes dilation of the right atrium. The most common cause of coronary sinus dilation evident on echocardiography is elevated right-sided heart pressure secondary to pulmonary hypertension. CS dilation also occurs in patients with anomalous venous drainage into the CS, including persistent left superior vena cava and total anomalous pulmonary venous return.\n\n(Choice A) Aortic dissection can occur in patients with severe hypertension. Such patients might have elevated left heart pressures, but elevated right-sided heart pressures with dilation of the CS would be unlikely.\n\n(Choice B) The presence of asymptomatic coronary artery disease usually does not change the size of the CS. Long-standing left ventricular systolic dysfunction due to prior myocardial infarction and ischemic cardiomyopathy can lead to secondary pulmonary hypertension, with the possibility of CS dilation over time.\n\n(Choice C) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually manifests as asymmetric septal hypertrophy with or without left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. CS dilation should not occur unless there is superimposed biventricular heart failure.\n\n(Choice D) Pericardial effusion can cause extrinsic compression of the CS.\n\nEducational objective: The coronary sinus communicates freely with the right atrium and will become dilated secondary to any factor that causes increased right atrial pressure. The most common cause is pulmonary hypertension, leading to elevated right heart pressures.",
    "zh": "心肌的大部分静脉引流通过冠状静脉窦（CS），将脱氧血输送到右心房。CS横向走行于心脏后部的左房室沟，并在CS开口处，下腔静脉和三尖瓣之间开口进入右心房。由于CS与右心房自由交通，任何导致右心房扩张的因素都会导致其扩张。超声心动图显示冠状静脉窦扩张最常见的原因是继发于肺动脉高压的右心压力升高。CS扩张也发生在异常静脉引流进入CS的患者中，包括左上腔静脉持续存在和全肺静脉异位回流。\n\n(选项A) 主动脉夹层可在严重高血压患者中发生。此类患者可能出现左心压力升高，但右心压力升高伴CS扩张的可能性不大。\n\n(选项B) 无症状冠状动脉疾病的存在通常不会改变CS的大小。由于既往心肌梗死和缺血性心肌病引起的长期左心室收缩功能障碍可导致继发性肺动脉高压，并可能随着时间的推移出现CS扩张。\n\n(选项C) 肥厚型心肌病通常表现为不对称室间隔肥大，伴或不伴左心室流出道梗阻。CS扩张不应发生，除非合并双心室心力衰竭。\n\n(选项D) 心包积液可引起CS的外部压迫。\n\n教学目标：冠状静脉窦与右心房自由交通，并且继发于任何导致右房压力增加的因素而扩张。最常见的原因是肺动脉高压，导致右心压力升高。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the coronary sinus and the causes of its dilation, particularly the association with elevated right-sided heart pressures and pulmonary hypertension.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the anatomical relationship of the coronary sinus to the right atrium and the factors that can increase right atrial pressure.
