    "en": "A 35-year-old woman comes to the office due to trouble seeing out of her right eye. The patient started having blurry vision and pain with eye movement 2 days ago. She has no headache, vertigo, slurred speech, numbness, or weakness. Two years ago, {{exhibit_1}} the patient had an episode of double vision that spontaneously resolved after a few weeks. On physical examination, she has an afferent pupillary defect with markedly reduced visual acuity on the right. Funduscopy reveals blurring of the optic disk margins in the right eye. MRI of the {{exhibit_2}} brain reveals multiple, ovoid white matter lesions with perpendicular orientation to the lateral ventricles. This patient's condition is most likely caused by an inappropriate immune response directed against which of the following cells?",
    "zh": "一名35岁的女性因右眼视力问题前来就诊。患者2天前开始出现视力模糊和眼球运动疼痛。她没有头痛、眩晕、言语不清、麻木或无力。两年前，{{exhibit_1}} 患者曾出现复视，数周后自发缓解。体格检查显示，右眼有传入性瞳孔缺陷，视力明显下降。眼底镜检查显示右眼视盘边缘模糊。{{exhibit_2}} 的脑部MRI显示多个卵圆形白质病灶，与侧脑室呈垂直方向。该患者的病症最可能由针对以下哪种细胞的不适当免疫反应引起？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's presentation of blurry vision, optic disk blurring, and multiple white matter lesions on MRI is characteristic of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The pathogenesis of MS involves an autoimmune response targeting myelin, which is produced by oligodendrocytes in the CNS. Therefore, the inappropriate immune response is directed against oligodendrocytes.",
    "zh": "患者的视力模糊、视盘模糊和MRI上多个白质病灶的表现是多发性硬化症（MS）的特征。MS是一种中枢神经系统（CNS）的自身免疫性脱髓鞘疾病。MS的发病机制涉及针对髓鞘的自身免疫反应，而髓鞘是由CNS中的少突胶质细胞产生的。因此，不适当的免疫反应是针对少突胶质细胞的。"
  },
  "summary": {
    "en": "The patient's symptoms and MRI findings are consistent with multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease that attacks myelin-producing cells in the CNS. The correct answer is oligodendrocytes, as they are responsible for myelin production in the CNS and are the primary target of the immune response in MS.",
    "zh": "患者的症状和MRI结果与多发性硬化症一致，这是一种攻击中枢神经系统中产生髓磷脂的细胞的自身免疫性疾病。正确答案是少突胶质细胞，因为它们负责中枢神经系统中的髓磷脂生成，并且是MS中免疫反应的主要靶标。"
