    "en": "A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to acute onset coffee-ground emesis and lightheadedness. Two months ago, he developed lower back pain with stiffness and began taking naproxen and cyclobenzaprine. Medical history is notable for moderate persistent asthma, hepatitis C, and HIV. His last CD4 count was 550/mm³. The patient has a remote history of intravenous drug use but currently does not use any recreational drugs. He has an allergy to penicillin that causes a rash and pruritus. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals gastric mucosal erythema and erosions. Which of the following best explains this patient's current symptoms?",

    "en": "This patient has upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which is an adverse effect of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) he has been taking. Cyclooxygenase (COX) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxane. COX enzymes are involved in mediating inflammation but are also required for housekeeping functions such as platelet aggregation, renal protection, and gastric mucosal protection. Inhibition of COX enzymes by NSAIDs (eg, naproxen, ibuprofen) leads to impaired prostaglandin-dependent gastric mucosal protection and the potential development of gastritis (ie, erythema, erosions) and ulceration. Changes to the gastric mucosa may be seen within the first week of initiating NSAID therapy.\n\nMost adverse drug reactions are PREDICTABLE and result from the known pharmacologic properties of the drug, and often occur after extended drug exposure. Unpredictable reactions are less common and occur due to relatively patient-specific immunologic processes or other mechanisms (eg, genetic enzyme deficiencies). In this case, upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to an NSAID is a well-known and predictable adverse effect.\n\n(Choice A) Exaggerated drug sensitivity, also sometimes called drug intolerance, refers to an unpredictable reaction that occurs due to a known pharmacologic action of the drug but at a lower dose than expected (likely due to patient-specific alterations in metabolism or end-organ susceptibility). For example, patients with deficiency of thiopurine methyltransferase, an enzyme that metabolizes azathioprine, are more likely to experience azathioprine intolerance.\n\n(Choice B) An idiosyncratic drug reaction is an unpredictable reaction (ie, results from patient-specific complexities) that does not involve a typical pharmacologic action of the drug. For example, the use of the antibiotic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency can lead to oxidative cellular injury and nonimmune hemolytic anemia.\n\n(Choice C) Immunologic drug reactions (drug allergies) are unpredictable antibody- or T cell-mediated responses to medications. This patient's history of rash and pruritus with penicillin likely represents IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity.\n\n(Choice E) Pseudoallergic drug reactions mimic immunologic reactions but occur via a nonimmunologic mechanism (eg, direct immune cell activation) in those with patient-specific susceptibility. Vancomycin, opioids, and radioiodine contrast can directly activate mast cells to cause a pseudoallergic reaction that closely mimics IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity.\n\nEducational objective: Most adverse drug reactions are predictable and result from known pharmacologic properties of the drug. Unpredictable reactions are less common and are typically driven by patient-specific genetics (eg, enzyme deficiency) or immunologic mechanisms.",

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of drug adverse effects, specifically differentiating between predictable and unpredictable reactions. It requires knowledge of NSAID pharmacodynamics and common gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the drug taken by the patient (naproxen, an NSAID) and correlating it with the presenting symptoms (coffee-ground emesis, lightheadedness, gastric mucosal erythema and erosions, indicative of upper GI bleeding). Recognizing that NSAID-induced gastric injury is a well-documented and expected side effect is key to selecting the correct answer.",
