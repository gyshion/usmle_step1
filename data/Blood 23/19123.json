    "en": "A 54-year-old woman comes to the office due to 3 months of progressive pain and prolonged morning stiffness in her hand joints. She has tried over-the-counter naproxen without significant relief. Review of systems is positive for fatigue. The patient has no other chronic medical conditions and takes no other medications regularly. Vital signs are normal. Swelling and tenderness of the proximal interphalangeal joints and metacarpophalangeal joints are present in both hands. Laboratory studies reveal a hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL and MCV of 86. The patient is prescribed methotrexate therapy. Laboratory results 6 months later reveal that hemoglobin has increased to 12 g/dL. If measured, which of the following changes were most likely present in this patient before the start of methotrexate therapy?",

    "en": "This patient's polyarticular hand joint pain, swelling, and prolonged morning stiffness are suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients with chronic rheumatologic diseases such as RA have high circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, which can trigger anemia of chronic disease (ACD) due to maladaptive changes in iron utilization.\n\nACD is primarily mediated by hepcidin, a small peptide released by the liver in response to inflammation. Hepcidin binds to and inactivates iron channels (ferroportin) on enterocytes and reticuloendothelial macrophages, leading to reduced iron absorption in the gut and reduced iron recycling by the reticuloendothelial system (the site of senescent erythrocyte destruction and the source of >95% of daily iron for new RBC production). These changes significantly reduce circulating iron levels, which impairs the generation of heme for new erythrocytes. Although patients with suspected ACD do not generally require bone marrow biopsy for diagnosis, it would show increased sequestration of iron within macrophages and reduced quantities of erythrocyte precursor cells (eg, normoblasts, reticulocytes).\n\nPatients with ACD typically develop a normocytic (or slightly microcytic) anemia with low reticulocyte count. Treatment of the underlying inflammatory condition (eg, methotrexate for RA) reduces serum inflammatory cytokine levels and generally improves the anemia.\n\n(Choice B) In contrast to ACD, patients with iron deficiency anemia have reduced serum iron levels and reduced bone marrow iron levels due to low total body iron stores.\n\nEducational objective:\nAnemia of chronic disease is caused by elevated inflammatory cytokine levels (eg, hepcidin), which increase sequestration of iron within the reticuloendothelial system and reduce circulating iron levels. Many patients have improvement in anemia with treatment of the underlying condition that caused the inflammation.",
    "zh": "该患者的多关节手部关节疼痛、肿胀和晨僵提示类风湿性关节炎(RA)。患有慢性风湿病（如 RA）的患者，其循环中炎性细胞因子水平较高，由于铁利用的适应不良变化，可触发慢性病贫血（ACD）。\n\nACD 主要由铁调素介导，铁调素是一种由肝脏释放的小肽，用于应对炎症。铁调素与肠细胞和网状内皮巨噬细胞上的铁通道（铁转运蛋白）结合并使其失活，导致肠道内铁吸收减少，并减少网状内皮系统（衰老红细胞破坏的部位，也是 >95% 的新 RBC 日常铁的来源）对铁的回收。这些变化显著降低循环铁水平，从而损害新红细胞中血红素的产生。尽管怀疑患有 ACD 的患者通常不需要骨髓活检来诊断，但它会显示巨噬细胞内铁的隔离增加以及红细胞前体细胞（例如，成正红细胞，网织红细胞）的数量减少。\n\n患有 ACD 的患者通常会发展为正细胞性（或轻度小细胞性）贫血，网织红细胞计数低。对潜在炎症疾病（例如，RA 的甲氨蝶呤）的治疗可降低血清炎性细胞因子水平，并普遍改善贫血。\n\n（选项 B）与 ACD 相比，患有缺铁性贫血的患者由于全身铁储备不足，血清铁水平和骨髓铁水平降低。\n\n教育目标：\n慢性病贫血是由炎性细胞因子水平升高（例如，铁调素）引起的，这增加了铁在网状内皮系统内的隔离，并降低了循环铁水平。许多患者在治疗引起炎症的潜在疾病后，贫血有所改善。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of anemia of chronic disease (ACD) and its pathophysiology related to iron metabolism. Specifically, it assesses the impact of inflammatory cytokines on hepcidin production and subsequent iron sequestration.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis, understand the mechanism of ACD involving hepcidin, and recall that ACD leads to low circulating iron levels and increased iron sequestration in the bone marrow.",
