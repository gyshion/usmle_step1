    "en": "A 45-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to shortness of breath and fatigue that has progressed over the last 2 weeks. The patient was diagnosed with nonischemic cardiomyopathy 2 years ago and has not been adherent with physician visits and his medical regimen. Blood pressure is 106/58 mm Hg, and pulse is 88/min and regular. The patient appears uncomfortable when lying flat. Jugular venous pressure is elevated. Bibasilar crackles are heard on lung auscultation and an S3 is present. There is 1+ bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Milrinone infusion is initiated. ",

    "en": "Milrinone is a selective phosphodiesterase (PDE)-3 enzyme inhibitor that can be used in patients with refractory heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The PDE-3 enzyme is normally responsible for degrading cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to AMP; the inhibition of cAMP degradation via milrinone has 2 positive effects on heart failure:\n\n*   In cardiomyocytes, intracellular calcium influx is increased, which increases cardiac contractility (positive inotropy) to improve stroke volume and cardiac output.\n*   In vascular smooth muscle, uptake of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum is increased, which reduces calcium-myosin light chain kinase interaction to stimulate relaxation and vasodilation. Venous vasodilation reduces preload and arterial vasodilation reduces afterload to provide a cumulative reduction in cardiac work. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nAlthough the vasodilatory action of milrinone can lead to hypotension, this effect is often compensated for by an increase in stroke volume that maintains blood pressure.\n\n(Choice A) Angioedema refers to localized subcutaneous swelling that affects the submucosal tissues of the face, mouth, throat, and genitalia. It is typically seen as a side effect of ACE inhibitors due to inhibition of bradykinin degradation.\n\n(Choice B) Milrinone does not have an antiarrhythmic effect on the myocardium. In fact, its positive inotropic effect may induce ventricular arrhythmias in some patients.\n\n(Choice C) Atrioventricular conduction block can be caused by toxicity due to digoxin, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or beta blockers; however, PDE inhibitors have minimal chronotropic effect (positive or negative).\n\n(Choice D) Renal perfusion is increased with milrinone due to an increase in cardiac output.\n\n(Choice E) Right atrial pressure is decreased with milrinone due to venous dilation and a consequent reduction in cardiac venous return (preload).\n\nEducational objective:\nMilrinone is a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor that reduces the degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate to provide 2 beneficial effects for treating systolic heart failure. Calcium influx into cardiomyocytes is increased, which increases cardiac contractility. In addition, calcium-myosin light chain interaction is reduced, which causes vasodilation and reduces cardiac preload and afterload.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of milrinone, a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor used in heart failure, and its effects on cardiac contractility and vasodilation. It also requires understanding of preload and afterload reduction in the context of heart failure management. \n\nThe best approach is to recall that milrinone increases cAMP levels, leading to increased calcium influx in cardiomyocytes (positive inotropy) and vasodilation. Recognizing the vasodilatory effect as the primary response helps eliminate other options.",
