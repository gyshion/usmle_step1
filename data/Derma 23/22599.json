    "en": "This patient has numerous cutaneous neurofibromas (fleshy skin nodules) and café-au-lait macules (flat, uniformly pigmented lesions), likely due to NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE 1, an autosomal dominant disorder (eg, her biological family members are also affected) associated with a mutation in the neurofibromin gene (NF1).\n\nCutaneous neurofibromas are benign nerve sheath tumors composed of diverse cells and are often found within the DERMIS. The dermis, the connective tissue layer between the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue (ie, hypodermis), is composed of collagen, elastic fibers, and ground substance and contains extracellular components including nerves, vasculature, hair follicles, and glands. Neurofibromas are composed of a mixture of cells normally found in peripheral nerves, including neoplastic Schwann cells, as well as non-neoplastic fibroblasts, perineural cells, and mast cells.\n\nCutaneous neurofibromas most commonly appear around puberty and increase in size and number with age. Café-au-lait macules represent localized areas of increased melanogenesis rather than pathologic cellular proliferation.\n\n(Choice A) Numerous cutaneous tumors, both benign and malignant, can arise from the adnexal structures of the skin: hair follicles (eg, pilomatricomas), sebaceous glands (eg, sebaceous adenomas), and sweat glands (eg, poromas). Some cutaneous adnexal tumors present as skin-colored papules or nodules; however, they are typically not as diffuse as this patient's skin lesions and are not associated with numerous café-au-lait macules.\n\n(Choice C) Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by a proliferation of atypical keratinocytes arising from the epidermis and invading the dermis. These lesions often present as discrete nodules with a scaly or ulcerated surface. In contrast, this patient's multiple lesions have normal overlying epidermis. In addition, although the epidermis contains free nerve endings, these unencapsulated neuronal receptors lack the components (eg, Schwann cells, connective tissue) that typically give rise to neurofibromas.\n\n(Choice D) Superficial fibromatosis represents an infiltrative fibroblast proliferation within superficial fascia, which can lead to progressive fascial contracture and local deformity. A classic example is Dupuytren contracture (ie, palmar fibromatosis), which affects the palmar fascia.\n\n(Choice E) Most skeletal muscle neoplasms are malignant. Rhabdomyosarcomas are aggressive tumors that arise from primitive mesenchymal cells with skeletal muscle differentiation rather than from mature, terminally differentiated muscle cells. They often appear during childhood or adolescence and involve locations that do not contain much skeletal muscle, most commonly the sinuses and genitourinary tract.\n\nEducational objective:\nNeurofibromas are benign nerve sheath tumors composed of cells normally found in peripheral nerves, including neoplastic Schwann cells, as well as non-neoplastic fibroblasts, perineural cells, and mast cells. Cutaneous neurofibromas often arise from small nerves in the dermis. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有多种皮肤神经纤维瘤（肉色皮肤结节）和咖啡牛奶斑（扁平、均匀色素沉着病变），这很可能与1型神经纤维瘤病有关，这是一种常染色体显性遗传疾病（例如，她的生物学家庭成员也受到影响），与神经纤维蛋白基因 (NF1) 突变有关。\n\n皮肤神经纤维瘤是良性神经鞘肿瘤，由多种细胞组成，通常位于真皮内。真皮是表皮和皮下组织（即真皮下组织）之间的结缔组织层，由胶原蛋白、弹性纤维和基质组成，并包含细胞外成分，包括神经、血管、毛囊和腺体。神经纤维瘤由周围神经中通常发现的细胞混合组成，包括肿瘤性施万细胞以及非肿瘤性成纤维细胞、神经周围细胞和肥大细胞。\n\n皮肤神经纤维瘤最常出现在青春期前后，并随着年龄的增长而增大和增多。咖啡牛奶斑代表局部黑色素生成增加的区域，而不是病理性细胞增生。\n\n(选项 A) 许多皮肤肿瘤，包括良性和恶性肿瘤，都可能源于皮肤的附属结构：毛囊（例如，毛母质瘤）、皮脂腺（例如，皮脂腺腺瘤）和汗腺（例如，汗孔瘤）。一些皮肤附属器肿瘤表现为肤色丘疹或结节；然而，它们通常不像该患者的皮肤病变那样弥漫，并且与许多咖啡牛奶斑无关。\n\n(选项 C) 皮肤鳞状细胞癌的特征是来自表皮并侵入真皮的非典型角质形成细胞增生。这些病变通常表现为具有鳞状或溃疡表面的离散结节。相比之下，该患者的多个病变具有正常的覆盖表皮。此外，尽管表皮包含游离神经末梢，但这些未包囊的神经元受体缺乏通常引起神经纤维瘤的成分（例如，施万细胞、结缔组织）。\n\n(选项 D) 浅表纤维瘤病代表浅筋膜内的浸润性成纤维细胞增生，这可能导致进行性筋膜挛缩和局部畸形。一个经典的例子是 Dupuytren 挛缩症（即掌部纤维瘤病），它影响掌部筋膜。\n\n(选项 E) 大多数骨骼肌肿瘤是恶性的。横纹肌肉瘤是起源于原始间充质细胞并具有骨骼肌分化的侵袭性肿瘤，而不是来自成熟、终末分化的肌细胞。它们通常出现在儿童或青春期，并涉及不含多少骨骼肌的位置，最常见的是鼻窦和泌尿生殖道。\n\n教育目标：\n神经纤维瘤是良性神经鞘肿瘤，由周围神经中通常发现的细胞组成，包括肿瘤性施万细胞以及非肿瘤性成纤维细胞、神经周围细胞和肥大细胞。皮肤神经纤维瘤通常源于真皮中的小神经。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}"

It requires understanding that neurofibromas are derived from nerve sheath tumors located in the dermis.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of NF1 (skin-colored papules, nodules, café-au-lait macules) and associate it with the proliferation of cells within the dermis.
