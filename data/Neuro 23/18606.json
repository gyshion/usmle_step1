    "en": "This patient has herpes zoster ophthalmicus, which is caused by reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the trigeminal ganglion. Following primary VZV infection (ie, chickenpox), the virus migrates via sensory nerves to the cranial nerve and dorsal spinal ganglia, where it lies dormant for years. Reactivation of the virus typically occurs in a single ganglion and causes a painful, vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution. Viral reactivation within the trigeminal ganglion most often affects the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V1), leading to development of a vesicular rash within the V1 distribution (eg, unilateral forehead, side of the nose, and periorbital area). Because CN V1 also conveys sensory innervation of the cornea (sensory limb of the corneal/blink reflex), involvement can cause acute keratitis, which can lead to vision loss. Vesicular lesions on the side and tip of the nose (ie, Hutchinson sign) have a high correlation with subsequent eye involvement because the nasociliary branch of CN V1 innervates both the eye and the side/tip of the nose. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choices A, C, and F) The oculomotor (CN III), trochlear (CN IV), and abducens (CN VI) nerves provide motor innervation to the extraocular muscles. Dysfunction can result in double vision. However, these nerves are not involved in this patient's condition and would not cause blindness if they were.\n\n(Choice B) The facial nerve (CN VII) is affected in herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome), which classically presents with ear pain, vesicles in the external auditory canal or auricle, and facial paralysis. The facial nerve innervates the orbicularis oculi muscle to close the eye; therefore, patients with facial nerve paralysis are at risk of exposure keratitis, which can lead to blindness. However, this patient's facial nerve is unaffected.\n\n(Choice D) In rare instances, zoster can cause blindness due to acute retinal necrosis and/or neuritis of the optic nerve (CN II). However, this patient has zoster involvement of CN V1.\n\nEducational objective:\nHermes zoster ophthalmicus is caused by viral reactivation within the trigeminal nucleus. It affects the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V1) and can lead to blindness due to acute keratitis because V1 conveys sensory information from the cornea.",
    "zh": "该患者患有带状疱疹眼部感染，其病因是潜伏在三叉神经节中的水痘-带状疱疹病毒(VZV)再激活。在原发性VZV感染（即水痘）后，病毒通过感觉神经迁移到脑神经和脊髓背根神经节，在那里潜伏多年。病毒的再激活通常发生在单个神经节中，并引起呈皮节分布的疼痛性水疱性皮疹。三叉神经节内的病毒再激活最常影响三叉神经的眼支（CN V1），导致V1分布区域内（例如，单侧前额、鼻子侧面和眼眶周围区域）出现水疱性皮疹。由于CN V1也传递角膜的感觉神经支配（角膜/眨眼反射的感觉分支），因此受累可引起急性角膜炎，从而导致视力丧失。鼻子侧面和鼻尖的水疱性病变（即Hutchinson征）与随后的眼部受累有高度相关性，因为CN V1的鼻睫状分支支配眼睛和鼻子侧面/鼻尖。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n（选项A、C和F）动眼神经（CN III）、滑车神经（CN IV）和外展神经（CN VI）为眼外肌提供运动神经支配。功能障碍可导致复视。然而，这些神经与该患者的病情无关，即使受累也不会导致失明。\n\n（选项B）面神经（CN VII）受累于耳带状疱疹（Ramsay Hunt综合征），其典型表现为耳痛、外耳道或耳廓内水疱和面瘫。面神经支配眼轮匝肌闭合眼睛；因此，面神经麻痹的患者有暴露性角膜炎的风险，这可导致失明。然而，该患者的面神经未受累。\n\n（选项D）在极少数情况下，带状疱疹可由于急性视网膜坏死和/或视神经炎（CN II）导致失明。然而，该患者的带状疱疹累及CN V1。\n\n教育目标：\n疱疹性带状疱疹眼部感染是由三叉神经核内的病毒再激活引起的。它影响三叉神经的眼支（CN V1），并可因急性角膜炎而导致失明，因为V1传递来自角膜的感觉信息。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, its etiology, clinical presentation, and potential complications, specifically the risk of vision loss due to corneal involvement. It also requires understanding of cranial nerve anatomy and function. \n\nThe best approach is to recognize the dermatomal distribution of the rash, associate it with the trigeminal nerve (V1 branch), and understand the potential for corneal involvement leading to keratitis and vision loss. Rule out other cranial nerves based on the clinical presentation.",
    "zh": "此题考察对带状疱疹眼部感染的认识，包括其病因、临床表现和潜在并发症，特别是由于角膜受累导致的视力丧失的风险。它还需要了解脑神经的解剖结构和功能。\n\n最佳方法是识别皮疹的皮节分布，将其与三叉神经（V1分支）联系起来，并了解角膜受累导致角膜炎和视力丧失的可能性。根据临床表现排除其他脑神经。"
