    "en": "A 75-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he was found unresponsive at home. The patient has a history of poorly controlled hypertension. Blood pressure is 240/120 mm Hg and pulse is 104 /min. He has extensor posturing and pinpoint pupils. CT scan of the head without contrast reveals an acute pontine hemorrhage with associated mass effect. The patient dies several hours later. Autopsy reveals disruption of all pigmented neurons in the posterior rostral pons at the lateral floor of the fourth ventricle. These neurons normally produce which of the following?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient had a hypertensive hemorrhage in the pons at the level of the locus ceruleus, a paired pigmented brainstem nucleus located in the posterior rostral pons near the lateral floor of the fourth ventricle. The locus ceruleus functions as the principal site for NOREPINEPHRINE synthesis in the brain and projects to virtually all parts of the central nervous system. It is involved in the control of mood, AROUSAL (reticular activating system), sleep-wake states, cognition, and autonomic function (eg, blood pressure control). Abnormal activation of the locus ceruleus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders (eg, panic attacks).\n\nPatients with bilateral pontine hemorrhage typically present with coma due to disruption of the RETICULAR ACTIVATING SYSTEM. Other features usually include total paralysis with extensor posturing due to corticospinal and corticobulbar tract injury and pinpoint pupils secondary to descending sympathetic tract damage.\n\n(Choice A) Dopamine is produced in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta located in the midbrain. The major dopaminergic pathways in the brain include the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways (regulate cognition and behavior), the nigrostriatal pathway (regulates coordination of voluntary movements), and the tuberoinfundibular pathway (inhibits prolactin secretion).\n\n(Choice B) Dynorphin is an opioid peptide that modulates the pain response. It is produced mostly in the periaqueductal gray, rostral ventral medulla, and dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n(Choice C) Norepinephrine is converted to epinephrine primarily in the adrenal medulla. Both of these neurotransmitters are released by the adrenal glands into the circulation after stimulation by sympathetic cholinergic preganglionic neurons.\n\n(Choices D and F) Histamine and orexin are produced in the posterior hypothalamus and play an important role in arousal and wakefulness.\n\n(Choices G and H) Oxytocin and vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) are hormones produced by the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary. Oxytocin promotes milk letdown and uterine contractions, whereas vasopressin causes vasoconstriction and free water reabsorption in the renal collecting ducts.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe locus ceruleus is a paired brainstem nucleus located in the posterior rostral pons near the lateral floor of the fourth ventricle. The locus ceruleus functions as the principal site for norepinephrine synthesis in the brain. It projects to virtually all parts of the central nervous system and helps control mood, arousal (reticular activating system), sleep-wake states, cognition, and autonomic function.",
    "zh": "该患者在脑桥的蓝斑（位于第四脑室外侧底附近后部吻侧脑桥）水平发生了高血压性出血。蓝斑是大脑中去甲肾上腺素合成的主要部位，并投射到中枢神经系统的几乎所有部位。它参与情绪、唤醒（网状激活系统）、睡眠-觉醒状态、认知和自主神经功能（例如，血压控制）的控制。蓝斑的异常激活与焦虑症（例如，惊恐发作）的发病机制有关。\n\n双侧脑桥出血患者通常表现为昏迷，这是由于网状激活系统的破坏所致。其他特征通常包括由于皮质脊髓束和皮质延髓束损伤引起的完全性瘫痪伴有伸展姿势，以及继发于下行交感神经束损伤的针尖样瞳孔。\n\n（选项A）多巴胺产生于中脑的腹侧被盖区和黑质致密部。大脑中的主要多巴胺能通路包括中脑边缘和中皮质通路（调节认知和行为）、黑质纹状体通路（调节随意运动的协调）和结节漏斗通路（抑制催乳素分泌）。\n\n（选项B）强啡肽是一种调节疼痛反应的阿片肽。它主要产生于导水管周围灰质、吻侧延髓腹侧和脊髓背角。\n\n（选项C）去甲肾上腺素主要在肾上腺髓质中转化为肾上腺素。这两种神经递质均由肾上腺在交感神经胆碱能节前神经元刺激后释放到循环中。\n\n（选项D和F）组胺和食欲素产生于下丘脑后部，并在唤醒和清醒中起重要作用。\n\n（选项G和H）催产素和加压素（抗利尿激素）是由下丘脑产生的激素，并从垂体后叶释放。催产素促进泌乳和子宫收缩，而加压素引起血管收缩和肾脏集合管中的自由水重吸收。\n\n教育目标：\n蓝斑是一个成对的脑干核，位于第四脑室外侧底附近后部吻侧脑桥。蓝斑是大脑中去甲肾上腺素合成的主要部位。它投射到中枢神经系统的几乎所有部位，并有助于控制情绪、唤醒（网状激活系统）、睡眠-觉醒状态、认知和自主神经功能。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the neuroanatomical localization of neurotransmitter synthesis and the clinical presentation of pontine hemorrhage. Specifically, it assesses knowledge of the role of the locus ceruleus in norepinephrine production and its involvement in arousal and autonomic function.\n\nTo solve this question, one must correlate the autopsy finding of disrupted pigmented neurons in the posterior rostral pons with the known functions and locations of neurotransmitter-producing nuclei. Understanding the clinical signs of pontine hemorrhage, such as coma, extensor posturing, and pinpoint pupils, is also crucial for contextualizing the pathology.",
