  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with abdominal pain has gross pathologic findings consistent with acute appendicitis. ACUTE appendicitis typically occurs in children and young adults and is often initiated by obstruction of the appendiceal lumen. The most common obstructing agents are fecaliths, hyperplastic lymphoid follicles (eg, following infection), tumors (eg, carcinoid), and nematodes.\n\nMucus accumulates in the lumen of the obstructed appendix, which causes increased pressure, appendiceal wall distension, and impaired venous outflow. The resulting ischemia and associated bacterial proliferation (Choice B) lead to inflammation of the appendiceal wall, causing edema (with further distension), serosal erythema, and purulent exudate. Necrosis of the wall with rupture may follow, and inflammatory fluid and bacterial contents may spill into the peritoneal cavity, causing peritonitis.\n\nPatients typically experience abdominal pain, which may migrate over time. Distension of the appendix triggers afferent pain fibers that enter at the T10 level in the spinal cord, producing vague, referred pain at the umbilicus. As the inflammatory reaction advances, the appendix irritates the parietal peritoneum, causing more severe somatic pain that shifts to the right lower quadrant.\n\n(Choices A and E) Both arterial spasm and venous thrombosis can cause mesenteric ischemia, which often presents with severe, diffuse abdominal pain. Gross examination of the affected bowel segment would show dusky red serosa, edema, and hemorrhagic mucosa.\n\n(Choice D) Meckel diverticula often contain ectopic gastric mucosa, which may lead to peptic ulceration of the surrounding small intestinal tissue and subsequent lower intestinal bleeding. Gross examination would show an intestinal outpouching within 2 feet of the ileocecal valve.\n\nEducational objective:\nObstruction of the appendiceal lumen (eg, fecalith, lymphoid hyperplasia) is frequently the inciting event in pathogenesis of acute appendicitis, which typically presents with periumbilical pain that shifts to the right lower quadrant. Gross pathologic examination often shows an edematous, erythematous appendix with purulent exudate.",
    "zh": "这位腹痛患者的病理学大体发现与急性阑尾炎一致。急性阑尾炎通常发生在儿童和年轻人中，通常由阑尾管腔阻塞引起。最常见的阻塞物是粪石、淋巴滤泡增生（例如，感染后）、肿瘤（例如，类癌）和线虫。\n\n黏液积聚在阻塞的阑尾管腔内，导致压力升高、阑尾壁扩张和静脉回流受损。由此产生的缺血和相关的细菌增殖（选项B）导致阑尾壁发炎，引起水肿（伴有进一步扩张）、浆膜红斑和脓性渗出物。随后可能发生壁坏死并破裂，炎症性液体和细菌内容物可能溢入腹腔，引起腹膜炎。\n\n患者通常会经历腹痛，随着时间的推移可能会转移。阑尾扩张会触发传入痛觉纤维，这些纤维进入脊髓的T10水平，产生模糊的、放射到脐部的疼痛。随着炎症反应的进展，阑尾刺激壁腹膜，引起更严重的躯体疼痛，并转移到右下象限。\n\n（选项 A 和 E）动脉痉挛和静脉血栓形成均可引起肠系膜缺血，这通常表现为严重的弥漫性腹痛。受影响的肠段的大体检查将显示暗红色浆膜、水肿和出血性黏膜。\n\n（选项 D）麦克尔憩室通常含有异位胃黏膜，这可能导致周围小肠组织的消化性溃疡，并导致随后的下消化道出血。大体检查将显示距离回盲瓣2英尺内的肠道外突。\n\n教育目标：\n阑尾管腔阻塞（例如，粪石、淋巴组织增生）通常是急性阑尾炎发病机制中的诱发事件，其通常表现为脐周疼痛，并转移到右下象限。大体病理检查通常显示水肿、红斑的阑尾伴有脓性渗出物。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of acute appendicitis, specifically the initiating factors and the progression of the disease. It also requires understanding of the clinical presentation of appendicitis, including the characteristic migration of pain.\n\nThe best approach is to consider the most common causes of appendicitis and how they relate to the patient's symptoms. Understanding the sequence of events from obstruction to inflammation and necrosis is crucial for selecting the correct answer.",
    "zh": "本题考察对急性阑尾炎病理生理学的了解，特别是诱发因素和疾病的进展。它还需要了解阑尾炎的临床表现，包括疼痛的特征性转移。\n\n最好的方法是考虑阑尾炎最常见的原因以及它们与患者症状的关系。了解从梗阻到炎症和坏死的事件顺序对于选择正确答案至关重要。"
