    "en": "A 4-year-old boy is brought in by his parents for evaluation of a fever that has persisted for the past 5 days. He has also been more irritable than usual and had 2 or 3 episodes of vomiting. The patient has no prior medical problems and takes no medications. He has received all recommended vaccinations. He traveled to China last year to visit his grandparents and cousins but has not traveled outside of the country this year. Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F). Physical examination shows bilateral conjunctival injection with no exudates. His tongue is bright red and lips are cracked. Nonpitting edema is present on his hands and feet. Which of the following complications is this patient at greatest risk for developing?",

    "en": "Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis of medium-sized arteries that affects young children (usually age <5 years). It occurs most commonly in patients of Asian ethnicity. The diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is based on a fever for ≥5 days plus 4 of the following findings:\n\n1.  Bilateral non-exudative conjunctival injection (erythema)\n2.  Cervical lymphadenopathy\n3.  Mucositis: Erythema of the palatine mucosa, fissured erythematous lips, \"strawberry\" tongue\n4.  Extremity changes: Edema of hands and feet, erythema of palms and soles, desquamation of the fingertips (periungual)\n5.  Rash: Polymorphous (usually urticarial) erythematous rash on the extremities that spreads centripetally to the trunk\n\nA serious complication of Kawasaki disease is coronary artery inflammation leading to the development of coronary artery aneurysms. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Dissecting aneurysms of the aorta are associated with long-standing hypertension and Marfan syndrome.\n\n(Choice C) Monocular blindness is a complication of temporal arteritis.\n\n(Choice D) Mononeuritis multiplex is a peripheral neuropathy of multiple individual nerves. It is associated with a variety of diseases, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) and polyarteritis nodosa.\n\n(Choice E) Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis can occur after group A streptococcal skin/throat infections. Although symptoms such as fever, \"strawberry\" tongue, and desquamation can occur in scarlet fever, this patient's bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, swelling of the hands and feet, and persistent high-grade fever are more suggestive of Kawasaki disease.\n\n(Choice F) Pulmonary cavities can occur following resolution of pulmonary tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, or sarcoidosis.\n\nEducational objective:\nKawasaki disease is a vasculitis of medium-sized arteries that presents with persistent fever for ≥5 days, bilateral conjunctivitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, and mucocutaneous involvement. Coronary artery aneurysms are a serious complication of Kawasaki disease. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "川崎病是一种影响幼儿（通常<5岁）的中型动脉血管炎。它最常见于亚裔患者。川崎病的诊断基于发烧≥5天，并伴有以下4项发现：\n\n1.  双侧非渗出性结膜充血（红斑）\n2.  颈部淋巴结病\n3.  黏膜炎：腭黏膜红斑、嘴唇干裂发红、“草莓舌”\n4.  四肢改变：手和脚水肿、手掌和足底红斑、指尖脱屑（甲周）\n5.  皮疹：四肢多形性（通常为荨麻疹样）红斑，向躯干中心扩散\n\n川崎病的严重并发症是冠状动脉炎症，导致冠状动脉瘤的发生。 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项A) 主动脉夹层与长期高血压和马凡综合征有关。\n\n(选项C) 单眼失明是颞动脉炎的并发症。\n\n(选项D) 多发性单神经炎是多个单独神经的周围神经病变。它与多种疾病相关，包括肉芽肿性多血管炎（韦格纳）和结节性多动脉炎。\n\n(选项E) 急性增生性肾小球肾炎可发生在A组链球菌皮肤/咽喉感染后。虽然猩红热中可能出现发烧、“草莓舌”和脱屑等症状，但该患者的双侧非渗出性结膜炎、手脚肿胀和持续性高烧更提示川崎病。\n\n(选项F) 肺空洞可在肺结核、组织胞浆菌病或结节病消退后发生。\n\n教育目标：\n川崎病是一种中型动脉血管炎，表现为持续发烧≥5天、双侧结膜炎、颈部淋巴结病和黏膜皮肤受累。冠状动脉瘤是川崎病的严重并发症。{{exhibit_2}}"
