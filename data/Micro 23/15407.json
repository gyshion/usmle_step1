    "en": "A 29-year-old man is hospitalized due to a flulike illness. He abruptly developed fever, rigors, malaise, headache, and myalgia 3 days ago. The patient has no prior health conditions and normally participates in multiple outdoor sporting activities each week. Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 124/84 mm Hg, and pulse is 110/min. Physical examination shows an ill-appearing man with bilateral conjunctival suffusion. Lung and heart sounds are normal. Abdominal examination reveals mild hepatosplenomegaly. Generalized lymphadenopathy is also present. Influenza antigen testing and blood cultures in routine growth media are negative. The patient subsequently develops progressive jaundice and renal failure. Further testing is diagnostic of an infection with a highly motile, corkscrew-shaped pathogen. This patient most likely acquired the infection via which of the following?",

    "en": "Leptospirosis is a widespread, zoonotic infection caused by several species of *Leptospira*, a thin, highly coiled, motile spirochete that infects wild (eg, rodents) and domestic (eg, dogs, cattle) animals. Infected animals harbor the organism in the proximal renal tubule and excrete it in urine. Transmission to humans primarily occurs during outdoor recreational (eg, kayaking, freshwater swimming) or occupational activities that exposes them to water contaminated with animal urine.\n\nMost cases of leptospirosis are mild or subclinical. However, some patients develop a flu-like illness (eg, fever, rigors, myalgia, headache), lymphadenopathy, or more severe end-organ disease such as renal failure or hepatic failure (eg, jaundice, hepatomegaly). Conjunctival suffusion, redness of the conjunctiva that resembles conjunctivitis but is noninflammatory, is an important diagnostic clue. Because spirochetes do not grow well on traditional culture media, initial blood cultures are often negative. However, specialized culture media can often identify the corkscrew-shaped organism.\n\n(Choice A) Bats can transmit rabies to humans via a bite wound. Manifestations typically begin with flulike symptoms and progress to fever, hydrophobia, pharyngeal spasms, coma, and death. Rabies is a cylindrical, enveloped RNA virus; it is not a motile, corkscrew-shaped organism.\n\n(Choice B) *Yersinia*, a bacteria transmitted by animal (eg, rodent) fleas, can cause bubonic plague, which typically presents with sudden-onset, flulike symptoms followed by intense pain and regional lymphadenopathy (eg, inguinal). *Yersinia* grows well on traditional culture media; it appears on Gram stain as a gram-negative coccobacillus.\n\n(Choice D) Lyme disease is a spirochetal, tick-borne illness that can cause chronic arthritis and neurologic manifestations (eg, meningitis, neuropathy); prominent hepatic dysfunction (eg, jaundice) and acute renal failure would not be expected. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is another tickborne illness that can present with flulike symptoms and conjunctivitis, however, it is caused by the gram-negative bacterium *Rickettsia rickettsii* (not a corkscrew-shaped spirochete).\n\n(Choice E) Tularemia is caused by the gram-negative bacterium *Francisella tularensis*, which frequently infects rabbits. Manifestations typically include flulike symptoms followed by lymphadenopathy and a papulo-ulcerative eschar at the site of inoculation.\n\nEducational objective:\nLeptospirosis is a zoonotic infection caused by the motile spirochete *Leptospira*. Transmission primarily occurs when humans come into contact with water contaminated with animal urine during outdoor recreational or occupational activities. Patients classically have a mild, self-limited, flulike illness but may develop more serious complications such as renal or hepatic failure.",
    "zh": "钩端螺旋体病是一种广泛存在的、人畜共患的感染，由多种钩端螺旋体（*Leptospira*）引起，钩端螺旋体是一种纤细、高度螺旋状、能活动的螺旋体，可感染野生（例如，啮齿动物）和家养（例如，狗、牛）动物。受感染的动物将该生物体储存在近端肾小管中，并将其排泄在尿液中。人与人之间的传播主要发生在户外休闲（例如，皮划艇、淡水游泳）或职业活动期间，这些活动使他们接触到被动物尿液污染的水。\n\n大多数钩端螺旋体病病例为轻度或亚临床。然而，一些患者会出现流感样疾病（例如，发热、寒战、肌痛、头痛）、淋巴结病，或更严重的终末器官疾病，如肾衰竭或肝衰竭（例如，黄疸、肝肿大）。结膜充血，结膜发红，类似于结膜炎，但非炎症性，是重要的诊断线索。由于螺旋体在传统培养基中生长不好，最初的血培养通常为阴性。然而，专门的培养基通常可以识别出螺旋状生物体。\n\n(选项A) 蝙蝠可以通过咬伤将狂犬病传播给人类。表现通常始于流感样症状，并进展为发热、恐水症、咽痉挛、昏迷和死亡。狂犬病是一种圆柱形的包膜 RNA 病毒；它不是一种能活动的螺旋状生物体。\n\n(选项B) *耶尔森菌*（*Yersinia*）是一种通过动物（例如，啮齿动物）跳蚤传播的细菌，可引起腺鼠疫，其典型表现为突发性流感样症状，然后是剧烈疼痛和区域性淋巴结病（例如，腹股沟）。*耶尔森菌*在传统培养基中生长良好；革兰染色显示为革兰阴性球杆菌。\n\n(选项D) 莱姆病是一种螺旋体病，蜱传疾病，可引起慢性关节炎和神经系统表现（例如，脑膜炎、神经病）；预计不会出现明显的肝功能障碍（例如，黄疸）和急性肾衰竭。落基山斑疹热是另一种蜱传疾病，可表现为流感样症状和结膜炎，然而，它是由革兰阴性细菌*立克次体立克次氏体*（不是螺旋状螺旋体）引起的。\n\n(选项E) 土拉热病是由革兰阴性细菌*土拉弗朗西斯菌*引起的，该细菌经常感染兔子。表现通常包括流感样症状，然后是淋巴结病和接种部位的丘疹溃疡性焦痂。\n\n教育目标：\n钩端螺旋体病是一种人畜共患感染，由能活动的螺旋体钩端螺旋体引起。传播主要发生在人类在户外休闲或职业活动期间接触被动物尿液污染的水时。患者通常有轻度的、自限性的、流感样疾病，但可能出现更严重的并发症，如肾衰竭或肝衰竭。"
