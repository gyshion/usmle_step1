    "en": "Persistent atrial fibrillation is usually managed with a rate-control strategy that focuses on maintaining an acceptable ventricular contraction rate during both rest (eg, <85/min) and moderate exercise (eg, <110-120/min) despite continued rapid and disorganized conduction of the atria. Pharmacologic agents that allow for rate control do so by slowing conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node via various mechanisms:\n\n*   Beta blockers (eg, atenolol, metoprolol) (Choice B) slow AV node conduction via blockade of sympathetic tone. This mechanism allows for effective rate control both during rest and exercise. For this reason, beta blockers are often the preferred agent for rate control of atrial fibrillation.\n*   Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) block AV nodal calcium channels to slow AV node conduction both at rest and during exercise. These drugs have similar rate control efficacy to that of beta blockers, although beta blockers are slightly superior at controlling heart rate during exercise.\n*   Digoxin slows AV node conduction via increased parasympathetic tone. This mechanism is effective at rest, when sympathetic tone is low, but it poorly controls ventricular rate during exercise, when high levels of sympathetic tone accelerate AV node conduction. For this reason, digoxin is often used only as an adjunctive agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation.\n\n(Choices A and D) Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine, nifedipine) and ACE inhibitors (eg, lisinopril) are vasodilators with no significant effect on the AV node. These drugs are not expected to slow heart rate either at rest or with exercise (ie, both resting and exercise curves are expected to closely match placebo).\n\nEducational objective:\nDigoxin slows atrioventricular node conduction by increasing parasympathetic tone. This mechanism is effective at controlling ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation at rest, but it poorly controls ventricular rate during exercise, when parasympathetic output is low relative to high levels of sympathetic tone. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "持续性房颤通常采用控制心率的策略进行管理，该策略侧重于在静息状态（例如，<85/min）和中等强度运动（例如，<110-120/min）期间维持可接受的室性收缩率，尽管心房持续快速和无序传导。允许控制心率的药物通过各种机制减缓通过房室 (AV) 结的传导：\n\n*   β 受体阻滞剂（例如，阿替洛尔、美托洛尔）（选项 B）通过阻断交感神经张力来减缓房室结传导。该机制允许在静息和运动期间有效控制心率。由于这个原因，β 受体阻滞剂通常是控制房颤心率的首选药物。\n*   非二氢吡啶类钙通道阻滞剂（例如，维拉帕米、地尔硫卓）阻断房室结钙通道，从而减缓静息和运动期间的房室结传导。这些药物的控制心率的疗效与β 受体阻滞剂相似，尽管β 受体阻滞剂在运动期间控制心率方面略胜一筹。\n*   地高辛通过增加副交感神经张力来减缓房室结传导。这种机制在静息状态下有效，此时交感神经张力较低，但在运动期间对心室率的控制不佳，此时高水平的交感神经张力会加速房室结传导。由于这个原因，地高辛通常仅用作房颤心率控制的辅助药物。\n\n（选项 A 和 D）二氢吡啶类钙通道阻滞剂（例如，氨氯地平、硝苯地平）和 ACE 抑制剂（例如，赖诺普利）是血管扩张剂，对房室结没有显着影响。预计这些药物既不能减缓静息心率，也不能减缓运动心率（即，预计静息和运动曲线都将与安慰剂密切匹配）。\n\n教育目标：\n地高辛通过增加副交感神经张力来减缓房室传导。这种机制在静息状态下控制房颤的心室率有效，但在运动期间对心室率的控制不佳，此时副交感神经输出相对于高水平的交感神经张力较低。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of different medications used for rate control in atrial fibrillation, specifically focusing on how they affect heart rate during rest and exercise. It requires understanding the role of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone in AV node conduction.\n\nTo solve this question, analyze the graphs to identify the drug that effectively slows heart rate at rest but has a diminished effect during exercise.
