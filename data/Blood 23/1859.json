    "en": "The presence of erythroid precursor cells in this patient's liver and spleen is indicative of EXTRAMEDULLARY HEMATOPOIESIS (EMH). EMH is characterized by the formation and maturation of blood cell precursors (ie, hematopoiesis) outside of the bone marrow, commonly in response to increased destruction of blood cells (eg, severe chronic hemolysis) {{exhibit_1}}.\n\nThroughout fetal development, hematopoiesis normally occurs in the yolk sac, followed by the liver, spleen, and bone marrow; after birth, the bone marrow is the primary hematopoietic site. However, in response to uncompensated, severe, chronic hemolytic anemia (eg, beta thalassemia, sickle cell disease), elevated erythropoietin can cause some hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to leave the bone marrow, migrate to other organs (often those involved in fetal hematopoiesis such as the liver and spleen), and initiate compensatory erythropoiesis.\n\nEMH can cause enlargement of the involved organs (eg, hepatosplenomegaly). In some patients, extensive splenic infiltration can impair the spleen's filtration and immune capabilities, increasing the risk for severe infections (eg, sepsis).\n\n(Choice B) Deficiency of cobalamin (vitamin B₁₂), which is required for DNA synthesis, results in megaloblastic anemia; it is not typically associated with EMH.\n\n(Choice C) Erythropoietin deficiency (eg, chronic kidney disease) is associated with anemia but does not cause EMH, since EMH is driven by increased levels of erythropoietin.\n\n(Choice D) Red blood cell transfusions limit EMH by reducing hypoxia and erythropoietin release. Patients with severe chronic hemolysis often receive regular transfusions to improve anemia and suppress EMH.\n\n(Choice E) Deficiency of iron, which is necessary for hemoglobin production, results in a relative depression of erythropoietic activity; it is not typically associated with EMH.\n\n(Choice F) Patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders may be susceptible to overwhelming sepsis, but these disorders are not frequently associated with severe chronic hemolysis, and EMH is not expected.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe presence of erythroid precursors in the liver and spleen is indicative of extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH), a condition characterized by erythropoietin-stimulated formation and maturation of blood cells outside of the bone marrow. EMH frequently occurs in response to severe chronic hemolytic anemia (eg, beta thalassemia).",
    "zh": "该患者肝脏和脾脏中红系祖细胞的存在表明存在髓外造血（EMH）。EMH的特征是血细胞前体（即造血）在骨髓外形成和成熟，通常是由于血细胞破坏增加（例如，严重的慢性溶血）{{exhibit_1}}。\n\n在整个胎儿发育过程中，造血通常发生在卵黄囊，然后是肝脏、脾脏和骨髓；出生后，骨髓是主要的造血部位。然而，为了应对未代偿的、严重的慢性溶血性贫血（例如，β地中海贫血、镰状细胞病），促红细胞生成素升高可导致一些造血干细胞和祖细胞离开骨髓，迁移到其他器官（通常是那些参与胎儿造血的器官，如肝脏和脾脏），并启动代偿性红细胞生成。\n\nEMH可导致受累器官增大（例如，肝脾肿大）。在某些患者中，广泛的脾脏浸润会损害脾脏的过滤和免疫能力，增加严重感染（例如，败血症）的风险。\n\n（选项 B）钴胺素（维生素 B₁₂）缺乏，而钴胺素是 DNA 合成所必需的，会导致巨幼红细胞性贫血；它通常与 EMH 无关。\n\n（选项 C）促红细胞生成素缺乏症（例如，慢性肾脏病）与贫血有关，但不会引起 EMH，因为 EMH 是由促红细胞生成素水平升高驱动的。\n\n（选项 D）输红细胞通过减少缺氧和促红细胞生成素的释放来限制 EMH。患有严重慢性溶血的患者通常接受定期输血以改善贫血并抑制 EMH。\n\n（选项 E）铁缺乏，铁是血红蛋白生成所必需的，导致红细胞生成活性相对下降；它通常与 EMH 无关。\n\n（选项 F）原发性免疫缺陷病患者可能容易发生压倒性败血症，但这些疾病并不常见与严重的慢性溶血相关，并且预计不会发生 EMH。\n\n教育目标：肝脏和脾脏中红系前体的存在表明存在髓外造血 (EMH)，这是一种以红细胞生成素刺激的骨髓外血细胞形成和成熟为特征的疾病。EMH 经常发生在对严重慢性溶血性贫血（例如，β地中海贫血）的反应中。"
