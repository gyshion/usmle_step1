On physical examination, the right leg is pale and cold to the touch with absent distal pulses. Cardiac auscultation reveals an irregular tachycardia, and ECG shows atrial fibrillation. Right lower extremity ultrasonography reveals an arterial embolus. Intravenous heparin infusion is initiated.

    "en": "Heparin is an endogenous anticoagulant that exerts its effect indirectly by binding to antithrombin III (AT), a serine protease inhibitor that irreversibly neutralizes clotting factors. Heparin binding alters the shape of AT, which converts it from a slow to rapid inactivator of clotting factors and increases its activity >1,000 fold.\n\nAlthough AT neutralizes a number of clotting factors in the intrinsic pathway, its anticoagulant effect primarily stems from the inactivation of factor Xa and thrombin. Therefore, patients who receive heparin products typically have the following coagulation changes:\n\n*   Prolonged thrombin time: Thrombin inactivation is strongest with unfractionated heparin infusion because the length of heparin chains in this formulation are longer, which inactivates thrombin more rapidly. Although low-molecular-weight heparin formulations contain shorter chain heparin molecules, they also inactivate thrombin but to a lesser extent.\n*   Decreased activity of factor Xa: All forms of heparin (eg, unfractionated, low molecular weight, fondaparinux) have strong activity against factor Xa. Antifactor Xa activity is usually monitored to determine when adequate anticoagulation is achieved.\n*   Prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT): Heparin primarily inhibits the intrinsic and final common clotting pathway; therefore, PTT is prolonged.\n\nUnlike heparin medications, which exert their anticoagulation effects broadly through the activation of AT, direct oral anticoagulants inhibit a single enzyme in the coagulation cascade, such as thrombin (eg, dabigatran) or factor Xa (eg, rivaroxaban).\n\nEducational objective:\nHeparin is an indirect anticoagulant that alters the shape of antithrombin (AT) III, thereby converting it from a slow to rapid inactivator of clotting factors. Because AT primarily neutralizes factor Xa and thrombin, patients on heparin have decreased factor Xa activity and prolonged thrombin time/partial thromboplastin time. In contrast, direct oral anticoagulants specifically target a single enzyme in the coagulation cascade, such as thrombin (eg, dabigatran) or factor Xa (eg, rivaroxaban).",
    "zh": "肝素是一种内源性抗凝剂，通过与抗凝血酶III（AT）结合间接发挥作用，抗凝血酶III是一种丝氨酸蛋白酶抑制剂，可不可逆地中和凝血因子。肝素结合改变了AT的形状，将其从缓慢灭活凝血因子转变为快速灭活凝血因子，并使其活性增加>1,000倍。\n\n尽管AT中和了内源性途径中的许多凝血因子，但其抗凝作用主要源于灭活因子Xa和凝血酶。因此，接受肝素产品的患者通常具有以下凝血变化：\n\n*   凝血酶时间延长：非级分肝素输注对凝血酶的灭活作用最强，因为该制剂中肝素链的长度较长，可更快地灭活凝血酶。虽然低分子量肝素制剂包含较短链的肝素分子，但它们也能灭活凝血酶，但程度较轻。\n*   因子Xa活性降低：所有形式的肝素（例如，非级分肝素、低分子量肝素、fondaparinux）都对因子Xa有很强的活性。通常监测抗因子Xa活性以确定何时达到足够的抗凝效果。\n*   部分凝血活酶时间（PTT）延长：肝素主要抑制内源性和共同凝血途径；因此，PTT延长。\n\n与肝素药物通过激活AT广泛发挥其抗凝作用不同，直接口服抗凝剂抑制凝血级联反应中的单一酶，例如凝血酶（例如，达比加群）或因子Xa（例如，利伐沙班）。\n\n教育目标：\n肝素是一种间接抗凝剂，可改变抗凝血酶（AT）III的形状，从而将其从缓慢灭活凝血因子转变为快速灭活凝血因子。由于AT主要中和因子Xa和凝血酶，接受肝素的患者因子Xa活性降低，凝血酶时间/部分凝血活酶时间延长。相比之下，直接口服抗凝剂专门靶向凝血级联反应中的单一酶，例如凝血酶（例如，达比加群）或因子Xa（例如，利伐沙班）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of heparin and its effects on coagulation parameters. It requires understanding how heparin affects thrombin time, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and factor Xa activity.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that heparin acts by binding to antithrombin III, which then inhibits thrombin and factor Xa. This leads to prolonged thrombin time and PTT, as well as decreased factor Xa activity.",
