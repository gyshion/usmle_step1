    "en": "A 34-year-old man comes to the office due to a painless penile ulcer, which he first noticed 3 days ago. He had unprotected sexual intercourse with a new partner a few weeks ago. The patient has no significant medical history and takes no medications. Temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F). Examination reveals a 2-cm nontender ulcer close to the glans penis with a raised, indurated margin and a clean base. There are no surrounding lesions or vesicles. There are several bilateral enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, which are firm, nontender, and rubbery. Physical examination is otherwise unremarkable. Rapid plasma reagin and HIV testing are negative. Infection with which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "zh": "一名34岁的男性因无痛性阴茎溃疡前来就诊，他于3天前首次注意到该症状。几周前，他与一位新的性伴侣发生了无保护措施的性行为。患者无重要病史，未服用任何药物。体温为37.1摄氏度（98.8华氏度）。检查显示，在阴茎头附近有一个2厘米的无压痛性溃疡，边缘隆起、坚硬，基底干净。周围无其他病灶或水疱。有几个双侧腹股沟淋巴结肿大，质地坚硬、无压痛、呈橡胶样。体格检查无其他异常。快速血浆反应素（RPR）和HIV检测均为阴性。以下哪种感染最有可能导致患者的症状？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "L serovars of *Chlamydia trachomatis* cause lymphogranuloma venereum. Although initial infection is associated with a painless genital ulcer, patients primarily present after the disease has spread to the regional lymph nodes, which results in painful lymphadenitis. This disease is very rare in the United States and occurs mostly in tropical and subtropical regions.\n\n*Haemophilus ducreyi* is a small gram-negative rod that causes chancroid, a sexually transmitted infection characterized by painful (not painless) genital ulcers with an erythematous base. Lesions typically begin as papules or pustules and evolve into an ulcer. More than one lesion is often present.\n\nHerpes simplex virus usually causes multiple, bilateral, painful, ulcerating lesions. Initial infections are frequently associated with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, headache, myalgia) and tender lymphadenopathy.\n\n*Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, a gram-negative diplococcus, is a leading cause of cervicitis, urethritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Infected patients usually have copious purulent discharge from the urethra; ulcerative genital lesions are not a feature of this organism.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients with early syphilis (eg, chancre) often have false-negative initial serologic testing. Direct visualization of the organism (*Treponema pallidum*) by dark-field microscopy or fluorescent antibody testing is the gold standard for diagnosis but is not widely available.",
    "zh": "沙眼衣原体L血清型引起性病性淋巴肉芽肿。虽然初始感染与无痛性生殖器溃疡相关，但患者主要在疾病扩散到区域淋巴结后就诊，导致淋巴结炎疼痛。这种疾病在美国非常罕见，主要发生在热带和亚热带地区。\n\n杜克雷嗜血杆菌是一种革兰氏阴性小杆菌，引起软下疳，这是一种性传播感染，其特征是疼痛（不是无痛）的生殖器溃疡，基底发红。病灶通常从丘疹或脓疱开始，发展成溃疡。通常存在多个病灶。\n\n单纯疱疹病毒通常引起多个、双侧、疼痛的溃疡性病灶。初次感染常伴有全身症状（如发烧、头痛、肌痛）和淋巴结压痛。\n\n淋病奈瑟菌，一种革兰氏阴性双球菌，是宫颈炎、尿道炎和盆腔炎的主要原因。受感染的患者通常有大量来自尿道的脓性分泌物；溃疡性生殖器病灶不是这种病原体的特征。\n\n教育目标：\n早期梅毒患者（例如，硬下疳）的初始血清学检测结果常常为假阴性。通过暗视野显微镜或荧光抗体检测直接观察病原体（梅毒螺旋体）是诊断的金标准，但尚未广泛使用。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to differentiate between causes of genital ulcers based on clinical presentation and initial laboratory findings. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing the characteristics of primary syphilis, including a painless ulcer and the possibility of false-negative serologic tests early in the disease.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key features of the patient's presentation: a painless, solitary genital ulcer with raised, indurated margins, and negative RPR and HIV tests. Consider the possibility of early syphilis despite the negative RPR and remember that dark-field microscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis.",
    "zh": "此问题测试根据临床表现和初步实验室检查区分生殖器溃疡病因的能力。它强调了识别原发性梅毒特征的重要性，包括无痛性溃疡以及疾病早期出现假阴性血清学检测的可能性。\n\n要解决此问题，请关注患者表现的关键特征：无痛性、单个生殖器溃疡，边缘隆起、坚硬，且RPR和HIV检测均为阴性。尽管RPR为阴性，仍要考虑早期梅毒的可能性，并记住暗视野显微镜是诊断的金标准。"
