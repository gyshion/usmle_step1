    "en": "A 3-year-old boy comes to the emergency department for evaluation of oral bleeding that began 1 hour after a tooth extraction. The bleeding has persisted for approximately 30 minutes despite application of constant pressure with gauze. He has no significant past medical or surgical history. The patient takes no medications, and his vaccinations are up to date. Blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg and pulse is 100/min. On physical examination, he has slow oozing of blood at the site of the dental extraction. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle who suffered from recurrent bleeding into his joints.",

    "en": "Abnormal bleeding following tooth extractions or other surgical procedures can signify a quantitative or qualitative platelet defect, coagulopathy, or abnormal fibrinolysis. This patient's male sex and family history of hemarthrosis in a maternal male relative suggest an X-linked coagulopathy such as hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) or hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency, Christmas disease). Hemophilia A and B are indistinguishable clinically as both demonstrate similar inheritance patterns. Both conditions are characterized by isolated prolongation of partial thromboplastin time due to defects in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT) are normal in patients with hemophilia.\n\nWhen endothelial injury occurs, platelets are activated and form a hemostatic plug first, followed by activation of the coagulation cascade. Patients with hemophilia have normal platelet function and can form a platelet plug, so bleeding after procedures can be delayed rather than immediate, in contrast to patients with platelet disorders. Manifestations include INTRAMUSCULAR HEMORRHAGE, HEMARTHROSIS, and prolonged or delayed bleeding after surgical procedures.\n\n(Choice A) Low haptoglobin is a sign of hemolytic anemia. Other associated findings include increased indirect bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase.\n\n(Choice B) This patient's hemoglobin level is likely normal since the oozing began recently and he has no history of chronic or recurrent bleeding.\n\n(Choice D) Signs of thrombocytopenia include easy bruisability, petechiae, and mucocutaneous hemorrhage (eg, recurrent epistaxis, gingival hemorrhage). The absence of petechiae and the delayed bleeding onset make a platelet disorder unlikely.\n\n(Choice E) The platelet function analyzer (PFA-100) test monitors the time needed for a patient's blood to form a platelet-based hemostatic plug in an in vitro environment. Abnormal results are seen in von Willebrand disease, inherited/acquired platelet dysfunction (eg, NSAID use), and thrombocytopenia.\n\n(Choice F) PT reflects the extrinsic clotting pathway, which involves tissue factor, fibrinogen, and factors II, V, VII, and X. Vitamin K deficiency and warfarin anticoagulant therapy are common causes of isolated PT prolongation as they lead to decreased activity of factors II, VII, IX, and X. Inherited deficiencies of these clotting factors are very rare.\n\n(Choice G) The TT measures the rate of conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. It is prolonged in patients with deficient or defective fibrinogen, which can be congenital or acquired. The most common cause of acquired dysfibrinogenemia is liver disease. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "拔牙或其他外科手术后的异常出血可能表明血小板数量或质量缺陷、凝血病或纤维蛋白溶解异常。该患者的男性性别和母亲一方的男性亲属有血症病史，提示 X 连锁凝血病，如血友病 A（凝血因子 VIII 缺乏症）或血友病 B（凝血因子 IX 缺乏症，圣诞病）。血友病 A 和 B 在临床上无法区分，因为两者表现出相似的遗传模式。这两种疾病的特征都是由于内在凝血途径的缺陷导致部分凝血活酶时间孤立性延长。血友病患者的凝血酶原时间 (PT) 和凝血酶时间 (TT) 正常。\n\n当内皮损伤发生时，血小板首先被激活并形成血栓，然后凝血级联反应被激活。血友病患者的血小板功能正常，可以形成血小板栓子，因此手术后的出血可能是延迟的而不是立即的，这与血小板疾病患者形成对比。表现包括肌肉内出血、血症和手术后出血时间延长或延迟。\n\n(选项 A) 触珠蛋白低是溶血性贫血的征兆。其他相关发现包括间接胆红素和乳酸脱氢酶升高。\n\n(选项 B) 该患者的血红蛋白水平可能正常，因为渗血最近才开始，而且他没有慢性或反复出血的病史。\n\n(选项 D) 血小板减少症的体征包括容易瘀伤、瘀点和粘膜皮肤出血（例如，反复性鼻衄、牙龈出血）。没有瘀点和出血延迟发生使得血小板疾病不太可能。\n\n(选项 E) 血小板功能分析仪 (PFA-100) 测试监测患者的血液在体外环境中形成基于血小板的血栓所需的时间。冯·维勒布兰德病、遗传/获得性血小板功能障碍（例如，使用非甾体抗炎药）和血小板减少症中可见异常结果。\n\n(选项 F) PT 反映外源性凝血途径，该途径涉及组织因子、纤维蛋白原和因子 II、V、VII 和 X。维生素 K 缺乏症和华法林抗凝治疗是 PT 孤立性延长的常见原因，因为它们会导致因子 II、VII、IX 和 X 的活性降低。这些凝血因子的遗传性缺乏症非常罕见。\n\n(选项 G) TT 测量纤维蛋白原转化为纤维蛋白的速度。它在纤维蛋白原缺乏或缺陷的患者中延长，这可以是先天性的或获得性的。获得性纤维蛋白原血症最常见的原因是肝病。{{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of inherited bleeding disorders, specifically hemophilia A and B, and their characteristic laboratory findings. It assesses the ability to recognize clinical clues suggesting an X-linked coagulopathy and to differentiate between intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathway abnormalities.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key features: male sex, family history of hemarthrosis, and delayed bleeding after a procedure. These point towards an X-linked bleeding disorder affecting the intrinsic coagulation pathway, making partial thromboplastin time the most likely abnormal result.",
