    "en": "An 8-month-old girl is brought to the office due to irritability and regression of motor skills. The patient's birth was unremarkable and her development had appeared normal, but she can no longer sit or roll over. Her parents have also noticed that she startles easily at loud noises. Head circumference measurement is consistent with macrocephaly. Bilateral funduscopic evaluation shows a bright red fovea centralis that is surrounded by a contrasting white macula. Peripheral vision is decreased. Abdominal examination is normal. Accumulation of which of the following metabolites is most likely present in this patient's tissues?",

    "en": "This patient's loss of motor skills, excessive startle response, and ophthalmic findings are most likely due to Tay-Sachs disease, an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder commonly seen in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Tay-Sachs is caused by β-hexosaminidase A deficiency, which results in lysosomal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside, a glycolipid component of cell membranes.\n\nInfants with Tay-Sachs disease typically develop normally for the first few months of life because the gradual buildup of ganglioside in neuronal lysosomes does not initially cause cellular dysfunction. However, by age 6 months the accumulation of glycolipids in the brain results in neuronal destruction. Subsequent neurologic degeneration typically manifests as developmental regression, as seen in this patient who is no longer able to sit or roll over.\n\nProgressive destruction of neurons in the brain and spinal cord leads to macrocephaly, seizures, and spasticity, with an exaggerated startle reflex with acoustic stimuli is the result of brainstem injury. Ganglioside accumulation also occurs in the retina but spares the fovea, which lacks ganglion cells. This leads to the characteristic funduscopic finding of a cherry-red macular spot, or a bright red unaffected fovea (which reflects the underlying choroid) that is accentuated due to surrounding opacification of the affected macula. Progressive neurodegeneration typically leads to death by age 2-5.\n\n(Choice A) Krabbe disease (galactocerebroside accumulation) is a lysosomal storage disease that causes progressive neurodegeneration. However, affected infants have optic atrophy, which is visualized as optic nerve pallor rather than a bright red fovea.\n\n(Choice B) Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder in which glucocerebroside accumulation results in bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone marrow suppression (eg, anemia, thrombocytopenia). This patient's normal abdominal examination and bright red fovea makes Gaucher disease unlikely.\n\n(Choice D) Mucopolysaccharidoses (eg, Hurler syndrome, Hunter syndrome) are lysosomal storage disorders characterized by the build-up of glycosaminoglycans such as heparan and dermatan sulfate. Patients have neurocognitive decline, but coarse facial features and hepatosplenomegaly are also expected. Although Hurler syndrome is associated with corneal clouding, neither mucopolysaccharidosis causes a cherry-red macula.\n\n(Choice E) Neurodegeneration and a cherry-red macular spot occur in Niemann-Pick disease, which is characterized by sphingomyelin accumulation. However, hepatosplenomegaly would be present and is not seen here.\n\nEducational objective:\nTay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by β-hexosaminidase A deficiency, which results in GM2 ganglioside accumulation in neuronal lysosomes. Key clinical features include progressive neurodegeneration (eg, developmental regression), an exaggerated startle reflex, and a cherry-red macular spot.",
    "zh": "该患者的运动技能丧失、过度惊吓反应和眼科表现最有可能源于泰-萨克斯病，这是一种常在亚什肯纳兹犹太人群中发现的常染色体隐性神经退行性疾病。泰-萨克斯病由β-己糖胺酶A缺乏症引起，导致溶酶体中GM2神经节苷脂（细胞膜的糖脂成分）的蓄积。\n\n患有泰-萨克斯病的婴儿通常在出生后的头几个月发育正常，因为神经元溶酶体中神经节苷脂的逐渐积累最初不会导致细胞功能障碍。然而，到6个月大时，脑中糖脂的积累会导致神经元破坏。随后的神经系统退行性变通常表现为发育倒退，正如本患者不再能坐或翻身。\n\n脑和脊髓中神经元的进行性破坏导致巨头畸形、癫痫发作和痉挛，对声音刺激的夸张惊吓反射是脑干损伤的结果。神经节苷脂的积累也发生在视网膜中，但保留中央凹，中央凹缺乏神经节细胞。这导致了特征性的眼底镜检查结果，即樱桃红色黄斑点，或不受影响的鲜红色中央凹（反映了潜在的脉络膜），由于受影响的黄斑周围浑浊而增强。进行性神经退行性变通常导致在2-5岁时死亡。\n\n(选项A) Krabbe病（半乳糖脑苷脂蓄积）是一种溶酶体贮积病，导致进行性神经退行性变。然而，受影响的婴儿有视神经萎缩，表现为视神经苍白而不是鲜红色中央凹。\n\n(选项B) Gaucher病是一种溶酶体贮积病，其中葡萄糖脑苷脂的蓄积导致骨痛、肝脾肿大和骨髓抑制（如贫血、血小板减少症）。该患者正常的腹部检查和鲜红色中央凹使Gaucher病不太可能。\n\n(选项D) 粘多糖贮积症（如Hurler综合征、Hunter综合征）是溶酶体贮积病，其特征是硫酸乙酰肝素和硫酸软骨素等糖胺聚糖的蓄积。患者出现神经认知能力下降，但也可能出现粗糙的面部特征和肝脾肿大。虽然Hurler综合征与角膜混浊有关，但两种粘多糖贮积症都不会引起樱桃红色黄斑。\n\n(选项E) 神经退行性变和樱桃红色黄斑点发生在尼曼-匹克病中，其特征是鞘磷脂的蓄积。然而，会存在肝脾肿大，但这里没有发现。\n\n教育目标：\n泰-萨克斯病是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，由β-己糖胺酶A缺乏症引起，导致GM2神经节苷脂在神经元溶酶体中蓄积。关键的临床特征包括进行性神经退行性变（如发育倒退）、夸张的惊吓反射和樱桃红色黄斑点。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of lysosomal storage diseases, specifically Tay-Sachs disease, and the characteristic clinical presentation and biochemical defect associated with it. It requires the integration of patient history, physical examination findings (including funduscopic exam), and knowledge of specific metabolite accumulation in various genetic disorders.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the constellation of symptoms suggestive of Tay-Sachs disease, including developmental regression, exaggerated startle reflex, macrocephaly, and the pathognomonic cherry-red macular spot. Based on this diagnosis, the underlying enzymatic deficiency (β-hexosaminidase A) and the accumulated substrate (GM2 ganglioside) can be deduced. Differential diagnoses should be considered and ruled out based on the provided clinical information.",
