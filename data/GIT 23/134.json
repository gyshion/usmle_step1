    "en": "A 38-year-old woman comes to the office due to intermittent abdominal pain and bloating since childhood. The patient does not drink milk because she does not like the taste and adds, \"I eat ice cream, cheese, and yogurt, but they upset my stomach sometimes.\" There is no associated weight loss, abnormal bleeding, or joint pain. Past medical history is otherwise unremarkable, though the patient has not seen a physician for many years. Vital signs and physical examination are normal. Laboratory studies show normal hemoglobin, iron, and vitamin D levels. A biopsy sample of this patient's small bowel mucosa would most likely show which of the following?",
    "zh": "一名38岁的女性因自童年以来间歇性腹痛和腹胀来诊。患者不喝牛奶，因为她不喜欢这种味道，并补充说：“我吃冰淇淋、奶酪和酸奶，但它们有时会让我胃不舒服。” 没有相关的体重减轻、异常出血或关节痛。既往病史无其他特殊情况，但患者多年未就医。生命体征和体格检查正常。实验室检查显示血红蛋白、铁和维生素D水平正常。该患者的小肠粘膜活检样本最有可能显示以下哪一项？"

    "en": "This patient, with gastrointestinal distress caused by consumption of lactose-containing dairy products, has typical features of LACTASE DEFICIENCY. Lactase deficiency results in incomplete hydrolysis of the disaccharide lactose into glucose and galactose. Undigested lactose in the bowel attracts excess water into the bowel lumen, leading to OSMOTIC DIARRHEA. However, light and electron microscopic examinations show NORMAL BOWEL MUCOSA {{exhibit_1}} in patients with primary lactase deficiency.\n\nPrimary lactase deficiency can be classified as congenital or acquired. The congenital variant is a rare autosomal recessive condition that presents with diarrhea after birth. The acquired variant is more common and typically arises from decreased production of lactase by mid childhood (lactase nonpersistence).\n\n(Choices A and E) SECONDRAY LACTASE DEFICIENCY is seen in disorders that cause injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa. Celiac disease is characterized by atrophy of the intestinal villi and is due to exposure to gluten-containing wheat products. Crohn disease causes noncaseating granulomas, and usually presents with abdominal pain and a variety of other gastrointestinal symptoms. Lactase deficiency due to these conditions is usually seen in association with other features of malabsorption (eg, iron deficiency, vitamin D deficiency).\n\n(Choice B) Diffuse inflammatory infiltrates with neutrophilic microabscesses in the crypt lumina can be seen in patients with ulcerative colitis, which usually presents with intermittent bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain.\n\n(Choice C) Distended macrophages in the intestinal lamina propria are a typical finding in Whipple disease, which characteristically presents with malabsorptive diarrhea, weight loss, and joint pain.\n\n(Choice D) Infiltration of the lamina propria with atypical lymphocytes would be expected in patients with gastrointestinal MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphomas. These often occur in the setting of chronic immune stimulation (eg, gastric MALT lymphoma with chronic Helicobacter pylori infection).",
    "zh": "该患者因摄入含乳糖的乳制品而引起胃肠道不适，具有乳糖酶缺乏症的典型特征。乳糖酶缺乏导致二糖乳糖未完全水解为葡萄糖和半乳糖。未消化的乳糖在肠道内吸引过多的水分进入肠腔，导致渗透性腹泻。然而，光镜和电镜检查显示，原发性乳糖酶缺乏症患者的肠粘膜正常 {{exhibit_1}}。\n\n原发性乳糖酶缺乏症可分为先天性和获得性。先天性变异是一种罕见的常染色体隐性遗传病，出生后出现腹泻。获得性变异更为常见，通常由儿童中期乳糖酶产生减少（乳糖酶不持久）引起。\n\n（选项A和E）继发性乳糖酶缺乏症见于引起胃肠粘膜损伤的疾病。乳糜泻的特征是肠绒毛萎缩，是由于接触含麸质的小麦制品所致。克罗恩病引起非干酪性肉芽肿，通常表现为腹痛和各种其他胃肠道症状。由于这些情况引起的乳糖酶缺乏症通常与其他吸收不良的特征相关（例如，缺铁、维生素D缺乏症）。\n\n（选项B）弥漫性炎性浸润伴隐窝腔内中性粒细胞性微脓肿可见于溃疡性结肠炎患者，通常表现为间歇性血性腹泻和腹痛。\n\n（选项C）肠固有层内巨噬细胞扩张是 Whipple 病的典型表现，其特征为吸收不良性腹泻、体重减轻和关节痛。\n\n（选项D）胃肠道 MALT（粘膜相关淋巴组织）淋巴瘤患者预计会出现固有层浸润非典型淋巴细胞。这些通常发生在慢性免疫刺激的情况下（例如，慢性幽门螺杆菌感染的胃 MALT 淋巴瘤）。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of lactose intolerance and its typical presentation, as well as the expected findings on small bowel biopsy in a patient with primary lactase deficiency.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the patient's symptoms are consistent with lactose intolerance and understanding that primary lactase deficiency does not cause structural changes in the small bowel mucosa.",
