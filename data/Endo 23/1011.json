    "en": "A 53-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine check-up. She has no current complaints. Her past medical history is significant for osteoarthritis of the right knee. Her mother suffered from hypertension and was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 68, from which she died 4 years later. Her father had diabetes mellitus and died in a motor vehicle accident at age 56. The patient's blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg and heart rate is 80/min. Physical examination is normal. Laboratory testing is significant for a fasting blood glucose level of 140 mg/dL on more than 2 occasions.",

    "en": "Several studies have shown that diabetes mellitus is one of the strongest risk factors for coronary heart disease. Cardiovascular mortality is increased by 2- to 4-fold in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and approximately 40% of patients die secondary to coronary heart disease. For a person with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the risk of dying from coronary heart disease exceeds the risk of dying from any of the other listed causes, even in the absence of other major risk factors for coronary heart disease.\n\n(Choice A) The risk of breast cancer is not increased in patients with diabetes mellitus. Although this patient has a family history of breast cancer, her risk is not significantly increased since her mother was at an advanced age when the cancer occurred.\n\n(Choice B) Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar coma are acute complications of untreated diabetes mellitus. Hyperosmolar coma is seen mainly with type 2 diabetes mellitus and is characterized by very high blood sugar levels without ketoacidosis. The mortality of hyperosmolar coma is higher than DKA; however, very few patients with diabetes die directly from DKA or hyperosmolar coma.\n\n(Choice D) Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), followed by hypertension. However, approximately 50% of patients with ESRD die due to cardiovascular disease, with infections being the next most common cause.\n\n(Choice E) The risk of stroke is increased in patients with diabetes mellitus. However, cerebrovascular accidents account for about 10% of total mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes versus 40% from coronary heart disease.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients with NONCORONARY ATHEROSCLEROTIC DISEASE, DIABETES MELLITUS, or CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE are at the same risk of cardiovascular events (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke) as patients with known coronary heart disease. CORONARY HEART DISEASE is the most common cause of death in patients with diabetes mellitus.",
    "zh": "多项研究表明，糖尿病是冠心病最强的危险因素之一。2型糖尿病患者的心血管死亡率增加2-4倍，大约40%的患者死于继发于冠心病。对于2型糖尿病患者而言，死于冠心病的风险超过死于其他任何所列原因的风险，即使没有其他主要的冠心病危险因素。\n\n(选项A) 糖尿病患者的乳腺癌风险并未增加。尽管该患者有乳腺癌家族史，但由于她的母亲在晚年才患上癌症，因此她的风险并未显着增加。\n\n(选项B) 糖尿病酮症酸中毒（DKA）和高渗性昏迷是未经治疗的糖尿病的急性并发症。高渗性昏迷主要见于2型糖尿病，其特征是血糖水平非常高，但没有酮症酸中毒。高渗性昏迷的死亡率高于DKA；然而，极少数糖尿病患者直接死于DKA或高渗性昏迷。\n\n(选项D) 糖尿病是终末期肾病（ESRD）的主要原因，其次是高血压。然而，大约50%的ESRD患者死于心血管疾病，感染是第二常见的死因。\n\n(选项E) 糖尿病患者的卒中风险增加。然而，脑血管意外约占2型糖尿病患者总死亡率的10%，而冠心病则占40%。\n\n教育目标：\n患有非冠状动脉粥样硬化性疾病、糖尿病或慢性肾脏疾病的患者，与已知患有冠心病的患者一样，都面临心血管事件（例如，心肌梗死、卒中）的风险。冠心病是糖尿病患者最常见的死亡原因。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the long-term complications of diabetes mellitus and the leading causes of mortality in diabetic patients. Specifically, it assesses the understanding that cardiovascular disease, particularly myocardial infarction, is the most common cause of death in individuals with diabetes.\n\nTo answer this question correctly, recognize that diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease. Consider the patient's risk factors and the prevalence of different causes of mortality in diabetic patients to determine the most likely cause of death.",
