    "en": "A 28-year-old woman comes to the gynecologist, who has provided routine care for the patient over the past 10 years. The patient has not menstruated for over 2 months and had a positive home pregnancy test last week. Although she hopes to have children in the future, she has been under a lot of stress lately and says that caring for a child is the last thing she needs right now. A pelvic ultrasound confirms an intrauterine pregnancy at 7 weeks gestation, and the patient requests that the gynecologist terminate the pregnancy as soon as possible. The gynecologist does not perform abortions on moral grounds but does have training in the procedure.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Conscientious refusal occurs when a provider refuses to provide care because doing so would conflict with the provider's beliefs. Although following one's conscience—the part of the self that judges actions as right or wrong—can lead to ethical and appropriate care, it also can conflict with professional obligations. Provider conscience does not take precedence over other ethical principles (eg, autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence). As with any procedure or treatment, the physician should have a neutral discussion regarding the procedure and alternatives. The physician should be nonjudgmental, refrain from imposing moral values, and convey respect for the patient's autonomy. If the patient decides to undergo the procedure after neutral education, she should be provided with resources that will assist in obtaining the desired service. Providers who are unable to provide care in good conscience are professionally and ethically obligated to refer patients in a timely fashion to other providers who can provide care.\n\n(Choices A and D) The physician is not required to perform the procedure but is obligated to provide resources to help the patient find another provider who will perform it in a timely manner to respect the patient's autonomy.\n\n(Choice B) Encouraging the patient to reconsider her decision is inappropriate because it imposes the physician's own judgment and values. Discussing age-related infertility risks in this situation can inadvertently place guilt or shame on the patient and should be avoided.\n\n(Choice C) Encouraging the patient to take additional time to make a decision is not advisable because this could place her past her first trimester and increase complexity/risk to the procedure.\n\nEducational objective:\nConscientious refusal of treatment occurs when a provider refuses to provide care due to moral conflict. Providers who cannot, in good conscience, provide treatment that a patient requests, are obligated to refer the patient in a timely fashion to another provider who can. This respects the patient's autonomy.",
    "zh": "良心拒诊是指当医疗提供者拒绝提供护理，因为这样做会与其自身的信仰相冲突。虽然遵循一个人的良心——即判断行为对错的自我部分——可以带来合乎伦理和适当的护理，但它也可能与专业义务相冲突。医疗提供者的良心并不优先于其他伦理原则（例如，自主性、公正性、行善、不作恶）。与任何程序或治疗一样，医生应就该程序和替代方案进行中立的讨论。医生应保持不带评判性，避免强加道德价值观，并传达对患者自主权的尊重。如果患者在中立教育后决定接受该程序，应向其提供资源，以协助其获得所需服务。如果医疗提供者无法以良心提供护理，则在专业和伦理上，有义务及时将患者转诊给可以提供护理的其他提供者。\n\n（选项A和D）医生无需进行该程序，但有义务提供资源，以帮助患者找到另一位可以及时执行该程序的提供者，以尊重患者的自主权。\n\n（选项B）鼓励患者重新考虑她的决定是不合适的，因为它强加了医生的个人判断和价值观。在这种情况下讨论与年龄相关的生育能力下降的风险可能会无意中给患者带来内疚感或羞耻感，应避免。\n\n（选项C）鼓励患者花更多时间做出决定是不可取的，因为这可能导致她超过妊娠早期，并增加该程序的复杂性和风险。\n\n教育目标：\n当医疗提供者由于道德冲突而拒绝提供护理时，就会发生良心拒诊。如果医疗提供者不能以良心提供患者要求的治疗，则有义务及时将患者转诊给可以提供治疗的另一位提供者。这尊重了患者的自主权。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ethical principle of conscientious refusal and the physician's obligation to respect patient autonomy while navigating personal moral objections to providing certain medical services. It requires understanding the appropriate steps a physician should take when faced with a conflict between their personal beliefs and a patient's request for care.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the option that respects the patient's autonomy and provides access to the requested service without forcing the physician to violate their conscience. Recognizing the ethical obligation to refer the patient to another provider is key to selecting the correct answer.",
    "zh": "本题考察了良心拒诊的伦理原则，以及医生在处理个人道德异议的同时，尊重患者自主权的义务。它要求理解当医生面临个人信仰与患者护理请求之间的冲突时，应采取的适当步骤。\n\n最佳方法是确定尊重患者自主权并提供获得所需服务的途径，而不会迫使医生违反其良心的选项。认识到将患者转诊给另一位提供者的伦理义务是选择正确答案的关键。"
