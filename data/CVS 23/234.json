    "en": "A 33-year-old woman who recently immigrated to the United States is brought to the emergency department with severe shortness of breath and hemoptysis. Physical examination reveals a diastolic murmur. Chest x-ray shows severe pulmonary vascular congestion and edema. She is admitted to the hospital, treated with diuretics, and begins to feel better. However, during her hospitalization, she develops right-sided hemiparesis. Which of the following additional findings in this patient would be most suggestive of combined disease involving the mitral and aortic valves rather than exclusive mitral involvement?",

    "en": "This patient's physical examination findings are suggestive of MITRAL STENOSIS (MS). In isolated MS, cardiac and pulmonary pressures proximal to the stenotic mitral valve are markedly elevated. However, diastolic pressure in the left ventricle (LV) is usually near normal or even decreased with severe stenosis. Increased LV diastolic pressure in a patient with MS suggests concomitant aortic valve dysfunction. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nRheumatic heart disease almost always affects the mitral valve, but both the mitral and aortic valves are affected in about 25% of cases. Aortic valve involvement typically involves combined aortic stenosis and regurgitation, both of which can increase LV diastolic pressure. Rheumatic deformation of the aortic valve can also predispose to infective endocarditis even when the valve is functionally normal. This patient's right-sided hemiparesis is most likely due to embolism, which could have originated from an atrial mural thrombus secondary to atrial dilation from MS or an endocarditis-related valvular vegetation (less likely).\n\n(Choices B and D) Severe, isolated MS can cause increased pulmonary artery pressure (pulmonary hypertension) via backward transmission of elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Longstanding pulmonary hypertension can result in reduced pulmonary vascular compliance due to endothelial remodelling and capillary obliteration.\n\n(Choice C) Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (an estimate of left atrial pressure) will increase with any significant left-sided valvular pathology (ie, both isolated MS and combined aortic and mitral valve disease).\n\n(Choices E and F) Right ventricular dilatation can occur in MS when the resulting pulmonary hypertension is severe enough to cause right heart failure. Tricuspid regurgitation can occur as a complication of right ventricular dilatation.\n\nEducational objective: Isolated mitral stenosis causes elevated upstream pressures in the left atrium and pulmonary veins and arteries. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) is normal or decreased due to obstruction of blood flow through the stenotic valve. An elevated LVEDP suggests additional downstream pathology (eg, aortic valve disease, left ventricular failure).",
    "zh": "该患者的体格检查结果提示二尖瓣狭窄 (MS)。在单纯 MS 中，狭窄二尖瓣近端的血流动力学压力和肺动脉压力显著升高。然而，左心室 (LV) 的舒张末期压力通常接近正常，甚至在严重狭窄时会降低。MS 患者左心室舒张末期压力升高提示合并主动脉瓣功能障碍。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n风湿性心脏病几乎总是影响二尖瓣，但在大约 25% 的病例中，二尖瓣和主动脉瓣都会受到影响。主动脉瓣受累通常涉及主动脉瓣狭窄和反流，两者都会增加左心室舒张末期压力。风湿性主动脉瓣变形也可能易患感染性心内膜炎，即使瓣膜功能正常。该患者的右侧偏瘫最可能由栓塞引起，其可能起源于二尖瓣狭窄引起的房室扩张或心内膜炎相关的心瓣赘生物（可能性较小）。\n\n(选项 B 和 D) 严重的、孤立的 MS 可通过肺毛细血管楔压升高的逆向传播引起肺动脉压力升高 (肺动脉高压)。长期的肺动脉高压可由于内皮重塑和毛细血管闭塞导致肺血管顺应性降低。\n\n(选项 C) 肺毛细血管楔压（左心房压力的估计值）将随着任何显著的左侧瓣膜病变（即，孤立的 MS 和联合的主动脉瓣和二尖瓣疾病）而增加。\n\n(选项 E 和 F) 当 MS 导致肺动脉高压严重到足以引起右心衰竭时，可能会发生右心室扩张。三尖瓣反流可作为右心室扩张的并发症。\n\n教育目的：孤立性二尖瓣狭窄导致左心房、肺静脉和肺动脉上游压力升高。由于血流通过狭窄瓣膜受阻，左心室舒张末期压力 (LVEDP) 正常或降低。LVEDP 升高提示额外的下游病理（如主动脉瓣疾病、左心室衰竭）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to differentiate between isolated mitral stenosis and combined mitral and aortic valve disease based on hemodynamic parameters. It requires understanding the pressure changes associated with each condition.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that isolated mitral stenosis typically results in normal or decreased left ventricular diastolic pressure. An elevated left ventricular diastolic pressure in the setting of mitral stenosis suggests additional pathology, such as aortic valve disease.",
    "zh": "本题考察根据血流动力学参数区分孤立性二尖瓣狭窄和联合二尖瓣和主动脉瓣疾病的能力。它要求了解与每种情况相关的压力变化。\n\n解决此问题的关键在于认识到孤立性二尖瓣狭窄通常导致左心室舒张末期压力正常或降低。在二尖瓣狭窄的情况下，左心室舒张末期压力升高提示存在其他病理，如主动脉瓣疾病。"
