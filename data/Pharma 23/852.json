    "en": "Drug distribution is not uniform; the rate at which drugs are delivered to target tissues is dependent on several factors, such as regional blood flow and drug characteristics. The pharmacokinetic profile of highly lipophilic anesthetic drugs, such as propofol, can be predicted using a MULTI-COMPARTMENT MODEL of distribution. Following administration of a single intravenous bolus, drug levels are high in the CENTRAL COMPARTMENT (ie, plasma). However, the drug is quickly distributed to the WELL-PERFUSED PERIPHERAL COMPARTMENT (eg, brain, liver, kidneys, lungs) due to the increased lipophilicity of the tissues compared to the blood. Over time, drug REDISTRIBUTION will occur through the central compartment into the POORLY-PERFUSED PERIPHERAL COMPARTMENT (eg, skeletal muscle, fat, bone), which has the highest volume of distribution for lipophilic agents. Redistribution occurs rapidly with highly lipophilic drugs and is responsible for the short duration of action seen with commonly used anesthetics such as propofol.\n\n(Choices A, B, C, and D) These organs have relatively high blood flow and are considered part of the well-perfused peripheral compartment. They will rapidly take up drugs from the central compartment and are visualized as the dashed line on the above graph.\n\nEDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVE:\nFollowing intravenous administration, a highly lipophilic drug will be rapidly distributed to organs with high blood flow (eg, brain, liver, kidneys, lungs). The drug is then redistributed to tissues with relatively lower blood flow (eg, skeletal muscle, fat, bone). This accounts for the short duration of action of many commonly used anesthetics, such as propofol.",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of drug distribution kinetics, specifically the multi-compartment model and the concept of redistribution for lipophilic drugs like propofol. It assesses the ability to interpret drug concentration-time curves in different tissues based on their perfusion and volume of distribution.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recognize that the red line, showing a slower rise and slower fall in drug concentration compared to the initial rapid decline in blood, represents a tissue with lower perfusion but a larger volume of distribution. This pattern is characteristic of redistribution into poorly perfused tissues after initial distribution to well-perfused organs.",
    "zh": "此问题测试对药物分布动力学的理解，特别是多室模型以及丙泊酚等亲脂性药物的再分布概念。它评估了根据不同组织的灌注和分布容积来解释不同组织中药物浓度-时间曲线的能力。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须认识到红线，与血液中的初始快速下降相比，红线显示药物浓度上升较慢，下降也较慢，代表血流灌注较低但分布容积较大的组织。这种模式是药物在初始分布到血流灌注良好的器官后，重新分布到血流灌注不良的组织的特征。"
