    "en": "A 6-day-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to inability to feed for 12 hours. The parents report that he has been unable to open his mouth and has had clenched hands all day. The neonate was delivered at home by the grandmother. After the umbilical cord was cut with a kitchen knife, the parents rubbed a coin on the umbilical stump to promote wealth during the child's life as is customary in their culture. The mother did not undergo prenatal care but says the pregnancy was uncomplicated. Physical examination shows increased muscle tone throughout, arching of the back, and dorsiflexed feet. In addition to hygienic umbilical cord care, which of the following interventions would have most likely prevented this neonate's condition?",

    "en": "Prevention of neonatal tetanus is achieved primarily by vaccination of the mother during pregnancy with an inactivated tetanus toxin (tetanus toxoid) as part of the tetanus-diphtheria (Td) or tetanus-reduced diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. An appropriately vaccinated woman provides transplacental IgG to the fetus, which decreases the incidence of neonatal tetanus by approximately 95%.\n\n(Choice A) Secretory IgA found in breast milk helps prevent respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in the neonate by providing mucosal immune support. However, adequate protection against neonatal tetanus requires the presence of toxin-neutralizing, circulating IgG antibodies that are obtained transplacentally.\n\n(Choices B and C) Treatment of tetanus, including neonatal tetanus, involves the use of antibiotics to kill C tetani and administration of tetanus immunoglobulin to neutralize unbound toxins. However, these agents are not used for tetanus prevention.\n\n(Choice E) The tetanus vaccine is not given at birth because the neonatal immune system is immature and unable to mount a proper memory immune response against the tetanus toxoid. The first dose of the Tdap series is commonly administered at age 2 months.\n\nEducational objective:\nRisk for neonatal tetanus is reduced substantially by hygienic umbilical cord care and vaccination of the mother during pregnancy. Mothers who have been vaccinated provide passive immunity to the fetus via transplacental IgG, which protects the neonate until active immunization (vaccination) at approximately age 2 months.",
    "zh": "新生儿破伤风的预防主要是通过在孕期为母亲接种灭活的破伤风毒素（破伤风类毒素）来实现，作为破伤风-白喉 (Td) 或破伤风-减毒白喉-无细胞百日咳 (Tdap) 疫苗的一部分。接种了适当疫苗的女性会为胎儿提供经胎盘 IgG，这可将新生儿破伤风的发病率降低约 95%。\n\n（选项 A）母乳中发现的分泌型 IgA 通过提供粘膜免疫支持来帮助预防新生儿的呼吸道和胃肠道感染。然而，充分预防新生儿破伤风需要存在中和毒素的循环 IgG 抗体，这些抗体是通过胎盘获得的。\n\n（选项 B 和 C）破伤风（包括新生儿破伤风）的治疗包括使用抗生素杀死 C tetani 和使用破伤风免疫球蛋白来中和未结合的毒素。然而，这些药物不用于预防破伤风。\n\n（选项 E）破伤风疫苗不在出生时接种，因为新生儿的免疫系统尚未成熟，无法对破伤风类毒素产生适当的记忆免疫反应。Tdap 系列的第一剂通常在 2 个月大时给药。\n\n教育目标：\n通过卫生的脐带护理和孕期母亲接种疫苗，可以大大降低新生儿破伤风的风险。接种疫苗的母亲通过经胎盘 IgG 为胎儿提供被动免疫，保护新生儿直到大约 2 个月大时进行主动免疫（疫苗接种）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of neonatal tetanus prevention, specifically the role of maternal vaccination in providing passive immunity to the fetus. It also assesses understanding of the pathophysiology of neonatal tetanus and the limitations of other interventions like breastfeeding, antibiotics, and neonatal vaccination.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the risk factors for neonatal tetanus (unhygienic delivery, lack of prenatal care) and identify the most effective preventive measure (maternal vaccination). Eliminate options that are not directly related to tetanus prevention or are not appropriate in the neonatal period.",
