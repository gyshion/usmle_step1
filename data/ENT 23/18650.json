    "en": "A 68-year-old man with a long history of using chewing tobacco comes to the office for follow up of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity. A month ago, the patient was diagnosed with SCC of the left lateral tongue. He underwent resection, the surgical specimen showed clear margins, and he started additional treatment. The patient recently noticed a second ulcerative lesion on the right lateral tongue. Biopsy is performed and it also shows SCC.",

    "en": "This patient with mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has developed a second primary tumor, which is common with HNSCC due to field cancerization.\n\nField cancerization describes a large area of cells within a field (eg, upper aerodigestive tract) that are \"primed\" to develop cancer because of widespread exposure to mutagens (eg, tobacco). Mutations that affect many similar cells can increase the likelihood of developing multiple primary malignancies, analogous to germline mutations in tumor suppressor genes (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 in breast and ovarian cancer). Field cancerization likely underlies the development of many common cancers, including:\n\n*   HNSCC due to mucosal exposure to tobacco carcinogens\n*   Basal cell carcinoma of the skin due to skin exposure to ultraviolet light\n*   Colorectal carcinoma due to epithelial exposure to dietary carcinogens\n\nEven with adequate treatment of a malignancy, the areas affected by field cancerization remain at higher risk of developing multiple primary malignancies, as seen in this patient. Therefore, patients diagnosed with any of these cancers require comprehensive evaluation and continued surveillance of the at-risk area (eg, colonoscopy, comprehensive skin examination, panendoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract).\n\n(Choice A) Chemotherapy can induce secondary malignancies, most commonly leukemia and lymphoma, in cancer survivors. In contrast to the tumors in this patient, secondary malignancies are seen years or even decades later.\n\n(Choices C and F) Most carcinomas, including HNSCC, spread via the lymphatic system, leading to metastases in the regional (eg, ipsilateral anterior neck) lymph nodes. However, it is unlikely for the carcinoma to spread back up to a contralateral epithelial site. Hematogenous spread is less common with carcinomas and typically results in metastases to distant sites.\n\n(Choice D) Certain anatomic sites (eg, eyes, testes) display inherent immune privilege, in which foreign grafts or cancers that would otherwise induce immunologic rejection are tolerated. Cancers may establish local sites of immune privilege to evade destruction, but this does not cause new tumor formation.\n\n(Choice E) Cancer treatment (eg, chemotherapy, radiation therapy) can result in impaired wound healing, which can result in acutely ulcerative oral lesions due to mucositis. However, these lesions would not be malignant.\n\nEducational objective:\nField cancerization can occur when a large area of cells is exposed to carcinogens that induce mutations, leading to a higher risk of forming cancers.",
    "zh": "这位患有粘膜头颈部鳞状细胞癌 (HNSCC) 的患者发展了第二个原发性肿瘤，这在 HNSCC 中很常见，原因是原位癌变。\n\n原位癌变描述了在一个区域（例如，上呼吸消化道）内的大片细胞，由于广泛暴露于诱变剂（例如，烟草），这些细胞“已准备好”发展为癌症。影响许多相似细胞的突变会增加发展多种原发性恶性肿瘤的可能性，类似于抑癌基因中的种系突变（例如，乳腺癌和卵巢癌中的 BRCA1 或 BRCA2）。原位癌变可能是许多常见癌症发展的基础，包括：\n\n*   由于粘膜暴露于烟草致癌物而引起的 HNSCC\n*   由于皮肤暴露于紫外线而引起的皮肤基底细胞癌\n*   由于上皮暴露于膳食致癌物而引起的结直肠癌\n\n即使对恶性肿瘤进行充分的治疗，受原位癌变影响的区域仍面临发展多种原发性恶性肿瘤的较高风险，正如在本患者中看到的那样。因此，诊断患有任何这些癌症的患者都需要对高危区域进行全面评估和持续监测（例如，结肠镜检查、全面皮肤检查、上呼吸消化道的泛内镜检查）。\n\n（选项 A）化疗可诱导癌症幸存者的继发性恶性肿瘤，最常见的是白血病和淋巴瘤。与本患者的肿瘤相比，继发性恶性肿瘤会在数年甚至数十年后出现。\n\n（选项 C 和 F）大多数癌，包括 HNSCC，通过淋巴系统扩散，导致区域性（例如，同侧前颈）淋巴结转移。然而，癌逆向扩散到对侧上皮部位的可能性很小。血行播散在癌中较少见，通常会导致转移到远处部位。\n\n（选项 D）某些解剖部位（例如，眼睛、睾丸）表现出固有的免疫豁免，其中原本会诱导免疫排斥的异体移植或癌症可被耐受。癌症可能会建立局部免疫豁免位点以逃避破坏，但这不会导致新的肿瘤形成。\n\n（选项 E）癌症治疗（例如，化疗、放疗）可导致伤口愈合受损，这可能导致由于粘膜炎引起的急性溃疡性口腔病变。然而，这些病变不会是恶性的。\n\n教育目标：\n当大片细胞暴露于诱导突变的致癌物时，可能发生原位癌变，从而导致形成癌症的风险更高。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of field cancerization, a process where prolonged exposure to carcinogens leads to multiple primary malignancies in a specific area. It also tests the understanding of other mechanisms of cancer spread and secondary malignancy development.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's history of chewing tobacco and the development of multiple SCCs in the oral cavity. Consider the concept of field cancerization as the most likely mechanism for the development of multiple primary tumors in the same area exposed to carcinogens.",
