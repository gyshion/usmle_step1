    "en": "A 21-year-old woman comes to the office due to a long history of episodic headaches, dizziness, and gait imbalance. The headaches are located in the occipital region, are characterized as dull, and last for several hours. Physical examination reveals gait ataxia but no focal weakness or sensory loss. MRI of the brain shows low-lying cerebellar tonsils extending below the plane of the foramen magnum into the vertebral canal.",
    "zh": "一名21岁的女性因长期反复发作的头痛、头晕和步态不稳前来就诊。头痛位于枕部，呈钝痛，持续数小时。体格检查显示步态共济失调，但无局灶性无力或感觉丧失。脑部MRI显示小脑扁桃体下垂，延伸至枕骨大孔平面以下进入椎管。"

    "en": "Chiari malformations are a group of CONGENITAL disorders caused by underdevelopment of the posterior fossa. The small size of the fossa causes parts of the CEREBELLUM and medulla to herniate through the FORAMEN MAGNUM. There are 2 types of Chiari malformations. Chiari type I is the most common and benign, and is characterized by low-lying cerebellar tonsils that extend below the foramen magnum into the vertebral canal. Patients typically present during adolescence/adulthood with paroxysmal occipital headaches (due to meningeal irritation) and cerebellar dysfunction (eg, dizziness, ataxia) due to compression of the cerebellar tonsils.\n\nChiari type II, Arnold-Chiari malformation, is more severe and typically becomes evident during the neonatal period. It is characterized by downward displacement of the cerebellum (vermis, tonsils) and medulla through the foramen magnum. Non-communicating hydrocephalus almost always occurs due to aqueductal stenosis. Compression of the medulla may result in dysphagia, stridor, and apnea. Patients also often have an associated lumbar myelomeningocele, which can cause lower limb paralysis.\n\n(Choice A) Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system that typically presents in young adult women with neurologic deficits disseminated in space and time. Neuroimaging typically shows periventricular white matter lesions.\n\n(Choice C) Friedrich ataxia is an autosomal recessive trinucleotide repeat disorder that presents during childhood with ataxia, loss of vibration/proprioception sense, and skeletal abnormalities (eg, kyphoscoliosis, pes cavus).\n\n(Choice D) Cerebellar neoplasms (eg, medulloblastoma, pilocytic astrocytoma) often present in children with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (eg, headache, vomiting) and cerebellar dysfunction. However, the absence of a cerebellar tumor on neuroimaging makes this unlikely.\n\n(Choice E) Traumatic brain injury can cause headache and neurologic impairment; however, this patient's MRI findings are highly characteristic of Chiari type I malformation.\n\n(Choice F) Cerebellar stroke may present with acute-onset occipital headache, dizziness, and ataxia. However, this patient's young age, absence of cardiovascular risk factors, and long history of episodic symptoms make this less likely.\n\nEducational objective:\nChiari malformations are congenital disorders that result from underdevelopment of the posterior fossa, causing parts of the cerebellum and medulla to herniate through the foramen magnum. Chiari type I is relatively benign and presents during adulthood with occipital headache and cerebellar dysfunction. Chiari type II is a more severe form that affects neonates and is often associated with lumbar myelomeningocele and hydrocephalus.",
    "zh": "Chiari畸形是一组由后颅窝发育不全引起的先天性疾病。后颅窝体积小导致小脑和延髓部分通过枕骨大孔疝出。Chiari畸形分为2型。Chiari I型最常见，且为良性，其特征是小脑扁桃体下垂，延伸至枕骨大孔以下进入椎管。患者通常在青春期/成年期出现阵发性枕部头痛（由于脑膜刺激）和小脑功能障碍（例如，头晕、共济失调），这是由于小脑扁桃体受压所致。\n\nChiari II型，Arnold-Chiari畸形，更为严重，通常在新生儿期显现。其特征是小脑（蚓部、扁桃体）和延髓向下移位通过枕骨大孔。由于导水管狭窄，几乎总是发生非交通性脑积水。延髓受压可能导致吞咽困难、喘鸣和呼吸暂停。患者也常伴有腰骶脊髓脊膜膨出，可引起下肢瘫痪。\n\n(选项A) 多发性硬化症是一种中枢神经系统自身免疫性脱髓鞘疾病，通常在年轻女性中出现，其神经功能缺损在时间和空间上弥漫分布。神经影像学通常显示脑室周围白质病变。\n\n(选项C) Friedrich共济失调是一种常染色体隐性三核苷酸重复序列疾病，在儿童期出现共济失调、振动/本体感觉丧失和骨骼异常（例如，脊柱侧弯、弓形足）。\n\n(选项D) 小脑肿瘤（例如，髓母细胞瘤、毛细胞星形细胞瘤）常在儿童中表现为颅内压增高（例如，头痛、呕吐）和小脑功能障碍。然而，神经影像学上没有小脑肿瘤使这种情况不太可能。\n\n(选项E) 脑外伤可引起头痛和神经功能障碍；然而，该患者的MRI结果高度符合Chiari I型畸形。\n\n(选项F) 小脑卒中可能表现为急骤起病的枕部头痛、头晕和共济失调。然而，该患者的年轻、无心血管危险因素以及长期发作性症状的病史使其可能性较低。\n\n教育目标：\nChiari畸形是由于后颅窝发育不全导致小脑和延髓部分通过枕骨大孔疝出的先天性疾病。Chiari I型相对良性，在成年期出现枕部头痛和小脑功能障碍。Chiari II型是一种更严重的类型，影响新生儿，并且常与腰骶脊髓脊膜膨出和脑积水有关。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of Chiari malformations, specifically Chiari type I, including their etiology, characteristic imaging findings, and clinical presentation. It also assesses the ability to differentiate Chiari malformations from other neurological conditions that can present with similar symptoms.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully analyzing the patient's symptoms (headache, dizziness, gait imbalance), physical examination findings (gait ataxia), and crucially, the MRI findings (low-lying cerebellar tonsils extending below the foramen magnum). This constellation of findings is pathognomonic for a Chiari malformation, and the specific description points to Chiari type I. The differential diagnosis then involves considering other conditions that can cause similar symptoms but are ruled out by the specific MRI findings or clinical context.",
