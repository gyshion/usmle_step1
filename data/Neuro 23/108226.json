    "en": "Focal dystonia {{exhibit_1}}\nis a neurologic movement disorder characterized by sustained, involuntary muscle contractions, which force certain parts of the body into abnormal, sometimes painful movements or postures. Focal dystonias affect a single muscle or group of related muscles, the most common of which include cervical dystonia (ie, torticollis), blepharospasm (ie, eyelid twitching), and brachial dystonia (ie. writer's cramp).\n\nFocal dystonias are usually classified as idiopathic; however, GENETIC MUTATIONS are becoming increasingly implicated. Focal dystonias are due to abnormal neural signaling pathways, which can arise from multiple locations in the brain (eg, basal ganglia, motor cortex, supplementary motor areas).\n\nBecause the dystonia originates from abnormal neural signaling, microscopic examination of the affected muscle is often relatively unremarkable. Histopathology may show normal muscle or MUSCLE FIBER HYPERTROPHY (which occurs due to repetitive contractions).\n\n(Choice A) Certain types of glycogen storage diseases (eg, Pompe disease) can lead to weakness and fatigue due to abnormal glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle. Muscle biopsy would show enlarged lysosomes containing periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)-positive material.\n\n(Choice B) Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are caused by mutations affecting dystrophin, a cytoplasmic protein vital for stabilization of the muscle cell membrane. Loss of cell membrane integrity leads to muscle fiber degeneration and progressive fibrofatty replacement.\n\n(Choice C) Autoimmune muscle injury (eg, dermatomyositis, polymyositis) often shows an inflammatory cellular infiltrate (eg, lymphocytes) with muscle fiber necrosis, phagocytosis, and regeneration. Over time, the active inflammation and necrosis may be replaced by fibrosis.\n\n(Choice E) Statin therapy can cause muscle fiber necrosis without a significant associated inflammatory infiltrate. Muscle aches and weakness are the most common complications of statin therapy.\n\nEducational objective:\nFocal dystonia is a neurologic movement disorder characterized by sustained, involuntary muscle contractions. Because these contractions are neurologically mediated, muscle biopsy may not show significant histologic changes, although muscle fiber hypertrophy is often present due to repetitive contractions. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "局灶性肌张力障碍 {{exhibit_1}} 是一种神经系统运动障碍，其特征是持续的、不自主的肌肉收缩，迫使身体某些部位进入异常的、有时是疼痛的运动或姿势。局灶性肌张力障碍影响单个肌肉或一组相关肌肉，其中最常见的是颈部肌张力障碍（即斜颈）、眼睑痉挛（即眼睑抽搐）和臂肌张力障碍（即书写痉挛）。\n\n局灶性肌张力障碍通常被归类为特发性；然而，基因突变越来越受到关注。局灶性肌张力障碍是由于神经信号通路异常所致，这种异常可能源自大脑的多个位置（例如，基底神经节、运动皮质、辅助运动区）。\n\n由于肌张力障碍源于神经信号异常，受影响肌肉的显微镜检查通常相对不明显。组织病理学可能显示正常的肌肉或肌纤维肥大（由于重复收缩而发生）。\n\n(选项 A) 某些类型的糖原累积病（例如，庞贝病）会导致骨骼肌中糖原分解异常，从而导致虚弱和疲劳。肌肉活检将显示含有周期性酸-希夫 (PAS) 阳性物质的溶酶体增大。\n\n(选项 B) Duchenne 和 Becker 肌营养不良是由影响肌营养不良蛋白的突变引起的，肌营养不良蛋白是一种对稳定肌细胞膜至关重要的细胞质蛋白。细胞膜完整性的丧失导致肌纤维变性和进行性纤维脂肪替代。\n\n(选项 C) 自身免疫性肌肉损伤（例如，皮肌炎、多肌炎）通常显示炎性细胞浸润（例如，淋巴细胞），伴有肌纤维坏死、吞噬作用和再生。随着时间的推移，活动性炎症和坏死可能被纤维化取代。\n\n(选项 E) 他汀类药物治疗可导致肌纤维坏死，而没有明显的炎症浸润。肌肉酸痛和虚弱是他汀类药物治疗最常见的并发症。\n\n教育目标：\n局灶性肌张力障碍是一种神经系统运动障碍，其特征是持续的、不自主的肌肉收缩。由于这些收缩是由神经介导的，肌肉活检可能不会显示出明显的组织学改变，尽管由于重复收缩，通常存在肌纤维肥大。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology and histologic findings associated with focal dystonia, particularly the role of genetic mutations and abnormal neural signaling. It requires understanding that muscle fiber hypertrophy can occur due to repetitive contractions in dystonia.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that focal dystonia is a neurological disorder leading to involuntary muscle contractions. Consider that these contractions can cause muscle fiber hypertrophy. Eliminate options associated with other muscle disorders like glycogen storage diseases, muscular dystrophies, and autoimmune myopathies.",
