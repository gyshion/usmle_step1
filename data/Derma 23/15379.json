  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's red papules and pustules on the face are consistent with inflammatory acne. The pathogenesis of acne involves the following:\n\n*   Hyperkeratinization due to abnormal epithelial growth and differentiation of corneocytes leads to keratin plug formation in the pilosebaceous follicles. These blocked follicles are referred to as comedones (ie, whiteheads and blackheads).\n*   In response to androgen stimulation (eg, during pubertal adrenarche), sebaceous glands enlarge (not involute) and increase production of sebum, a lipid-rich substance that facilitates obstruction of pilosebaceous follicles (Choice A).\n*   Cutibacterium acnes, an anaerobic bacteria that relies on sebum as a nutrient source, proliferates in occluded follicles, triggering an inflammatory response that results in the red papules and pustules characteristic of nodulocystic acne.\n\n(Choice B) Bacterial metabolism of apocrine secretions contributes to body odor. Bromhidrosis is a condition characterized by excessive and offensive body odor.\n\n(Choice C) Estrogen has antiandrogenic effects and inhibits sebum production. For this reason, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives help to improve inflammatory acne.\n\n(Choice D) As epithelial stem cells undergo mitosis in the basal layers of the epidermis, newer cells form and undergo differentiation as they migrate toward the surface, replacing epithelial cells that desquamate. Increased epithelial mitosis and desquamation (ie, topical retinoids) helps extrude debris from comedones, limiting acne formation.\n\nEducational objective:\nAcne is characterized by the obstruction of pilosebaceous follicles (ie. comedones) due to hyperkeratinization and excessive sebum accumulation. Androgens stimulate production of sebum, which serves as a nutrient source for Cutibacterium acnes. Within the follicles, C acnes proliferation triggers an inflammatory response, resulting in formation of red papules and pustules.",
    "zh": "该患者面部的红色丘疹和脓疱与炎症性痤疮一致。痤疮的发病机制涉及以下内容：\n\n*   由于角质形成细胞的异常上皮生长和分化导致的过度角化，导致皮脂毛囊中角蛋白栓形成。这些阻塞的毛囊被称为粉刺（即，白头和黑头）。\n*   作为对雄激素刺激（例如，青春期肾上腺初现）的反应，皮脂腺增大（而非萎缩）并增加皮脂的产生，皮脂是一种富含脂质的物质，有助于阻塞皮脂毛囊（选项A）。\n*   痤疮丙酸杆菌，一种依赖皮脂作为营养来源的厌氧菌，在闭塞的毛囊中增殖，触发炎症反应，导致结节囊肿性痤疮特有的红色丘疹和脓疱。\n\n（选项B）顶泌汗腺分泌物的细菌代谢会导致体味。汗腺过度分泌症是一种以过度和难闻的体味为特征的疾病。\n\n（选项C）雌激素具有抗雄激素作用并抑制皮脂产生。因此，含雌激素的口服避孕药有助于改善炎症性痤疮。\n\n（选项D）当上皮干细胞在表皮的基底层进行有丝分裂时，新的细胞形成并在向表面迁移时发生分化，取代脱屑的上皮细胞。上皮细胞有丝分裂和脱屑增加（即，局部维甲酸）有助于从粉刺中挤出碎屑，从而限制痤疮的形成。\n\n教育目标：\n痤疮的特征是由于过度角化和皮脂过度积聚导致的皮脂毛囊阻塞（即粉刺）。雄激素刺激皮脂的产生，皮脂作为痤疮丙酸杆菌的营养来源。在毛囊内，痤疮丙酸杆菌增殖会触发炎症反应，导致红色丘疹和脓疱的形成。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris, specifically the role of Cutibacterium acnes and sebum production in the inflammatory process. It also requires differentiating acne from other skin conditions and understanding the hormonal influences on sebaceous glands.\n\nThe best approach is to recall the key steps in acne development: hyperkeratinization, sebum production stimulated by androgens, and subsequent proliferation of C. acnes leading to inflammation. Eliminate options that describe unrelated processes or have incorrect hormonal effects.",
    "zh": "本题考察对寻常痤疮发病机制的理解，特别是痤疮丙酸杆菌和皮脂在炎症过程中的作用。它还要求将痤疮与其他皮肤病区分开来，并了解激素对皮脂腺的影响。\n\n最好的方法是回忆痤疮发展的关键步骤：过度角化，雄激素刺激皮脂产生，以及随后的痤疮丙酸杆菌增殖导致炎症。排除描述无关过程或具有不正确激素影响的选项。"
