    "en": "A 72-year-old woman is brought to the office due to forgetfulness. Her family has noticed that the patient quickly forgets conversations and misplaces household items. The symptoms have progressively worsened over the past 2-3 years. A month ago, the patient became lost while driving in the neighborhood where she has lived most of her adult life. She has no significant medical history, and her only medication is a daily multivitamin. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs and lives with her son and his wife. Vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient has a short-term memory deficit with no other significant neurologic findings. After discussion, an oral cholinesterase inhibitor is prescribed. Which of the following is the most likely effect of the drug prescribed for this patient?",
    "zh": "一名72岁女性因健忘就诊。其家人注意到患者很快忘记谈话内容并乱放家里的物品。症状在过去2-3年内逐渐恶化。一个月前，患者在她成年后一直居住的社区内驾车时迷路。她没有重要的病史，唯一的药物是每日复合维生素。患者不吸烟、不饮酒、不吸毒，与她的儿子和儿媳住在一起。生命体征在正常范围内。体格检查显示，患者存在短期记忆障碍，无其他重要的神经系统发现。讨论后，开出了一种口服胆碱酯酶抑制剂。以下哪项是为该患者开具的药物最可能产生的作用？"

    "en": "This elderly patient with an insidious onset of increasing forgetfulness, visuospatial deficits (eg, misplacing objects), and executive dysfunction (eg, getting lost in familiar surroundings), coupled with a normal neurologic examination, most likely has ALZHEIMER DISEASE (AD).\n\nDegeneration of cholinergic neurons resulting in reduced acetylcholine synthesis in the basal forebrain, contributes to the memory loss and executive dysfunction that characterizes AD. Cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) block acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft to compensate for the loss of cholinergic transmission.\n\nAlthough cholinesterase inhibitors provide modest symptomatic improvement, they do not enhance neuron survival. Therefore, they are not considered neuroprotective and do not impact the overall trajectory of AD. In contrast, NMDA receptor antagonists (eg, memantine) inhibit glutamate NMDA signaling to prevent excitotoxicity (calcium overload) and subsequent neuronal apoptosis; these agents likely serve a neuroprotective role that may slow disease progression (Choice A).\n\n(Choice C) Antioxidants (eg, vitamin E) may delay progression of AD through a neuroprotective effect but do not seem to improve cognition.\n\n(Choice D) Neuroplasticity, the ability of neurons to reorganize or restructure, is most notably prominent in childhood. Reduced neuroplasticity has been implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric conditions (eg, psychosis). However, currently available medications for AD cannot enhance neuroplasticity.\n\n(Choice E) Cholinesterase inhibitors have demonstrated greater improvement in cognition and daily functioning compared to placebo.\n\nEducational objective:\nCholinesterase inhibitors (eg, donepezil, galantamine) may provide modest symptomatic improvement of cognitive symptoms and temporarily improve functioning in patients with Alzheimer disease. However, these medications do not alter the inevitable disease progression.",
    "zh": "这位老年患者起病隐匿，逐渐出现健忘、视觉空间缺陷（如乱放物品）和执行功能障碍（如在熟悉的环境中迷路），并伴有正常的神经系统检查结果，最有可能患有阿尔茨海默病（AD）。\n\n胆碱能神经元的变性导致基底前脑中乙酰胆碱合成减少，这促成了AD的特征性记忆丧失和执行功能障碍。胆碱酯酶抑制剂（如多奈哌齐、利斯的明、加兰他敏）阻断突触间隙中的乙酰胆碱酯酶，以代偿胆碱能神经传递的缺失。\n\n尽管胆碱酯酶抑制剂可提供轻度的症状改善，但它们并不能增强神经元的存活率。因此，它们不被认为是神经保护剂，也不会影响AD的总体病程。相比之下，NMDA受体拮抗剂（如美金刚）抑制谷氨酸NMDA信号传导，以防止兴奋性毒性（钙超载）和随后的神经元凋亡；这些药物可能起到神经保护作用，从而减缓疾病进展（选项A）。\n\n（选项C）抗氧化剂（如维生素E）可能通过神经保护作用延缓AD的进展，但似乎并不能改善认知功能。\n\n（选项D）神经可塑性，即神经元重组或重建的能力，在儿童时期最为突出。神经可塑性降低与多种神经精神疾病（如精神病）有关。然而，目前可用于治疗AD的药物无法增强神经可塑性。\n\n（选项E）与安慰剂相比，胆碱酯酶抑制剂在认知功能和日常功能方面显示出更大的改善。\n\n教育目标：\n胆碱酯酶抑制剂（如多奈哌齐、加兰他敏）可以对阿尔茨海默病患者的认知症状提供轻度的症状改善，并暂时改善功能。然而，这些药物不会改变不可避免的疾病进展。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of Alzheimer's disease and the mechanism of action of cholinesterase inhibitors used in its management. It assesses the understanding of the symptomatic benefits versus disease-modifying effects of these medications.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease and recall that cholinesterase inhibitors primarily provide symptomatic relief by increasing acetylcholine levels in the brain, without altering the underlying disease progression.",
