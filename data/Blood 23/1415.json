    "en": "This patient's symptoms are consistent with cyanide poisoning. Used in many industries (eg, jewelry making, plastics manufacturing), cyanide is a potent mitochondrial toxin that binds with high affinity to the ferric ion (Fe³⁺) in the heme center of cytochrome c oxidase. This blocks the electron transport chain, preventing ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation; cells are forced to switch to anaerobic glycolysis for energy production, and lactic acidosis quickly develops (Choices A and E). {{exhibit_1}}\n\nCyanide poisoning results in a variety of symptoms that may include shortness of breath, dizziness, and palpitations. Reddish discoloration of the skin occurs because venous blood contains higher levels of unused oxygen and is brighter/redder.\n\nIf cyanide poisoning is untreated, cardiovascular collapse and death occur. Therefore, an antidote is administered urgently to any patient with suspected cyanide toxicity. Hydroxocobalamin, a vitamin B₁₂ precursor, rapidly binds to cyanide (preventing it from binding to cytochrome c oxidase) and forms cyanocobalamin, a nontoxic metabolite that is excreted in the urine.\n\n(Choice B) Sodium thiosulfate increases the availability of sulfur donors for rhodanese, an enzyme that transfers sulfur to cyanide to form thiocyanate, a nontoxic metabolite excreted in the urine. Sodium thiosulfate is sometimes given with hydroxocobalamin for cyanide poisoning.\n\n(Choice C) Sodium nitrite and amyl nitrite induce the formation of methemoglobin. Methemoglobin binds cyanide with high affinity, freeing it from cytochrome oxidase and limiting its toxic effects; however, methemoglobin is unable to carry oxygen and can exacerbate the tissue hypoxia already present from cyanide poisoning.\n\nEducational objective:\nCyanide is a potent mitochondrial toxin that binds to the ferric ion in the heme center of cytochrome c oxidase. This blocks the electron transport chain and uncouples oxidative phosphorylation. Hydroxocobalamin, rapidly binds to cyanide and forms the nontoxic metabolite cyanocobalamin, which is excreted in the urine. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者的症状与氰化物中毒一致。氰化物广泛应用于许多行业（例如，珠宝制造、塑料制造），是一种强效的线粒体毒素，它与细胞色素c氧化酶血红素中心的铁离子(Fe³⁺)具有高度亲和力。这会阻断电子传递链，阻止通过氧化磷酸化的ATP产生；细胞被迫转为无氧糖酵解以产生能量，并迅速发生乳酸性酸中毒（选项A和E）。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n氰化物中毒会导致各种症状，可能包括呼吸急促、头晕和心悸。皮肤发红是由于静脉血中含有较高水平的未利用氧气，颜色更鲜艳/发红。\n\n如果氰化物中毒未经治疗，则会发生心血管衰竭和死亡。因此，对于任何疑似氰化物毒性的患者，都应紧急给予解毒剂。羟钴胺，一种维生素B₁₂的前体，能迅速与氰化物结合（阻止其与细胞色素c氧化酶结合），并形成氰钴胺，一种无毒的代谢产物，通过尿液排出。\n\n（选项B）硫代硫酸钠增加了硫供体对硫氰酸酶的可用性，硫氰酸酶是一种将硫转移给氰化物形成硫氰酸盐的酶，硫氰酸盐是一种通过尿液排出的无毒代谢物。硫代硫酸钠有时与羟钴胺一起用于治疗氰化物中毒。\n\n（选项C）亚硝酸钠和亚硝酸异戊酯诱导高铁血红蛋白的形成。高铁血红蛋白与氰化物具有高亲和力，从而将其从细胞色素氧化酶中释放出来，并限制其毒性作用；然而，高铁血红蛋白无法携带氧气，并且会加剧已经存在的由于氰化物中毒引起的组织缺氧。\n\n教育目标：\n氰化物是一种强效的线粒体毒素，它与细胞色素c氧化酶血红素中心的铁离子结合。这会阻断电子传递链并解偶联氧化磷酸化。羟钴胺能迅速与氰化物结合，形成通过尿液排出的无毒代谢物氰钴胺。{{exhibit_2}}"
