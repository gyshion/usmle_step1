    "en": "A 46-year-old woman comes to the office with a painful rash involving her groin and legs that has been worsening over the last 2 weeks. She was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 6 months ago but has no other medical problems other than occasional loose stools. Physical examination shows coalescing erythematous plaques with crusting and scaling at the borders and central areas of brownish induration. Biopsy of the lesions reveals superficial necrolysis.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient most likely has a glucagonoma, a rare tumor arising from the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Glucagonomas secrete large quantities of glucagon, so affected patients often have hyperglycemia or overt diabetes mellitus. A characteristic skin finding is necrolytic migratory erythema, an elevated painful and pruritic rash typically affecting the face, groin, and extremities. Over time, small erythematous papules coalesce to form large, indurated plaques with a central clearing that often appears brown or bronze-colored. Diagnosis is made by detecting elevated levels of glucagon in the serum.\n\n(Choice A) Glucagon acts on the liver to promote amino acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis from amino acids. Circulating levels of amino acids are low in glucagonoma and thought to contribute to development of necrolytic migratory erythema.\n\n(Choice B) Elevated gastrin levels in patients with gastrinoma are associated with hypersecretion of gastric acid and resultant gastrointestinal ulceration. The peptic ulcers that occur with gastrinomas are often in unusual areas, such as the jejunum. Patients with gastrinomas can also have diarrhea and abdominal pain.\n\n(Choice D) Excess somatostatin secretion from a somatostatinoma typically presents with abdominal pain, gallbladder stones, constipation, hyperglycemia, and steatorrhea. These manifestations result from somatostatin-induced inhibition of insulin, glucagon, gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin secretion, and inhibition of gastrointestinal motility.\n\n(Choice E) High levels of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are seen in patients with a VIPoma, which typically presents with intractable diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria. Patients are usually hypotensive due to dehydration and the vasodilatory effects of VIP.\n\n(Choice F) Diabetes mellitus is present in the majority of patients with glucagonoma, most likely due to excessive hepatic glucose production. Insulin levels tend to be normal but can be elevated secondary to hyperglycemia and glucagon-induced stimulation of the pancreatic beta cells.\n\n(Choice G) Zinc deficiency causes erythematous skin lesions (mainly around body orifices) that are predominantly vesicular and pustular. Other features include hypogonadism, impaired taste and smell, night blindness, and impaired wound healing. Although the skin lesions in zinc deficiency can resemble necrolytic migratory erythema, this patient's lack of additional findings and her recent diabetes mellitus diagnosis make glucagonoma more likely.\n\nEducational objective:\nGlucagonoma presents with hyperglycemia (often as newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus) and necrolytic migratory erythema (blistering erythematous plaques with central clearing) affecting the groin, face, and extremities. The diagnosis is made by detecting elevated glucagon levels.",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有胰高血糖素瘤，这是一种罕见的肿瘤，起源于胰岛朗格汉斯岛的α细胞。胰高血糖素瘤分泌大量胰高血糖素，因此受影响的患者通常会出现高血糖或显性糖尿病。一个典型的皮肤表现是坏死性游走性红斑，这是一种隆起、疼痛且瘙痒的皮疹，通常影响面部、腹股沟和四肢。随着时间的推移，小的红斑丘疹会融合形成大的、硬化的斑块，中心区域变清，通常呈棕色或青铜色。诊断通过检测血清中胰高血糖素水平升高来进行。\n\n(选项A) 胰高血糖素作用于肝脏，促进氨基酸氧化和氨基酸的糖异生。在胰高血糖素瘤中，循环氨基酸水平较低，据认为这有助于坏死性游走性红斑的发展。\n\n(选项B) 胃泌素瘤患者的胃泌素水平升高与胃酸过度分泌和随之而来的胃肠道溃疡有关。胃泌素瘤引起的消化性溃疡通常发生在不寻常的区域，如空肠。胃泌素瘤患者也可能出现腹泻和腹痛。\n\n(选项D) 生长抑素瘤分泌过多的生长抑素，通常表现为腹痛、胆结石、便秘、高血糖和脂肪泻。这些表现源于生长抑素诱导的对胰岛素、胰高血糖素、胃泌素、促胰液素和胆囊收缩素分泌的抑制，以及对胃肠动力的抑制。\n\n(选项E) 血管活性肠肽(VIP)水平升高见于VIP瘤患者，通常表现为顽固性腹泻、低钾血症和胃酸缺乏症。患者通常会因脱水和VIP的血管舒张作用而出现低血压。\n\n(选项F) 大多数胰高血糖素瘤患者都存在糖尿病，这很可能是由于肝脏葡萄糖过度产生所致。胰岛素水平往往正常，但可能由于高血糖和胰高血糖素诱导的胰腺β细胞刺激而升高。\n\n(选项G) 锌缺乏症会导致红斑性皮肤损伤（主要位于身体开口周围），这些损伤主要为水疱性和脓疱性。其他特征包括性腺功能减退、味觉和嗅觉受损、夜盲症和伤口愈合受损。虽然锌缺乏症的皮肤损伤可能类似于坏死性游走性红斑，但该患者缺乏其他发现，并且近期诊断为糖尿病，这使得胰高血糖素瘤的可能性更大。\n\n教育目标：\n胰高血糖素瘤表现为高血糖（通常表现为新诊断的糖尿病）和坏死性游走性红斑（累及腹股沟、面部和四肢的起泡性红斑斑块，伴有中央清除）。诊断通过检测胰高血糖素水平升高来进行。"
