    "en": "A 13-month-old boy is brought to the clinic after repeated infections for the past 4 months, including otitis media, pneumonia, and erysipelas. Although his infections have been responsive to treatment, his father is concerned about the number of infections. The patient also has persistent diarrhea, and a recent stool antigen detection assay was positive for *Giardia lamblia*. An immunoglobulin panel demonstrates very low serum levels of all immunoglobulin types. Intradermal injection of *Candida* antigens results in a large indurated nodule within 48 hours. This patient's lymph nodes most likely lack which of the following structures?",

    "en": "This patient's recurrent infections in the setting of intact T lymphocyte function (positive response to *Candida* antigens) and very low immunoglobulin levels suggest X-linked (Bruton) agammaglobulinemia (XLA). This condition results from a mutation in the Bruton tyrosine kinase gene that causes failure of bone marrow pre-B cells to develop into mature B lymphocytes. As a result, patients have absent or very low B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues.\n\nIn general, B lymphocytes aggregate in the cortex of lymph nodes to form lymphoid follicles. Primary follicles are dense and dormant; secondary follicles have a pale germinal center containing proliferating B cells in response to an antigenic stimulus. In XLA, primary lymphoid follicles and germinal centers do not form due to an absence of B cells. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nLack of mature B lymphocytes also leads to inability to produce plasma cells, and patients therefore have absent or very low serum immunoglobulins. Recurrent infections typically begin once maternally derived antibodies wane (age 3-6 months), as seen here.\n\n(Choice B) The outer cortex is composed of primary and secondary lymphoid follicles (i.e, B cell-rich regions), but it also contains prominent numbers of CD4+ T cells within the interfollicular regions (allowing for T-B cell interaction). In patients with XLA, the outer cortex is present but diminished.\n\n(Choice C) The paracortical zone lies internal to the cortex of the lymph node. This zone is populated primarily by T lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Dendritic cells present antigens collected from the blood and lymph to the T lymphocytes aggregated in this section of the node. This patient's positive reaction to *Candida* antigens (type 4 hypersensitivity) indicates intact T lymphocyte function.\n\n(Choices D and E) The subcapsular sinuses are found between the capsule and the cortex of the lymph node and are in direct communication with afferent lymphatic vessels. These sinuses are connected to cortical sinuses that line the trabeculae and penetrate through the cortex and paracortex to reach the medulla. From there, medullary sinuses drain into the efferent lymphatic channel. These structures are not affected in XLA.\n\nEducational objective:\nX-linked (Bruton) agammaglobulinemia is caused by a defect in B cell maturation, resulting in absent mature B cells and severely low immunoglobulin levels. T cell numbers and function remain intact. Due to the absence of B cells, primary lymphoid follicles and germinal centers do not form within lymph nodes. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者在T淋巴细胞功能完整（对白色念珠菌抗原呈阳性反应）和免疫球蛋白水平极低的情况下反复感染，提示X连锁（Bruton）无丙种球蛋白血症 (XLA)。 这种情况是由Bruton酪氨酸激酶基因突变引起的，该突变导致骨髓前B细胞无法发育成成熟的B淋巴细胞。因此，患者在外周血和淋巴组织中缺乏或极低水平的B淋巴细胞。\n\n一般来说，B淋巴细胞聚集在淋巴结的皮质中形成淋巴滤泡。初级滤泡密集且不活跃；次级滤泡具有苍白的生发中心，其中含有增殖的B细胞以响应抗原刺激。在XLA中，由于缺乏B细胞，不会形成初级淋巴滤泡和生发中心。 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n缺乏成熟的B淋巴细胞也会导致无法产生浆细胞，因此患者缺乏或血清免疫球蛋白水平极低。反复感染通常在母体来源的抗体减弱后开始（3-6个月大），如本例所示。\n\n（选项B）外皮质由初级和次级淋巴滤泡（即富含B细胞的区域）组成，但它也包含大量CD4+T细胞，位于滤泡间区域内（允许T-B细胞相互作用）。在XLA患者中，外皮质存在但减少。\n\n（选项C）副皮质区位于淋巴结皮质的内侧。该区域主要由T淋巴细胞和树突状细胞组成。树突状细胞将从血液和淋巴中收集的抗原呈递给聚集在该区域的T淋巴细胞。该患者对白色念珠菌抗原呈阳性反应（4型超敏反应）表明T淋巴细胞功能完整。\n\n（选项D和E）皮下窦位于淋巴结的包膜和皮质之间，并与传入的淋巴管直接相通。这些窦与覆盖小梁的皮质窦相连，并穿过皮质和副皮质到达髓质。从那里，髓质窦排入传出淋巴管。这些结构在XLA中不受影响。\n\n教育目标：\nX连锁（Bruton）无丙种球蛋白血症是由B细胞成熟缺陷引起的，导致成熟B细胞缺失和免疫球蛋白水平极低。T细胞数量和功能保持完整。由于缺乏B细胞，淋巴结内不会形成初级淋巴滤泡和生发中心。 {{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), specifically the pathophysiology related to B cell development and the resulting impact on lymph node structure. It requires understanding of the role of B cells in forming germinal centers within lymph nodes.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation suggestive of XLA (recurrent infections, low immunoglobulins, normal T cell function). Recall that XLA results in absent B cells, which are essential for the formation of germinal centers in lymph nodes.",
