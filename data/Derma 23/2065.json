    "en": "A 52-year-old woman comes to the office due to a 2-month history of oral lesions that cause pain with chewing and swallowing food. The patient did not seek treatment because she thought the lesions would go away on their own, but they have persisted. On examination, there are erosions of the buccal and gingival mucosa, as shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}. There are several flaccid bullae with erosions scattered over her trunk. The blisters spread laterally with pressure, and traction on seemingly uninvolved skin produces blistering. Autoantibodies directed against which of the following structures are most likely responsible for this process?",

    "en": "This patient has pemphigus vulgaris (PV), an autoimmune bullous disease characterized by autoantibodies directed against painful, flaccid bullae and erosions of the skin and mucosal membranes. Any mucosal site can be involved, but the oral mucosa is the most common. The bullae are structurally weak and often rupture prior to presentation, with only erosions remaining. The bullae spread laterally when pressure is applied on top (ie, Asboe-Hansen sign), and new blisters may form with gentle traction or rubbing (ie, Nikolsky sign). \n\nThe underlying pathophysiology of PV involves autoantibodies directed against desmosomes, specifically desmogleins 1 and 3, which disrupt cohesion of keratinocytes. Biopsy of an active PV lesion will show intraepithelial cleavage with detached keratinocytes (acantholysis), retained keratinocytes along the basement membrane and an eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate. Direct immunofluorescence of unaffected skin adjacent to PV lesions will show epidermal intercellular IgG and C3 deposits. Circulating autoantibodies against desmogleins are present in many patients and can aid diagnosis. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}\n\n(Choice A) Autoantibodies against cutaneous basement membrane proteins are characteristic of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (forms tense acral bullae) and cicatricial pemphigoid (causes chronic conjunctivitis and scarring).\n\n(Choice B) No known cutaneous diseases result from connexin autoimmunity, but connexin defects do underlie some specific forms of palmoplantar keratoderma, which causes epidermal hyperproliferation of the palms and soles, or deafness-associated ichthyosis.\n\n(Choice D) Autoantibodies against hemidesmosomal proteins cause bullous pemphigoid, in which the bullae are usually tense and remain intact as the entire epidermis separates from the dermis (no intraepithelial cleavage). In addition, mucosal involvement is less common and Nikolsky sign is usually negative.\n\n(Choice E) Autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase result in celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis, an autoimmune cutaneous eruption associated with gluten sensitivity. The eruption is characterized by grouped (herpetiform) erythematous papulovesicles that are intensely pruritic, not painful; oral mucosal involvement is rare.\n\nEducational objective:\nPemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune bullous disease characterized by autoantibodies directed against desmosomal proteins (eg, desmogleins). It presents with painful, flaccid bullae and erosions affecting the skin and mucosal membranes. The bullae spread laterally with pressure, and new blisters may form with gentle rubbing.",
    "zh": "该患者患有寻常型天疱疮 (PV)，这是一种自身免疫性大疱性疾病，其特征是针对皮肤和黏膜上疼痛的、松弛的大疱和糜烂的自身抗体。任何黏膜部位都可能受累，但口腔黏膜最为常见。大疱在结构上较弱，通常在出现前破裂，仅留下糜烂。当顶部施加压力时，大疱横向扩散（即 Asboe-Hansen 征），并且可以通过轻轻牵拉或摩擦形成新的水疱（即 Nikolsky 征）。\n\nPV 的潜在病理生理学涉及针对桥粒的自身抗体，特别是桥粒蛋白 1 和 3，它们会破坏角质形成细胞的粘附力。活跃的 PV 病变的活检将显示上皮内分裂伴有脱落的角质形成细胞（棘解），沿基底膜保留的角质形成细胞和嗜酸性粒细胞炎症浸润。PV 病变邻近的未受累皮肤的直接免疫荧光将显示表皮细胞间 IgG 和 C3 沉积。许多患者存在针对桥粒蛋白的循环自身抗体，有助于诊断。 {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}\n\n（选项 A）针对皮肤基底膜蛋白的自身抗体是获得性大疱性表皮松解症（形成紧张的肢端大疱）和瘢痕性类天疱疮（导致慢性结膜炎和瘢痕形成）的特征。\n\n（选项 B）没有已知的皮肤病是由连接蛋白自身免疫引起的，但连接蛋白缺陷确实是某些特定类型的掌跖角化病的基础，该病会导致手掌和足底表皮过度增生，或与耳聋相关的鱼鳞病。\n\n（选项 D）针对半桥粒蛋白的自身抗体可引起大疱性类天疱疮，其中大疱通常紧张并保持完整，因为整个表皮与真皮分离（无上皮内分裂）。此外，黏膜受累较少见，Nikolsky 征通常为阴性。\n\n（选项 E）针对组织转谷氨酰胺酶的自身抗体可导致乳糜泻和疱疹样皮炎，这是一种与麸质敏感性相关的自身免疫性皮肤疹。皮疹的特征是成簇（疱疹样）红斑性丘疹，这些丘疹剧烈瘙痒，但无疼痛；口腔黏膜受累罕见。\n\n教育目标：\n寻常型天疱疮是一种自身免疫性大疱性疾病，其特征是针对桥粒蛋白（例如，桥粒蛋白）的自身抗体。它表现为影响皮肤和黏膜的疼痛的、松弛的大疱和糜烂。大疱受压后横向扩散，并且可以通过轻轻摩擦形成新的水疱。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pemphigus vulgaris (PV), an autoimmune blistering disease, and the specific autoantibodies involved in its pathogenesis. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of PV, including flaccid bullae, mucosal involvement, and a positive Nikolsky sign, and associating these findings with autoantibodies against desmosomes.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key clinical features of PV, such as the flaccid bullae and mucosal involvement. Recall that PV is caused by autoantibodies targeting desmosomes, which are cell adhesion molecules responsible for maintaining the integrity of the epidermis. Eliminate options associated with other blistering diseases or unrelated conditions.",
