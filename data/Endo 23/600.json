    "en": "A 21-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to several days of dizziness and extreme fatigue. The patient has been drinking a lot of water and urinating more than usual for the past 2 weeks. He developed nausea and vomiting one day ago and has had difficulty keeping food and liquids down. The patient has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. Blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 20/min. Urinalysis is positive for glucose and ketones. The patient is given intravenous fluids and an intravenous infusion of recombinant human insulin without any structural modifications. His condition improves, and he remains stable for the rest of the hospitalization. In preparation for discharge, a plan is made to prescribe a regimen that includes a subcutaneous formulation of the same insulin that the patient was receiving intravenously. Which of the following drug concentration curves shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}} is most likely to be obtained after subcutaneous injection of this insulin?",
    "zh": "一名21岁男性因头晕和极度疲劳数天来到急诊科。患者在过去2周里饮用了大量的水，且排尿量多于平常。一天前出现恶心和呕吐，并且难以维持食物和液体摄入。患者没有其他疾病，也没有服用任何药物。血压90/60 mmHg，脉搏120次/分，呼吸20次/分。尿液分析显示葡萄糖和酮体呈阳性。患者接受静脉输液和重组人胰岛素静脉输注，没有进行任何结构修饰。他的病情有所改善，并在住院期间保持稳定。为出院做准备，制定了处方方案，包括皮下注射与患者静脉注射的相同胰岛素。下图{{exhibit_1}}中显示的以下哪种药物浓度曲线最有可能在皮下注射这种胰岛素后获得？"

    "en": "This young patient with symptoms of hyperglycemia (eg, polyuria, polydipsia) that progressed to volume depletion, glucosuria, and ketonuria has DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA), likely due to new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus. DKA is treated with an INTRAVENOUS infusion of regular insulin that begins to lower serum glucose and ketone levels within minutes. Intravenous regular insulin has a half-life of 5 minutes, allowing rapid adjustment of the infusion rate, which is required when glucose levels change rapidly during DKA management.\n\nFollowing resolution of DKA, patients are transitioned to subcutaneous insulin to be continued at home. This patient's postdischarge regimen includes the subcutaneous formulation of regular insulin, which begins working within 30 minutes after injection, peaks in 2-4 hours, and lasts 5-8 hours. The delayed onset and prolonged duration of action compared to the intravenous formation are due to subcutaneous polymerization (eg, hexamer formation) that delays systemic absorption.\n\nSubcutaneous regular insulin is used to treat post prandial hyperglycemia and is used with basal insulin (intermediate acting [ie, NPH] or long acting [eg, glargine]), which treats fasting hyperglycemia. Regular insulin and neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) are the only human recombinant insulins without amino acid modification. All other insulin preparations (eg, glargine, lispro) have structural modifications (eg, amino acid changes) to improve pharmacokinetics and are considered insulin analogs.\n\n(Choice A) Insulin aspart, lispro, and glulisine are rapid-acting insulin analogues used to treat postprandial hyperglycemia. Because they have a more rapid onset of action (15 min) and peak effect (45-75 min) compared to regular insulin, these analogues more closely mimic postprandial physiologic insulin secretion.\n\n(Choice C) NPH is an intermediate-acting insulin that has a more delayed onset (2 hr) and peak effect (4-6 hr) compared to regular insulin; it can be used as a basal insulin (given twice a day). Unlike regular insulin, NPH is a crystalline suspension that is not suitable for intravenous use.\n\n(Choices D and E) Detemir and glargine are long-acting basal insulin analogues that do not have a significant peak effect. Unlike glargine, which has a duration of action of 24 hours, detemir typically lasts just under 24 hours, making it the less-preferred basal insulin.\n\nEducational objective:\nIntravenous regular insulin has a rapid onset and short half-life, allowing the rapid adjustments needed in diabetic ketoacidosis management. In contrast, regular insulin given subcutaneously starts working within 30 minutes, peaks in 2-4 hours, and lasts 5-8 hours, making it usable as a premeal insulin that treats postprandial hyperglycemia.",
    "zh": "这位出现高血糖症状（如，多尿、烦渴）的年轻患者，病情发展到容量不足、糖尿和酮尿，患有糖尿病酮症酸中毒(DKA)，这很可能是由于新发1型糖尿病所致。DKA的治疗方法是静脉输注普通胰岛素，它在几分钟内开始降低血清葡萄糖和酮体水平。静脉注射普通胰岛素的半衰期为5分钟，可以快速调整输注速率，这在DKA管理期间血糖水平快速变化时是必需的。\n\n在DKA缓解后，患者会转换为皮下注射胰岛素，以便在家继续使用。该患者出院后的方案包括皮下注射普通胰岛素制剂，该制剂在注射后30分钟内开始起效，在2-4小时内达到峰值，持续5-8小时。与静脉注射制剂相比，其起效延迟和作用时间延长是由于皮下聚合（例如，六聚体形成）延缓了全身吸收。\n\n皮下注射普通胰岛素用于治疗餐后高血糖，并与基础胰岛素（中效[如，NPH]或长效[如，甘精胰岛素]）一起使用，用于治疗空腹高血糖。普通胰岛素和中性鱼精蛋白Hagedorn (NPH)是唯一未经氨基酸修饰的人重组胰岛素。所有其他胰岛素制剂（例如，甘精胰岛素、赖脯胰岛素）都进行了结构修饰（例如，氨基酸改变）以改善药代动力学，并被认为是胰岛素类似物。\n\n（选项A）门冬胰岛素、赖脯胰岛素和谷赖胰岛素是速效胰岛素类似物，用于治疗餐后高血糖。由于与普通胰岛素相比，它们的起效时间更短（15分钟）和峰值效应更短（45-75分钟），这些类似物更接近地模拟餐后生理性胰岛素分泌。\n\n（选项C）NPH是一种中效胰岛素，与普通胰岛素相比，其起效时间更长（2小时）和峰值效应更长（4-6小时）；它可用作基础胰岛素（每天注射两次）。与普通胰岛素不同，NPH是一种结晶悬浮液，不适合静脉使用。\n\n（选项D和E）地特胰岛素和甘精胰岛素是长效基础胰岛素类似物，没有明显的峰值效应。与持续时间为24小时的甘精胰岛素不同，地特胰岛素通常持续不到24小时，这使得它成为不太受青睐的基础胰岛素。\n\n教育目标：\n静脉注射普通胰岛素起效快，半衰期短，可以快速调整糖尿病酮症酸中毒的管理。相比之下，皮下注射的普通胰岛素在30分钟内开始起效，在2-4小时内达到峰值，并持续5-8小时，这使其可用作治疗餐后高血糖的餐前胰岛素。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of insulin types, their onset of action, peak, and duration, specifically focusing on the difference between intravenous and subcutaneous regular insulin. It also requires understanding the clinical context of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and the transition from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that subcutaneous regular insulin has a delayed onset (30 minutes), peaks in 2-4 hours, and lasts 5-8 hours. This corresponds to curve B, which shows a gradual increase and peak within the expected timeframe, unlike the rapid peak of curve A (representing rapid-acting insulin) or the delayed and prolonged action of curve C (representing intermediate-acting insulin).",
