    "en": "This patient's liver biopsy findings and recent travel to an endemic region suggest ACUTE HEPATITIS A infection. Acute viral hepatitis is characterized histologically by the presence of \"spotty necrosis\" with ballooning degeneration (hepatocyte swelling with wispy/clear cytoplasm). Councilman bodies (eosinophilic apoptotic hepatocytes), and mononuclear cell infiltrates. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nPatients typically present acutely with a prodrome of fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. After several days (up to 1 week), prodromal symptoms lessen as patients develop signs of cholestasis such as jaundice, pruritus, DARK-COLORED URINE (due to increased conjugated bilirubin levels), and acholic stool (lacks bilirubin pigment). The illness is self-limited and does not progress to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n(Choices A and C) Chronic cholestatic processes (eg, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis) may present initially with prolonged pruritus and fatigue. As these conditions progress, patients can develop acholic stools and malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (due to reduced bile flow to the small intestine). This can lead to vitamin D deficiency and metabolic bone disease (eg, osteoporosis, osteomalacia).\n\n(Choice D) Skin pigmentation and diabetes mellitus are more suggestive of hemochromatosis, an inherited disease associated with iron overload in the liver, pancreas, heart, and other organs.\n\n(Choice E) Upper gastrointestinal bleeding and ascites are more suggestive of portal hypertension, a condition that typically develops secondary to liver cirrhosis.\n\nEducational objective:\nAcute hepatitis A is a self-limited infection that typically presents acutely with prodromal symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, right upper quadrant pain) followed by signs of cholestasis (eg, jaundice, pruritus, dark-colored urine, clay-colored stool). {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "该患者的肝活检结果和近期前往流行地区旅行提示急性甲型肝炎病毒（甲肝）感染。急性病毒性肝炎的组织学特征是存在“点状坏死”，伴有气球样变性（肝细胞肿胀，胞浆稀薄/透明）。 Councilman小体（嗜酸性凋亡肝细胞）和单核细胞浸润。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n患者通常表现为急性期，先有发热、不适、食欲不振、恶心/呕吐和右上腹疼痛等前驱症状。数天（最多1周）后，前驱症状减轻，患者出现胆汁淤积的体征，如黄疸、瘙痒、深色尿（由于结合胆红素水平升高）和无胆汁便（缺乏胆红素色素）。该病为自限性疾病，不会进展为慢性肝炎、肝硬化或肝细胞癌。\n\n（选项 A 和 C）慢性胆汁淤积过程（例如，原发性胆汁性肝硬化、原发性硬化性胆管炎）最初可能表现为长期瘙痒和疲劳。随着这些疾病的进展，患者会出现无胆汁便和脂溶性维生素吸收不良（由于流向小肠的胆汁流量减少）。这可能导致维生素D缺乏和代谢性骨病（如骨质疏松症、骨软化症）。\n\n（选项 D）皮肤色素沉着和糖尿病更提示血色病，这是一种与肝脏、胰腺、心脏和其他器官铁超载相关的遗传性疾病。\n\n（选项 E）上消化道出血和腹水更提示门脉高压，这通常继发于肝硬化而发生。\n\n教育目标：\n急性甲型肝炎是一种自限性感染，通常以急性前驱症状（如发热、不适、食欲不振、恶心/呕吐、右上腹疼痛）起病，继而出现胆汁淤积的体征（如黄疸、瘙痒、深色尿、陶土色粪便）。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the clinical presentation and diagnosis of acute hepatitis A infection, including its characteristic prodromal symptoms and histological findings. The question requires recognizing the significance of travel history, liver biopsy results, and common presenting symptoms to differentiate hepatitis A from other liver conditions.\n\nThe best approach is to correlate the patient's travel history and liver biopsy findings with the typical prodromal symptoms of acute hepatitis A. Rule out other conditions based on their distinct clinical features, such as chronic cholestatic processes, hemochromatosis, and portal hypertension.",
