    "en": "The patient is a former smoker and presents with digital clubbing {{exhibit_2}}: a thickening and widening of the nail bed and distal phalanges that give the fingers a bulbous drumstick appearance. Normally, when two opposing fingers are held nail to nail, a diamond-shaped space is formed between proximal nail folds; obliteration of this space is consistent with clubbing. \n\nClubbing is observed in cardiopulmonary disease states where hypoxic-inflammatory pathways are activated, releasing platelet and fibroblast-derived growth factors (especially vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) that promote platelet clumping/embedment in the distal capillary beds (fingers, toes), which then leads to local fibrovascular proliferation. \n\nLung adenocarcinoma (ie, tumor-secreted VEGF) is the most common cause of clubbing in adults. Other common causes of clubbing include chronic chest infections (eg, bronchiectasis) and cardiopulmonary diseases with hypoxemia (eg, cyanotic heart defects). Occasionally, clubbing is associated with a painful periosteal reaction and synovitis, known as hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, a paraneoplastic syndrome strongly linked to lung adenocarcinoma. \n\nExamination for clubbing is clinically valuable because it may be the only visible physical sign of lung cancer, including small and surgically resectable (curable) tumors that would be otherwise asymptomatic. Therefore, the presence of clubbing should prompt further imaging of the chest for malignancy. {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(Choice A) Uncomplicated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD without hypoxemia) alone is not associated with clubbing; clubbing in a patient with COPD should trigger further investigation for underlying complications (eg, malignancy, bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension). In addition, this patient has normal breath sounds, making COPD (eg, emphysema, chronic bronchitis) unlikely.\n\n(Choice B) Chronic renal failure is associated with “half-and-half” nails (Lindsay nails), a sharply demarcated transverse leukonychia. The mechanism remains unknown but is unlikely to be related to azotemia because the transition line disappears after renal transplantation but not with hemodialysis.\n\n(Choice C) Iron deficiency anemia is associated with koilonychia, or scooped concavity of the nail bed (“spoon nails”), possibly due to chronic nutrient deficiency leading to regression of the nail matrix.\n\n(Choice E) Psoriatic nail dystrophy is due to primary involvement of the nail by psoriasis itself. It manifests as nail pitting, thickening, brittleness, and onycholysis (separation from the underlying nail bed).\n\nEducational objective:\nThe most common cause of digital clubbing in adults is pulmonary malignancy (especially lung adenocarcinoma). More generally, clubbing is a sign of chronic cardiopulmonary disease associated with activation of hypoxic-inflammatory signaling (eg, chronic chest infections, right-to-left shunting). {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "患者曾是吸烟者，并出现杵状指{{exhibit_2}}：指甲床和远端指骨增厚和增宽，使手指呈现球状鼓槌状。正常情况下，当两个相对的手指指甲相对时，在近端甲皱襞之间形成菱形空间；该空间消失提示杵状指。\n\n杵状指可见于心肺疾病状态，其中缺氧炎症通路被激活，释放血小板和成纤维细胞衍生的生长因子（尤其是血管内皮生长因子 [VEGF]），促进血小板在远端毛细血管床（手指、脚趾）中聚集/嵌入，进而导致局部纤维血管增生。\n\n肺腺癌（即肿瘤分泌的VEGF）是成人杵状指最常见的原因。杵状指的其他常见原因包括慢性胸部感染（例如，支气管扩张）和伴有低氧血症的心肺疾病（例如，发绀型心脏缺陷）。偶尔，杵状指与疼痛性骨膜反应和滑膜炎相关，称为肥大性肺性骨关节病，这是一种与肺腺癌密切相关的副肿瘤综合征。\n\n杵状指检查在临床上具有价值，因为它可能是肺癌的唯一可见体征，包括本来无症状的小型和可手术切除（可治愈）的肿瘤。因此，杵状指的存在应促使对胸部进行进一步的影像学检查以查找恶性肿瘤。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n(选项 A) 单纯的慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD，无低氧血症）本身与杵状指无关；COPD患者出现杵状指应促使进一步调查潜在并发症（例如，恶性肿瘤、支气管扩张、肺动脉高压）。此外，该患者呼吸音正常，使得COPD（例如，肺气肿，慢性支气管炎）的可能性降低。\n\n(选项 B) 慢性肾衰竭与“半甲半白”指甲（Lindsay指甲）相关，其特征是界限分明的横向白甲症。其机制尚不清楚，但不太可能与氮血症有关，因为移植肾后过渡线会消失，但血液透析后则不会消失。\n\n(选项 C) 缺铁性贫血与反甲症或甲床凹陷（“匙形甲”）相关，这可能是由于慢性营养缺乏导致甲母质退缩。\n\n(选项 E) 银屑病甲营养不良是由于银屑病本身主要累及指甲。表现为甲点状凹陷、增厚、脆弱和甲剥离（与下方甲床分离）。\n\n教育目标：\n成人杵状指最常见的原因是肺部恶性肿瘤（特别是肺腺癌）。更一般地说，杵状指是慢性心肺疾病的标志，与缺氧炎症信号传导的激活相关（例如，慢性胸部感染、右向左分流）。{{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"
