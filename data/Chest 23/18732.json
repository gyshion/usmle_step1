    "en": "A 46-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to shortness of breath, cough, and fever. The patient began experiencing mild upper respiratory illness a week ago. He has a history of asthma and was using inhaled bronchodilators more frequently since the onset of respiratory illness. Over the past 2 days, he has had worsening breathlessness, productive cough, and high fever. The patient has no other medical conditions. Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 28/min. On physical examination, the patient appears in severe respiratory distress with intercostal retractions. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing. Prompt endotracheal intubation for respiratory support is planned. Prior to endotracheal intubation, intravenous ketamine is administered for induction of anesthesia.",

    "en": "This hemodynamically unstable patient has severe bronchospasm and impending respiratory failure and requires intubation. Prior to intubation, anesthesia must be induced. Three medications are commonly used because of their rapid onset of action and short duration of effect.\n\n*   **Propofol:** A highly lipophilic GABA agonist that may be used for long-term sedation. Disadvantages include vasodilation, which can result in hypotension and an increase in serum triglycerides and lipase.\n*   **Etomidate:** A GABA agonist that has the advantage of being the most hemodynamically neutral. It does not cause changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or cardiac output. However, it inhibits cortisol synthesis, which can lead to (reversible) adrenocortical suppression. Because of this, it is often avoided in patients with septic shock, and it should not be used as maintenance of sedation after induction.\n*   **Ketamine:** An N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist that is similar to PCP; it preserves the respiratory drive during induction of anesthesia. In contrast to propofol and etomidate, it also provides an analgesic effect. Ketamine stimulates the release of catecholamines (ie, sympathomimetic), which can cause bronchodilation but also increase the heart rate, myocardial contractility, and cerebral blood flow, potentially putting the patient at risk for cardiovascular events or increased intracranial pressure.\n\nIn this patient with an acute asthma attack, ketamine was likely chosen because it stimulates release of catecholamines that increase sympathomimetic activity and may improve bronchospasm.\n\n**(Choice A)** Propofol and etomidate are both GABA agonists, but ketamine works at the NMDA receptor.\n\n**(Choice B)** Both ketamine and etomidate are much less lipophilic than propofol.\n\n**(Choice C)** Both ketamine and etomidate are metabolized primarily by the liver. Propofol is also metabolized by the liver, but the effect is terminated by its redistribution rather than metabolism.\n\n**(Choice D)** Neuromuscular blockade is often used to facilitate intubation. None of the three commonly used induction anesthetics cause significant neuromuscular blockade, so an additional medication (eg, succinylcholine, rocuronium) is used if needed.\n\nEducational objective:\nKetamine can be used for anesthesia induction. The side effects of increased catecholamine release (eg, bronchodilation) are often exploited in patients with bronchospasm.",
    "zh": "这位血流动力学不稳定的患者患有严重的支气管痉挛和即将发生的呼吸衰竭，需要插管。在插管前，必须进行麻醉诱导。由于这三种药物起效迅速且持续时间短，因此常被使用。\n\n*   **丙泊酚：** 一种高亲脂性GABA激动剂，可用于长期镇静。缺点包括血管舒张，这可能导致低血压以及血清甘油三酯和脂肪酶升高。\n*   **依托咪酯：** 一种GABA激动剂，其优点是血流动力学最中性。它不会引起心率、血压或心输出量的变化。然而，它会抑制皮质醇的合成，这可能导致（可逆的）肾上腺皮质抑制。因此，它通常用于脓毒性休克的患者，并且不应用于诱导后的镇静维持。\n*   **氯胺酮：** 一种N-甲基-D-天冬氨酸（NMDA）拮抗剂，与苯环利定（PCP）类似；它在麻醉诱导期间保持呼吸驱动力。与丙泊酚和依托咪酯相比，它还具有镇痛作用。氯胺酮刺激儿茶酚胺（即，拟交感神经）的释放，这可以引起支气管扩张，但也增加心率、心肌收缩力和脑血流量，可能使患者面临心血管事件或颅内压升高的风险。\n\n在这位患有急性哮喘发作的患者中，氯胺酮可能被选中，因为它刺激儿茶酚胺的释放，增加拟交感神经活性并可能改善支气管痉挛。\n\n**(选项A)** 丙泊酚和依托咪酯都是GABA激动剂，但氯胺酮作用于NMDA受体。\n\n**(选项B)** 氯胺酮和依托咪酯的亲脂性都远低于丙泊酚。\n\n**(选项C)** 氯胺酮和依托咪酯主要由肝脏代谢。丙泊酚也由肝脏代谢，但其作用由其重新分布而非代谢终止。\n\n**(选项D)** 神经肌肉阻滞常用于促进插管。这三种常用的麻醉诱导剂都不会引起显著的神经肌肉阻滞，因此，如果需要，会使用额外的药物（例如，琥珀酰胆碱、罗库溴铵）。\n\n教学目标：\n氯胺酮可用于麻醉诱导。增加儿茶酚胺释放（例如，支气管扩张）的副作用常常被用于支气管痉挛患者。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of appropriate anesthetic agents for intubation in a patient with asthma exacerbation. It requires understanding the mechanism of action and effects of different induction agents, particularly ketamine's sympathomimetic properties.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the patient's bronchospasm and the need for an agent that can improve it. Ketamine's sympathomimetic activity, leading to bronchodilation, makes it the most suitable choice in this scenario.",
