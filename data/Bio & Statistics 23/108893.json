  "explanation": {
    "en": "For autosomal recessive disorders, an affected child must inherit a mutant allele from each parent; for 2 healthy parents to conceive an affected child (aa), they must each be a carrier for the disease (Aa). The probability of conceiving an affected child is equal to the **probability of both parents being carriers** multiplied by the **probability of each parent transmitting** the mutant allele:\n\nP(affected child) = P(carrier mother) × P(carrier father) × P(both parents transmitting a mutant allele)\n\n*   P(carrier mother): The **woman has siblings affected** (aa) by the disease; because the **woman’s parents are not affected** (ie, not aa), both of the woman’s parents must be carriers (Aa). This allows for the following genotypes in the woman:\n    *   Homozygous mutant\n    *   Heterozygous carrier with her mother’s mutant allele\n    *   Heterozygous carrier with the father’s mutant allele\n    *   Homozygous normal\n\nHowever, because the woman is healthy, she **cannot be homozygous** for the mutant allele; she must have one of the **3 remaining genotypes**:\n\n*   Heterozygous carrier with her mother’s mutant allele\n    *   Heterozygous carrier with the father’s mutant allele\n    *   Homozygous normal\n\nTherefore, the woman has a **2 in 3** probability of being a carrier.\n\n*   P(carrier father): The man’s genotype is unknown and he has **no relevant family history**; therefore, the probability of him being a carrier is equal to the carrier frequency in the general population, or **1 in 200**.\n\n*   P(both parents transmitting a mutant allele): Finally, assuming both parents are carriers, the probability of both parents independently transmitting a mutant allele is (1/2) × (1/2), or **1/4**.\n\nP(affected child) = 2/3 × 1/200 × 1/4 = 1 in 1,200\n\nTherefore, the probability of this couple conceiving an affected child is 1 in 1,200.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe probability that two healthy parents will conceive a child with an autosomal recessive disorder is equal to the probability of both parents being carriers multiplied by the probability of the child inheriting a mutant allele from each parent.",
    "zh": "对于常染色体隐性遗传病，受影响的孩子必须从每个父母那里遗传一个突变等位基因；对于 2 个健康的父母生下一个受影响的孩子 (aa)，他们都必须是该疾病的携带者 (Aa)。生下受影响孩子的概率等于**双方父母均为携带者的概率**乘以**每个父母传递**突变等位基因的**概率**：\n\nP(受影响孩子) = P(携带者母亲) × P(携带者父亲) × P(双方父母传递突变等位基因)\n\n*   P(携带者母亲)：由于该**女子有患病** (aa) 的兄弟姐妹，而**女子的父母未受影响** (即，并非 aa)，女子的父母都必须是携带者 (Aa)。这使得该女子有以下基因型：\n    *   纯合突变型\n    *   携带母亲突变等位基因的杂合子\n    *   携带父亲突变等位基因的杂合子\n    *   纯合正常型\n\n然而，由于该女子是健康的，她**不可能为纯合子**，必须有**剩余 3 种基因型**中的一种：\n\n*   携带母亲突变等位基因的杂合子\n    *   携带父亲突变等位基因的杂合子\n    *   纯合正常型\n\n因此，该女子是携带者的概率为**2/3**。\n\n*   P(携带者父亲)：该男子的基因型未知，并且**没有相关的家族史**；因此，他成为携带者的概率等于普通人群中的携带者频率，即**1/200**。\n\n*   P(双方父母传递突变等位基因)：最后，假设双方父母都是携带者，双方父母独立传递突变等位基因的概率为 (1/2) × (1/2)，即**1/4**。\n\nP(受影响孩子) = 2/3 × 1/200 × 1/4 = 1/1200\n\n因此，这对夫妇生下患有该疾病的孩子的概率是 1/1200。\n\n教育目标：\n两个健康父母生下患有常染色体隐性遗传病孩子的概率等于双方父母均为携带者的概率乘以孩子从每个父母那里遗传突变等位基因的概率。"

    "en": "This question assesses the ability to calculate the probability of offspring inheriting an autosomal recessive disorder, given parental carrier probabilities derived from family history and general population carrier frequency. It tests knowledge of Mendelian genetics and risk assessment in genetic counseling. \n\nTo solve this problem, first determine the woman's probability of being a carrier based on her affected siblings. Then, identify the man's carrier probability based on the general population frequency. Finally, calculate the probability of both parents being carriers and each passing on the recessive allele to their child.",
