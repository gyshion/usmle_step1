  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with \"emotional ups and downs\" and tearfulness, exhaustion, and self-doubt soon after delivery most likely has the POSTPARTUM BLUES, a common but typically SELF-LIMITING condition. Mild depressive symptoms (eg, intermittent sadness, tearfulness, irritability) typically begin 2-3 days after delivery and resolve within 14 days. The postpartum blues are usually managed with enhanced psychosocial support and observation. However, POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION (ie, major depressive disorder with peripartum onset) shares OVERLAPPING SYMPTOMS (eg, tearfulness, sleep disturbance). In addition, it is common for patients to underreport depressive symptoms due to feelings of inadequacy or shame about fulfilling preconceived maternal roles (eg, \"I'm not doing things right\"). For these reasons, patients who report mood symptoms soon after delivery require PROMPT EVALUATION for postpartum depression rather than delaying evaluation until the routine 6-week postpartum visit (Choice E). An IN-PERSON ASSESSMENT is preferable to an evaluation via telephone because meeting face-to-face encourages sharing of sensitive topics (eg, guilt, suicidal ideation) and provides a more controlled and private setting. Therefore, the most appropriate response is to use this phone call to validate the patient's experience (eg, \"postpartum hormonal shifts can cause mood changes\"), SCREEN FOR IMMEDIATE SAFETY (eg, thoughts about harming the baby), and SCHEDULE AN OFFICE VISIT as soon as possible. In contrast to this patient, those who disclose SUICIDAL OR HOMOCIDAL IDEATION require immediate evaluation in the emergency department.\n\n(Choices A and B) It can be helpful to offer reassurance and normalize the postpartum blues (eg, \"adjusting to life with a newborn is challenging and takes time,\" \"your symptoms are very common\"). However, advising the patient to call if symptoms \"worsen\" or to give herself \"time to adjust\" disregards her current struggles and may be perceived as dismissive. In addition, mood changes after delivery should be evaluated in-person given the potential for underreporting of symptoms and undiagnosed postpartum depression.\n\n(Choice C) Patients with postpartum blues are at increased risk for postpartum depression; however, further evaluation and safety screening are required prior to referring to another clinician.\n\nEducational objective: Postpartum blues is a common, self-limiting condition that begins several days postpartum and resolves within 14 days. However, due to underreporting of depressive symptoms and the risk for progression to postpartum depression, patients who report mood symptoms soon after delivery require a prompt in-person evaluation.",
    "zh": "这位患者在分娩后不久就出现“情绪起伏”和流泪、疲惫和自我怀疑，很可能患有POSTPARTUM BLUES，这是一种常见但通常是SELF-LIMITING的疾病。 轻度抑郁症状（例如，间歇性悲伤、流泪、易怒）通常在分娩后2-3天开始，并在14天内缓解。 产后情绪低落通常通过加强心理社会支持和观察来管理。 然而，POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION（即，围产期发病的重度抑郁症）具有重叠的SYMPTOMS（例如，流泪、睡眠障碍）。 此外，由于对履行先入为主的母性角色（例如，“我没有把事情做好”）感到不足或羞耻，患者通常会低报抑郁症状。 由于这些原因，在分娩后不久报告情绪症状的患者需要对产后抑郁症进行PROMPT EVALUATION，而不是推迟评估直到例行的产后6周复诊（选择E）。 IN-PERSON ASSESSMENT优于通过电话进行的评估，因为面对面的会面鼓励分享敏感话题（例如，内疚感、自杀意念），并提供一个更受控和私密的环境。 因此，最合适的反应是使用这次电话呼叫来验证患者的经历（例如，“产后激素变化会导致情绪变化”），SCREEN FOR IMMEDIATE SAFETY（例如，关于伤害婴儿的想法），并尽快SCHEDULE AN OFFICE VISIT。 与该患者相比，那些透露SUICIDAL OR HOMOCIDAL IDEATION的人需要立即在急诊科进行评估。\n\n（选项A和B）提供保证并使产后情绪低落正常化（例如，“适应新生儿的生活具有挑战性并且需要时间”，“您的症状很常见”）可能有所帮助。 然而，建议患者如果症状“恶化”或给自己“时间去适应”而不顾她当前的挣扎，这可能被认为是不屑一顾。 此外，分娩后的情绪变化应进行亲自评估，因为患者可能低报症状和未确诊的产后抑郁症。\n\n（选项C）患有产后情绪低落的患者患产后抑郁症的风险增加； 然而，在转诊给另一位临床医生之前，需要进一步评估和安全筛查。\n\n教育目标：产后情绪低落是一种常见的、自限性疾病，在产后几天开始，并在14天内缓解。 然而，由于抑郁症状的低报以及进展为产后抑郁症的风险，在分娩后不久报告情绪症状的患者需要及时的亲自评估。"
