    "en": "A 79-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department from the nursing home due to explosive diarrhea. Laboratory studies show leukocytosis, and results from a stool specimen return positive for *Clostridioides difficile*. Three days later, one of the nurses who cared for the patient at the nursing home is admitted with diarrhea and is found to have *C difficile* infection. However, the other nurses who also took care of the patient are asymptomatic and do not develop the infection. If all the nurses were similarly exposed to *C difficile*, which of the following is the most likely reason that the asymptomatic nurses did not develop the infection?",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Over 400 types of bacteria inhabit the healthy human gastrointestinal tract as part of the normal **intestinal microbiome**. In healthy individuals, a very small percentage of these are aerobes (eg, *Pseudomonas*), approximately 10% are facultative anaerobes (eg, *Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Bacillus*), and the majority are strict anaerobes (eg, *Bacteroides, Fusobacterium*). These intestinal bacteria effectively **suppress** **overgrowth of *Clostridioides difficile*** and other potentially pathogenic bacteria by competing for nutrients and adhesion sites within the gut.\n\n**Alteration** of the intestinal microbiome can lead to overgrowth of pathogenic strains and symptomatic *C difficile* infection (CDI). This most commonly occurs due to **antibiotic therapy** but can also be caused by **gastric acid suppression** (eg, proton pump inhibitor use). *C difficile* causes disease by releasing 2 toxins that damage the mucosal lining of the large intestine, leading to diarrhea (toxin A) and necrosis (toxin B) with pseudomembrane formation.\n\n(Choice A) Increased risk of CDI is seen with proton pump inhibitor use, suggesting that gastric acidity may have a protective role. However, there is no association between pancreatic enzyme secretion and CDI.\n\n(Choice B) Cell-mediated immunity is **not essential** for prevention of CDI, but it is required to eradicate infections with intracellular agents that avoid the humoral (antibody) immune response (eg, *Legionella, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Listeria monocytogenes, viruses, Leishmania*).\n\n(Choice C) Individuals usually develop serum antibodies against *C difficile* toxins, not spores (the inactive, dormant form of the bacteria).\n\n(Choice E) Rapid gastrointestinal transit is rarely effective at \"washing away\" pathogenic diarrhea-causing organisms as they are well adapted to adhering to the gut mucosa in the setting of voluminous diarrhea.\n\nEducational objective:\nAlteration of the normal intestinal microbial flora (eg, antibiotic therapy, gastric acid suppression) can allow overgrowth of pathogenic strains of *Clostridioides difficile*, which produce enterotoxin (toxin A) and cytotoxin (toxin B). Clinical disease can range from transient diarrhea to severe pseudomembranous colitis.",
    "zh": "超过400种细菌栖息在健康的人类胃肠道中，构成正常的**肠道微生物组**的一部分。在健康个体中，只有一小部分是需氧菌（例如，*假单胞菌属*），大约10%是兼性厌氧菌（例如，*大肠杆菌、克雷伯菌属、乳杆菌属、芽孢杆菌属*），而大多数是专性厌氧菌（例如，*拟杆菌属、梭菌属*）。这些肠道细菌通过竞争营养物质和肠道内的粘附位点，有效地**抑制** **艰难梭菌的过度生长**和其他潜在的病原性细菌。\n\n肠道微生物组的**改变**可导致病原菌株的过度生长和有症状的艰难梭菌感染（CDI）。这种情况最常发生于**抗生素治疗**，但也可能由**胃酸抑制**（例如，质子泵抑制剂的使用）引起。艰难梭菌通过释放2种毒素来引起疾病，这些毒素会损害大肠的粘膜内层，导致腹泻（毒素A）和坏死（毒素B），伴有假膜形成。\n\n(选项A) 使用质子泵抑制剂会增加CDI的风险，这表明胃酸可能具有保护作用。然而，胰酶分泌与CDI之间没有关联。\n\n(选项B) 细胞介导的免疫对于预防CDI**并非必要**，但它对于根除避免体液（抗体）免疫反应的细胞内病原体（例如，*军团菌、淋病奈瑟菌、单核细胞增生李斯特菌、病毒、利什曼原虫*）至关重要。\n\n(选项C) 个人通常会产生针对艰难梭菌毒素的血清抗体，而不是孢子（细菌的非活性、休眠形式）。\n\n(选项E) 快速的胃肠道转运很少能有效地“清除”引起腹泻的病原体，因为它们在大量腹泻的情况下很好地适应了粘附于肠道粘膜。\n\n教育目标：\n正常肠道菌群的改变（例如，抗生素治疗、胃酸抑制）可导致艰难梭菌的病原菌株过度生长，从而产生肠毒素（毒素A）和细胞毒素（毒素B）。临床疾病的范围从短暂性腹泻到严重的假膜性结肠炎。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the role of the intestinal microbiome in preventing *Clostridioides difficile* infection (CDI). It also assesses understanding of factors that disrupt the normal gut flora and increase susceptibility to CDI.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that a preserved intestinal microbiome effectively suppresses the overgrowth of *C. difficile* by competing for nutrients and adhesion sites. Understanding the risk factors for CDI, such as antibiotic use and gastric acid suppression, is also helpful.",
