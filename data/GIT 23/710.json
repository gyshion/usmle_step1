    "en": "A 5-week-old boy is brought to the emergency department after having tonic-clonic movements of his left upper and lower extremity that lasted approximately 3 minutes. The patient was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 23-year-old primigravid woman. The mother received normal prenatal care, took prenatal vitamins, and had a healthy diet during pregnancy. The infant's newborn screen was positive for cystic fibrosis, and confirmatory testing is pending. The infant has been breastfeeding exclusively. He has never taken any medications and has received no vaccinations. On examination, the infant is postictal. A CT scan of the head shows a right-sided intracranial hemorrhage. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this infant's presentation?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This infant has a right-sided intracranial hemorrhage causing contralateral seizure activity. In an infant who has not received any medications, the most likely cause of bleeding is VITAMIN K deficiency. Newborns physiologically have low vitamin K stores due to poor transplacental transfer and inefficient use by the liver. Additional risk factors include exclusive breastfeeding, due to the low vitamin K content of breast milk, and CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF), due to malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).\n\nVitamin K is an essential cofactor for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase, an enzyme that carboxylates COAGULATION factors II, VII, IX, and X. Carboxylation allows for the creation of calcium-binding sites, which attract clotting factors to negatively charged phospholipids on platelets and endothelial cells, which is necessary for efficient coagulation. Vitamin K deficiency leads to impaired clotting factor activity.\n\nNewborns who do not receive routine VITAMIN K prophylaxis at birth are at greatest risk for vitamin K-deficient bleeding. Lack of functioning coagulation factors predisposes to life-threatening bleeding, such as INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE and profuse bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, umbilicus, and surgical sites.\n\n(Choice A) Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) deficiency results in defective collagen synthesis due to failure of hydroxylation of proline and lysine. Mucosal bleeding and skin bruising are typical and occur in severely malnourished individuals and those who misuse drugs or alcohol. Breast milk provides adequate ascorbic acid.\n\n(Choice B) Vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency results in failure of formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are required for fatty-acid oxidation and synthesis, respectively. Niacin deficiency presents with pellagra (ie, dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia), not intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n(Choices C and F) Patients with CF are at risk for deficiency of vitamins A and D. Vitamin A deficiency impairs rhodopsin formation and leads to night blindness and xerophthalmia, not bleeding. Reduced activation of intranuclear receptors occurs in vitamin D deficiency. Although vitamin D is poorly absorbed from breast milk, deficiency causes rickets (eg, craniotabes), not bleeding diathesis.\n\n(Choice E) Erythropoiesis requires folate, deficiency of which leads to megaloblastic anemia, not hemorrhage.\n\nEducational objective:\nVitamin K is necessary for carboxylation of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. Newborns who do not receive prophylactic supplementation are at risk for life-threatening bleeding (eg, intracranial hemorrhage). Patients with cystic fibrosis are also at increased risk for vitamin K deficiency due to malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins.",
    "zh": "该婴儿患有右侧颅内出血，导致对侧癫痫发作。对于未接受任何药物治疗的婴儿来说，最有可能的出血原因是维生素K缺乏症。新生儿由于胎盘转运不良和肝脏利用效率低下，生理上维生素K储存量较低。其他危险因素包括纯母乳喂养（由于母乳中维生素K含量较低）和囊性纤维化 (CF)（由于脂溶性维生素（A、D、E、K）吸收不良）。\n\n维生素K是γ-谷氨酰羧化酶（一种羧化凝血因子II、VII、IX和X的酶）的必需辅助因子。羧化作用允许形成钙结合位点，这些位点吸引凝血因子与血小板和内皮细胞上带负电荷的磷脂结合，这对于有效的凝血至关重要。维生素K缺乏症会导致凝血因子活性受损。\n\n未在出生时接受常规维生素K预防的新生儿，发生维生素K缺乏症相关出血的风险最高。缺乏功能的凝血因子容易导致危及生命的出血，例如颅内出血，以及来自胃肠道、脐部和手术部位的出血。\n\n（选项 A）维生素C（抗坏血酸）缺乏会导致脯氨酸和赖氨酸羟化失败，从而导致胶原蛋白合成缺陷。黏膜出血和皮肤瘀伤是典型的表现，多见于严重营养不良的个体以及滥用药物或酒精的人。母乳提供充足的抗坏血酸。\n\n（选项 B）维生素B3（烟酸）缺乏会导致烟酰胺腺嘌呤二核苷酸（NAD）和烟酰胺腺嘌呤二核苷酸磷酸（NADP）形成失败，而这两种物质分别是脂肪酸氧化和合成所必需的。烟酸缺乏症表现为糙皮病（即皮炎、腹泻、痴呆），而不是颅内出血。\n\n（选项 C 和 F）囊性纤维化患者有发生维生素A和D缺乏症的风险。维生素A缺乏会损害视紫红质的形成，并导致夜盲症和眼干燥症，而不是出血。维生素D缺乏症时，核内受体的活化会减少。尽管维生素D难以从母乳中吸收，但缺乏症会导致佝偻病（例如颅软化），而不是出血素质。\n\n（选项 E）红细胞生成需要叶酸，缺乏叶酸会导致巨幼细胞性贫血，而不是出血。\n\n教育目标：\n维生素K是羧化凝血因子II、VII、IX和X所必需的。未接受预防性补充的新生儿有发生危及生命出血（例如颅内出血）的风险。囊性纤维化患者由于脂溶性维生素吸收不良，发生维生素K缺乏症的风险也增加。"
