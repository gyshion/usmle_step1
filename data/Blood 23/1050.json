  "explanation": {
    "en": "Tumor lysis syndrome is an oncologic emergency. It often develops during chemotherapy for high-grade lymphomas, leukemias, and other tumors that have rapid cell turnover and high sensitivity to chemotherapy. When a large number of tumor cells are destroyed during chemotherapy, intracellular ions, such as potassium, phosphorous, and uric acid (a metabolite of tumor nucleic acid), are released into the serum and are then filtered by the kidneys.\n\nUric acid (pKa = 5.4) is soluble at physiologic pH, but precipitates in an acidic environment. The lowest pH along the nephron is found in the distal tubules and collecting ducts; so these are the segments of the nephron that become obstructed by uric acid crystals. Obstructive uropathy and acute renal failure follow.\n\nThe risk of tumor lysis syndrome can be reduced by urine alkalinization and hydration. Additionally, allopurinol (a xanthine oxidase inhibitor) is used to reduce uric acid production during the breakdown of tumor cells.\n\n(Choice D) Ignore the anatomy portion of choice D and evaluate the latter portion. A \"high urine flow rate\" would universally decrease uric acid crystallization and precipitation. Therefore, this cannot possibly be the correct answer.\n\n(Choices A, B and C) Uric acid does not precipitate in proximal tubules or in Henle's loop.\n\nEducational Objective: \nTumor lysis syndrome occurs when tumors with a high cell turnover are treated with chemotherapy. The lysis of tumor cells causes intracellular ions, such as potassium and phosphorous, and uric acid (metabolite of tumor nucleic acid) to be released into serum. Uric acid is soluble at physiologic pH, but it can precipitate in the normally acidic environment of distal tubules and collecting ducts. The prevention of tumor lysis syndrome includes urine alkalinization and hydration, as high urine flow and high pH along the nephron prevents crystallization and precipitation of uric acid.",
    "zh": "肿瘤溶解综合征是一种肿瘤急症。它通常发生在针对高度恶性淋巴瘤、白血病和其他具有快速细胞更新和对化疗高度敏感的肿瘤的化疗期间。当大量肿瘤细胞在化疗期间被破坏时，细胞内离子（如钾、磷和尿酸（肿瘤核酸的代谢物））被释放到血清中，然后被肾脏过滤。\n\n尿酸 (pKa = 5.4) 在生理 pH 值下可溶，但在酸性环境中会沉淀。沿肾单位的最低 pH 值位于远曲小管和集合管；因此，这些是肾单位中被尿酸晶体阻塞的段。随后出现梗阻性尿路病和急性肾衰。\n\n可以通过尿液碱化和补液来降低肿瘤溶解综合征的风险。此外，别嘌呤醇（黄嘌呤氧化酶抑制剂）用于减少肿瘤细胞分解过程中尿酸的产生。\n\n(选项 D) 忽略选项 D 的解剖部分，并评估后一部分。“高尿流速”将普遍降低尿酸的结晶和沉淀。因此，这绝对不可能是正确的答案。\n\n(选项 A、B 和 C) 尿酸不会在近曲小管或亨利襻中沉淀。\n\n教育目标：\n当对细胞更新率高的肿瘤进行化疗时，就会发生肿瘤溶解综合征。肿瘤细胞的溶解会导致细胞内离子（如钾和磷）以及尿酸（肿瘤核酸的代谢物）释放到血清中。尿酸在生理 pH 值下可溶，但它可以在远曲小管和集合管的正常酸性环境中沉淀。肿瘤溶解综合征的预防包括尿液碱化和补液，因为高尿流和肾单位的高 pH 值可防止尿酸的结晶和沉淀。"
