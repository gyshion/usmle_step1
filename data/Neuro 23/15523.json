    "en": "A 6-year-old boy is brought to the office due to frequent nighttime awakenings. Several times a week over the past month, he has come to his parents' bed around 3 AM, frequently crying, appearing frightened, and saying that he became lost in a crowd and couldn't find his parents. Although he is comforted by their reassurance, he refuses to return to his room and eventually falls back asleep in their bed. The boy is about to start first grade at a new school. He is healthy and developmental milestones are normal. Examination shows no abnormalities.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This boy's recurrent awakenings with associated dream content and ability to be comforted are characteristic of nightmares, a common and developmentally normal experience for most children. Nightmares occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and are more frequent in the final third of the night when REM periods become longer (Choice A). Children can often describe the nightmare, become fully alert after awakening, and are typically able to be consoled. In contrast, sleep terrors are a common non-REM parasomnia of childhood that occur during slow-wave sleep in the first third of the night. Unlike nightmares, the child with sleep terrors does not fully awaken, is unresponsive to comfort, and has no associated dream content.\n\nREM sleep is characterized by the defining feature of rapid eye movements, vivid dreaming, and voluntary muscle atonia due to inhibition of motor neurons. EEG activity during REM sleep is similar to the waking state, consisting of a combination of alpha, beta, and desynchronous EEG waves (sawtooth waves).\n\n(Choices B, D, and E) These EEG findings are characteristic of different sub stages of non-REM sleep (typically divided into 3 stages). Theta waves are seen in stage 1 (transition from wakefulness to sleep) and stage 2 (light, stable sleep). Sleep spindles and K complexes are characteristic of stage 2. Delta waves are characteristic of slow-wave sleep or deep sleep (stage 3).\n\nNon-REM arousal disorders (eg. sleep terrors) often occur in stage 3.\n\nEducational objective:\nREM sleep is characterized by dreaming and voluntary muscle paralysis, and occurs more often during the final third of the night. Nightmares occur during REM sleep and can be differentiated from sleep terrors, a non-REM parasomnia characterized by incomplete arousals and lack of recall of dream content.",
    "zh": "这名男孩反复醒来，伴有梦的内容，并且能够被安慰，这符合噩梦的特征，这对于大多数儿童来说是一种常见且发育正常的经历。噩梦发生在快速眼动（REM）睡眠期间，并且在夜间最后三分之一时更频繁，此时REM时相变得更长（选项A）。儿童通常可以描述噩梦，醒来后完全清醒，并且通常能够被安慰。相反，梦魇是儿童时期常见的非REM睡眠异态，发生在夜间前三分之一的慢波睡眠期间。与噩梦不同，患有梦魇的儿童不会完全醒来，对安慰无反应，并且没有相关的梦的内容。\n\nREM睡眠的特征是快速眼动、生动的梦境和由于运动神经元抑制引起的随意肌肉张力低下。REM睡眠期间的脑电图活动类似于清醒状态，由α、β和去同步化脑电波（锯齿波）组成。\n\n（选项B、D和E）这些脑电图结果是不同非REM睡眠亚阶段的特征（通常分为3个阶段）。θ波出现在第1阶段（从清醒到睡眠的过渡）和第2阶段（轻度、稳定睡眠）。睡眠纺锤波和K复合波是第2阶段的特征。δ波是慢波睡眠或深度睡眠（第3阶段）的特征。\n\n非REM觉醒障碍（例如，梦魇）经常发生在第3阶段。\n\n教育目标：\nREM睡眠的特征是做梦和随意肌肉麻痹，并且更经常发生在夜间最后三分之一的时间。噩梦发生在REM睡眠期间，并且可以与梦魇区分开来，梦魇是一种非REM睡眠异态，其特征是不完全觉醒和缺乏对梦内容的记忆。"
