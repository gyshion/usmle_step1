    "en": "A 25-year-old man fractures his right tibia in a motor vehicle collision. His right leg is fixed in a cast, and he requires underarm crutches to ambulate. Two weeks later, the patient comes to the clinic with right upper extremity weakness and numbness. He has no neck or arm pain. The patient is concerned because he is right handed and cannot perform his duties as an electrician. On neurologic examination, there is diminished strength on extension of the right wrist with an absent triceps reflex. {{exhibit_1}}",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is E. The radial nerve is derived from the C5-T1 spinal nerves and is 1 of the 2 final branches of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. The nerve initially courses medial to the surgical neck of the humerus inferior to the teres major muscle within the axilla before entering the posterior arm to course between the long head of the triceps brachii and the posterior humerus. {{exhibit_2}} Proximal radial nerve injury can occur at the nerve's superficial position within the axilla by repetitive pressure/trauma caused by an ill-fitting crutch (crutch palsy) or if an individual sleeps with the arm over a chair (Saturday night palsy). Injury at this location may cause weakness or paralysis of the forearm, hand, and finger extensor muscles (eg, wrist drop, absent triceps reflex). Sensory loss may also be observed over the radial nerve distribution. Injuries to the radial nerve as it crosses the posterior humerus (eg, midshaft humeral fractures) spare the triceps brachii, as the fibers innervating this muscle leave the nerve before entering the radial groove. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} (Choice A) The accessory nerve (CN XI) exits the skull through the jugular foramen and courses over the levator scapulae muscle to innervate the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. Injury to CN XI can occur during cervical lymph node dissection. (Choice B) Fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus and anterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint can cause injury to the axillary nerve. The resultant paralysis of the deltoid and teres minor muscles causes weakness on arm abduction. Sensory loss over the deltoid may also be evident. (Choice C) Damage to the long thoracic nerve causes paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle and winging of the scapula. This nerve is often injured during axillary lymph node dissection in patients undergoing radical mastectomy. (Choice D) Proximal median nerve injury often occurs with supracondylar humerus fractures. This results in sensory loss over the palmar aspect of the first 3 digits and impairment of thumb flexion/opposition, flexion of the second/third digits, and wrist flexion/abduction. (Choice F) The suprascapular nerve provides sensation to the shoulder joint and innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. Suprascapular nerve entrapment results in shoulder pain and weakness of arm abduction and external rotation. Educational objective: Radial nerve injury can occur with repetitive pressure/trauma at the axilla (eg, improperly fitted crutches). Findings include weakness of the forearm, hand, and fingers extensors (eg, wrist drop, absent triceps reflex) and sensory loss over the posterior arm and forearm, dorsolateral hand, and dorsal thumb. More distal lesions spare the triceps brachii.",
    "zh": "正确答案是E。桡神经起源于C5-T1脊神经，是臂丛后束的2条终末分支之一。该神经最初在腋下，在肱骨外科颈的内侧，在冈下肌下方走行，然后进入后臂，在肱三头肌长头和肱骨后方之间走行。{{exhibit_2}} 近端桡神经损伤可发生在腋下神经的浅表位置，由不合适的拐杖（拐杖麻痹）引起的重复性压力/创伤或个体将手臂搭在椅子上睡觉（周六夜麻痹）引起。该位置的损伤可能导致前臂、手和手指伸肌无力或麻痹（例如，腕下垂、肱三头肌反射消失）。也可能观察到桡神经分布区域的感觉缺失。当桡神经穿过后肱骨时（例如，肱骨中段骨折），肱三头肌得以保留，因为支配该肌肉的纤维在进入桡神经沟之前就离开了神经。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} (选项A) 副神经（CN XI）通过颈静脉孔离开颅骨，并沿着肩胛提肌走行，支配胸锁乳突肌和斜方肌。CN XI损伤可发生在颈部淋巴结清扫术中。(选项B) 肱骨外科颈骨折和肩肱关节前脱位可导致腋神经损伤。由此导致的三角肌和小圆肌麻痹会导致手臂外展无力。三角肌上的感觉缺失也可能很明显。(选项C) 胸长神经损伤会导致前锯肌麻痹和肩胛骨翼状。该神经通常在接受根治性乳房切除术的患者的腋窝淋巴结清扫术中受伤。(选项D) 近端正中神经损伤常发生于肱骨髁上骨折。这会导致前3个手指的掌侧感觉缺失，并导致拇指屈曲/对掌、第二/第三个手指屈曲和腕屈曲/外展受损。(选项F) 冈上神经为肩关节提供感觉，并支配冈上肌和冈下肌。冈上神经卡压会导致肩部疼痛和手臂外展和外旋无力。教育目标：桡神经损伤可发生在腋窝的重复性压力/创伤（例如，不合适的拐杖）。结果包括前臂、手和手指伸肌无力（例如，腕下垂、肱三头肌反射消失）以及后臂和前臂、手背外侧和拇指背侧的感觉缺失。更远端的病变保留了肱三头肌。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of peripheral nerve injuries, specifically focusing on the clinical presentation and anatomical localization of radial nerve palsy, particularly in the context of crutch use. It requires correlating symptoms like wrist drop, absent triceps reflex, and sensory deficits with the specific nerve involved.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully analyzing the patient's symptoms, including motor deficits (weakness in wrist and finger extension, absent triceps reflex) and sensory complaints, and relating them to the anatomical course and innervation patterns of the listed peripheral nerves. Identifying that the triceps reflex is spared is a key differentiator pointing away from more proximal brachial plexus injuries and towards a lesion distal to the origin of the nerve supplying the triceps.",
    "zh": "此题考察了对周围神经损伤的理解，特别侧重于桡神经麻痹的临床表现和解剖定位，尤其是在使用拐杖的背景下。它需要将腕下垂、肱三头肌反射消失和感觉缺陷等症状与所涉及的特定神经联系起来。\n\n解决此问题的方法包括仔细分析患者的症状，包括运动功能障碍（腕和手指伸展无力、肱三头肌反射消失）和感觉主诉，并将它们与所列周围神经的解剖走行和支配模式联系起来。确定肱三头肌反射未受影响是一个关键的区别，它指向了远离更近端的臂丛神经损伤，而指向了供应肱三头肌的神经起点的远端病变。"
