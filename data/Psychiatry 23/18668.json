    "en": "A 45-year-old woman with a history of opioid use disorder and HIV infection is brought to the emergency department due to worsening lethargy. The patient receives methadone maintenance therapy, which she recently restarted after being hospitalized for an HIV-related infection. Her infection improved after inpatient treatment, and she continues to take appropriate antimicrobials as an outpatient. Her current temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 116/68 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 10/min. On physical examination, the patient is somnolent and withdraws all extremities to painful stimuli. The pupils are small and sluggish to react. Brain imaging reveals no new findings, and renal function tests are within normal limits.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's presentation of somnolence, miosis, and respiratory depression is consistent with OPIOID TOXICITY. She is on methadone maintenance therapy, and her lethargy has worsened. The most likely cause of her opioid toxicity is an interaction with one of her medications that increases methadone levels. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication that is metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 system, particularly CYP3A4. Methadone is also extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. Fluconazole inhibits CYP3A4, which can significantly increase plasma methadone concentrations, leading to opioid toxicity. The table lists fluconazole as a common medication that increases methadone effect. \n\n(Choices A and B) Atovaquone and dapsone are alternative agents used to prevent pneumocystis pneumonia in patients with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole allergy. Common side effects of dapsone include hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia, particularly in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Neither medication has significant interactions with methadone. \n\n(Choice D) Rifampin is used in the treatment of multiple mycobacterial infections. It is a cytochrome P-450 inducer and can result in lower plasma concentrations of methadone, thereby decreasing its effects. \n\n(Choice E) Valganciclovir is used for treatment and secondary prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus retinitis. Side effects include bone marrow suppression and diarrhea. It does not interact with methadone.\n\nKey pearls:\n- Methadone is metabolized by CYP3A4.\n- Fluconazole inhibits CYP3A4, increasing methadone levels and risk of toxicity.\n- Rifampin induces CYP3A4, decreasing methadone levels and risk of withdrawal.",
    "zh": "患者表现出嗜睡、缩瞳和呼吸抑制，这与阿片类药物毒性一致。她正在接受美沙酮维持治疗，并且她的嗜睡有所加重。她出现阿片类药物毒性最可能的原因是她的一种药物与美沙酮发生相互作用，导致美沙酮水平升高。氟康唑是一种抗真菌药物，由细胞色素 P-450 系统（特别是 CYP3A4）代谢。美沙酮也主要由 CYP3A4 代谢。氟康唑抑制 CYP3A4，这会显著增加血浆中美沙酮的浓度，从而导致阿片类药物毒性。该表将氟康唑列为一种常见的会增加美沙酮作用的药物。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）阿托伐醌和氨苯砜是用于预防对复方新诺明过敏的患者发生肺孢子虫肺炎的替代药物。氨苯砜的常见副作用包括溶血性贫血和高铁血红蛋白血症，尤其是在患有葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶缺乏症的患者中。这两种药物均与美沙酮没有显著的相互作用。\n\n（选项 D）利福平用于治疗多种分枝杆菌感染。它是一种细胞色素 P-450 诱导剂，可导致血浆中美沙酮浓度降低，从而降低其作用。\n\n（选项 E）缬更昔洛韦用于治疗和二级预防巨细胞病毒性视网膜炎。副作用包括骨髓抑制和腹泻。它不与美沙酮相互作用。\n\n关键要点：\n- 美沙酮由 CYP3A4 代谢。\n- 氟康唑抑制 CYP3A4，增加美沙酮水平和中毒风险。\n- 利福平诱导 CYP3A4，降低美沙酮水平和戒断风险。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of drug-drug interactions, specifically how certain medications can affect the metabolism of methadone, leading to toxicity. It requires knowledge of common antifungal agents and their metabolic pathways, as well as the pharmacokinetics of methadone.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the patient's symptoms suggestive of opioid toxicity. Then, consider the patient's medication list and evaluate potential interactions with methadone, focusing on drugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A4, the primary enzyme responsible for methadone metabolism.",
