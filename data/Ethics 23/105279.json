  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Patients may ask various types of questions, from inquiries about the physician's professional qualifications and experience to more personal questions about the physician's background and life experiences (including age, marital status, children, and similar experiences such as cancer, a particular medical diagnosis, and loss of a loved one). Some may be especially curious to know personal details that relate to their own life struggles, often triggered by unspoken hopes and fears about whether the physician will be able to help them.\n\nAlthough being responsive to a patient's questions can enhance a trusting relationship, physicians should not feel pressured to respond to questions that they find overly personal or intrusive. However, physicians can maintain boundaries while also gently exploring why the patient is asking. This approach can be helpful in gaining a deeper understanding of the patient's concerns. Querying about what makes this patient ask the question may reveal specific concerns about whether the physician understands her emotional pain and may allay possible fears about psychotherapy. The physician can then more effectively support the patient and address these concerns.\n\n(Choice A) This response ignores the patient's question and attempts to provide general reassurance. It would be more productive to try to identify and address the patient's specific issues.\n\n(Choice C) Although this statement sets a boundary with the patient, it misses the opportunity to explore deeper concerns that may underlie her question.\n\n(Choice D) This response prematurely assumes what the patient is feeling. Exploring the reason for her question in an open-ended manner is more likely to reveal her specific concerns and help her feel better understood.\n\n(Choice E) This response is defensive in tone and may damage the physician-patient relationship.\n\nEducational objective:\nPhysicians should not feel pressured to respond to questions that they find overly personal or intrusive. Exploring why patients are asking is a helpful strategy that can assist the physician in gaining a deeper understanding of their specific concerns.",
    "zh": "患者可能会问各种类型的问题，从关于医生的专业资质和经验的询问，到关于医生的背景和生活经历（包括年龄、婚姻状况、子女以及类似的经历，如癌症、特定的医学诊断和失去亲人）的更私人的问题。有些人可能特别想知道与他们自己生活挣扎相关的个人细节，这些细节通常是由对医生是否能够帮助他们的未说出口的希望和恐惧触发的。\n\n尽管对患者的问题做出回应可以增强信任关系，但医生不应感到有压力去回答他们认为过于私人或侵入性的问题。然而，医生可以在维持界限的同时，也温和地探索患者提问的原因。这种方法有助于更深入地了解患者的担忧。询问是什么让患者问这个问题，可能会揭示对医生是否理解她的情绪痛苦的具体担忧，并可能减轻对心理治疗的恐惧。然后，医生可以更有效地支持患者并解决这些担忧。\n\n(选项 A) 这种回应忽略了患者的问题，试图提供一般的安慰。尝试识别并解决患者的特定问题会更有成效。\n\n(选项 C) 尽管此声明与患者建立了界限，但它错失了探索可能隐藏在她问题背后的更深层担忧的机会。\n\n(选项 D) 这种回应过早地假设了患者的感受。以开放式的方式探索她提问的原因，更有可能揭示她的具体担忧，并帮助她感到被更好地理解。\n\n(选项 E) 这种回应带有防御的语气，可能会损害医患关系。\n\n教育目标：\n医生不应感到有压力去回答他们认为过于私人或侵入性的问题。探索患者提问的原因是一种有用的策略，可以帮助医生更深入地了解他们的具体担忧。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to respond appropriately to a patient's personal question while maintaining professional boundaries and exploring the underlying concerns. It assesses the physician's communication skills and understanding of the therapeutic relationship.\n\nThe best approach is to acknowledge the patient's question and explore the reasons behind it, rather than directly answering or dismissing it. This allows the physician to gain a deeper understanding of the patient's concerns and build trust.",
