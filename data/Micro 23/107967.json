    "en": "A 40-year-old woman is evaluated for extreme weakness, headache, blurry vision, and difficulty swallowing and opening her eyes over the past several hours. Her husband has similar symptoms and is being evaluated in the emergency department as well. One day earlier, they both developed abdominal cramps and diarrhea after attending a lunch event at a cultural heritage center. Temperature is 36.9 C (98.4 F), pulse rate is 58/min, blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg, and respirations are 18/min. The patient is alert, awake, and fully oriented. She has difficulty supporting her head and visibly drooling. Upper extremities are weaker than the lower extremities. Sensation is intact throughout.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient and her husband had gastrointestinal symptoms followed by rapidly progressive neurologic deficits that include:\n\n•\tdouble vision and ptosis\n•\tbulbar symptoms (eg, dysphagia, drooling)\n•\tsymmetric, descending muscle weakness (arms > legs)\n•\tintact sensation\n•\tabsence of systemic inflammatory symptoms (eg, afebrile, no tachycardia, normal mental status)\n\nThis presentation is suspicious for foodborne botulism. Certain improperly canned foods, particularly nonacidic vegetables (eg, beans) and meat, provide the appropriate environment for Clostridium botulinum spore germination. As the bacteria grow, they produce a toxin that inhibits presynaptic acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. This leads to rapidly progressive, symmetric, descending weakness (limb and/or bulbar). Because it is caused by release of a preformed toxin, foodborne botulism usually does not induce an inflammatory reaction, which is why patients are typically afebrile and not tachycardic.\n\n(Choice B) Although some sexually transmitted infections can lead to neurologic symptoms (eg, neurosyphilis), the presentation would be less acute.\n\n(Choice C) Diphyllobothrium latum can contaminate freshwater fish and lead to gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, diarrhea, intestinal obstruction) and pernicious anemia; the resultant neurologic symptoms due to B₁₂ deficiency would take years to manifest. Consumption of pufferfish can result in acute neurotoxicity from tetrodotoxin, which blocks the influx of sodium into nerve axons, but pufferfish are primarily saltwater dwelling.\n\n(Choice D) Undercooked shrimp can lead to infections such as Vibrio vulnificus, which causes severe diarrhea. Patients also frequently develop sepsis and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n(Choice E) Common infections due to feces-contaminated water include Escherichia coli and hepatitis. Although neurologic symptoms may occur, they are not the typical presenting features. In addition, a shared community meal is unlikely to expose participants to feces-contaminated water.",
    "zh": "该患者及其丈夫出现了胃肠道症状，随后出现快速进展的神经功能缺损，包括：\n\n•\t复视和上睑下垂\n•\t延髓症状（如吞咽困难、流口水）\n•\t对称性、下降性肌无力（上肢>下肢）\n•\t感觉完整\n•\t无全身炎症反应症状（如无发热、无心动过速、精神状态正常）\n\n这种表现提示食源性肉毒杆菌中毒。某些保存不当的罐头食品，特别是非酸性蔬菜（如豆类）和肉类，为肉毒梭菌孢子的萌发提供了合适的生长环境。细菌生长时，会产生一种毒素，抑制神经肌肉接头前突触乙酰胆碱的释放。这会导致快速进展的、对称性的、下降性无力（肢体和/或延髓）。由于它是由预先形成的毒素释放引起的，食源性肉毒杆菌中毒通常不会引起炎症反应，这就是为什么患者通常不发热且无心动过速的原因。\n\n（选项B）虽然一些性传播感染可导致神经系统症状（如神经梅毒），但其表现不如该病急性。\n\n（选项C）阔节裂头绦虫可污染淡水鱼，导致胃肠道症状（如腹泻、肠梗阻）和恶性贫血；由于维生素B₁₂缺乏引起的神经系统症状需要数年才能显现。食用河豚可导致河豚毒素引起的急性神经毒性，河豚毒素阻断钠离子流入神经轴突，但河豚主要生活在咸水中。\n\n（选项D）未煮熟的虾可导致感染，如创伤弧菌感染，导致严重腹泻。患者也经常发生败血症和弥散性血管内凝血的证据。\n\n（选项E）粪便污染水引起的常见感染包括大肠杆菌和肝炎。虽然可能出现神经系统症状，但它们不是典型的表现特征。此外，共同的社区用餐不太可能使参与者接触到粪便污染的水。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of foodborne botulism, its clinical presentation, and the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin. It also tests the ability to differentiate botulism from other causes of neurologic symptoms and gastrointestinal illness.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the constellation of gastrointestinal symptoms followed by rapidly progressive, symmetric, descending neurologic deficits (bulbar symptoms, muscle weakness) in multiple individuals who attended the same event, along with the absence of fever. This should raise suspicion for a preformed toxin like botulinum toxin.",
    "zh": "本题考察对食源性肉毒杆菌中毒的认识、其临床表现以及肉毒杆菌毒素的作用机制。它还测试了将肉毒杆菌中毒与其他神经系统症状和胃肠道疾病的原因区分开来的能力。\n\n解决此问题的关键是认识到多名参加同一事件的个体出现胃肠道症状，然后迅速出现进行性、对称性、下降性神经功能缺损（延髓症状、肌无力），且无发热。这应引起对肉毒杆菌毒素等预先形成毒素的怀疑。"
