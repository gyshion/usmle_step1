    "en": "A 68-year-old man comes to the office to establish care. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by chronic kidney disease and peripheral sensory neuropathy. Medical history is notable for hypertension and coronary artery disease. The patient works for an agricultural supply company and spends most of his day walking and standing on a warehouse floor. Vital signs are normal. BMI is 34 kg/m². Examination of the lower extremities shows decreased sensation to monofilament testing below the knees bilaterally, with 2+ pitting edema, varicosities, and extensive skin discoloration, as shown below {{exhibit_1}}.",

    "en": "This patient has varicose veins and edema in the lower extremities consistent with CHRONIC VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY. Venous insufficiency is a multifactorial process; contributing factors include obstruction of venous return (eg, pregnancy, OBESITY), increased orthostatic pressure (eg, PROLONGED STANDING), decreased muscular compression (eg, sedentary lifestyle), and damaged venous valves (eg, due to deep vein thrombosis).\n\nOver time, patients with venous insufficiency can develop extravasation of fluid, plasma proteins, and red cells, leading to chronic inflammation and stasis dermatitis (SD). SD is characterized by erythema, induration, fibrosis, and deposition of hemosiderin (from breakdown of extravasated RBCs) manifesting as reddish-brown discoloration, as in this patient. Symptoms are typically bilateral and usually worse at or above the ankles. Complications of SD include poor wound healing and ulceration.\n\n(Choice A) Deposition of calcium phosphate salts leads to calcific uremic arteriolopathy (calciphylaxis). This usually occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis and presents with extremely painful nodules, plaques, and ulcers.\n\n(Choice B) Tinea versicolor is a superficial fungal infection that causes primarily macular, rather than regional, pigment changes. It is typically found on the trunk and upper extremities rather than the ankles.\n\n(Choice C) Dermal deposition of glycosaminoglycans is seen in patients with untreated hypothyroidism (ie, myxedema) and Graves disease (ie, thyroid dermopathy). It can manifest as induration and thickening of the skin over the shins.\n\n(Choice E) Chronic radiation dermatitis is characterized by focal fibrosis and increased production of melanin. It is usually seen following external beam radiation therapy for cancer, and the findings are typically most notable in the treatment field.\n\nEducational objective:\nStasis dermatitis is characterized by chronic erythema, fibrosis, and reddish-brown discoloration due to deposition of hemosiderin (from breakdown of extravasated red cells). Symptoms are typically bilateral and usually worse at or above the ankles. Complications include poor wound healing, weeping, and ulceration. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "该患者下肢有静脉曲张和水肿，与慢性静脉功能不全相符。静脉功能不全是一个多因素过程；促成因素包括静脉回流受阻（例如，妊娠、肥胖）、直立压增高（例如，长时间站立）、肌肉压迫减弱（例如，久坐的生活方式）以及静脉瓣膜受损（例如，由于深静脉血栓形成）。\n\n随着时间的推移，静脉功能不全的患者可能会出现体液、血浆蛋白和红细胞外渗，导致慢性炎症和淤滞性皮炎（SD）。SD的特征是红斑、硬化、纤维化和含铁血黄素沉积（来自外渗红细胞的分解），表现为红棕色变色，如本患者所示。症状通常是双侧性的，通常在踝部或踝部以上加重。SD的并发症包括伤口愈合不良和溃疡形成。\n\n（选项A）磷酸钙盐沉积导致钙化性尿毒症性小动脉病（钙化性血管病）。这通常发生在接受血液透析的终末期肾病患者中，表现为极度疼痛的结节、斑块和溃疡。\n\n（选项B）花斑癣是一种浅表性真菌感染，主要引起斑疹，而非区域性的色素变化。它通常发生在躯干和上肢，而不是踝部。\n\n（选项C）在未治疗的甲状腺功能减退症（即黏液性水肿）和Graves病（即甲状腺病）患者中可见真皮糖胺聚糖沉积。它可表现为胫骨上方皮肤的硬化和增厚。\n\n（选项E）慢性放射性皮炎的特征是局灶性纤维化和黑色素生成增加。它通常在癌症的体外放射治疗后出现，其发现通常在治疗区域最为明显。\n\n教育目标：\n淤滞性皮炎的特征是慢性红斑、纤维化和红棕色变色，这是由于含铁血黄素沉积（来自外渗红细胞的分解）所致。症状通常是双侧性的，通常在踝部或踝部以上加重。并发症包括伤口愈合不良、渗出和溃疡形成。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of chronic venous insufficiency and its complications, specifically stasis dermatitis and the resulting skin discoloration due to hemosiderin deposition. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of venous insufficiency and differentiating it from other causes of skin discoloration.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the risk factors for venous insufficiency (diabetes, obesity, prolonged standing) and the characteristic findings (edema, varicosities, skin discoloration). Then, consider the pathophysiology of stasis dermatitis and the resulting hemosiderin deposition as the most likely cause of the skin changes.",
