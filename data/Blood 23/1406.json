    "en": "This peripheral blood smear shows myeloblasts, which are large myelogenous cells with abundant basophilic cytoplasm and large nuclei that can be folded or bilobed. Myeloblasts often have a number of coarse rod/needle-shaped intracytoplasmic granules (eg, Auer rods) that stain positive for myeloperoxidase. Auer rods indicate myeloid differentiation.\n\nAcute promyelogenous leukemia (APL) is a variant of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), in which immature cells of myeloid origin are unable to differentiate and mature. They proliferate in the bone marrow and suppress the growth and multiplication of other hematopoietic precursors. The clinical manifestations of APL, such as anemia (fatigue, pallor), thrombocytopenia (petechiae, hemorrhages), and neutropenia (fever, opportunistic infections), result from marrow replacement by leukemic cells.\n\n(Choice A) Major basic protein is found in eosinophil granules and helps to defend against parasites.\n\n(Choice C) Platelet-derived growth factor receptor mutations play a role in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.\n\n(Choice D) Hairy cell leukemia stains positively for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). The neoplastic cells are B lymphocyte precursors and are CD20+. Hairy cell leukemia presents with splenomegaly, fatigue and pancytopenia.\n\n(Choice E) Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is responsible for adding nucleotides to the V, D and J regions of the antibody gene for antibody diversity. It is a marker of immature lymphocytes, both B and T cells. Neoplastic cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are TdT positive. ALL mainly affects children.\n\nEducational Objective:\nAuer rods are deformed azurophilic granules found in the cytoplasm of myeloblasts that stain positively for myeloperoxidase. Auer rods are found in abundance in AML M3 (acute promyelocytic leukemia). {{exhibit_2}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize myeloblasts with Auer rods on a peripheral blood smear and associate them with myeloperoxidase staining and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). It also tests knowledge of the clinical presentation of APL, including pancytopenia.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the myeloblasts and Auer rods in the image. Recall that Auer rods stain positively for myeloperoxidase and are characteristic of APL. Eliminate options based on knowledge of other conditions and their associated markers.",
