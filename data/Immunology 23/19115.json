    "en": "A 42-year-old woman is hospitalized due to fever and chills after a hemodialysis session. The patient has a history of end-stage kidney disease due to IgA nephropathy and recently began intermittent dialysis through a tunneled catheter. Medical history includes depression, for which she takes citalopram. Temperature is 38.4 C (101.1 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 94/min. There is no erythema or tenderness at the catheter site, and the remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Blood cultures are obtained, and empiric vancomycin and ceftazidime are initiated. While receiving the intravenous vancomycin infusion, the patient reports a burning, itching sensation. Vital signs are unchanged, but repeat examination shows an erythematous rash involving the face and neck. She reports no history of drug allergy but has never received these antibiotics. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's current condition?",

    "en": "This patient was given vancomycin and shortly thereafter developed burning, itching, and an erythematous rash on the face and neck, raising strong suspicion for VANCOMYCIN INFUSION REACTION (VIR) {{exhibit_1}}. VIR is a nonallergic reaction that occurs when vancomycin is infused too rapidly; rapid vancomycin infusion can directly activate mast cells, leading to the release of potent vasoactive mediators (eg, histamine).\n\nManifestations of VIR include flushing, pruritus, and an erythematous rash, which is usually seen on the upper torso, neck, and face. Myalgias and hypotension can occasionally occur. Discontinuation of the vancomycin and administration of diphenhydramine are usually curative. Because VIR is not IgE mediated, it is not a true allergic reaction, so vancomycin infusion can be resumed at a slower rate once symptoms resolve.\n\n(Choice A) Patients with spirochetal illness (eg, syphilis, Lyme disease) can develop the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy. It is caused by massive release of bacterial products into the circulation due to widespread bacterial lysis. However, most cases arise several hours (not minutes) after antimicrobial therapy and are marked by high fever and worsened constitutional symptoms (eg, headache, myalgia).\n\n(Choices B and D) Antibody-mediated drug reactions generally require previous exposure (sensitization) to the medication. This patient who has never received vancomycin is unlikely to have an antibody-mediated reaction; furthermore, such reactions are rare with vancomycin and are usually marked by urticaria, pruritus, hypotension, and angioedema.\n\n(Choice E) Serotonergic drug interactions are most common with drugs that affect the serotonin system such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and certain antiemetics (eg, ondansetron). However, most cases are marked by alterations in autonomic function (eg, hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia), and rash is unusual.\n\nEducational objective:\nVancomycin infusion reaction (flushing, pruritus, erythematous rash) is the most common adverse reaction to vancomycin. It occurs due to rapid vancomycin infusion, which leads to the direct activation of mast cells (non-IgE mediated) and the subsequent release of vasoactive mediators.",
    "zh": "该患者接受了万古霉素，此后不久出现面部和颈部灼热、瘙痒和红斑皮疹，这强烈提示万古霉素输注反应 (VIR) {{exhibit_1}}。VIR是一种非过敏反应，发生在万古霉素输注过快时；快速输注万古霉素可直接激活肥大细胞，导致释放有效的血管活性介质（例如组胺）。\n\nVIR的表现包括潮红、瘙痒和红斑皮疹，通常见于上躯干、颈部和面部。肌痛和低血压偶尔也会发生。停用万古霉素并给予苯海拉明通常可以治愈。由于VIR不是IgE介导的，因此它不是真正的过敏反应，因此一旦症状缓解，可以以较慢的速度恢复万古霉素输注。\n\n（选项A）螺旋体病（例如梅毒、莱姆病）患者在开始抗菌治疗后可发生Jarisch-Herxheimer反应。它是由细菌的大量溶解导致细菌产物大量释放到循环中引起的。然而，大多数病例发生在抗菌治疗后数小时（而不是数分钟），并以高烧和加重的全身症状（例如头痛、肌痛）为特征。\n\n（选项B和D）抗体介导的药物反应通常需要先前接触（敏化）该药物。从未接受过万古霉素的患者不太可能发生抗体介导的反应；此外，这种反应在万古霉素中很少见，通常以荨麻疹、瘙痒、低血压和血管性水肿为特征。\n\n（选项E）5-羟色胺能药物相互作用最常见于影响5-羟色胺系统的药物，如选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂、三环类抗抑郁药和某些止吐药（例如昂丹司琼）。然而，大多数病例的特征是自主神经功能改变（例如高血压、心动过速、高热），皮疹不常见。\n\n教育目标：\n万古霉素输注反应（潮红、瘙痒、红斑皮疹）是万古霉素最常见的不良反应。它发生在快速输注万古霉素时，这会导致肥大细胞的直接激活（非IgE介导）和随后释放血管活性介质。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of vancomycin infusion reaction (VIR), a common non-allergic reaction to rapid vancomycin administration. It assesses the ability to differentiate VIR from other drug reactions and understand its mechanism of mast cell activation. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the temporal relationship between vancomycin infusion and the onset of symptoms (burning, itching, rash). Consider the lack of prior exposure and the absence of systemic symptoms to rule out other causes like antibody-mediated reactions or Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.",
