    "en": "A 56-year-old woman with unknown medical history is brought to the emergency department in an unresponsive state. Paramedics were called for sudden-onset, left-sided weakness, and when they arrived at the patient's house she was having a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Antiseizure medications were given and the patient was subsequently intubated. Evaluation shows a comatose woman with left hemiplegia. Neuroimaging reveals a large infarction in the right middle cerebral artery territory with cerebral edema. Despite aggressive interventions, the patient dies from brain herniation. Autopsy reveals multiple small, nondestructive masses attached to the edges of the mitral valve leaflets. Microscopy shows that these masses are composed of platelet-rich thrombi, but no organisms are present.",

    "en": "The autopsy finding of sterile platelet-rich thrombi attached to the mitral valve leaflets is characteristic of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) (marantic endocarditis). The pathogenesis of NBTE is thought to begin with valvular endothelial injury caused by circulating inflammatory cytokines, which triggers platelet deposition in the presence of an underlying hypercoagulable state. NBTE is most commonly associated with advanced malignancy (especially mucinous adenocarcinoma) and systemic lupus erythematosus (Libman-Sacks endocarditis); less commonly, it can occur with antiphospholipid syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and extensive burns.\n\nHistologically, NBTE vegetations consist of bland thrombus with strands of fibrin, immune complexes, and mononuclear cells (white thrombus). The vegetations typically affect the left-sided heart valves (mitral or aortic) and are often asymptomatic; however, systemic embolization (eg, stroke, acute limb ischemia) can occur and is the most common presentation of NBTE.\n\n(Choice B) Chronic liver failure (ie, cirrhosis) can be complicated by portal vein thrombosis; however, it is not associated with NBTE.\n\n(Choice C) Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by ventricular enlargement and reduced systolic function. It can occasionally lead to left ventricular mural thrombus with risk of systemic embolization, but it is not associated with NBTE.\n\n(Choice D) Intravenous drug use increases the risk of bacterial endocarditis, not NBTE. Injected particulate matter (eg, dirt) is thought to cause microdamage to the right-sided heart valves before being filtered out by the lungs, facilitating bacterial attachment to primarily the tricuspid valve.\n\n(Choice E) Temporal (giant cell) arteritis, a large-vessel vasculitis that typically presents with headaches and fever, is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolic disease. Although associated NBTE has been reported, it is quite rare.\n\nEducational objective:\nNonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis is characterized by valvular deposition of sterile platelet-rich thrombi. It likely results from valvular damage due to inflammatory cytokines in the setting of an underlying hypercoagulable state, and it is most commonly seen with advanced malignancy (especially mucinous adenocarcinoma) or systemic lupus erythematosus.",
    "zh": "尸检发现无菌富含血小板的血栓附着在二尖瓣叶上，这是非细菌性血栓性心内膜炎 (NBTE)（恶病质性心内膜炎）的特征。 认为 NBTE 的发病机制始于循环炎症细胞因子引起的瓣膜内皮损伤，这会在潜在的高凝状态下触发血小板沉积。 NBTE 最常与晚期恶性肿瘤（尤其是黏液腺癌）和系统性红斑狼疮（Libman-Sacks 心内膜炎）相关； 较少见的情况下，它可与抗磷脂综合征、弥漫性血管内凝血和广泛烧伤有关。\n\n组织学上，NBTE 赘生物由平淡的血栓组成，其中有纤维蛋白、免疫复合物和单核细胞（白色血栓）。 赘生物通常影响左侧心脏瓣膜（二尖瓣或主动脉瓣），并且通常无症状； 然而，可能发生全身性栓塞（例如，中风、肢体急性缺血），这是 NBTE 最常见的表现。\n\n(选项 B) 慢性肝功能衰竭（即，肝硬化）可能并发门静脉血栓形成； 然而，它与 NBTE 无关。\n\n(选项 C) 扩张型心肌病的特征是心室扩大和收缩功能下降。 它偶尔会导致左心室壁血栓形成，并有发生全身性栓塞的风险，但它与 NBTE 无关。\n\n(选项 D) 静脉药物滥用会增加细菌性心内膜炎的风险，而不是 NBTE。 注射的颗粒物（例如，污垢）被认为会导致右侧心脏瓣膜的微损伤，然后在被肺过滤掉之前，促进细菌附着于三尖瓣。\n\n(选项 E) 颞动脉炎（巨细胞动脉炎）是一种大血管炎，通常表现为头痛和发烧，与静脉血栓栓塞性疾病的风险增加有关。 尽管有相关 NBTE 的报道，但这种情况非常罕见。\n\n教育目标：\n非细菌性血栓性心内膜炎的特征是瓣膜上沉积无菌富含血小板的血栓。 它可能源于在潜在高凝状态下，由于炎症细胞因子造成的瓣膜损伤，并且最常见于晚期恶性肿瘤（尤其是黏液腺癌）或系统性红斑狼疮。"
