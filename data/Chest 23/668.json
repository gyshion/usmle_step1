    "en": "A 53-year-old man comes to the office due to an 8-month history of progressive shortness of breath that peaks during strenuous activity. Several of his coworkers have experienced similar symptoms. His medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pulmonary examination reveals diffuse fine crackles. Chest x-ray {{exhibit_1}} reveals nodular densities in both lungs that are most prominent in the apical regions. Calcification of the hilar lymph nodes is also seen. Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy of a calcified node is performed, and polarized microscopy shows birefringent particles surrounded by dense collagen fibers. This patient most likely has a history of exposure to which of the following substances?",

    "en": "This middle-aged patient with dyspnea on exertion, nodular densities on x-ray, calcified hilar lymph nodes, and birefringent particles on biopsy has silicosis. **Silicosis** is a form of pneumoconiosis (ie, a type of interstitial lung disease caused by inhalation of mineral dust). Inhaled crystalline silica, typically due to **industrial exposure** (eg, mining, sand blasting), is toxic to alveolar macrophages and promotes the formation of intrapulmonary free radicals, leading to progressive lung injury and interstitial collagen deposition. Histologically, silicosis is characterized by birefringent silicate particles within dense, whorled collagenous nodules surrounded by dust-laden macrophages.\n\nSilicosis is often initially asymptomatic but can present with dyspnea on exertion and productive cough, typically 10-20 years after initial exposure. Radiography varies based on disease progression; simple silicosis typically demonstrates numerous small, rounded nodules predominant in the upper lobes that may rarely coalesce to form mass-like upper lobe fibrosis (progressive massive fibrosis). Calcification of the rim of hilar nodes (eggshell calcification) may also be seen.\n\n(Choice A) Asbestosis can present with dyspnea on exertion, but chest x-ray {{exhibit_2}} is more likely to reveal an interstitial pattern of involvement most prominent in the lower zones. Pleural plaques may also be noted. Histology shows ferruginous bodies featuring fusiform rods with a translucent asbestos center and a golden-brown iron coating.\n\n(Choice B) Berylliosis may present with dyspnea and ill-defined nodular or irregular opacities on chest x-ray {{exhibit_3}}. Histology reveals noncaseating epithelioid granulomas without obvious associated particles.\n\n(Choice C) Coal worker's pneumoconiosis can present with exertional dyspnea and nodular interstitial opacities on chest x-ray {{exhibit_4}}. Histology of nodal and perilymphatic lung tissue shows accumulations of black, carbon-laden macrophages (coal macules).\n\n(Choice D) Inhalation of organic dusts can cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Patients have exertional dyspnea and diffuse interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray {{exhibit_5}}. Histology of nodal tissue may reveal noncaseating granulomas.\n\nEducational objective: Silicosis is characterized by dyspnea and productive cough occurring years after inhalational exposure to crystalline silica. Histologically, it is characterized by birefringent silicate particles within dense, whorled collagenous nodules surrounded by dust-laden macrophages. Radiography typically demonstrates numerous small, rounded nodules predominant in the upper lobes; calcification of the rim of hilar nodes (eggshell calcification) may also be seen. {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}",
    "zh": "这名中年患者在活动时出现呼吸困难，X线片显示结节性密度增高，肺门淋巴结钙化，活检显示双折射颗粒，患有矽肺病。**矽肺病**是一种尘肺病（即，一种由吸入矿物粉尘引起的间质性肺病）。吸入的结晶二氧化硅，通常是由于**职业暴露**（例如，采矿、喷砂），对肺泡巨噬细胞具有毒性，并促进肺内自由基的形成，导致进行性肺损伤和间质胶原沉积。组织学上，矽肺病的特征是致密的、涡状的胶原结节内存在双折射硅酸盐颗粒，周围环绕着含尘巨噬细胞。\n\n矽肺病最初通常无症状，但可在接触后10-20年出现劳力性呼吸困难和咳痰。影像学检查因疾病进展而异；单纯性矽肺病通常显示上叶占优势的多个小的、圆形的结节，这些结节很少会聚集成团块状上叶纤维化（进行性大块纤维化）。也可见肺门淋巴结边缘的钙化（蛋壳样钙化）。\n\n（选项A）石棉肺病可表现为劳力性呼吸困难，但胸部X线片{{exhibit_2}}更有可能显示下肺区最明显的间质浸润模式。也可能注意到胸膜斑。组织学显示含铁小体，其特征是梭形杆状物，具有半透明的石棉中心和金棕色的铁包膜。\n\n（选项B）铍肺病可表现为呼吸困难，胸部X线片{{exhibit_3}}上出现边界不清的结节状或不规则的阴影。组织学显示非干酪性上皮样肉芽肿，无明显相关颗粒。\n\n（选项C）煤矿工人尘肺病可表现为劳力性呼吸困难和胸部X线片{{exhibit_4}}上出现结节状间质性阴影。淋巴结和血管周围肺组织的组织学显示黑色、含碳巨噬细胞的聚集（煤炭斑）。\n\n（选项D）吸入有机粉尘可引起超敏性肺炎。患者在胸部X线片{{exhibit_5}}上出现劳力性呼吸困难和弥漫性间质浸润。淋巴结组织的组织学可显示非干酪性肉芽肿。\n\n教育目标：矽肺病的特征是在吸入结晶二氧化硅后数年出现呼吸困难和咳痰。组织学上，其特征是致密的、涡状的胶原结节内存在双折射硅酸盐颗粒，周围环绕着含尘巨噬细胞。影像学通常显示上叶占优势的多个小的、圆形的结节；也可见肺门淋巴结边缘的钙化（蛋壳样钙化）。{{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pneumoconiosis, specifically silicosis, including its etiology, radiographic findings, and histological features. It requires differentiating silicosis from other pneumoconioses based on clinical and pathological characteristics.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key findings: nodular densities in the upper lobes, calcification of hilar lymph nodes (eggshell calcification), and birefringent particles on biopsy. These findings are highly suggestive of silicosis due to silica exposure.",
