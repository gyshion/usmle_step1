    "en": "The cross-section of the liver shows a large, solid, yellow-green nodule with multiple smaller nodules, consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections dramatically increase the risk of HCC. Ongoing infection with either virus leads to increased hepatocyte turnover, which increases the risk for genetic mutations and malignant transformation. However, HBV has several additional mechanisms that promote HCC, including the following:\n\n*   Integration into the host genome – Nearly 90% of patients with chronic HBV who develop HCC have evidence of HBV DNA in the chromosomes of tumor cells. HBV is a partially double-stranded DNA virus that is repaired to form a closed circular DNA strand. HBV DNA is often inserted into the cellular genome, although this is not required for viral replication (unlike HIV). Integration into regions that control cell growth and differentiation can result in tumorigenesis.\n*   Production of oncogenic viral proteins – HBV produces a viral protein called HBx that is a transcriptional activator of several genes associated with cellular growth. It also interferes with the function of p53, an important tumor-suppressor protein.\n\n(Choices A and C) Cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus are members of the Herpesviridae family. Both have double-stranded DNA genomes and cause acute infection followed by latent infection. Cytomegalovirus is not particularly associated with cancer, but Epstein-Barr infection is linked to nasopharyngeal carcinoma and hematologic malignancies. However, neither virus is strongly associated with development of HCC.\n\n(Choice B) Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoal infection that is typically acquired by ingesting contaminated food or water in developing countries. A minority of patients develop invasive disease with liver abscess. This usually presents with fever and right-upper quadrant pain; the organism does not incorporate its genome into host cells.\n\n(Choice E) Chronic HCV infection dramatically increases the risk of HCC. However, HCV is an RNA virus (that does not have reverse transcriptase) and is unable to integrate into the host genome.\n\n(Choice F) Human papilloma virus is a double-stranded DNA of the papillomavirus family. HPV produces oncogenic proteins and is able to integrate into the host chromosome. However, HPV is not linked with liver cancer; it typically causes cervical and oropharyngeal cancer.\n\nEducational objective:\nBoth hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C virus infections increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma due to chronic hepatic inflammation and cell turnover. HBV is also carcinogenic due to the production of oncogenic proteins and the insertion of the HBV genome into host chromosomes.",
    "zh": "肝脏横切面显示一个大的、实性的、黄绿色的结节，伴有多个较小的结节，与肝细胞癌（HCC）一致。慢性乙型肝炎病毒（HBV）和丙型肝炎病毒（HCV）感染会显著增加HCC的风险。持续感染任一病毒都会导致肝细胞更新加速，从而增加基因突变和恶性转化的风险。然而，HBV有几种额外的机制促进HCC，包括以下几点：\n\n*   整合到宿主基因组中– 几乎90%的患有慢性HBV并发展为HCC的患者，其肿瘤细胞染色体中都有HBV DNA的证据。HBV是一种部分双链DNA病毒，修复后形成闭合环状DNA链。HBV DNA经常插入细胞基因组中，尽管这并非病毒复制所必需（不像HIV）。整合到控制细胞生长和分化的区域中会导致肿瘤发生。\n*   产生致癌病毒蛋白– HBV产生一种名为HBx的病毒蛋白，它是与细胞生长相关的几个基因的转录激活因子。它还干扰p53的功能，p53是一种重要的抑癌蛋白。\n\n（选项A和C）巨细胞病毒和EB病毒是疱疹病毒科的成员。两者都有双链DNA基因组，并引起急性感染，然后是潜伏感染。巨细胞病毒与癌症的关联不大，但EB病毒感染与鼻咽癌和血液系统恶性肿瘤有关。然而，这两种病毒都与HCC的发生没有很强的关联。\n\n（选项B）溶组织内阿米巴是一种原生动物感染，通常通过在发展中国家摄入被污染的食物或水而获得。少数患者会发展为侵袭性疾病，伴有肝脓肿。这通常表现为发热和右上腹疼痛；该生物体不会将其基因组整合到宿主细胞中。\n\n（选项E）慢性HCV感染会显著增加HCC的风险。然而，HCV是一种RNA病毒（没有逆转录酶），无法整合到宿主基因组中。\n\n（选项F）人乳头瘤病毒是乳头瘤病毒科的双链DNA。HPV产生致癌蛋白，并能够整合到宿主染色体中。然而，HPV与肝癌无关；它通常引起宫颈癌和口咽癌。\n\n教育目标：\n由于慢性肝脏炎症和细胞更新，乙型肝炎（HBV）和丙型肝炎病毒感染都会增加肝细胞癌的风险。HBV也具有致癌性，因为它会产生致癌蛋白并将HBV基因组插入宿主染色体中。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the etiology and pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), specifically the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in integrating its DNA into the host genome. It also tests the ability to interpret autopsy findings and genomic analysis results.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the autopsy findings suggestive of HCC and the genomic analysis indicating foreign DNA fragments.
