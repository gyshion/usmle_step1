    "en": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother due to changes in vision. For the last few weeks, the patient has been squinting when trying to read the interactive whiteboard in class and has had to sit closer to the front of the room. He has also developed headaches. The patient has no chronic medical conditions and takes no medications. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 118/76 mm Hg, and pulse is 70/min. Examination of the eyes shows equal and reactive pupils. Extraocular muscles are intact, and visual field testing reveals no defects. Visual acuity shows 20/70 in both eyes. His ability to read close text is normal.",

    "en": "This patient with decreased visual acuity and an otherwise normal ophthalmic examination likely has simple myopia (nearsightedness), a refractive error caused by an increased anterior-posterior diameter of the eye. The risk is greatest for those with a positive family history or those of East Asian descent.\n\nDuring the adolescent growth spurt, the axial length of the globe also grows rapidly, making the incidence of new-onset myopia highest in this age group. As the anterior-posterior diameter increases, the focal point of a refractive error lies anterior to the retina. {{exhibit_1}} For images to be seen clearly, they must be projected directly onto the retina; therefore, the image displacement in myopia causes blurred vision of long-distance objects and decreased visual acuity on examination. Vision of nearby objects is unaffected and appears clear in myopic patients. The remainder of the examination, including extraocular movements, peripheral field testing, and funduscopic examination, is normal.\n\nManagement is with prescription glasses with a diverging (concave) lens, which refocuses the refracted image onto the retina. The degree of myopia usually stabilizes by early adulthood.\n\n(Choice A) Glaucoma, most commonly due to chronically elevated intraocular pressure, is characterized by optic neuropathy, as evidenced by optic cupping seen on funduscopic examination. Visual acuity may be affected but is a late manifestation after progressive loss of peripheral vision, which is normal in this patient.\n\n(Choice B) Untreated strabismus (misalignment of the eyes) in early childhood can cause unilateral visual cortex suppression to avoid diplopia and eventually lead to amblyopia (decreased visual acuity). This patient's recent symptom onset and normal extraocular movements make this diagnosis unlikely.\n\n(Choice D) Presbyopia is a nonrefractive error that increases with age due to the loss of accommodating power of the lens from decreased elasticity. Blurry vision of nearby objects typically develops in patients age >40.\n\n(Choice E) Hyperopia (farsightedness) is a refractive error characterized by a reduced anterior-posterior diameter of the eye, causing the focal point of the refracted image to be positioned posterior to the retina. In contrast to myopia, hyperopia causes blurred vision of nearby objects and is corrected by a converging (convex) lens.\n\nEducational objective:\nMyopia (nearsightedness) is a refractive error in which the focal point of an image falls anterior to the retina due to an increased anterior-posterior diameter of the eyes. Patients have difficulty seeing objects at a distance and have normal near vision.",
    "zh": "这位患者视力下降，并且眼科检查结果正常，很可能患有单纯性近视，这是一种由眼球前后径增加引起的屈光不正。有阳性家族史或东亚血统的人风险最高。\n\n在青春期生长突增期间，眼球的轴向长度也会迅速增长，这使得在这个年龄组中新发近视的发生率最高。随着眼球前后径的增加，屈光不正的焦点位于视网膜前方。{{exhibit_1}} 要清晰地看到图像，它们必须直接投射到视网膜上；因此，近视中的图像位移会导致远距离物体的视力模糊，并在检查时降低视力。近处物体的视力不受影响，在近视患者中看起来很清晰。其余检查，包括眼外肌运动、周边视野测试和眼底镜检查，均正常。\n\n治疗方法是使用带有发散（凹）透镜的处方眼镜，这会将折射的图像重新聚焦到视网膜上。近视的程度通常在成年早期稳定下来。\n\n（选项A）青光眼，最常见的原因是慢性眼内压升高，其特征是视神经病变，这可以通过眼底镜检查中看到的视盘凹陷来证明。视力可能会受到影响，但这是在进行性周边视野丧失后的晚期表现，而该患者的周边视野正常。\n\n（选项B）儿童早期未经治疗的斜视（眼睛错位）会导致单侧视觉皮层抑制，以避免复视，并最终导致弱视（视力下降）。该患者最近出现的症状和正常的眼外肌运动使该诊断不太可能。\n\n（选项D）老花眼是一种非屈光不正，随着年龄的增长而增加，这源于晶状体由于弹性下降而丧失调节能力。近处物体视力模糊通常发生在年龄>40岁的患者中。\n\n（选项E）远视是一种屈光不正，其特征是眼球前后径减小，导致折射图像的焦点位于视网膜后方。与近视相反，远视会导致近处物体视力模糊，并且可以通过会聚（凸）透镜进行矫正。\n\n教育目标：\n近视是一种屈光不正，其中图像的焦点由于眼球前后径增加而落在视网膜前方。患者难以看清远处物体，但近处视力正常。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of myopia, its pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and differentiation from other refractive errors and ocular conditions. It assesses the ability to correlate symptoms of blurred distance vision and normal near vision with the underlying refractive error.\n\nTo solve this question, one should identify the key symptoms (squinting, sitting closer, blurred distance vision, normal near vision) and signs (visual acuity 20/70) that point towards a refractive error. The patient's age and lack of other significant findings help narrow down the differential diagnosis to common refractive errors like myopia and hyperopia, and then differentiate them based on the characteristic symptoms and optical principles.",
