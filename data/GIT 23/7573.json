    "en": "A 22-year-old male presents to the emergency department complaining of fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting. He has had these symptoms for the past four days, but has not sought medical attention because of concerns over the cost of treatment. On examination, the patient appears acutely ill. There is right lower quadrant tenderness with rebound as well as a palpable mass. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates a periappendiceal fluid collection. Culture of this fluid would most likely isolate which of the following organisms?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient is suffering from perforated appendicitis that has evolved into an intraabdominal abscess. Although most infections within the abdominal cavity are polymicrobial, *B. fragilis* is a common anaerobic gram-negative bacillus that is frequently isolated, and of the choices given, it is the most likely organism to be identified in the culture of this patient's abscess. This organism expresses unique surface polysaccharides that have been shown to favor abscess formation. In addition to *B. fragilis*, common bacterial isolates from intraabdominal infections include other members of the normal colonic flora such as *Escherichia coli*, enterococci, and streptococci.\n\n**(Choice A)** *S. aureus* is a gram-positive organism that can cause abscess formation on the skin, but is not typically isolated from an intraabdominal abscess.\n\n**(Choice B)** *Actinomyces* species are anaerobic bacteria that can form abscesses in the cervicofacial region or abdominal cavity. However, they are much less common than *B. fragilis* and typically do not form abscesses this quickly.\n\n**(Choice C)** *Candida albicans* can be isolated from an infection resulting from perforation of the proximal bowel such as a perforated peptic ulcer.\n\n**(Choice E)** Infection with *E. histolytica* can result in the formation of an amebic liver abscess. This patient, however, has perforated appendicitis, which is not related to infection with *E. histolytica*.\n\nEducational objective:\nIntraabdominal infections are polymicrobial, with *B. fragilis* and *E. coli* being the most prominent organisms isolated.",
    "zh": "该患者患有穿孔性阑尾炎，已发展为腹腔内脓肿。尽管腹腔内的大多数感染是多菌感染，但脆弱拟杆菌（*B. fragilis*）是一种常见的厌氧革兰氏阴性杆菌，经常被分离出来，在给出的选项中，它最有可能在该患者脓肿的培养物中被鉴定出来。这种病原体表达独特的表面多糖，已被证明有利于脓肿的形成。除了脆弱拟杆菌（*B. fragilis*）之外，腹腔内感染常见的细菌分离物还包括正常结肠菌群的其他成员，如大肠杆菌（*Escherichia coli*）、肠球菌和链球菌。\n\n**(选项 A)** 金黄色葡萄球菌（*S. aureus*）是一种革兰氏阳性菌，可引起皮肤脓肿形成，但通常不是从腹腔内脓肿中分离出来的。\n\n**(选项 B)** 放线菌属（*Actinomyces*）是厌氧菌，可在颈面部或腹腔中形成脓肿。然而，它们比脆弱拟杆菌（*B. fragilis*）少见得多，通常不会这么快形成脓肿。\n\n**(选项 C)** 白色念珠菌（*Candida albicans*）可从近端肠穿孔引起的感染中分离出来，例如穿孔性消化性溃疡。\n\n**(选项 E)** 溶组织内阿米巴（*E. histolytica*）感染可导致阿米巴肝脓肿的形成。然而，该患者患有穿孔性阑尾炎，这与溶组织内阿米巴（*E. histolytica*）感染无关。\n\n教育目标：\n腹腔内感染是多菌感染，脆弱拟杆菌（*B. fragilis*）和大肠杆菌（*E. coli*）是最主要的病原体。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the common pathogens involved in intra-abdominal abscesses, particularly those arising from perforated appendicitis. It requires understanding of the typical microbial flora of the colon and the pathophysiology of abscess formation.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the clinical context of perforated appendicitis and the likely source of infection. Recall that intra-abdominal abscesses are often polymicrobial, with anaerobic bacteria like *B. fragilis* being common isolates.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试了对腹腔内脓肿常见病原体的了解，特别是那些由穿孔性阑尾炎引起的。它要求理解结肠的典型微生物菌群和脓肿形成的病理生理学。\n\n要解决这个问题，请考虑穿孔性阑尾炎的临床背景和可能的感染来源。回想一下，腹腔内脓肿通常是多菌感染，其中厌氧菌如脆弱拟杆菌（*B. fragilis*）是常见的分离物。"
