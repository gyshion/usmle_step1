    "en": "An 81-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by a neighbor due to abdominal pain. The pain comes in waves and is associated with nausea and vomiting. The patient is confused and unable to provide additional information. Past medical history is unknown, but she comes with a bag containing medications used in type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and dementia. On examination, the patient has a low-grade fever and mild tachycardia. She appears in distress due to pain. Mucous membranes are dry, and there is decreased skin turgor. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with high-pitched bowel sounds. Imaging of the abdomen reveals a complete small bowel obstruction. The patient undergoes laparotomy with extraction of a hard mass obstructing the ileocecal valve. The cholesterol content of the mass is 85%. Which of the following radiographic findings is most consistent with this patient's clinical presentation?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient, an older woman with intermittent abdominal pain and a cholesterol-containing mass lodged at the ileocecal valve, has a gallstone ileus. Gallstone ileus is not a true ileus (nonmechanical disruption of intestinal motility) but rather a mechanical obstruction that occurs when a large gallstone (usually >2.5 cm in diameter) erodes into the intestinal lumen through a cholecystoenteric fistula. As the gallstone travels down the intestine, it intermittently obstructs the lumen, causing episodic symptoms. Eventually, the gallstone may come to rest in the ileum, which has the smallest lumen of the intestinal tract.\n\nTypical symptoms of gallstone ileus include crampy pain, vomiting, and bloating. Examination will show signs of small bowel obstruction, such as abdominal distension, tenderness, and high-pitched (tinkling) bowel sounds. Abdominal radiographs may reveal dilated bowel loops with air-fluid levels. Careful inspection may also reveal air in the biliary tree (pneumobilia) due to retrograde passage of intestinal gas through the fistula {{exhibit_1}}.\n\n(Choice B) Bladder distension due to urinary retention is most often associated with underlying prostatic hyperplasia, anticholinergic medication use, and underlying neurologic impairment.\n\n(Choice C) Air in the peritoneal cavity is suggestive of bowel perforation. Although the bowel wall is disrupted in gallstone ileus, the cholecystoenteric fistula is usually associated with fibrotic adhesions between the biliary tree and the bowel, and there is no free communication with the peritoneal cavity.\n\n(Choice D) Heavily calcified vessels are a sign of chronic atherosclerotic arterial disease. Common intra-abdominal complications in such patients would include intestinal ischemia and abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n\n(Choice E) Pancreatic calcifications are suggestive of chronic pancreatitis, which is most commonly seen in alcohol abuse, cystic fibrosis, or outlet obstruction due to tumor, pseudocysts, or recurrent passage of gallstones.\n\n(Choice F) Pleural effusion may be seen in a broad range of intra-abdominal conditions, such as pancreatitis, esophageal rupture, or chronic hepatic or renal disease.\n\nEducational objective:\nGallstone ileus is a mechanical bowel obstruction caused when a large gallstone erodes into the intestinal lumen. Pneumobilia (air in the biliary tract) is a common finding.",
    "zh": "该患者是一位老年女性，间断性腹痛，回盲瓣处有含胆固醇的肿块，患有胆石性肠梗阻。 胆石性肠梗阻并非真正的肠梗阻（肠道蠕动的非机械性中断），而是一种机械性梗阻，当一颗大胆结石（通常直径>2.5 cm）通过胆囊肠瘘侵蚀到肠腔中时发生。 随着胆结石在肠道中移动，它会间歇性地阻塞管腔，引起阵发性症状。 最终，胆结石可能会停留在回肠中，回肠的管腔最小。\n\n胆石性肠梗阻的典型症状包括痉挛性疼痛、呕吐和腹胀。 检查会显示小肠梗阻的体征，例如腹胀、压痛和高亢（叮当声）肠鸣音。 腹部X光片可能会显示扩张的肠袢，伴有气液平面。 仔细检查还可以显示胆管树内有气体（气胆症），这是由于肠气通过瘘管逆行进入 {{exhibit_1}}。\n\n(选项 B) 由于尿潴留引起的膀胱扩张最常与潜在的前列腺增生、抗胆碱能药物的使用和潜在的神经功能障碍有关。\n\n(选项 C) 腹腔内气体提示肠穿孔。 尽管在胆石性肠梗阻中，肠壁被破坏，但胆囊肠瘘通常与胆管树和肠道之间的纤维性粘连有关，并且与腹腔没有自由交通。\n\n(选项 D) 严重钙化的血管是慢性动脉粥样硬化性疾病的征兆。 此类患者常见的腹内并发症包括肠缺血和腹主动脉瘤。\n\n(选项 E) 胰腺钙化提示慢性胰腺炎，这最常见于酗酒、囊性纤维化或因肿瘤、假性囊肿或胆结石反复通过引起的出口梗阻。\n\n(选项 F) 胸腔积液可见于多种腹内疾病，例如胰腺炎、食管破裂或慢性肝病或肾病。\n\n教育目标：\n胆石性肠梗阻是一种机械性肠梗阻，由一颗大胆结石侵蚀到肠腔中引起。 气胆症（胆道内的气体）是一种常见发现。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of gallstone ileus, a mechanical bowel obstruction caused by a gallstone eroding into the intestinal lumen, and its characteristic radiographic finding of air in the biliary tree (pneumobilia). It also tests the ability to differentiate gallstone ileus from other potential causes of abdominal pain and radiographic findings.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's presentation (older woman with small bowel obstruction and a cholesterol-containing mass) as suggestive of gallstone ileus. Recall that pneumobilia is a common radiographic finding in gallstone ileus due to the cholecystoenteric fistula.",
    "zh": "此题考察对胆石性肠梗阻的认识，这是一种由胆结石侵蚀到肠腔引起的机械性肠梗阻，其特征性的影像学表现为胆管树内有气体（气胆症）。 它还考察了区分胆石性肠梗阻与其他可能引起腹痛和影像学表现的原因的能力。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要认识到患者的表现（老年女性，小肠梗阻，含胆固醇的肿块）提示胆石性肠梗阻。 回忆起气胆症是胆石性肠梗阻的常见影像学表现，这是由于胆囊肠瘘引起的。"
