    "en": "An 11-year-old girl is brought to the office for a health maintenance visit. She feels well and has no chronic medical conditions. As part of routine care, the patient receives a first dose of the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine and the 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine. Five minutes later, while being escorted to the waiting area, the patient appears pale and reports feeling dizzy. She immediately loses consciousness, but a fall is prevented by the health care provider. Blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg and pulse is 46/min. On physical examination, the patient has normal lung and heart sounds. There is no rash. {{exhibit_1}} Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's syncope?",
