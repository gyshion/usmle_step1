    "en": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the office for evaluation of dysphagia. The patient's symptoms first began 2 years ago with regurgitation and bloating after meals but have recently progressed to difficulty swallowing both solid foods and liquids. She has been using antacids without relief. The patient has no other medical history. She drinks 1 or 2 beers on weekends but does not smoke or use illicit drugs. Family history is unremarkable. Vital signs are within normal limits. BMI is 21 kg/m². The abdomen is nontender and soft with normal active bowel sounds. The patient undergoes upper endoscopy that shows a dilated esophagus and retained food. Esophageal manometry reveals increased lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone and incomplete relaxation. Peristalsis is absent in the distal esophagus.",

    "en": "Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder characterized by the absence of esophageal peristalsis in the distal esophagus and incomplete relaxation of a hypertonic lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Achalasia is caused by the immune-mediated destruction of inhibitory ganglion cells in the esophageal wall. Nitric oxide-producing neurons in the myenteric plexus that are responsible for esophageal smooth muscle relaxation are preferentially destroyed, whereas excitatory cholinergic neurons responsible for smooth muscle contraction are relatively spared. This imbalance results in increased lower esophageal tone and impaired sphincter relaxation.\n\nBotulinum toxin, a neurotoxin formed by Clostridium botulinum, prevents the fusion of acetylcholine-containing synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane. This effectively prevents acetylcholine release into the neuromuscular synapse, resulting in muscle weakness and paralysis. In a patient with achalasia, injection of botulinum toxin into the LES causes cholinergic blockade, leading to sphincter relaxation and symptomatic improvement.\n\n(Choices B and D) In addition to the cholinergic neurons, there are multiple other hormones and neurotransmitters that modulate esophageal tone. Prostaglandins promote LES relaxation, whereas alpha-adrenergic agonists, such as phenylephrine, increase LES tone. Because corticosteroids inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, both corticosteroids and phenylephrine would worsen the patient's symptoms.\n\n(Choices C and E) Neostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor and pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist. Both of these medications increase cholinergic stimuli at the LES and would worsen the patient's symptoms. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "贲门失弛缓症是一种食管动力障碍，其特征是远端食管缺乏食管蠕动，以及高张力下食管括约肌（LES）不完全松弛。贲门失弛缓症是由免疫介导的食管壁抑制性神经节细胞破坏引起的。负责食管平滑肌松弛的肌间神经丛中的产生一氧化氮的神经元被优先破坏，而负责平滑肌收缩的兴奋性胆碱能神经元相对保留。这种失衡导致下食管张力增加和括约肌松弛受损。\n\n肉毒杆菌毒素是由肉毒梭菌形成的一种神经毒素，可阻止含有乙酰胆碱的突触囊泡与质膜融合。这有效地阻止了乙酰胆碱释放到神经肌肉突触中，导致肌肉无力和麻痹。对于贲门失弛缓症患者，将肉毒杆菌毒素注射到LES中会导致胆碱能阻滞，从而导致括约肌松弛和症状改善。\n\n（选项B和D）除了胆碱能神经元外，还有多种其他激素和神经递质调节食管张力。前列腺素促进LES松弛，而α-肾上腺素能受体激动剂（如去氧肾上腺素）增加LES张力。由于皮质类固醇抑制前列腺素合成，皮质类固醇和去氧肾上腺素都会加重患者的症状。\n\n（选项C和E）新斯的明是一种胆碱酯酶抑制剂，毛果芸香碱是一种胆碱能激动剂。这两种药物都会增加LES的胆碱能刺激，并会加重患者的症状。 {{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of achalasia, an esophageal motility disorder, and its treatment with botulinum toxin. It requires understanding the pathophysiology of achalasia, specifically the impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter due to the destruction of inhibitory ganglion cells.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the symptoms of achalasia (dysphagia, regurgitation, increased LES tone) and recall that botulinum toxin inhibits acetylcholine release, leading to muscle relaxation and improved sphincter function.
