  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has Cushing syndrome (CS) presenting with hypertension, facial plethora, easy bruising, centripetal obesity (ie, trunk, abdomen), and hyperglycemia. In light of the associated hyperpigmentation (due to the cosecretion of ACTH and melanocyte-stimulating hormone) and lung mass, this is likely due to an ACTH-secreting small cell lung cancer. Paraneoplastic CS often develops rapidly, and the characteristic facial features may not be present at the time of diagnosis.\n\nHigh levels of cortisol, as seen in patients with CS, frequently cause hypertension due to a combination of the following:\n\nIncreased peripheral vascular sensitivity to adrenergic stimuli\nIncreased hepatic production of renin substrate (angiotensinogen)\nActivation of renal tubular mineralocorticoid receptors\nActivation of renal mineralocorticoid receptors usually occurs in patients with severe hypercortisolism, which is often due to ectopic ACTH secretion. This receptor activation induces sodium reabsorption and potassium wasting in the renal collecting tubules. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice B) Elevated plasma catecholamine levels occur with pheochromocytoma. Hypertension is common, although it is often severe (eg, systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg), paroxysmal, and associated with tachy palpitations. However, hyperpigmentation and edema would not be expected.\n\n(Choice C) Impaired filtration of sodium and water is a major cause of hypertension and peripheral edema in patients with glomerulonephritis and/or other causes of kidney injury; in such cases, creatinine would be elevated. Given this patient's hyperpigmentation, hyperglycemia, and lung mass, CS is more likely.\n\n(Choice D) Marked urinary loss of albumin and other proteins is characteristic of nephrotic syndrome. Peripheral edema is usually present due to reduced intravascular oncotic pressure, but hypertension is unusual unless the glomerular filtration rate is impaired (eg, elevated creatinine). Also, hyperpigmentation is not seen.\n\n(Choice E) Renal resistance to antidiuretic hormone occurs in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients are either euvolemic or hypovolemic (if they cannot obtain drinking water as needed) and do not have hypertension or peripheral edema.\n\nEducational objective:\nHigh levels of cortisol, as seen in patients with Cushing syndrome, frequently cause hypertension due to the increased production of angiotensinogen, adrenergic hypersensitivity, and activation of renal mineralocorticoid receptors, which induces sodium reabsorption. The combined effect leads to expanded blood volume and increased systemic vascular resistance.",
    "zh": "该患者患有库欣综合征 (CS)，表现为高血压、面部多血症、易于出现瘀伤、向心性肥胖（即躯干、腹部）和高血糖。鉴于伴随的色素沉着过度（由于ACTH和促黑素细胞激素的共同分泌）和肺部肿块，这很可能与分泌ACTH的小细胞肺癌有关。副肿瘤性CS通常进展迅速，在诊断时可能没有典型的面部特征。\n\n如CS患者所见，高水平的皮质醇经常导致高血压，原因是以下几种情况的结合：\n\n周围血管对肾上腺素能刺激的敏感性增加\n肝脏产生肾素底物（血管紧张素原）增加\n肾小管盐皮质激素受体激活\n肾脏盐皮质激素受体激活通常发生在严重高皮质醇血症患者中，这通常是由于异位ACTH分泌引起的。这种受体激活可诱导肾集合管对钠的重吸收和钾的丢失。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n(选项B) 嗜铬细胞瘤患者会出现血浆儿茶酚胺水平升高。高血压很常见，尽管它通常很严重（例如，收缩压>180 mmHg），阵发性，并且与心动过速有关。然而，不应出现色素沉着过度和水肿。\n\n(选项C) 钠和水过滤受损是肾小球肾炎和/或其他原因导致肾损伤患者高血压和外周水肿的主要原因；在这种情况下，肌酐会升高。考虑到该患者的色素沉着过度、高血糖和肺部肿块，CS的可能性更大。\n\n(选项D) 尿中大量白蛋白和其他蛋白质流失是肾病综合征的特征。由于血管内胶体渗透压降低，通常存在外周水肿，但高血压不常见，除非肾小球滤过率受损（例如，肌酐升高）。此外，未见色素沉着过度。\n\n(选项E) 肾性尿崩症中出现肾脏对 (抗利尿激素) 的抵抗。患者要么是血容量正常，要么是血容量不足（如果他们无法根据需要获得饮用水），并且没有高血压或外周水肿。\n\n教育目标：\n如库欣综合征患者所见，高水平的皮质醇通常会引起高血压，原因是血管紧张素原的产生增加、肾上腺素能高敏反应以及肾脏盐皮质激素受体的激活，从而诱导钠重吸收。这种综合作用导致血容量扩张和全身血管阻力增加。"
