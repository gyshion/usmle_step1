    "en": "A 16-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department after an eye injury during a baseball game. He was batting for his high school team when the opposing pitcher made a wild throw and the baseball hit him in the right eye. The patient has since had diplopia that worsens when he looks up. On physical examination, he has mild periorbital ecchymosis, enophthalmos, and limited vertical movement of the right eye. Visual acuity and left eye examination are normal. CT scan of the face reveals an orbital floor fracture. {{exhibit_1}} Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be seen in this patient?",

    "en": "The patient has sustained an orbital floor fracture, which is a common injury from blunt trauma to the orbit. The orbital floor is the thinnest part of the orbital bone and is formed by the maxillary, palatine, and ethmoid bones. The inferior rectus muscle and the infraorbital nerve are located in close proximity to the orbital floor and can be injured during a fracture. {{exhibit_2}} The clinical presentation of diplopia that worsens with upward gaze is highly suggestive of entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle. Enophthalmos can occur due to prolapse of orbital fat into the maxillary sinus. {{exhibit_3}} The infraorbital nerve, a branch of the maxillary nerve (V2), runs along the orbital floor and exits the skull via the infraorbital foramen, which is located just below the orbit. Damage to this nerve can result in numbness or paresthesia of the upper lip, cheek, and gingiva. Therefore, reduced sensation over the right upper lip is the most likely additional finding. {{exhibit_4}} \n\n(Choice A) The corneal reflex involves the trigeminal nerve (CN V1) for sensory input and the facial nerve (CN VII) for motor output. While CN V1 can be affected by orbital fractures, the corneal reflex is typically impaired with injuries to the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve or the facial nerve, often associated with superior orbital fissure or orbital apex injuries, not specifically orbital floor fractures. \n\n(Choice B) Bruising over the mastoid process, known as Battle's sign, is indicative of a basilar skull fracture, particularly involving the temporal bone. While severe facial trauma can sometimes be associated with basilar skull fractures, it is not a direct consequence of an isolated orbital floor fracture. \n\n(Choice C) Impaired olfaction (anosmia) is usually due to damage to the olfactory nerves (CN I) or the olfactory bulb, which can occur with fractures of the cribriform plate or frontal bone, not typically with an orbital floor fracture. \n\n(Choice D) The ability to puff out the cheeks is controlled by the facial nerve (CN VII). While facial nerve injuries can occur with significant facial trauma, an isolated orbital floor fracture is less likely to directly cause weakness of the buccinator muscle. \n\nEducational objective: An orbital floor fracture can result in entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle, which presents with vertical diplopia and restriction of upward movement. In addition, the infraorbital nerve (a branch of V2) runs along the orbital floor and can be damaged, resulting in numbness and paresthesia of the upper cheek, lip, and gingiva. {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "患者已发生眶底骨折，这是钝性眶部外伤的常见损伤。眶底是眶骨最薄的部分，由上颌骨、腭骨和筛骨构成。下直肌和眶下神经与眶底非常接近，在骨折时可能受伤。{{exhibit_2}} 向上看时复视加重的临床表现高度提示下直肌受压。眼球内陷可能是由于眶脂肪脱垂到上颌窦中。{{exhibit_3}} 眶下神经是上颌神经（V2）的一个分支，沿眶底走行，通过眶下孔（位于眶下）离开颅骨。该神经受损可导致上唇、面颊和牙龈麻木或感觉异常。因此，右侧上唇感觉减退是最有可能的附加发现。{{exhibit_4}} \n\n（选项A）角膜反射涉及三叉神经（CN V1）的传入感觉和面神经（CN VII）的传出运动。虽然眶骨骨折可影响CN V1，但角膜反射通常在三叉神经眼支或面神经损伤时受损，通常与眶上裂或眶尖损伤有关，而不是眶底骨折。 \n\n（选项B）乳突过程瘀伤，即Battle征，提示颅底骨折，尤其是颞骨骨折。虽然严重的颜面部外伤有时可能与颅底骨折相关，但它并不是孤立的眶底骨折的直接后果。 \n\n（选项C）嗅觉障碍通常是由于嗅神经（CN I）或嗅球受损所致，这种情况可能发生在筛板或额骨骨折时，但通常不发生在眶底骨折。 \n\n（选项D）鼓起面颊的能力由面神经（CN VII）控制。虽然面神经损伤可能发生在严重的颜面部外伤中，但孤立的眶底骨折不太可能直接导致颊肌无力。 \n\n教育目标：眶底骨折可导致下直肌受压，表现为垂直复视和向上运动受限。此外，眶下神经（V2的一个分支）沿眶底走行，可能受损，导致上颊、上唇和牙龈麻木和感觉异常。{{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the anatomy of the orbit and the potential complications of an orbital floor fracture. Specifically, it assesses the knowledge of which cranial nerves and structures are at risk of injury with this type of fracture and the resulting clinical manifestations.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the diagnosis of orbital floor fracture based on the clinical presentation and CT findings. Then, recall the anatomical structures located near the orbital floor, particularly the inferior rectus muscle and the infraorbital nerve. Finally, correlate potential nerve damage with the sensory distribution of the trigeminal nerve branches to determine the most likely additional finding.",
