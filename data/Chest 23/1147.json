  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with cough, night sweats, and bilateral hilar adenopathy likely has sarcoidosis, a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by noncaseating granulomas (non-necrotic aggregates of epithelioid macrophages frequently with multinucleated giant cells). It typically presents in young adults (women > men) and occurs more commonly in African Americans.\n\nAny organ can be affected by sarcoidosis; however, the lungs (eg, reticular/nodular infiltrates), lymph nodes (eg, hilar adenopathy), skin (erythematous rash), and eyes (eg, anterior uveitis) are often involved. In addition to pulmonary symptoms (eg, cough, chest pain, dyspnea), constitutional symptoms (including fever, weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, and arthralgias) are common.\n\n(Choice A) Acute HIV infection can present with constitutional symptoms and weight loss; however, noncaseating granulomas are not consistent with isolated HIV infection and suggest sarcoidosis.\n\n(Choice B) Hodgkin lymphoma can cause supraclavicular adenopathy and B symptoms (eg, weight loss, fever, night sweats); however, biopsy would demonstrate Reed-Sternberg cells surrounded by an inflammatory infiltrate.\n\n(Choices C and D) Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung can cause constitutional symptoms and cough; however, a mass would be expected on imaging. In addition, biopsy of squamous cell carcinoma would show sheets or nests of malignant cells with squamous differentiation (eg, keratinization), whereas adenocarcinoma would show glandular differentiation with atypia.\n\n(Choice E) Mycobacterium avium complex can cause similar symptoms with noncaseating (and caseating) granulomas but typically occurs in severely immunocompromised patients. In addition, Mycobacterium avium pulmonary disease typically causes cavitations and pulmonary infiltrates on imaging.\n\n(Choice F) Tuberculosis can cause weight loss, cough, and night sweats, particularly in those with risk factors (eg, immunosuppression, imprisonment, immigrants, HIV positive). However, biopsy would typically show caseating granulomas and acid-fast bacilli.\n\nEducational objective:\nSarcoidosis is an inflammatory disorder characterized histologically by noncaseating granulomas consisting of aggregates of epithelioid macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. Common manifestations include hilar adenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, skin rash, ophthalmic findings, and constitutional symptoms.",
    "zh": "这名出现咳嗽、盗汗和双侧肺门淋巴结肿大的患者很可能患有结节病，这是一种全身性炎症性疾病，其特征是非干酪样肉芽肿（由上皮样巨噬细胞组成的非坏死性聚集体，常伴有多核巨细胞）。它通常见于年轻人（女性 > 男性），并且更常见于非裔美国人。\n\n结节病可影响任何器官；然而，肺（如网状/结节状浸润）、淋巴结（如肺门淋巴结肿大）、皮肤（红斑皮疹）和眼睛（如前葡萄膜炎）经常受到累及。除了肺部症状（如咳嗽、胸痛、呼吸困难）外，全身症状（包括发热、体重减轻、疲劳、盗汗和关节痛）也很常见。\n\n(选项A) 急性HIV感染可表现为全身症状和体重减轻；然而，非干酪样肉芽肿与单纯的HIV感染不符，提示结节病。\n\n(选项B) 霍奇金淋巴瘤可引起锁骨上淋巴结肿大和B症状（如体重减轻、发热、盗汗）；然而，活检会显示Reed-Sternberg细胞被炎性浸润包围。\n\n(选项C和D) 肺腺癌和肺鳞状细胞癌可引起全身症状和咳嗽；然而，影像学检查预计会出现肿块。此外，鳞状细胞癌的活检将显示具有鳞状分化（如角化）的恶性细胞片或巢，而腺癌将显示具有异型的腺体分化。\n\n(选项E) 鸟分枝杆菌复合体可引起类似的症状，伴有非干酪样（和干酪样）肉芽肿，但通常发生在严重免疫功能低下的患者中。此外，鸟分枝杆菌肺病通常会导致影像学上的空洞和肺部浸润。\n\n(选项F) 结核病可引起体重减轻、咳嗽和盗汗，尤其是在那些有危险因素的人（如免疫抑制、监禁、移民、HIV阳性）中。然而，活检通常会显示干酪样肉芽肿和抗酸杆菌。\n\n教育目标：\n结节病是一种炎症性疾病，其组织学特征为由上皮样巨噬细胞和多核巨细胞组成的非干酪样肉芽肿。常见表现包括肺门淋巴结肿大、肺部浸润、皮疹、眼部表现和全身症状。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of sarcoidosis presentation, diagnostic findings, and differential diagnosis. Sarcoidosis is characterized by noncaseating granulomas and can affect multiple organ systems, including the lungs and lymph nodes.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of sarcoidosis: bilateral hilar adenopathy on chest x-ray, noncaseating granulomas on biopsy, and constitutional symptoms. Rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as tuberculosis and lymphoma, based on biopsy findings and risk factors.",
