    "en": "A 52-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with pain and redness affecting her left leg. The patient's symptoms began 2 days ago and have progressed to the point where she cannot walk without experiencing severe pain. Physical examination shows a large, erythematous area with indistinct margins over her left leg. The area feels hot and indurated and is exquisitely tender. She is admitted to the hospital for severe left leg cellulitis and is started on intravenous cefazolin. Several minutes after the infusion is started, she experiences shortness of breath, diffuse itching, and dizziness. Her blood pressure is 64/38 mm Hg and heart rate is 130/min. On examination, there is a diffuse erythematous skin rash and bilateral wheezing is heard on lung auscultation.",
    "zh": "一名52岁的女性来到急诊科，主诉左腿疼痛和发红。患者的症状从2天前开始，并已进展到她无法行走而不会感到剧烈疼痛的程度。体格检查显示其左腿上有一个大的、红斑区域，边缘不清楚。该区域感觉发热、变硬，且极度触痛。她因严重的左腿蜂窝织炎入院，并开始静脉注射头孢唑啉。输注开始几分钟后，她出现呼吸急促、弥漫性瘙痒和头晕。她的血压为64/38 mmHg，心率为130/min。检查发现弥漫性红斑皮疹，肺部听诊可闻及双侧喘息。"

    "en": "This patient is experiencing an ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION to the cephalosporin cefazolin. Anaphylaxis is a systemic type I hypersensitivity reaction characterized by increased vascular permeability and MULTISYSTEM EDEMA, leading to massive shifting of intravascular fluid to the extravascular compartment. Symptoms often begin within seconds to minutes after intravascular exposure to an inciting factor (eg, insect stings, intravenous medications) but can take up to 2 hours to develop with orally ingested antigens.\n\nAnaphylaxis results from widespread MAST CELL and BASOPHIL DEGRANULATION and resultant HISTAMINE and TRYPTASE release. Tryptase is an enzyme that is relatively specific to mast cells, and elevated serum levels of tryptase are often used to support a clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis after the patient has been stabilized.\n\n(Choice A) Alkaline phosphatase is present in all cells of the body, but the highest levels are found in the liver, bones, and placenta.\n\n(Choice B) Calcitonin is produced by the C cells of the thyroid gland and can be useful as a tumor marker for medullary thyroid carcinoma.\n\n(Choices C and D) Collagenases breakdown collagen. Myeloperoxidase catalyzes formation of hypochlorous acid (ie, bleach) during the oxidative burst in the immune response to infection. These enzymes are found predominantly in neutrophils and are not significantly elevated during an acute allergic reaction.\n\nEducational objective: Anaphylaxis is the result of widespread mast cell and basophil degranulation and the release of preformed inflammatory mediators, including histamine and tryptase. Tryptase is relatively specific to mast cells and can be used as a marker for mast cell activation.",
    "zh": "该患者正在经历对头孢菌素类药物头孢唑啉的过敏反应。过敏反应是一种全身性I型超敏反应，其特征是血管通透性增加和多系统水肿，导致血管内液体大量转移到血管外间隙。症状通常在暴露于诱发因素（例如，昆虫蜇伤、静脉注射药物）后的几秒钟到几分钟内开始，但口服摄入的抗原可能需要长达2小时才能出现。\n\n过敏反应是由广泛的肥大细胞和嗜碱性粒细胞脱颗粒以及由此产生的组胺和类胰蛋白酶释放引起的。类胰蛋白酶是一种相对特异于肥大细胞的酶，在患者病情稳定后，通常使用血清类胰蛋白酶水平升高来支持过敏反应的临床诊断。\n\n（选项A）碱性磷酸酶存在于体内所有细胞中，但最高水平存在于肝脏、骨骼和胎盘中。\n\n（选项B）降钙素由甲状腺的C细胞产生，可用作甲状腺髓样癌的肿瘤标志物。\n\n（选项C和D）胶原酶分解胶原蛋白。髓过氧化物酶在免疫反应中催化次氯酸（即漂白剂）的形成。这些酶主要存在于中性粒细胞中，在急性过敏反应期间不会显着升高。\n\n教育目标：过敏反应是由于广泛的肥大细胞和嗜碱性粒细胞脱颗粒以及释放预先形成的炎症介质（包括组胺和类胰蛋白酶）引起的。类胰蛋白酶相对特异于肥大细胞，可用作肥大细胞激活的标志物。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of anaphylaxis, its clinical presentation, underlying mechanisms, and diagnostic markers. Specifically, it assesses the role of tryptase as a marker for mast cell activation in anaphylactic reactions.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (hypotension, wheezing, rash, itching) following exposure to a medication. Recall that anaphylaxis involves mast cell degranulation, leading to the release of mediators like histamine and tryptase, with tryptase being a relatively specific marker for mast cell activation.",
    "zh": "此题考察对过敏反应的认识，包括其临床表现、潜在机制和诊断标志物。具体而言，它评估了类胰蛋白酶作为肥大细胞活化在过敏反应中的标志物的作用。\n\n为了解决这个问题，需要识别在接触药物后过敏反应的体征和症状（低血压、喘息、皮疹、瘙痒）。回想一下，过敏反应涉及肥大细胞脱颗粒，导致组胺和类胰蛋白酶等介质的释放，其中类胰蛋白酶是肥大细胞激活的相对特异性标志物。"
