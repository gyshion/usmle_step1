    "en": "This patient's CT findings (eg, hyperdense mass) are consistent with an acute putaminal hemorrhage (ie, affecting the basal ganglia). Because of their location, putaminal hemorrhages almost always affect the adjacent internal capsule, leading to dysarthria, contralateral hemiparesis, and contralateral hemisensory loss due to disruption of the corticobulbar, corticospinal, and somatosensory fibers. As the hemorrhage expands, it leads to increase intracranial pressure (headache, nausea/vomiting, and altered mental status), midline shift from mass effect, and possible cerebral herniation. {{exhibit_2}} Hypertensive vasculopathy involving the small, penetrating branches of the major cerebral arteries is the most common cause of spontaneous deep intracerebral hemorrhage. Chronic hypertension leads to the formation of Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms, which may ultimately rupture and bleed within the deep brain structures. The most frequently affected locations include the basal ganglia (putamen), cerebellar nuclei, and pons. The basal ganglia are supplied by the LENTICULOSTRIATE ARTERIES, which are deep, small vessel branches off the middle cerebral arteries. {{exhibit_3}} (Choice A) Cortical branches of the major cerebral arteries are affected in lobar hemorrhages (eg, occipital), as opposed to deep hypertensive hemorrhages. Spontaneous lobar hemorrhages tend to occur in the elderly due to amyloid angiopathy. (Choices B, E, and F) The middle (inferior and superior divisions) and posterior cerebral arteries are large, proximal vessels arising from the circle of Willis. These arteries are typically associated with ischemic stroke due to thrombotic/embolic vessel occlusion or subarachnoid hemorrhage after saccular aneurysm rupture; intracerebral hemorrhage involving the basal ganglia is more likely due to rupture of deep penetrating arteries. (Choice D) The pontine arteries are small branches of the basilar artery that can rupture in the setting of poorly controlled chronic hypertension. Pontine hemorrhages usually occur close to the midline and affect both sides of the pons. They typically present with coma (disruption of the reticular activating system), locked-in syndrome (corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts), and pinpoint pupils (descending sympathetic tract). {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者的CT表现（例如，高密度影）与急性壳核出血（即，影响基底节）一致。由于其位置，壳核出血几乎总是会影响邻近的内囊，导致构音障碍、对侧偏瘫和对侧感觉缺失，这是由于皮质延髓束、皮质脊髓束和躯体感觉纤维受损所致。随着出血扩大，会导致颅内压升高（头痛、恶心/呕吐和精神状态改变）、由占位效应引起的脑中线移位以及可能的脑疝形成。{{exhibit_2}} 高血压性血管病变累及主要脑动脉的小分支、穿支是自发性深部脑内出血最常见的原因。慢性高血压会导致Charcot-Bouchard动脉瘤的形成，最终可能破裂并在深部脑结构内出血。最常受累的部位包括基底节（壳核）、小脑核和脑桥。基底节由豆纹动脉供应，豆纹动脉是大脑中动脉发出的深部小血管分支。{{exhibit_3}} （选项A）主要的脑动脉的皮质分支受累于叶出血（例如，枕叶），而不是深部高血压性出血。自发性叶出血倾向于发生于老年人，是由于淀粉样血管病所致。（选项B、E和F）大脑中动脉（下部和上部分支）和大脑后动脉是从Willis环发出的大的近端血管。这些动脉通常与缺血性卒中相关，这是由于血栓/栓塞血管阻塞或动脉瘤破裂后的蛛网膜下腔出血所致；涉及基底节的脑内出血更可能是由于深穿支动脉破裂所致。（选项D）脑桥动脉是基底动脉的小分支，在控制不佳的慢性高血压情况下可能破裂。脑桥出血通常发生在靠近中线的位置，并影响脑桥的两侧。它们通常表现为昏迷（网状激活系统受损）、闭锁综合征（皮质脊髓束和皮质延髓束）和针尖样瞳孔（下降的交感神经束）。{{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the etiology and common locations of spontaneous deep intracerebral hemorrhage, specifically relating the clinical presentation and CT findings to the affected cerebral blood vessels. It emphasizes the role of hypertensive vasculopathy and the anatomy of the lenticulostriate arteries in causing basal ganglia hemorrhages.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the clinical signs and CT findings suggestive of a deep intracerebral hemorrhage, particularly in the basal ganglia. Then, knowledge of the vascular supply to these deep brain structures, especially in the context of hypertension, is crucial to identify the most likely affected vessel among the given options.",
