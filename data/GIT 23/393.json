    "en": "A 54-year-old man is evaluated in the clinic due to generalized weakness and lethargy for the past 5 years. He has no history of hypothyroidism or depression. The patient uses acetaminophen intermittently for joint pains that he attributes to \"old age.\" He drinks alcohol occasionally but does not use tobacco or illicit drugs. His older brother died of liver cirrhosis. Laboratory tests show a serum ferritin level of 1800 µg/L. If this patient's disorder is hereditary, the genetic defect responsible for his condition most likely affects which of the following processes?",

    "en": "This patient likely has hereditary hemochromatosis, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive intestinal iron absorption and accumulation within parenchymal tissues that result in end-organ damage (eg, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy, arthropathy). The condition is frequently caused by a missense mutation in the HFE gene (eg, C282Y).\n\nThe HFE protein interacts with the transferrin receptor on the cell surface to facilitate endocytosis of the iron-transferrin complex. Once inside the cell, transferrin is degraded and the released iron is added to the labile iron pool. Mutation of the HFE protein leads to reduced iron uptake and causes enterocytes and hepatocytes to sense falsely low iron levels. This enhances iron accumulation in the body via 2 mechanisms:\n\n1.  Enterocytes increase apical expression of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), increasing intestinal iron absorption from the lumen.\n2.  Hepatocytes decrease hepcidin synthesis, which increases ferroportin expression on the basolateral surface of enterocytes and promotes iron secretion into the circulation.\n\nExcessive iron accumulation results in elevated levels of serum ferritin (cellular iron storage protein) and increased saturation of transferrin (major iron transporter in the plasma).\n\n(Choice A) Iron transport in the blood is not impaired in hereditary hemochromatosis as transferrin function is normal.\n\n(Choice B) Patients with severe forms of thalassemia (eg, beta thalassemia major) often have chronic hemolytic anemia and develop iron overload due to repeated blood transfusions (secondary hemochromatosis). However, hemoglobin production is normal in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis as iron transport to the bone marrow is unaffected.\n\n(Choices C and E) Total body iron levels are regulated by varying the rate of intestinal iron absorption. Although iron loss occurs through sloughing of the intestinal lining and during menstruation in women, there are no regulated mechanisms to excrete iron from the body.\n\nEducational objective:\nHereditary hemochromatosis is most commonly caused by a missense mutation in the HFE gene, resulting in excessive intestinal iron absorption and organ damage (eg, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy, arthropathy) due to iron accumulation within parenchymal tissues. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该患者可能患有遗传性血色素沉着病，这是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是肠道铁吸收过多，并在实质组织内积聚，导致终末器官损伤（如肝硬化、糖尿病、心肌病、关节病）。这种情况通常由HFE基因的错义突变（例如，C282Y）引起。\n\nHFE蛋白与细胞表面的转铁蛋白受体相互作用，以促进铁-转铁蛋白复合物的内吞作用。进入细胞后，转铁蛋白被降解，释放的铁被添加到不稳定铁库中。HFE蛋白的突变导致铁摄取减少，并导致肠细胞和肝细胞错误地感知到低铁水平。这通过两种机制增强了体内的铁积聚：\n\n1. 肠细胞增加二价金属转运蛋白1 (DMT1) 的顶端表达，增加肠道从管腔吸收铁。\n2. 肝细胞减少铁调素的合成，从而增加肠细胞基底外侧面的铁转运蛋白表达，并促进铁分泌到循环系统中。\n\n铁的过度积累导致血清铁蛋白（细胞内铁储存蛋白）水平升高，以及转铁蛋白（血浆中主要的铁转运蛋白）的饱和度增加。\n\n(选项 A) 遗传性血色素沉着病中，血液中的铁转运没有受损，因为转铁蛋白功能正常。\n\n(选项 B) 患有重型地中海贫血（例如，β-地中海贫血）的患者通常患有慢性溶血性贫血，并且由于反复输血而出现铁超载（继发性血色素沉着病）。然而，遗传性血色素沉着病患者的血红蛋白生成是正常的，因为铁向骨髓的转运不受影响。\n\n(选项 C 和 E) 全身铁水平通过改变肠道铁吸收率来调节。尽管铁的流失发生在肠道内壁脱落和女性月经期间，但没有调节机制来将铁从体内排出。\n\n教育目标：遗传性血色素沉着病最常见的原因是HFE基因的错义突变，导致肠道铁吸收过多，并由于实质组织内铁的积累而导致器官损伤（例如肝硬化、糖尿病、心肌病、关节病）。{{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hereditary hemochromatosis, specifically the genetic defect and its impact on iron absorption. It requires understanding the role of the HFE gene and its effect on intestinal iron absorption.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the elevated ferritin level as a sign of iron overload. Then, recall that hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by a mutation in the HFE gene, which leads to increased intestinal iron absorption.",
