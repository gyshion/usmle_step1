    "en": "A 65-year-old man comes to the emergency department with sudden onset of right-sided calf and foot pain. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation and stable angina. Physical examination reveals paleness of the right leg and diminished right popliteal pulse. Immediate angiography is ordered that reveals an obstructive thrombus in the right common femoral artery. The thrombus extraction is followed by a rapid surge of serum creatine kinase level, which is best explained by:",

    "en": "Ischemia is characterized by the reduction of blood flow, usually as a result of mechanical obstruction within the arterial system (eg, thrombus). If the flow of blood to the ischemic tissue is restored in a timely manner, those cells that were reversibly injured will typically recover. Sometimes, however, the cells within the damaged tissue will paradoxically die at an accelerated pace through apoptosis or necrosis after resumption of blood flow. This process is termed REPERFUSION INJURY, and is thought to occur secondary to one or more of the following mechanisms: 1) oxygen free radical generation by parenchymal cells, endothelial cells, and leukocytes; 2) severe, irreversible mitochondrial damage described as \"mitochondrial permeability transition\"; 3) inflammation, which attracts circulating neutrophils that cause additional injury; and 4) activation of the complement pathway, causing cell injury and further inflammation. When the cells within heart, brain, or skeletal muscle are injured, the enzyme creatine kinase leaks across the damaged cell membrane and into circulation (as seen in this patient).\n\n(Choice A) Cellular swelling arises secondary to changes in ion concentration and the influx of water. This state is considered a hallmark of reversible injury, and is not directly associated with the leakage of intracellular proteins such as creatine kinase.\n\n(Choice C) Glutathione peroxidase actually reduces cellular injury by catalyzing free radical breakdown. The presence of this enzyme is not responsible for the release of creatine kinase.\n\n(Choice D) Mitochondrial vacuolization reduces the cellular capacity for ATP generation and is associated with irreversible injury. Creatine kinase release is not directly associated with this mitochondrial change, however.\n\n(Choice E) Nuclear shrinkage (pyknosis), fragmentation, and dissolution characterize irreversible injury of the cell. Creatine kinase release is not directly associated with such nuclear changes, however.",
    "zh": "缺血的特征是血流减少，这通常是由于动脉系统内的机械性阻塞（例如，血栓）造成的。如果及时恢复缺血组织的血流，那些可逆性损伤的细胞通常会恢复。然而，有时，受损组织内的细胞在恢复血流后，会通过细胞凋亡或坏死以加速的速度死亡。这个过程被称为再灌注损伤，并且被认为继发于以下一种或多种机制：1) 实质细胞、内皮细胞和白细胞产生的氧自由基；2) 严重的、不可逆的线粒体损伤，被称为“线粒体通透性转变”；3) 炎症，它吸引循环中的中性粒细胞，导致额外的损伤；4) 补体途径的激活，导致细胞损伤和进一步的炎症。当心脏、大脑或骨骼肌内的细胞受损时，酶肌酸激酶会穿过受损的细胞膜并进入循环（如该患者所示）。\n\n(选项A) 细胞肿胀继发于离子浓度变化和水的涌入。 这种状态被认为是可逆性损伤的标志，并且与肌酸激酶等细胞内蛋白质的渗漏没有直接关系。\n\n(选项C) 谷胱甘肽过氧化物酶实际上通过催化自由基分解来减少细胞损伤。 这种酶的存在与肌酸激酶的释放无关。\n\n(选项D) 线粒体空泡化降低了细胞产生ATP的能力，并与不可逆损伤有关。 然而，肌酸激酶的释放与这种线粒体变化没有直接关系。\n\n(选项E) 核收缩（固缩）、断裂和溶解是细胞不可逆损伤的特征。 然而，肌酸激酶的释放与这种核变化没有直接关系。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of reperfusion injury and its mechanisms, specifically the release of intracellular enzymes like creatine kinase due to cell membrane damage. Reperfusion injury occurs when blood flow is restored to ischemic tissue, paradoxically leading to further cell damage and death.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the scenario of thrombus extraction followed by a surge in creatine kinase as indicative of reperfusion injury. Understand that cell membrane damage is a key mechanism leading to the release of intracellular enzymes during this process.",
