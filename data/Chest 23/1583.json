Physical examination shows cyanosis and expiratory wheezes scattered throughout the lungs. During evaluation for long-term oxygen therapy, his respiratory rate decreases shortly after he begins nasal cannular oxygen supplementation. This patient's reduced respiratory rate is most likely caused by a sudden decrease in stimulation of which of the following sensory receptors?",

    "en": "This patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) developed a decrease in respiratory rate as a result of oxygen supplementation. Oxygen has a minimal effect on respiratory drive unless the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) drops below 60-70 mm Hg; therefore, the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂) is the major stimulator of respiration in healthy individuals. However, patients with long-standing COPD have decreased sensitivity to PaCO₂ (due to chronic CO₂ retention) and may also have profound hypoxemia (PaO₂ <60 mm Hg); therefore, PaO₂ levels can become a significant contributor to respiratory drive.\n\nThe depth and rate of respirations are controlled by the medullary respiratory center based on input from central and peripheral chemoreceptors and airway mechanoreceptors. Peripheral chemoreceptors found in the carotid and aortic bodies {{exhibit_1}} are the primary sites for sensing PaO₂ and are stimulated by hypoxemia. When supplemental oxygen is administered, the rapid increase in PaO₂ can reduce peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation and decrease the respiratory rate.\n\nReduced respiratory rate is a minor contributor to the oxygen-induce hypercapnia that can occur in patients with COPD; increased ventilation-perfusion mismatch triggered by alleviation of pulmonary vasoconstriction in poorly ventilated areas is the major mechanism.\n\n(Choice B) Central chemoreceptors, located in the medulla, are more involved in the respiratory response to hypercapnia than to hypoxemia. CO₂ readily diffuses through the blood-brain barrier and forms hydrogen ions in the cerebrospinal fluid; the resulting decrease in pH is detected by medullary neurons, triggering an increase in respiration. Because the blood-brain barrier is relatively impermeable to hydrogen ions, blood pH itself has little effect on central chemoreceptors.\n\n(Choice C) The juxtaglomerular apparatus is located in the kidneys and consists of juxtaglomerular cells and the macula densa. It helps regulate renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate via renin secretion.\n\n(Choices D and E) Pulmonary stretch receptors include myelinated and unmyelinated C fibers in the lungs and airways. These receptors regulate the duration of inspiration depending on the degree of lung distension (Hering-Breuer reflex).\n\nEducational objective:\nArterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂) is the major stimulator of respiration in healthy individuals; even a slight increase in PaCO₂ stimulates central chemoreceptors and triggers increased ventilation. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the response to PaCO₂ is blunted and hypoxemia can contribute to respiratory drive. Peripheral chemoreceptors are primarily responsible for sensing arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) and can be suppressed with oxygen administration. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该慢性阻塞性肺病(COPD)患者由于氧气补充而出现呼吸频率下降。除非动脉血氧分压(PaO₂)降至60-70 mmHg以下，否则氧气对呼吸驱动的影响很小；因此，动脉二氧化碳分压(PaCO₂)是健康个体呼吸的主要刺激因素。然而，患有长期COPD的患者对PaCO₂的敏感性降低（由于慢性CO₂潴留），并且可能存在严重的低氧血症(PaO₂ <60 mmHg)；因此，PaO₂水平可以成为呼吸驱动的重要影响因素。\n\n呼吸的深度和频率由延髓呼吸中枢控制，该中枢基于来自中枢和外周化学感受器以及气道机械感受器的输入。在颈动脉体和主动脉体中发现的外周化学感受器{{exhibit_1}}是感应PaO₂的主要部位，并受低氧血症刺激。当补充氧气时，PaO₂的快速升高可以减少外周化学感受器的刺激并降低呼吸频率。\n\n呼吸频率降低是COPD患者可能发生的氧诱导性高碳酸血症的一个次要因素；由通气不足区域肺血管收缩缓解触发的通气-灌注失配增加是主要机制。\n\n(选项B)位于延髓的中枢化学感受器更多地参与对高碳酸血症而非低氧血症的呼吸反应。CO₂容易穿过血脑屏障并在脑脊液中形成氢离子；由此导致的pH值下降被延髓神经元检测到，从而触发呼吸增加。由于血脑屏障对氢离子相对不可渗透，因此血pH值本身对中枢化学感受器的影响很小。\n\n(选项C)肾小球旁器位于肾脏中，由肾小球旁细胞和致密斑组成。它通过肾素分泌帮助调节肾血流和肾小球滤过率。\n\n(选项D和E)肺牵张感受器包括肺和气道中的有髓和无髓C纤维。这些感受器根据肺扩张的程度调节吸气持续时间（Hering-Breuer反射）。\n\n教育目标：\n动脉二氧化碳分压(PaCO₂)是健康个体呼吸的主要刺激因素；即使PaCO₂略有升高也会刺激中枢化学感受器并触发通气增加。在慢性阻塞性肺病患者中，对PaCO₂的反应减弱，低氧血症可以促进呼吸驱动。外周化学感受器主要负责感知动脉血氧分压(PaO₂)，并且可以通过氧气给药来抑制。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of respiratory physiology, specifically the role of chemoreceptors in regulating breathing in patients with COPD. It requires knowledge of how oxygen supplementation can affect respiratory drive in these patients.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that COPD patients rely on hypoxemia as a respiratory drive due to chronic CO2 retention. Administering oxygen reduces hypoxemia, decreasing stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors (carotid and aortic bodies) and leading to a decreased respiratory rate.",
