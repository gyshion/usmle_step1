    "en": "A 52-year-old woman undergoes a fine needle aspiration procedure for evaluation of a thyroid nodule. The physician completes the biopsy successfully without complication. However, a week later, the physician is concerned because no pathology results are seen in the electronic medical record. Upon contacting the laboratory, the physician learns that the specimen was never received. The physician inquires further among his staff and learns that the staff member normally in charge of transporting specimens was absent the day the procedure was performed, and a temporary off-site assistant had filled in for the staff member. The patient is scheduled to come to the office the following day to receive her results. After informing the patient of the need for a repeat procedure due to sample misplacement, which of the following additional statements by the physician would be most appropriate?",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has experienced a preventable error (ie, misplaced biopsy specimen). Although the patient is not directly harmed, she requires a repeat biopsy procedure, exposing her to additional risks, costs, and inconvenience. The cause of this error is likely related to multiple SYSTEMS FAILURES involving tracking (eg, lack of automated tracking methods such as bar-coding), transportation (eg, complexities in transportation logistics), or staff training.\n\nAlthough the physician is not responsible for the error, the physician practices within the system that contributed to the error and therefore has an ethical obligation to disclose the error. Full disclosure of error to the patient includes the following:\n\n*   Describing details of the error (in plain language) and why it occurred (eg, that the specimen was misplaced, possibly due to problems in the tracking system)\n*   Apologizing or expressing regret for the error; in this case, given lack of direct involvement in the error, the physician should express regret on behalf of the team\n*   Explaining steps to minimize consequences to the patient (eg, waiving further charges)\n*   Describing steps to prevent future occurrences (eg, improving tracking system, reporting incident to administrators)\n\nPhysicians should avoid hiding information or providing partial disclosure (eg, not explicitly stating that an error occurred, omitting details or potential causes). Evidence suggests that early, full disclosure of errors is associated with fewer malpractice lawsuits (possibly because disclosure may increase patient trust in the provider).\n\n(Choices A and D) Although these statements include a clear apology, they do not include discussion of steps that can be taken to minimize consequences (eg, waiving charges) or prevent future occurrences.\n\n(Choice B) Although the patient has autonomy to transfer care elsewhere following an error, attempts should first be made to encourage continuation of the therapeutic relationship and reestablish trust. Moreover, as the physician was not directly involved in the error, apologizing on behalf of the team is more appropriate.\n\n(Choice E) Although staff inexperience may be a contributing factor in this error, it is likely that other systems factors (eg, tracking, staffing schedules) also played a role. Therefore, implicating staff in the error is premature without further investigation.\n\nEducational objective:\nPhysicians have an ethical responsibility to disclose errors caused by system failures to patients. Full disclosure includes providing details of the error and why it happened and explaining steps to minimize consequences and prevent future occurrences.",
    "zh": "该患者经历了可预防的错误（即，活检标本错放）。虽然患者没有直接受到伤害，但她需要重复进行活检程序，这使她面临额外的风险、费用和不便。导致此错误的原因可能与涉及追踪（例如，缺乏自动追踪方法，如条形码）、运输（例如，运输物流的复杂性）或员工培训的多个系统故障有关。\n\n尽管医生不应对错误负责，但医生在导致错误的系统中执业，因此有伦理义务披露该错误。向患者充分披露错误包括以下内容：\n\n*   描述错误的细节（用通俗易懂的语言）及其发生的原因（例如，标本被错放，可能由于追踪系统的问题）\n*   为错误道歉或表示遗憾；在这种情况下，鉴于没有直接参与错误，医生应代表团队表示遗憾\n*   解释最大限度地减少对患者造成的后果的步骤（例如，免除进一步的费用）\n*   描述防止将来再次发生的步骤（例如，改进追踪系统，向管理人员报告事件）\n\n医生应避免隐藏信息或提供部分披露（例如，不明确说明发生了错误，省略细节或潜在原因）。有证据表明，早期、充分披露错误与较少的医疗事故诉讼有关（可能是因为披露可以增加患者对提供者的信任）。\n\n（选项 A 和 D）虽然这些陈述包括明确的道歉，但它们不包括讨论可以采取的减少后果（例如，免除费用）或防止将来再次发生的步骤。\n\n（选项 B）尽管患者有自主权在错误发生后转到其他地方就医，但首先应尝试鼓励继续治疗关系并重建信任。此外，由于医生没有直接参与错误，代表团队道歉更为合适。\n\n（选项 E）虽然工作人员缺乏经验可能是导致此错误的一个因素，但其他系统因素（例如，追踪、人员配备时间表）也可能发挥了作用。因此，在没有进一步调查的情况下，将工作人员牵连到错误中为时过早。\n\n教育目标：\n医生有伦理责任向患者披露由系统故障引起的错误。充分披露包括提供错误的细节及其发生的原因，并解释最大限度地减少后果和防止将来再次发生的步骤。"

It emphasizes the importance of full disclosure and transparency in maintaining patient trust and potentially reducing malpractice lawsuits. \n\nThe best approach is to select the option that includes a comprehensive apology on behalf of the team, explains the error, and outlines steps to minimize consequences and prevent future occurrences.
