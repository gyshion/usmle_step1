    "en": "A 35-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and cough. She has had subjective fevers but no upper respiratory symptoms, and no family members have had a similar illness. Medical history is unremarkable, and the patient does not use tobacco. Temperature is 37.5 C (99.5 F), blood pressure is 118/75 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 22/min. Pulmonary examination shows normal air exchange with scattered crackles and no wheezes. The patient also has nontender cervical lymphadenopathy. Serum chemistry shows a calcium level of 12.0 mg/dL. Chest x-ray demonstrates scattered nodules and parenchymal infiltrates, as shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}.\n\nLymph node biopsy reveals noncaseating granulomas.",

    "en": "This patient, with systemic and respiratory symptoms, pulmonary infiltrates, lymphadenopathy, and noncaseating granulomas, has typical features of sarcoidosis. Hypercalcemia is a common feature of sarcoidosis, and even patients with normal serum calcium levels may have increased urinary excretion of calcium, suggesting abnormal calcium metabolism.\n\nIn normal individuals, 25-hydroxyvitamin D is converted to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidneys. This step is regulated primarily by parathyroid hormone (PTH) in response to blood calcium levels. However, in sarcoidosis and other granulomatous disorders, 1-alpha-hydroxylase expression in activated macrophages in the lung and lymph nodes causes PTH-independent production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This leads to increased intestinal absorption of calcium and subsequent hypercalcemia.\n\n(Choice A) Increased bone turnover may be seen in patients with sarcoidosis who have very high 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels, but this is a less significant source than intestinal absorption of calcium. Regardless, the underlying cause of both of these mechanisms is excess 1-alpha-hydroxylase expression by activated macrophages.\n\n(Choice C) Osteolytic metastases can cause hypercalcemia due to increased bone resorption in areas surrounding malignant cells. However, this patient, a nonsmoker with noncaseating granulomas on biopsy, has no specific signs of malignancy.\n\n(Choice D) PTH levels in sarcoidosis are typically suppressed due to elevated levels of calcium and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.\n\n(Choice E) Chronic renal failure causes phosphorus retention. The excess serum phosphorus can cause hypocalcemia by combining with intravascular calcium.\n\nEducational objective:\nHypercalcemia in sarcoidosis is caused by parathyroid hormone-independent formation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by activated macrophages. This leads to increased intestinal absorption of calcium. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者出现全身和呼吸系统症状、肺浸润、淋巴结肿大和非干酪性肉芽肿，具有典型的结节病特征。高钙血症是结节病的常见特征，即使血钙水平正常的患者也可能出现尿钙排泄增加，提示钙代谢异常。\n\n在正常个体中，25-羟基维生素D通过肾脏中的1-α-羟化酶转化为1,25-二羟基维生素D。这一步骤主要受甲状旁腺激素（PTH）调节，以响应血钙水平。然而，在结节病和其他肉芽肿性疾病中，肺和淋巴结中活化的巨噬细胞中的1-α-羟化酶表达导致PTH非依赖性产生1,25-二羟基维生素D。这导致钙的肠道吸收增加，继而引起高钙血症。\n\n(选项 A) 骨转换加速可能见于结节病患者，其1,25-二羟基维生素D水平非常高，但这不如钙的肠道吸收重要。无论如何，这两种机制的根本原因都是活化的巨噬细胞过度表达1-α-羟化酶。\n\n(选项 C) 溶骨性转移可因恶性细胞周围区域的骨吸收增加而引起高钙血症。然而，该患者为非吸烟者，活检显示非干酪性肉芽肿，没有恶性肿瘤的特异性征象。\n\n(选项 D) 结节病患者的PTH水平通常因钙和1,25-二羟基维生素D水平升高而被抑制。\n\n(选项 E) 慢性肾功能衰竭引起磷潴留。过多的血清磷可与血管内钙结合引起低钙血症。\n\n教育目标：\n结节病中的高钙血症是由活化的巨噬细胞产生1,25-二羟基维生素D（不依赖于甲状旁腺激素）引起的。这导致钙的肠道吸收增加。{{exhibit_2}}"
