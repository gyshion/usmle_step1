    "en": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the clinic after his mother noticed he was developing pubic hair. The boy had a recent growth spurt and is now taller than his 5-year-old brother. The patient's preschool teacher recently mentioned he has body odor after he runs or plays. Height is at the 95th percentile for age, and weight is at the 80th percentile. Examination reveals sparse growth of long, pigmented hair at the base of the penis and in both axillae. Testes are present bilaterally and appear normal. Laboratory assessment reveals high serum concentrations of 17-hydroxyprogesterone and testosterone.",

    "en": "Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase is the most common form of CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA and leads to impaired conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) to 11-deoxycortisol. Excess 17-OHP is shunted away from cortisol synthesis toward androgen production. ACTH increases due to the decline in cortisol levels and has a trophic effect on adrenal cortical cells, causing ADRENAL CORTICAL HYPERPLASIA. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nDepending on the residual enzyme activity, 21-hydroxylase deficiency can present as 3 distinct clinical syndromes of differing severity. This patient most likely has the classic, non-salt-wasting (ie, simple virilizing) form of the disease. Because 21-hydroxylase is not completely absent (as in the most severe form), sufficient mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids are maintained to avoid salt wasting such that patients have normal blood pressure and electrolytes. Due to ADRENAL ANDROGEN OVERPRODUCTION, girls with this variant are often identified at birth due to ambiguous genitalia. Boys appear normal at birth and typically present around age 2-4 with early virilization (eg, body odor, pubic/axillary hair). Exposure to high levels of sex hormones also induces an early pubertal growth spurt that manifests as ACCELERATED LINEAR GROWTH at a young age.\n\nIn all forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency, patients have increased 17-OHP and androgen levels. Adrenal androgens (eg, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione) undergo peripheral conversion to testosterone, which explains this patient's high testosterone level.\n\n(Choice B) Adrenal medullary hyperplasia is a precursor lesion for pheochromocytoma characterized by increased catecholamine production. Presenting signs include hypertension, tachycardia, and sweating (not virilization).\n\n(Choice C) Leydig cell tumors produce excess testosterone and can present with precocious puberty in young boys (eg, early testicular/phallic enlargement). A testicular mass is typically palpated on examination.\n\n(Choice D) Production of excess LH and FSH by pituitary adenomas can lead to increased testosterone but not increased 17-OHP levels. Pituitary adenomas producing excess ACTH can lead to excess adrenal androgen production; however, symptoms of excess cortisol production (Cushing syndrome) such as growth deceleration and weight gain would predominate.\n\n(Choice E) A seminoma is a testicular tumor most commonly found in adolescents and adults. These tumors are derived from the seminiferous tubules and present with a testicular mass, not virilization and elevated testosterone.\n\nEducational objective:\nDeficiency of 21-hydroxylase causes adrenal cortical hyperplasia due to excess stimulation of the adrenal cortex by ACTH. The classic, non-salt-wasting form presents in boys age 2-4 with early virilization, accelerated linear growth, and elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androgens.",
    "zh": "21-羟化酶缺乏症是最常见的先天性肾上腺增生症形式，导致17-羟孕酮 (17-OHP) 转化为 11-脱氧皮质醇受损。过量的17-OHP从皮质醇合成转移到雄激素生成。由于皮质醇水平下降，ACTH增加，并对肾上腺皮质细胞产生营养作用，导致肾上腺皮质增生。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n根据残余酶活性，21-羟化酶缺乏症可表现为3种不同严重程度的临床综合征。该患者最有可能患有该病的经典、非失盐型（即，单纯男性化）形式。由于21-羟化酶并非完全缺失（如在最严重的形式中），因此维持了足够的盐皮质激素和糖皮质激素以避免失盐，从而使患者具有正常的血压和电解质。由于肾上腺雄激素过度产生，患有这种变异的女孩通常在出生时就被发现，因为她们有外生殖器模糊不清。男孩在出生时看起来正常，通常在2-4岁左右出现早期男性化（例如，体味、阴毛/腋毛）。暴露于高水平的性激素也会诱导早期青春期生长突增，表现为幼年时的加速线性生长。\n\n在所有形式的21-羟化酶缺乏症中，患者的17-OHP和雄激素水平都会升高。肾上腺雄激素（例如，脱氢表雄酮和雄烯二酮）在周围转化为睾酮，这解释了该患者睾酮水平高的原因。\n\n(选项B) 肾上腺髓质增生是嗜铬细胞瘤的前体病变，其特征是儿茶酚胺生成增加。出现的体征包括高血压、心动过速和出汗（不是男性化）。\n\n(选项C) Leydig细胞瘤产生过多的睾酮，并且可引起男孩的性早熟（例如，睾丸/阴茎早期增大）。检查通常可触及睾丸肿块。\n\n(选项D) 垂体腺瘤产生的过量LH和FSH可导致睾酮升高，但不会导致17-OHP水平升高。产生过量ACTH的垂体腺瘤可导致肾上腺雄激素过度产生；然而，过量皮质醇产生的症状（库欣综合征），如生长减缓和体重增加，将占主导地位。\n\n(选项E) 精原细胞瘤是一种睾丸肿瘤，最常见于青少年和成年人。这些肿瘤源自精小管，表现为睾丸肿块，而不是男性化和睾酮升高。\n\n教育目标：\n21-羟化酶缺乏症导致肾上腺皮质增生，原因是ACTH过度刺激肾上腺皮质。经典的、非失盐型在2-4岁的男孩中表现为早期男性化、加速的线性生长以及17-羟孕酮和雄激素水平升高。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, specifically the non-classic form, and its clinical presentation in young boys. It assesses the ability to recognize the signs and symptoms of early virilization and elevated androgen levels in the context of CAH.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the clinical features of early virilization (pubic hair, body odor, growth spurt) and the elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone level, which are characteristic of CAH. Rule out other causes of precocious puberty based on the absence of testicular mass or other specific symptoms.",
