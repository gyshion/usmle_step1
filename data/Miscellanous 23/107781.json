    "en": "A 14-year-old girl is brought to the clinic for evaluation of primary amenorrhea. The patient takes no medications. Examination establishes breast development consistent with Tanner stage 1 and pubic hair consistent with Tanner stage 3. There is a blind vaginal pouch. Imaging reveals absence of a uterus and fallopian tubes. Epididymides and vasa deferentia are present bilaterally, and testes are visualized bilaterally within the inguinal canal. Karyotype analysis shows 46,XY.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient is a 46,XY genotypic male with external female genitalia (blind vaginal pouch, absence of uterus and fallopian tubes) but internal male genital ducts (epididymides and vasa deferentia) and testes. This discordance between genotype and phenotype, particularly the presence of internal male structures despite female external genitalia, is characteristic of 5-alpha reductase deficiency. This enzyme is responsible for converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is crucial for the virilization of external genitalia during embryonic development. In its absence, the external genitalia develop along female lines. However, testosterone itself is responsible for the development of internal male structures (wolffian ducts), which are present in this patient. The explanation also includes a table summarizing 5-alpha reductase deficiency, its pathogenesis, and clinical features. \n\n(Choice B) Aplasia of fetal Leydig cells would result in a lack of testosterone production, leading to absent internal male structures and female external genitalia. This patient has internal male structures, making Leydig cell aplasia unlikely.\n\n(Choice C) Complete androgen receptor insensitivity (testicular feminization) would result in a 46,XY individual with female external genitalia, breast development, and a blind vaginal pouch, but absent internal male structures (vas deferens, epididymis) due to the inability to respond to androgens. This patient has internal male structures, ruling out complete androgen insensitivity.\n\n(Choice D) Inability to convert 17-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol is a defect in cortisol synthesis, typically leading to congenital adrenal hyperplasia. In XX individuals, it causes virilization. In XY individuals, it usually results in normal male external genitalia, although some ambiguity can occur. This is not the primary mechanism for the observed findings.\n\n(Choice E) Loss of the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome (SRY gene) would lead to a 46,XY individual developing as a female, with absent testes and female internal and external genitalia. This patient has testes and internal male structures, making SRY gene loss unlikely.\n\nKey clinical pearls: The presence of internal male structures (vas deferens, epididymis) in a 46,XY individual with female external genitalia strongly suggests a defect in androgen action or metabolism after testosterone production, with 5-alpha reductase deficiency being the most common cause. Remember that testosterone drives internal male development, while DHT drives external male virilization.",
    "zh": "该患者为46,XY基因型男性，外生殖器为女性（盲端阴道，子宫和输卵管缺如），但内生殖器导管为男性（附睾和输精管）并且有睾丸。这种基因型和表型的差异，特别是尽管外生殖器为女性但存在内生殖器结构，是5-α还原酶缺乏症的特征。该酶负责将睾酮转化为双氢睾酮(DHT)。DHT对于胚胎发育过程中外生殖器的男性化至关重要。在缺乏DHT的情况下，外生殖器会沿着女性方向发育。然而，睾酮本身负责内生殖器结构（中肾管）的发育，这些结构在该患者中存在。解释还包括一个表格，总结了5-α还原酶缺乏症，其发病机制和临床特征。\n\n（选项B）胎儿Leydig细胞发育不全会导致睾酮生成不足，从而导致内生殖器结构缺失和女性外生殖器。该患者有内生殖器结构，因此Leydig细胞发育不全的可能性较小。\n\n（选项C）完全雄激素受体不敏感（睾丸女性化）会导致46,XY个体出现女性外生殖器、乳房发育和盲端阴道，但由于无法对雄激素作出反应而缺乏内生殖器结构（输精管、附睾）。该患者有内生殖器结构，因此排除了完全雄激素不敏感性。\n\n（选项D）无法将17-羟孕酮转化为11-脱氧皮质醇是皮质醇合成的缺陷，通常会导致先天性肾上腺皮质增生。在XX个体中，它会导致男性化。在XY个体中，通常会导致正常的男性外生殖器，尽管可能会出现一些歧义。这并不是观察到的发现的主要机制。\n\n（选项E）Y染色体性别决定区（SRY基因）缺失会导致46,XY个体发育为女性，且缺乏睾丸和女性内外生殖器。该患者有睾丸和内生殖器结构，因此SRY基因缺失的可能性较小。\n\n关键临床要点：46,XY个体出现女性外生殖器但存在内生殖器结构（输精管、附睾），强烈提示在睾酮生成后雄激素的作用或代谢存在缺陷，其中5-α还原酶缺乏症是最常见的原因。请记住，睾酮驱动内生殖器发育，而DHT驱动外生殖器男性化。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of disorders of sex development, specifically differentiating between conditions affecting androgen synthesis, action, and metabolism in a 46,XY individual. It requires correlating genetic makeup with anatomical findings to identify the underlying pathophysiological mechanism.\n\nTo solve this question, analyze the patient's genotype (46,XY) and phenotype (external female genitalia, internal male structures, testes). Consider the roles of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in sexual differentiation. Evaluate each option based on the expected clinical presentation of the described genetic or enzymatic defect.",
