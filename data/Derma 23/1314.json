Physical examination shows a few well-defined, hypopigmented lesions on the skin of his lower extremities that have diminished sensation. After confirming the diagnosis of leprosy, the patient undergoes further testing to help classify the severity of his disease. Intradermal injection of heat-killed *Mycobacterium leprae* causes the development of a large indurated nodule.",

    "en": "Leprosy is a chronic, slowly progressive, communicable disease caused by *Mycobacterium leprae* that typically involves the skin and peripheral nerves. Clinical manifestations are widely variable depending on the strength of the T<sub>H</sub>1 cell-mediated immune response to the organism. Disease is classified along a spectrum between tuberculoid (mild) to lepromatous (severe) forms. Patients with tuberculoid leprosy develop a strong T<sub>H</sub>1-mediated response (interleukin [IL]-2, IFN-γ, and IL-12) in affected tissues, leading to the activation of macrophages that kill *M leprae* organisms, thereby limiting disease extent. However, this localized inflammation damages the skin and cutaneous nerves, leading to the development of a small number of hypopigmented, well-demarcated plaques with decreased sensation.\n\nLepromatous leprosy is a more disseminated form of the disease characterized by an innate inability to recognize and mount a cellular immune response against *M leprae* antigens. Affected tissues show extensive accumulation of acid-fast bacilli within macrophages and often a T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokine profile (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10). Patients with lepromatous leprosy develop more numerous, poorly demarcated plaques that are widespread across the body. Over time, the bacterial load increases and the nodular lesions coalesce, causing the development of leonine facies and degeneration and loss of the nose and digits.\n\nThe lepromin skin test (in which *M leprae* antigens are injected intradermally) can be used to distinguish between tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy. Patients with tuberculoid leprosy will develop an indurated nodule at the site of the injection (much like a positive PPD test for *M tuberculosis*). In contrast, the test is usually nonreactive in patients with lepromatous leprosy due to their weak T<sub>H</sub>1 cell-mediated immune response.\n\n(Choice A) Patients with lepromatous leprosy have a high bacterial load with widespread involvement throughout the peripheral (cooler) tissues of the body. As a result, intermittent bacteremia often occurs in the later stages of the disease. However, this patient's few lesions and positive lepromin skin test {{exhibit_1}} are more indicative of tuberculoid leprosy, which has a very low bacterial load with limited tissue involvement.\n\n(Choice B) High serum antimycobacterial antibody levels are more frequently seen in lepromatous leprosy than tuberculoid leprosy. Because *M leprae* resides mostly within macrophages, circulating immunoglobulins have little access to the organism and are unable to bind, opsonize, or fix complement. Humoral immunity does not influence the positivity of the lepromin skin test.\n\n(Choice C) In lepromatous leprosy, macrophages remain inactivated due to the inability of T<sub>H</sub>1 cells to recognize *M leprae* antigens. This form of leprosy is characterized by a poor cell-mediated response and diffuse spread of the organism. This patient is presenting with the tuberculoid form, in which activated macrophages actively kill *M leprae* organisms.\n\n(Choice E) Acid-fast bacteria typically do not accumulate in the skin lesions of tuberculoid leprosy due to the strong cell-mediated response that is effective at eradicating *M leprae*. In some instances, this immune response is so effective that tuberculoid leprosy can be self-limited and heal completely without treatment.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe lepromin skin test will be positive in patients with tuberculoid leprosy as they exhibit a strong CD4+ T<sub>H</sub>1 cell-mediated immune response to *Mycobacterium leprae*. Patients with lepromatous leprosy will test negative due to their weak T<sub>H</sub>1 cell-mediated immune response.",
    "zh": "麻风病是由麻风分枝杆菌(*Mycobacterium leprae*)引起的慢性、缓慢进展的、可传播的疾病，通常涉及皮肤和周围神经。临床表现差异很大，这取决于针对该病原体的T<sub>H</sub>1细胞介导的免疫反应的强度。该疾病被归类为结核样麻风（轻度）到瘤型麻风（重度）之间的谱系。结核样麻风患者在受累组织中发展出强烈的T<sub>H</sub>1介导的反应（白细胞介素[IL]-2，IFN-γ和IL-12），导致巨噬细胞活化，从而杀死麻风分枝杆菌，从而限制疾病范围。然而，这种局部炎症会损伤皮肤和皮肤神经，导致出现少量色素减退、边界清楚的斑块，伴有感觉减退。\n\n瘤型麻风是该疾病的一种更广泛的播散形式，其特征在于先天性无法识别并对麻风分枝杆菌抗原产生细胞免疫反应。受累组织显示巨噬细胞内大量抗酸杆菌积聚，并且经常出现T<sub>H</sub>2细胞因子谱（IL-4，IL-5和IL-10）。瘤型麻风患者会发展出更多、边界不清的斑块，这些斑块遍布全身。随着时间的推移，细菌载量增加，结节病变融合，导致狮面症和鼻子和手指的退化和缺失。\n\n麻风菌素皮肤试验（将麻风分枝杆菌抗原皮内注射）可用于区分结核样麻风和瘤型麻风。结核样麻风患者将在注射部位出现硬结性结节（很像结核分枝杆菌的PPD试验阳性）。相比之下，由于瘤型麻风患者的T<sub>H</sub>1细胞介导的免疫反应较弱，该试验通常无反应。\n\n(选项A) 瘤型麻风患者的细菌载量高，遍及身体周围（较冷）组织。因此，在该疾病的后期阶段，经常发生间歇性菌血症。然而，该患者的几个病变和麻风菌素皮肤试验阳性{{exhibit_1}}更表明为结核样麻风，其细菌载量非常低，组织受累有限。\n\n(选项B) 血清中抗分枝杆菌抗体水平高在瘤型麻风中比在结核样麻风中更常见。由于麻风分枝杆菌主要存在于巨噬细胞内，循环免疫球蛋白很少能接触到该病原体，并且无法结合、调理或激活补体。体液免疫不影响麻风菌素皮肤试验的阳性。\n\n(选项C) 在瘤型麻风中，由于T<sub>H</sub>1细胞无法识别麻风分枝杆菌抗原，巨噬细胞保持失活状态。这种麻风病的特征是细胞介导的反应差和病原体弥漫性扩散。该患者表现为结核样形式，其中活化的巨噬细胞主动杀灭麻风分枝杆菌。\n\n(选项E) 由于强烈的细胞介导的反应有效根除麻风分枝杆菌，抗酸杆菌通常不会在结核样麻风的皮肤病变中积聚。在某些情况下，这种免疫反应非常有效，以至于结核样麻风可以自限性并在没有治疗的情况下完全治愈。\n\n教育目的：\n麻风菌素皮肤试验在结核样麻风患者中将呈阳性，因为他们对麻风分枝杆菌表现出强烈的CD4+ T<sub>H</sub>1细胞介导的免疫反应。瘤型麻风患者将呈阴性，因为他们的T<sub>H</sub>1细胞介导的免疫反应较弱。"
