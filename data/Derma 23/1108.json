  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Typically associated with hyperlipidemia or lymphoproliferative malignancies, xanthomas are yellow nodules composed of lipid-laden histiocytes in the dermis. Clinically, xanthomas can be divided into several categories:\n\n*   eruptive xanthomas: yellow papules that abruptly appear when plasma triglycerides and lipids increase.\n*   tuberous and tendinous xanthomas: the latter are often present on Achilles tendons and the extensor tendons of the fingers.\n*   plane xanthomas: linear lesions in skin folds that are strongly associated with primary biliary cholangitis.\n*   xanthelasma: soft eyelid or periorbital plaques with no associated lipid abnormalities in 50% of affected individuals.\n\nHistologically, xanthomas are composed of benign macrophages packed with finely vacuolated, \"foamy\" cytoplasm. This cytoplasm contains high levels of cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides. The lipid-laden macrophages are frequently also enclosed by inflammatory cells and fibrotic stroma. With xanthelasmas, the small aggregates of dermal foam cells are present without any surrounding inflammation or fibrosis.\n\n(Choice B) Fasting blood glucose would be appropriate to evaluate in patients suspected of having diabetes mellitus or other glucose metabolic abnormalities. Associated skin findings include acanthosis nigricans.\n\n(Choice C) Rheumatoid factor would be appropriate to evaluate in patients suspected of having rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid nodules are associated with severe disease (eg, painful arthritis, deformations) and usually develop on pressure points.\n\n(Choice D) Antinuclear antibodies would be appropriate to evaluate in patients suspected of having autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n(Choice E) Fecal occult blood test would be appropriate to evaluate in patients suspected of having bleeding of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nEducational objective:\nXanthomas are suggestive of HYPERLIPIDEMIA, especially when present in conjunction with a family history of early cardiac death.",
    "zh": "黄瘤通常与高脂血症或淋巴增殖性恶性肿瘤有关，是真皮中由富含脂质的组织细胞组成的黄色结节。临床上，黄瘤可分为几类：\n\n*   发疹性黄瘤：当血浆甘油三酯和脂质升高时突然出现的黄色丘疹。\n*   结节性和腱性黄瘤：后者常出现在跟腱和手指伸肌腱上。\n*   扁平黄瘤：皮肤皱褶中的线状病变，与原发性胆汁性胆管炎密切相关。\n*   睑黄瘤：软性眼睑或眶周斑块，50%的受影响个体没有相关的脂质异常。\n\n组织学上，黄瘤由良性巨噬细胞组成，这些巨噬细胞被精细空泡化的“泡沫状”细胞质所包裹。这种细胞质含有高水平的胆固醇、磷脂和甘油三酯。富含脂质的巨噬细胞也经常被炎性细胞和纤维化基质包围。对于睑黄瘤，小的真皮泡沫细胞聚集体存在，没有周围的炎症或纤维化。\n\n（选项 B）对于怀疑患有糖尿病或其他葡萄糖代谢异常的患者，空腹血糖是合适的评估方法。相关的皮肤表现包括黑棘皮病。\n\n（选项 C）对于怀疑患有类风湿性关节炎的患者，类风湿因子是合适的评估方法。类风湿结节与严重疾病（例如，疼痛性关节炎、畸形）有关，通常发生在受压点。\n\n（选项 D）对于怀疑患有自身免疫性疾病（如系统性红斑狼疮）的患者，抗核抗体是合适的评估方法。\n\n（选项 E）对于怀疑有胃肠道出血的患者，大便潜血试验是合适的评估方法。\n\n教学目标：\n黄瘤提示高脂血症，尤其是在伴有早发性心脏病家族史的情况下。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize tendinous xanthomas as a sign of hyperlipidemia and to select the appropriate initial test. The patient's family history of early cardiac death further supports the need to evaluate for hyperlipidemia.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the significance of the subcutaneous bumps attached to the Achilles tendons (tendinous xanthomas) and the family history of early cardiac death. This should prompt consideration of hyperlipidemia as the underlying cause and lead to the selection of a blood cholesterol test.",
    "zh": "此问题测试识别腱黄瘤作为高脂血症的征兆以及选择合适的初始检查的能力。患者的早发性心脏病家族史进一步支持了评估高脂血症的必要性。\n\n解决此问题的关键是认识到附着在跟腱上的皮下肿块（腱黄瘤）和早发性心脏病家族史的重要性。这应促使考虑高脂血症作为根本原因，并导致选择血胆固醇测试。"
