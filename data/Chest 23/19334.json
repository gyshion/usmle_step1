    "en": "This patient with sudden-onset shortness of breath and a physical examination showing subcutaneous crepitus and unilaterally decreased breath sounds most likely has a pneumothorax. In cystic fibrosis, chronic lung damage, combined with mucus plugging and large alveolar pressure surges (eg, coughing), predisposes to spontaneous alveolar rupture.\n\nPressure in the lungs is normally equivalent to atmospheric pressure at end expiration, and the pressure in the intrapleural space is negative (eg, -5 cm H2O relative to atmospheric pressure) due to the expanding tendency of the chest wall and collapsing tendency of the lungs. Alveolar rupture creates continuity between the lungs and the pleural space, with pressure equalization and loss of intrapleural negative pressure. Shortness of breath results from inability to expand the ruptured lung, and during rupture, air may be forced into the subcutaneous tissues of the chest wall to cause crepitus.\n\nSimple pneumothorax is most common, but tension pneumothorax can develop if the rupture creates a one-way tissue valve that opens during inspiration to allow air into the pleural space and then closes during expiration to trap that air. As a result, intrapleural pressure increases with each breath and leads to contralateral mediastinal shift with vena cava compression and decreased venous return to the heart. The reduced cardiac output causes hypotension and tachycardia (ie, obstructive shock) and can rapidly lead to cardiac arrest; therefore, emergent decompression of the pleural space is needed. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(Choice A) Alveolar consolidation with inflammatory exudate occurs with pneumonia, which can cause hypotension (ie, septic shock). However, increased breath sounds are expected with pneumonia, and it would not explain subcutaneous crepitus.\n\n(Choice B) Bronchial obstruction with alveolar air reabsorption describes atelectasis (eg, due to a large mucus plug). Shortness of breath and decreased breath sounds are typical, but hypotension and subcutaneous crepitus are not expected.\n\n(Choice C) Diffuse bronchiolar constriction occurs with asthma exacerbation and is not typical of cystic fibrosis. Hypotension and unilaterally decreased breath sounds are not expected with asthma exacerbation.\n\n(Choice D) Increased dead-space ventilation occurs with pulmonary embolism. Although hypotension (ie, obstructive shock) can occur, decreased breath sounds and subcutaneous crepitus are not typical.\n\nEducational objective:\nSpontaneous pneumothorax is common in cystic fibrosis and involves alveolar rupture, leading to loss of intrapleural negative pressure. Patients have sudden-onset shortness of breath, unilaterally decreased breath sounds, and, sometimes, subcutaneous crepitus. Hypotension and tachycardia suggest the development of tension pathophysiology.",
    "zh": "该患者突发呼吸困难，体格检查显示皮下捻发感和单侧呼吸音减弱，最有可能患有气胸。在囊性纤维化中，慢性肺损伤，加上黏液阻塞和大的肺泡压力涌动（例如，咳嗽），易于发生自发性肺泡破裂。\n\n肺内的压力在呼气末通常与大气压相等，而胸膜腔内的压力为负压（例如，相对于大气压为 -5 cm H2O），这是由于胸壁的扩张趋势和肺的塌陷趋势。肺泡破裂使肺和胸膜腔之间产生连续性，导致压力均等和胸膜腔内负压消失。呼吸困难是由于无法扩张破裂的肺，并且在破裂期间，空气可能会被压入胸壁的皮下组织中，从而引起捻发感。\n\n单纯性气胸最常见，但如果破裂形成一个单向组织瓣膜，该瓣膜在吸气时打开以允许空气进入胸膜腔，然后在呼气时关闭以捕获空气，则可能发展为张力性气胸。结果，胸膜腔内压力随着每次呼吸而增加，并导致对侧纵隔移位，伴有腔静脉受压和静脉回流减少。心输出量减少会导致低血压和心动过速（即，阻塞性休克），并可迅速导致心脏骤停；因此，需要紧急减压胸膜腔。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}\n\n（选项 A）肺泡实变伴炎性渗出物发生于肺炎，可引起低血压（即，感染性休克）。然而，肺炎预计会增加呼吸音，并且无法解释皮下捻发感。\n\n（选项 B）支气管阻塞伴肺泡气体再吸收描述了肺不张（例如，由于大的黏液栓子）。呼吸困难和呼吸音减弱是典型的，但预计不会出现低血压和皮下捻发感。\n\n（选项 C）弥漫性细支气管收缩发生于哮喘加重，并非囊性纤维化的典型表现。哮喘加重预计不会出现低血压和单侧呼吸音减弱。\n\n（选项 D）死腔通气增加发生于肺栓塞。虽然可能发生低血压（即，阻塞性休克），但呼吸音减弱和皮下捻发感并不典型。\n\n教学目标：\n自发性气胸在囊性纤维化中很常见，涉及肺泡破裂，导致胸膜腔内负压消失。患者会出现突发性呼吸困难、单侧呼吸音减弱，有时会出现皮下捻发感。低血压和心动过速提示张力性病理生理学的发生。"
