    "en": "A 46-year-old obese man is referred to a dietitian for evaluation of his food intake. He has been trying to lose weight but has been unsuccessful. The patient is 172.7 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 113 kg (250 lb). Analysis of his food intake shows that he is consuming 3600 Calories a day. The dietitian recommends increasing physical activity and implementing a dietary plan. In the first phase, the patient is advised to reduce his daily dietary intake to 3,000 Calories, with 30% coming from protein.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Dietary energy comes predominantly from protein, carbohydrate, and fat. Metabolism yields 4 Calories (Cal) per gram of protein or carbohydrate and 9 Cal per gram of fat. Ethanol yields 7 Cal per gram.\n\nThis patient is instructed to consume 3000 Cal per day, 900 (30%) of which are to be from protein. Because 1 g of protein yields 4 Cal of energy, this patient should consume (900 Cal /4 Cal) = 225 g/day of protein.\n\nEducational objective:\nMetabolism of 1 g of protein or carbohydrate produces 4 Calories of energy; metabolism of 1 g of fat produces 9 Calories.",
    "zh": "膳食能量主要来自蛋白质、碳水化合物和脂肪。代谢每克蛋白质或碳水化合物产生4卡路里（Cal），每克脂肪产生9卡路里。乙醇每克产生7卡路里。\n\n该患者被指示每天摄入3000卡路里，其中900卡路里（30%）来自蛋白质。由于1克蛋白质产生4卡路里的能量，该患者应摄入（900卡路里/4卡路里）= 225克/天 的蛋白质。\n\n教育目标：\n1克蛋白质或碳水化合物的代谢产生4卡路里的能量；1克脂肪的代谢产生9卡路里。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to calculate macronutrient requirements based on caloric intake and percentage distribution. It requires understanding the caloric values of protein, carbohydrates, and fats and applying basic arithmetic to determine the grams of protein needed to meet the specified caloric percentage.\n\nTo solve this question, first calculate the total calories from protein (30% of 3000 Calories). Then, divide the total protein calories by the caloric value of protein (4 Calories/gram) to find the grams of protein required per day.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试根据热量摄入和百分比分布计算常量营养素需求的能力。它需要理解蛋白质、碳水化合物和脂肪的热量值，并运用基本的算术来确定满足指定热量百分比所需的蛋白质克数。\n\n要解决这个问题，首先计算来自蛋白质的总热量（3000卡路里的30%）。然后，将总蛋白质热量除以蛋白质的热量值（4卡路里/克），以找到每天所需的蛋白质克数。"
