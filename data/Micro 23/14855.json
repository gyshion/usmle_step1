    "en": "A 27-year-old man comes to the office due to a 2-week history of genital papules that are not painful or pruritic. Over this period, he has also had fatigue and mild, generalized arthralgia but no urethral discharge or dysuria. The patient had gonococcal urethritis 3 months ago, which was adequately treated, and tests for other sexually transmitted infections at that time were negative. He is sexually active with several male and female partners and reports using condoms consistently after the episode of gonorrhea. Temperature is 37.6 C (99.6 F). Physical examination shows a faint, diffuse maculopapular skin rash involving the trunk, extremities, palms, and soles. There are several enlarged, nontender inguinal lymph nodes. Genital examination reveals multiple elevated lesions on the scrotum and perineal region. Histopathologic evaluation of these lesions would most likely reveal which of the following in this patient? {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "一名27岁男性因阴茎丘疹2周前来就诊，丘疹无疼痛或瘙痒。在此期间，他还感到疲劳和轻微的全身性关节痛，但无尿道分泌物或排尿困难。患者3个月前患有淋球菌性尿道炎，已得到充分治疗，当时的性传播感染检测结果为阴性。他与多个男性和女性伴侣有性行为，并报告在患淋病后一直使用避孕套。体温37.6°C（99.6°F）。体格检查显示躯干、四肢、手掌和足底出现轻微、弥漫性斑丘疹皮疹。有几个肿大、无压痛的腹股沟淋巴结。生殖器检查显示阴囊和会阴区有多个隆起性病变。该患者对这些病变的组织病理学评估最有可能揭示以下哪一项？ {{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "Secondary syphilis is characterized by the spread of the causative spirochete, *Treponema pallidum*, through the blood to the skin and mucosal surfaces. Patients usually have a diffuse maculopapular skin rash that includes the palms and soles. They may also develop *condylomata lata*, which are painless, wart-like, elevated plaques, on moist areas of the skin such as the scrotum and perineum. **Lymphadenopathy**, fatigue, arthralgias, and mild fever are also common. Histopathologic examination of syphilitic lesions (at all stages) classically demonstrates **proliferative endarteritis** of small vessels with a surrounding plasma cell–rich infiltrate.\n\nThis patient was likely infected with syphilis at the same time he was infected with gonorrhea (coinfection is common). Serologic testing for syphilis (eg, rapid plasma reagin) is often falsely negative in early infection due to lag time between acquisition of *T. pallidum* and the development of a measurable humoral antibody response. Patients who do not notice or ignore the genital chancre of primary syphilis often develop secondary syphilis 2 – 10 weeks later.\n\n(Choice A) Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by autoantibodies against epithelial cell surface antigens, leading to the formation of mucous membrane blisters that quickly erode; histopathology usually shows acantholysis (detached keratinocytes) with superficial dermal infiltrate.\n\n(Choice B) Kaposi sarcoma (KS) lesions are histologically characterized by spindle-shaped endothelial cells that form vascular channels. KS is due to human herpesvirus 8 infection and most commonly occurs in the setting of advanced AIDS. Lesions typically appear as purplish or dark brown plaques and nodules on the lower extremities.\n\n(Choice D) Biopsy of erythema nodosum lesions usually reveals septal panniculitis with multinucleated giant cells. Erythema nodosum is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that can occur due to drugs or other antigenic stimuli. Patients usually present with tender nodules on the bilateral shins.\n\n(Choice E) Biopsy of anogenital warts will demonstrate papillomatous epidermal hyperplasia with cytoplasmic vacuolization. Anogenital warts are caused by specific serotypes of human papillomavirus (eg, HPV-6, HPV-11). Anogenital warts are not typically associated with diffuse maculopapular rash or systemic symptoms.\n\nEducational objective:\nHistopathologic examination of syphilitic lesions classically demonstrates a proliferative endarteritis with a surrounding plasma cell infiltrate. Most of the manifestations of syphilis are due to localized tissue ischemia resulting from endarteritis. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "二期梅毒的特征是病原螺旋体苍白密螺旋体(*Treponema pallidum*)通过血液扩散到皮肤和黏膜表面。患者通常会出现弥漫性斑丘疹皮疹，包括手掌和足底。他们也可能发展为扁平湿疣(*condylomata lata*)，这是一种无痛的、疣状的、隆起的斑块，位于皮肤潮湿区域，如阴囊和会阴。**淋巴结病**、疲劳、关节痛和轻度发热也很常见。对梅毒病变的组织病理学检查（在所有阶段）典型地显示小血管的**增生性动脉内膜炎**，伴有周围丰富的浆细胞浸润。\n\n该患者很可能在感染淋病的同时感染了梅毒（合并感染很常见）。由于苍白密螺旋体(*T. pallidum*)感染和可测量的体液抗体反应的产生之间存在滞后时间，早期感染的梅毒血清学检测（例如，快速血浆反应素试验）通常呈假阴性。没有注意到或忽略原发性梅毒生殖器下疳的患者通常会在2 – 10周后发展为二期梅毒。\n\n（选项A）寻常型天疱疮的特征是针对上皮细胞表面抗原的自身抗体，导致黏膜水疱形成，迅速侵蚀；组织病理学通常显示棘解（角质形成细胞脱落）伴浅表真皮浸润。\n\n（选项B）卡波西肉瘤(KS)病变的组织学特征是梭形内皮细胞形成血管通道。KS是由于人疱疹病毒8型感染引起的，最常发生在晚期艾滋病中。病变通常表现为下肢的紫红色或深棕色斑块和结节。\n\n（选项D）结节性红斑病变的活检通常显示伴多核巨细胞的间隔性脂膜炎。结节性红斑是一种迟发型超敏反应，可由药物或其他抗原刺激引起。患者通常表现为双侧胫骨上的压痛结节。\n\n（选项E）肛门生殖器疣的活检将显示乳头状表皮增生伴细胞质空泡变性。肛门生殖器疣是由特定血清型的人乳头瘤病毒（例如，HPV-6、HPV-11）引起的。肛门生殖器疣通常与弥漫性斑丘疹皮疹或全身症状无关。\n\n教育目标：\n梅毒病变的组织病理学检查典型地显示增生性动脉内膜炎伴周围浆细胞浸润。梅毒的大多数表现是由于动脉内膜炎引起的局部组织缺血。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of secondary syphilis presentation, including skin findings, lymphadenopathy, and characteristic histopathology. It also assesses understanding of co-infection with gonorrhea and limitations of early serologic testing. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical features suggestive of secondary syphilis (maculopapular rash, condylomata lata, lymphadenopathy). Recall the classic histopathologic finding of proliferative endarteritis with plasma cell infiltrate in syphilitic lesions.",
