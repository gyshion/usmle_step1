An ultrasound is performed, during which the fetus is found to have a congenital defect and no cardiac activity. Due to the pregnancy loss, the patient undergoes an induction of labor.

    "en": "The gross pathology of this fetus is consistent with anencephaly, an OPEN NEURAL TUBE DEFECT (NTD). Open NTDs are caused by a defect in PRIMARY NEURULATION. This process normally begins with formation of the neural plate, the lateral ends of which elevate to become neural folds during the third week of fetal development. These folds form the neural tube by fusing in the midline, starting in the cervical region and extending rostrally and caudally to the anterior and posterior neuropores, respectively. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nFailure of either neuropore to close results in an open NTD, and failure of anterior (rostral) neuropore closure specifically leads to anencephaly, a fatal condition in which the skull and meninges fail to form. The fetal brain is then exposed to amniotic fluid, resulting in degeneration of the developing forebrain, as seen here. Maternal serum alpha fetoprotein is markedly elevated due to direct leakage from the open neural tube into the amniotic fluid. Prenatal ultrasound shows ABSENCE OF THE BRAIN AND SKULL SUPERIOR TO THE ORBITS. {{exhibit_3}}\n\nMany fetuses with anencephaly die in utero; those born with anencephaly may retain spontaneous breathing and brainstem reflexes (eg, suck, Moro) but die soon after birth.\n\n(Choice A) Neural crest cells are the progenitors for the peripheral nervous system and several other cell types (eg, melanocytes). Disorders of neural crest cell migration (eg, Hirschsprung disease) involve the peripheral nervous system rather than the CNS. {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choice B) The notochord is a major regulator of embryonic patterning and disruption to its development may affect the CNS, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tract. CNS structures related to notochord development include the spinal cord and vertebral column; defects would not affect the scalp and skull. {{exhibit_5}}\n\n(Choice C) Failure of prosencephalon division leads to holoprosencephaly, in which the brain does not separate normally into 2 hemispheres. A spectrum of findings may be present, including hypotelorism, a single nostril or proboscis, and/or a single central incisor. {{exhibit_6}}\n\n(Choice E) Failure of vertebral column fusion describes spina bifida occulta. Gross visual inspection may be unremarkable or show a deep sacral pit, tuft of hair, or overlying hemangioma. {{exhibit_7}}",
    "zh": "该胎儿的肉眼病理表现与无脑畸形一致，这是一种开放性神经管缺陷(NTD)。开放性NTD是由原神经胚管形成缺陷引起的。这个过程通常始于神经板的形成，神经板的侧端在胎儿发育的第三周隆起成为神经褶。这些神经褶在中线融合形成神经管，从颈部开始，分别向头端和尾端延伸到前神经孔和后神经孔。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n任一神经孔闭合失败都会导致开放性NTD，而前（头端）神经孔闭合失败则特别会导致无脑畸形，这是一种致命疾病，其中颅骨和脑膜无法形成。然后胎儿大脑暴露于羊水中，导致正在发育的前脑退化，如这里所示。母体血清甲胎蛋白由于开放性神经管直接渗漏到羊水中而显着升高。产前超声显示眼眶上方无脑和颅骨。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n许多患有无脑畸形的胎儿在子宫内死亡；那些出生时患有无脑畸形的胎儿可能保留自发呼吸和脑干反射（例如，吸吮，莫罗反射），但在出生后不久就会死亡。\n\n(选项A) 神经嵴细胞是周围神经系统和其他几种细胞类型（例如，黑素细胞）的祖细胞。神经嵴细胞迁移障碍（例如，先天性巨结肠症）涉及周围神经系统而不是中枢神经系统。{{exhibit_4}}\n\n(选项B) 脊索是胚胎模式形成的主要调节因子，其发育受损可能会影响中枢神经系统、胃肠道或泌尿生殖道。与脊索发育相关的中枢神经系统结构包括脊髓和椎柱；缺陷不会影响头皮和颅骨。{{exhibit_5}}\n\n(选项C) 前脑分裂失败导致全前脑发育不全，在这种情况下，大脑无法正常分离成2个半球。可能存在一系列发现，包括眼距过近、单个鼻孔或吻突，和/或单个中切牙。{{exhibit_6}}\n\n(选项E) 椎柱融合失败描述了隐性脊柱裂。肉眼观察可能无明显异常，或显示深骶窝、一簇毛发或覆盖的血管瘤。{{exhibit_7}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of neural tube defects, specifically anencephaly, and the embryologic process of rostral neuropore closure. It requires recognizing the gross pathology of anencephaly and linking it to the failure of the anterior neuropore to close during fetal development. \n\nTo solve this question, identify the key finding of anencephaly (absence of brain and skull) and associate it with the embryologic process of rostral neuropore closure. Rule out other options by understanding the embryologic origins and associated defects of neural crest cells, notochord, prosencephalon, and vertebral column.",
