    "en": "A 51-year-old woman comes to the office for a follow-up visit. Three weeks ago, she had a screening mammogram that was suspicious for malignancy. An ultrasound-guided needle aspiration was performed and showed invasive ductal carcinoma. The patient underwent a lumpectomy with axillary dissection and was found to have no metastatic disease. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor specimen was significant for the following:\n\nEstrogen receptor Positive\nProgesterone receptor Positive\nHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 Positive",

    "en": "This patient has localized invasive ductal breast carcinoma that shows estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positivity. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the management of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. It binds to a portion of the extracellular domain of HER2 and prevents activation of a transmembrane tyrosine kinase. This downregulates cellular proliferation and promotes apoptosis. Approximately 20% of all invasive breast cancers overexpress HER2; this can also be found in other solid tumors (eg, stomach, lung, ovary).\n\n(Choices A and B) Hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (ER and/or PR overexpression) is treated with antiestrogen medications to reduce tumor cell proliferation. Premenopausal patients are typically treated with selective estrogen receptor modulators (eg, tamoxifen), while aromatase inhibitors (eg, anastrozole, letrozole) are used in postmenopausal women. However, these medications are not monoclonal antibodies.\n\n(Choice C) Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) activates osteoclasts: RANKL expression on bone may contribute to bone metastases by binding to RANK on tumor cells. Denosumab, a human monoclonal antibody against RANKL, is used to reduce skeletal-related events if metastasis to bone occurs.\n\n(Choice E) Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which also binds to a receptor tyrosine kinase, induces angiogenesis. VEGF inhibitors, such as the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, have a role in treatment of some metastatic cancers (eg, colon, lung).\n\nEducational objective:\nHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed in 20% of breast cancer patients. In such patients, HER2 blockade with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab downregulates cellular proliferation and promotes apoptosis.",
    "zh": "该患者患有局部浸润性导管乳腺癌，表现为雌激素受体 (ER)、孕激素受体 (PR) 和人表皮生长因子受体 2 (HER2) 阳性。曲妥珠单抗是一种单克隆抗体，用于治疗HER2阳性乳腺癌患者。它与HER2细胞外结构域的一部分结合，阻止跨膜酪氨酸激酶的激活。这会下调细胞增殖并促进细胞凋亡。大约20%的浸润性乳腺癌过度表达HER2；这也可以在其他实体瘤（例如，胃、肺、卵巢）中发现。\n\n（选项A和B）激素受体阳性乳腺癌（ER和/或PR过度表达）用抗雌激素药物治疗，以减少肿瘤细胞增殖。绝经前患者通常用选择性雌激素受体调节剂（例如，他莫昔芬）治疗，而芳香化酶抑制剂（例如，阿那曲唑、来曲唑）用于绝经后妇女。然而，这些药物不是单克隆抗体。\n\n（选项C）核因子κB配体（RANKL）受体激活剂激活破骨细胞：骨骼上RANKL的表达可能通过与肿瘤细胞上的RANK结合而促成骨转移。地舒单抗，一种针对RANKL的人单克隆抗体，用于减少骨转移发生的骨相关事件。\n\n（选项E）血管内皮生长因子 (VEGF)，也与受体酪氨酸激酶结合，诱导血管生成。VEGF抑制剂，如单克隆抗体贝伐珠单抗，在治疗一些转移性癌症（例如，结肠癌、肺癌）中发挥作用。\n\n教育目标：\n人表皮生长因子受体2 (HER2) 是一种受体酪氨酸激酶，在20%的乳腺癌患者中过度表达。在这些患者中，用单克隆抗体曲妥珠单抗阻断HER2会下调细胞增殖并促进细胞凋亡。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of targeted therapies in breast cancer, specifically the mechanism of action of trastuzumab in HER2-positive tumors.
