    "en": "A 23-year-old, previously healthy man was involved in a motor vehicle collision. He lost consciousness at the scene but recovered by the time emergency medical services arrived. The patient was alert and awake in the ambulance but lost consciousness again soon after arriving at the emergency department. His breath smells of alcohol. Blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, pulse is 68/min, and respirations are 12/min. A bruise is noted over the left temple area. The left pupil is mildly dilated. Brain imaging would most likely reveal blood accumulating between which of the following tissues?",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is C. The patient's presentation is classic for an EPIDURAL HEMATOMA. This type of intracranial hemorrhage is an accumulation of blood between the skull (bone) and the dura mater. It most commonly results from a fracture of the temporal bone, which tears the middle meningeal artery. The typical clinical course involves a brief loss of consciousness, followed by a lucid interval, and then a rapid deterioration with signs of increased intracranial pressure, such as pupillary changes and altered mental status. The patient's history of head trauma, initial loss of consciousness, recovery, and subsequent deterioration, along with a dilated pupil (ipsilateral to the injury), strongly suggests an epidural hematoma. Brain imaging, typically a noncontrast CT scan, would show a biconvex, lens-shaped hematoma between the bone and the dura mater. {{exhibit_1}} shows a table summarizing intracranial hemorrhages. The explanation for epidural hematoma states it is an accumulation of blood between the skull bone and dura mater, often due to a tear of the middle meningeal artery. It also notes the characteristic lucid interval and signs of elevated ICP. {{exhibit_2}} shows the correct answer C with 78% accuracy. {{exhibit_3}} provides further details on intracranial hemorrhages, specifically mentioning epidural hematoma as an accumulation of blood between the bone and dura mater, often due to fracture of the temporal bone and tear of the middle meningeal artery, and its characteristic transient loss of consciousness followed by a lucid period. {{exhibit_4}} reiterates that epidural hematoma is an accumulation of blood between the bone and dura mater, and that it typically occurs due to a tear of the middle meningeal artery associated with fracture of the pterion region of the skull. It also mentions the characteristic transient loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval. \n\n(Choice A) The epicranial aponeurosis (galea aponeurotica) and outer periosteum cover the exterior surface of the cranial bones. Intracranial hemorrhages are located inside the cranial vault, not between these layers.\n\n(Choice B) Blood accumulation between the arachnoid mater and pia mater constitutes a SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE. This is typically caused by ruptured aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations and presents with severe headache, nuchal rigidity, and often altered mental status, but not typically a lucid interval followed by rapid deterioration from a direct arterial tear.\n\n(Choice D) Subdural hematoma (SDH) is located between the dura mater and arachnoid mater. It usually results from tearing of the bridging cortical veins and typically presents in older patients or those with significant brain atrophy, often with a more gradual onset of symptoms or a history of significant trauma. While it can cause neurological deterioration, the classic lucid interval is less common than with epidural hematomas.\n\n(Choice E) The pia mater is closely adherent to the brain surface. Blood accumulating directly on the brain surface would be within the subarachnoid space or intraparenchymal.",
    "zh": "正确的答案是 C。该患者的临床表现是硬膜外血肿的典型表现。这种类型的颅内出血是血液积聚在颅骨（骨）和硬脑膜之间。它最常由颞骨骨折引起，导致脑膜中动脉撕裂。典型的病程包括短暂的意识丧失，随后是清醒间期，然后是快速恶化，并出现颅内压增高的迹象，如瞳孔变化和精神状态改变。患者的头部外伤病史、最初的意识丧失、恢复和随后的恶化，以及瞳孔扩张（与损伤同侧），强烈提示硬膜外血肿。脑部影像学检查，通常是非对比 CT 扫描，会显示骨骼和硬脑膜之间呈双凸、透镜状的血肿。{{exhibit_1}} 显示了一个总结颅内出血的表格。硬膜外血肿的解释指出，它是血液积聚在颅骨和硬脑膜之间，通常是由于脑膜中动脉撕裂所致。它还指出了特征性的清醒间期和 ICP 升高的迹象。{{exhibit_2}} 显示正确答案 C 的准确率为 78%。{{exhibit_3}} 提供了关于颅内出血的更多细节，特别是将硬膜外血肿描述为血液积聚在骨骼和硬脑膜之间，通常是由于颞骨骨折和脑膜中动脉撕裂所致，以及其特征性的短暂意识丧失，随后是清醒期。{{exhibit_4}} 重申硬膜外血肿是血液积聚在骨骼和硬脑膜之间，并且通常是由于脑膜中动脉撕裂所致，这与颅骨翼点区域的骨折有关。它还提到了特征性的短暂意识丧失，随后是清醒间期。\n\n（选项 A）颅上腱膜（帽状腱膜）和外骨膜覆盖颅骨的外表面。颅内出血位于颅腔内，而不是在这些层之间。\n\n（选项 B）蛛网膜和软脑膜之间的血液积聚构成蛛网膜下腔出血。这通常由动脉瘤破裂或动静脉畸形引起，表现为严重的头痛、颈项强直，并且通常伴有精神状态改变，但通常不会出现清醒间期，随后因直接的动脉撕裂而迅速恶化。\n\n（选项 D）硬膜下血肿（SDH）位于硬脑膜和蛛网膜之间。它通常是由于皮质桥静脉撕裂所致，通常出现在老年患者或脑萎缩严重的患者中，通常症状起病更缓慢或有严重的创伤史。虽然它会导致神经系统恶化，但经典的清醒间期不如硬膜外血肿常见。\n\n（选项 E）软脑膜与脑表面紧密相连。直接在脑表面积聚的血液将在蛛网膜下腔或脑实质内。"

It emphasizes the classic presentation of an epidural hematoma, including the lucid interval.\n\nTo solve this question, one must correlate the patient's clinical presentation (head trauma, loss of consciousness, lucid interval, subsequent deterioration, ipsilateral pupillary dilation) with the anatomical locations of intracranial hemorrhages. Recognizing the typical cause and location of an epidural hematoma is key to selecting the correct answer.",
