    "en": "A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, comes to the emergency department for evaluation of vaginal bleeding. The patient has had bright red spotting for the past 24 hours but no contractions or leakage of fluid. She is at 31 weeks gestation by last menstrual period and has not had prenatal care this pregnancy. Her first pregnancy ended in an uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery at term. Vital signs and fetal heart rate tracing are normal. Physical examination shows a non-tender uterus consistent in size with 31 weeks gestation. A pelvic ultrasound reveals a complete placenta previa. The findings are discussed with the patient, and she states that she would still like to have a vaginal delivery. The physician says, \"Unfortunately, the only safe option for delivery is a cesarean delivery.\" The physician's statement is an example of which of the following ethical principles?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Most medical decisions are made via shared decision-making, in which the patient's preferences and personal values are considered when discussing ≥ 2 medically reasonable treatment options (Choice D). However, when there is only 1 medically reasonable treatment option that has clearly superior evidence-based support, it is ethically appropriate for the physician to provide DIRECTIVE COUNSELING, in which only a single treatment option is recommended to a patient.\n\nThis patient has a COMPLETE PLACENTA PREVIA, a condition in which the entire placenta covers the cervix, which is associated with a HIGH RISK of maternal (eg, hemorrhage) and fetal (eg, intrauterine demise) morbidity and mortality with vaginal bleeding. Due to these risks, the only safe option for delivery, as stated by this patient, is cesarean delivery. Although this patient prefers a vaginal delivery, it is inappropriate for the physician to discuss this choice as a safe and reasonable option. It is the physician's ethical responsibility to advise against it and provide directive counseling by explaining why a cesarean delivery is medically necessary.\n\n(Choice A) Assisted decision-making occurs when a family member or other caregiver helps the patient in making a medical decision (but does not make the decision for the patient). Common scenarios include patients with intellectual disability or a potentially reversible impairment in decision-making capacity (eg, fluctuating mental illness [schizophrenia]).\n\n(Choice C) Informed refusal refers to the patient's refusal of a recommended medical treatment following informed consent (including full disclosure of the risks of refusing treatment). This would occur in this case if, after discussion of the need for cesarean delivery, the patient refuses the procedure.\n\n(Choice E) Substituted judgment occurs when a surrogate decision-maker makes a health care decision for an incapacitated patient based on the surrogate's knowledge of the patient's wishes and values.\n\nEducational objective:\nDirective counseling is ethically appropriate when only one treatment option is medically reasonable and has clearly superior evidence-based support. Patients with complete placenta previa should be counseled that cesarean delivery is medically necessary.",
    "zh": "大多数医疗决策是通过共同决策做出的，在这种决策中，在讨论≥2种医学上合理的治疗方案时，会考虑患者的偏好和个人价值观（选项D）。然而，当只有1种医学上合理的治疗方案具有明显优越的循证医学支持时，医生提供指导性咨询是符合伦理的，在这种咨询中，只向患者推荐单一的治疗方案。\n\n该患者患有完全性前置胎盘，这是一种整个胎盘覆盖子宫颈的疾病，与阴道出血导致孕产妇（如，出血）和胎儿（如，宫内死亡）发病率和死亡率的高风险相关。由于这些风险，正如该患者所说，分娩的唯一安全选择是剖腹产。虽然该患者更喜欢阴道分娩，但医生讨论这种选择作为安全和合理的方案是不合适的。医生的伦理责任是劝阻这种选择，并通过解释为什么剖腹产在医学上是必要的来提供指导性咨询。\n\n（选项A）协助决策发生在家庭成员或其他护理人员帮助患者做出医疗决定时（但不会为患者做出决定）。常见情况包括智力障碍或决策能力可能可逆性受损的患者（例如，精神疾病波动[精神分裂症]）。\n\n（选项C）知情拒绝是指患者在知情同意后拒绝推荐的医疗治疗（包括充分披露拒绝治疗的风险）。如果在此病例中，在讨论了剖腹产的必要性后，患者拒绝该手术，就会发生这种情况。\n\n（选项E）替代判断发生在替代决策者根据其对患者意愿和价值观的了解，为无行为能力的患者做出医疗保健决定时。\n\n教育目标：\n当只有一个治疗方案在医学上合理并具有明确的循证医学支持时，指导性咨询在伦理上是适当的。应告知完全性前置胎盘患者，剖腹产在医学上是必要的。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of ethical principles in medical decision-making, specifically differentiating between shared decision-making, directive counseling, and other related concepts in the context of a high-risk obstetric scenario.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the number of medically reasonable treatment options presented to the patient. If there is only one safe and recommended option, directive counseling is appropriate, as opposed to shared decision-making which involves multiple viable choices.",
