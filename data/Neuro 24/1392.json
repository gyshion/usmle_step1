    "en": "This patient has meningitis, likely caused by Listeria monocytogenes, given the CSF findings (elevated leukocytes with neutrophil predominance, elevated protein, low-normal glucose, and presence of bacteria) and the characteristic description of gram-positive rods with tumbling motility on microscopy. Listeria is an intracellular facultative bacterium that grows within macrophages and exhibits flagellar motility, which is typically seen at room temperature but not at human body temperatures. This unique characteristic allows it to be identified in CSF microscopy. \n\nListeria monocytogenes is most commonly acquired through the ingestion of CONTAMINATED FOOD. It can multiply in cold temperatures, allowing it to thrive in refrigerated foods such as unpasteurized milk and dairy products, deli meats, and raw vegetables. In immunocompromised individuals, such as this patient who has undergone a kidney transplant and is likely taking immunosuppressants, Listeria can cause bacteremia and spread to the central nervous system, leading to meningitis or meningoencephalitis. Ampicillin is the antibiotic of choice for treating Listeria infections.\n\n(Choice A) Arthropod bites transmit diseases like leishmaniasis (sandfly bite), malaria (Anopheles mosquito bite), and Lyme disease (Ixodes tick bite). None of these are caused by gram-positive rods with tumbling motility.\n\n(Choice C) Needlesticks can transmit HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, among other infections. These are not caused by Listeria.\n\n(Choice D) Respiratory droplets are the primary mode of transmission for common bacterial meningitis pathogens such as Neisseria meningitidis (gram-negative diplococcus), Haemophilus influenzae (gram-negative coccobacillus), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (gram-positive diplococcus). Listeria is not transmitted via respiratory droplets.\n\n(Choice E) Unprotected sex is a mode of transmission for sexually transmitted infections like HIV, hepatitis B, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis. Listeria is not transmitted sexually.\n\nKey clinical pearls:\n- LYSTERIA MONOCYTOGENES is a gram-positive rod with TUMBLING MOTILITY.\n- It is a common cause of MENINGITIS in IMMUNOCOMPROMISED individuals, especially those with transplant or hematologic malignancy.\n- Transmission is typically via INGESTION OF CONTAMINATED FOOD, particularly dairy products and deli meats.\n- It can GROW IN COLD TEMPERATURES.\n- AMPICILLIN is the treatment of choice.",
    "zh": "该患者患有脑膜炎，可能由单核细胞增生李斯特菌引起，这基于CSF结果（白细胞升高并以中性粒细胞为主，蛋白质升高，葡萄糖低正常，以及细菌存在）以及革兰氏阳性杆菌在显微镜下呈翻滚运动的特征性描述。李斯特菌是一种细胞内兼性细菌，在巨噬细胞内生长并表现出鞭毛运动，这通常在室温下可见，但在人体体温下不可见。这种独特的特征使其可以在CSF显微镜下被识别。\n\n单核细胞增生李斯特菌最常见的是通过摄入受污染的食物而获得。它可以在低温下繁殖，使其能够在冷藏食品中生存，如未经巴氏消毒的牛奶和乳制品、熟食肉和生蔬菜。在免疫功能低下的人群中，例如接受过肾移植并可能服用免疫抑制剂的患者，李斯特菌可引起菌血症并扩散到中枢神经系统，导致脑膜炎或脑膜脑炎。氨苄西林是治疗李斯特菌感染的首选抗生素。\n\n(选项 A) 节肢动物叮咬传播疾病，如利什曼病（白蛉叮咬）、疟疾（按蚊叮咬）和莱姆病（硬蜱叮咬）。这些疾病都不是由呈翻滚运动的革兰氏阳性杆菌引起的。\n\n(选项 C) 针刺伤可传播HIV、乙型肝炎和丙型肝炎等感染。这些疾病不是由李斯特菌引起的。\n\n(选项 D) 呼吸道飞沫是常见细菌性脑膜炎病原体的主要传播途径，如脑膜炎奈瑟菌（革兰氏阴性双球菌）、流感嗜血杆菌（革兰氏阴性杆菌）和肺炎链球菌（革兰氏阳性双球菌）。李斯特菌不通过呼吸道飞沫传播。\n\n(选项 E) 无保护性行为是性传播感染（如HIV、乙型肝炎、淋病、衣原体病和梅毒）的传播方式。李斯特菌不通过性传播。\n\n关键临床要点：\n- 单核细胞增生李斯特菌是一种呈翻滚运动的革兰氏阳性杆菌。\n- 它是免疫功能低下个体脑膜炎的常见原因，尤其是那些接受移植或患有血液系统恶性肿瘤的个体。\n- 传播通常通过摄入受污染的食物，特别是乳制品和熟食肉。\n- 它可以在低温下生长。\n- 氨苄西林是首选治疗方法。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation, causative organism, and transmission routes of Listeria monocytogenes meningitis, particularly in immunocompromised patients. It requires correlating CSF findings and microscopic characteristics with the likely source of infection.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the causative organism based on the description (gram-positive rods with tumbling motility) and the patient's immunocompromised state.
