    "en": "A 54-year-old man comes to the office due to several months of heartburn, acid regurgitation, and dysphagia. He has taken antacids and over-the-counter medications without relief. Medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. BMI is 32 kg/m². Physical examination is unremarkable. Upright chest x-ray shows an opacity with an air-fluid level behind the heart. A subsequent barium swallow reveals the proximal stomach herniating through the esophageal hiatus. Which of the following pathophysiological changes most likely contributed to this patient's current condition?",

    "en": "This patient has a hiatal hernia, a common disorder in which the contents of the abdominal cavity herniate through the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity at the esophageal hiatus. The distal esophagus is normally attached circumferentially to the diaphragm by the phrenoesophageal membrane at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction; disruptions in membrane integrity can result in hernia formation:\n\nSliding hiatal hernias are the most common form and occur due to laxity of the phrenoesophageal membrane, which typically results from repetitive stress on the membrane (eg, coughing, vomiting). This allows the GE junction and proximal stomach to slide upward into the thoracic cavity and predisposes patients to reflux symptoms (eg, heartburn, regurgitation, epigastric/chest pain) due to incompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter.\n\nParaesophageal hernias are rarer and occur due to a defect (hole) in the phrenoesophageal membrane. Laxity of the gastrocolic and gastrosplenic ligaments (which anchor the stomach in the abdomen) allows the gastric fundus to migrate into the thoracic cavity. Larger defects can also result in the subsequent herniation of the GE junction and surrounding structures (eg, bowel, spleen) into the chest. This predisposes patients to gastric volvulus, ulcerations, and respiratory complications (due to lung compression).\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n(Choice A) Barrett esophagus is the metaplastic replacement of normal squamous cells in the distal esophagus with squamocolumnar cells and occurs as a result of chronic acid reflux. Patients with Barrett esophagus are at increased risk of esophageal cancer, but it does not cause herniation.\n\n(Choice C) Diaphragmatic muscle paralysis due to C3-5 motor nerve injury causes an elevated hemidiaphragm. Patients are typically asymptomatic (due to compensation by the other respiratory muscles), but dyspnea or orthopnea can occur. It is not associated with herniation of intraabdominal contents into the chest.\n\n(Choice D) Failure of the posterolateral diaphragmatic foramina to fuse can cause a Bochdalek hernia. This congenital hernia is typically diagnosed pre- or perinatally; pulmonary hypoplasia with neonatal respiratory distress is common.\n\n(Choice E) Herniation of the viscera through the omental foramen (foramen of Winslow) causes an intraabdominal hernia known as lesser sac hernia. Lesser sac hernias are very rare, typically involve the small bowel, and cause severe abdominal pain due to bowel strangulation or obstruction.\n\nEducational objective:\nHiatal hernias occur when contents of the abdominal cavity herniate through the diaphragm at the esophageal hiatus into the thoracic cavity. Sliding hiatal hernias occur due to laxity of the phrenoesophageal membrane, leading to herniation of the gastroesophageal junction and proximal stomach, whereas paraesophageal hernias occur due to defects in the membrane, resulting in the gastric fundus herniation.",
    "zh": "该患者患有食管裂孔疝，这是一种常见疾病，腹腔内容物通过膈肌疝入食管裂孔进入胸腔。远端食管通常通过膈食管膜在胃食管（GE）结合部周围附着于膈肌；膜的完整性受损可导致疝的形成：\n\n滑动型食管裂孔疝是最常见的类型，由于膈食管膜松弛而发生，这通常是由于膜受到反复应力（如咳嗽、呕吐）所致。这使得GE结合部和胃近端向上滑动到胸腔中，并使患者易于出现反流症状（例如，烧心、反流、上腹部/胸部疼痛），这是由于食管下括约肌功能不全所致。\n\n食管旁疝较为罕见，是由于膈食管膜存在缺陷（孔洞）而发生的。胃结肠韧带和胃脾韧带（将胃固定在腹部）松弛，使胃底向胸腔内迁移。较大的缺陷还可能导致GE结合部和周围结构（例如，肠、脾）随后疝入胸腔。这使患者易于出现胃扭转、溃疡和呼吸系统并发症（由于肺受压）。\n\n{{exhibit_1}}\n（选项A）巴雷特食管是远端食管正常鳞状细胞被鳞柱状细胞替代的化生，是慢性胃酸反流的结果。巴雷特食管患者发生食管癌的风险增加，但它不会引起疝。 \n\n（选项C）由于C3-5运动神经损伤引起的膈肌麻痹会导致半膈肌升高。患者通常无症状（由于其他呼吸肌的代偿），但可能会出现呼吸困难或端坐呼吸。它与腹腔内容物疝入胸腔无关。\n\n（选项D）后外侧膈孔融合失败可导致Bochdalek疝。这种先天性疝通常在出生前或围产期被诊断出来；肺发育不全伴新生儿呼吸窘迫很常见。\n\n（选项E）脏器通过网膜孔（Winslow孔）疝出导致腹腔内疝，称为小囊疝。小囊疝非常罕见，通常涉及小肠，并由于肠绞窄或梗阻引起剧烈腹痛。\n\n教学目标：\n当腹腔内容物通过膈肌在食管裂孔疝入胸腔时，发生食管裂孔疝。滑动型食管裂孔疝是由于膈食管膜松弛而发生，导致胃食管结合部和胃近端疝出，而食管旁疝是由于膈食管膜存在缺陷而发生，导致胃底疝出。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of hiatal hernias, specifically the role of the phrenoesophageal membrane in maintaining the gastroesophageal junction and preventing herniation. It also requires differentiating between sliding and paraesophageal hernias.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the patient's symptoms and barium swallow findings as indicative of a hiatal hernia. Understanding that laxity of the phrenoesophageal membrane is the primary mechanism behind sliding hiatal hernias leads to the correct answer.",
