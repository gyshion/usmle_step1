    "en": "2.  7-year-old woman in her 2nd trimester of pregnancy comes to the office due to constipation. Her stools have become increasingly hard and pellet-like over the past few weeks; bowel movements before then were always regular. She also has mild crampy abdominal pain and bloating, both of which improve after defecation. Medical history and family history are both unremarkable. This is the patient's first pregnancy and has so far been uncomplicated. On physical examination, the abdomen appears gravid but nontender.",
    "zh": "一位怀孕 7 个月的女性（孕中期）因便秘前来就诊。在过去的几周里，她的粪便变得越来越硬，呈颗粒状；而在此之前，她的排便一直很规律。她还伴有轻微的痉挛性腹痛和腹胀，这两种症状在排便后均有所缓解。病史和家族史均无特殊。这是该患者的首次怀孕，迄今为止一直未出现并发症。体格检查显示，腹部隆起但无压痛。"

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Pregnancy has multiple effects in the gastrointestinal tract due to increasing levels of progesterone and estrogen as well as the effects of a gravid uterus on surrounding structures. CONSTIPATION is particularly common in pregnant patients and is largely due to the effects of progesterone, which has been shown to reduce colonic smooth muscle activity. Progesterone also prevents the release of motilin, a hormone responsible for stimulating the fasting migrating myoelectric complex, which normally helps propel undigested food from the small intestines into the colon. Constipation may be exacerbated in later stages of pregnancy as the gravid uterus increases pressure on the small intestine, slowing intestinal transit.\n\nOther common gastrointestinal alterations in pregnancy include reduced lower esophageal sphincter pressure (promoting gastroesophageal reflux) and gallbladder stasis (increasing the likelihood of developing gallstones). Hemorrhoids are also common and result from a rise in pressure within the rectal venous system due to the gravid uterus.\n\n(Choice B) The parasympathetic nervous system stimulates peristalsis and gastrointestinal motility. Reduced parasympathetic input to the colon can lead to constipation; however, this typically occurs with neurologic disorders (eg, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis).\n\n(Choice C) Defecatory dysfunction results from an inability to relax pelvic floor muscles, which prevents proper evacuation of stool from the rectal vault. Although this can occur after trauma (eg, traumatic vaginal delivery), it is not a physiologic change that occurs during pregnancy.\n\n(Choice D) Thickened intestinal secretions can cause constipation; however, this is typically seen in patients with cystic fibrosis, which affects water and electrolyte transportation. Patients with cystic fibrosis are typically diagnosed in infancy and have recurrent respiratory infections and failure to thrive.\n\n(Choice E) Rectoceles occur when the rectum herniates into the vaginal canal through a thinned rectovaginal septum. Although they also cause constipation, rectoceles typically occur in elderly individuals with a history of multiple vaginal deliveries, not during pregnancy. Patients often report needing to manually compress the vagina to induce bowel movements.",
    "zh": "由于孕酮和雌激素水平升高以及妊娠子宫对周围结构的影响，妊娠对胃肠道有多种影响。 便秘在孕妇中特别常见，这主要归因于孕酮的作用，孕酮已被证明可以降低结肠平滑肌的活动。孕酮还会阻止生长素的释放，这是一种负责刺激禁食迁移肌电复合体的激素，该复合体通常有助于将未消化的食物从​​小肠推进到结肠。 随着妊娠子宫增加对小肠的压力，减缓肠道转运，便秘可能会在妊娠后期加剧。\n\n妊娠中常见的其他胃肠道改变包括食管下括约肌压力降低（促进胃食管反流）和胆囊淤滞（增加发生胆结石的可能性）。痔疮也很常见，是由于妊娠子宫导致直肠静脉系统内的压力升高而引起的。\n\n（选项 B）副交感神经系统刺激蠕动和胃肠道蠕动。 结肠的副交感神经输入减少可导致便秘；然而，这通常发生在神经系统疾病（例如，脊髓损伤、多发性硬化症）中。\n\n（选项 C）排便功能障碍是由于无法放松盆底肌肉，从而阻止粪便从直肠腔中正确排出。 虽然这可能发生在创伤后（例如，产伤性阴道分娩），但这不是妊娠期间发生的生理变化。\n\n（选项 D）肠道分泌物增稠可引起便秘；然而，这通常见于患有囊性纤维化的患者，其影响水和电解质的转运。囊性纤维化患者通常在婴儿期被诊断出来，并反复发生呼吸道感染和生长迟缓。\n\n（选项 E）直肠膨出是指直肠通过变薄的直肠阴道隔疝入阴道。 虽然它们也会引起便秘，但直肠膨出通常发生在有多产史的老年人身上，而不是在怀孕期间。 患者经常报告需要手动按压阴道以诱导排便。"
