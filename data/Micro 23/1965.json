    "en": "A 34-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to recurrent fever, chills, and excessive sweating. The symptoms began a few days ago and seem to recur every 48 hours. The patient recently returned from a trip to Latin America. Temperature is 38.6 C (101.5 F). Physical examination is otherwise normal. Laboratory studies are notable for anemia and thrombocytopenia. A blood smear with Giemsa staining demonstrates red blood cell inclusions. Chloroquine and primaquine are prescribed. The addition of primaquine to the treatment regimen is most likely to have which of the following effects?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's fever paroxysms, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and erythrocyte inclusions seen with Giemsa staining after travel to Latin America are indicative of malaria, a mosquito-borne parasitic infection caused by 4 major Plasmodium species. Infections in sub-Saharan Africa are primarily due to Plasmodium falciparum, whereas infections in South and Central America are largely caused by Plasmodium vivax. Both species are endemic to India, East Asia, and the western Pacific nations.\n\nThe life cycle of malaria is relatively preserved across the 4 Plasmodium species. A bite by a female Anopheles mosquito transmits sporozoites into the host bloodstream; sporozoites then spread to the liver, infect hepatocytes, and replicate. Lysis of infected hepatocytes releases merozoites into the bloodstream, which rapidly invade circulating erythrocytes. P falciparum infects erythrocytes of all ages, leading to a very high degree of parasitemia; in contrast, P vivax and Plasmodium ovale prefer younger, larger erythrocytes.\n\nFollowing erythrocyte invasion, the merozoites feed on hemoglobin and mature from ring forms → trophozoites → schizonts. Schizont maturation occurs synchronously within erythrocytes, resulting in simultaneous cell lysis and release of proinflammatory substances, which causes paroxysms of fever.\n\nUnlike other species, P vivax and P ovale form hypnozoites in the liver that are dormant and reactivate weeks or months later. Therefore, these species must be treated with a medication that targets the intraerythrocytic phase (eg, chloroquine) as well as the dormant hepatic phase (eg, primaquine) to ensure eradication and prevent relapse.\n\n(Choice A) Retinopathy is the most serious long-term adverse effect related to chloroquine. However, it occurs rarely and is related to prolonged use. Primaquine does not alter chloroquine adverse effects.\n\n(Choices B and E) Primaquine has limited therapeutic activity against the intraerythrocytic forms of malaria (eg, trophozoites); it targets the intrahepatic stage of infection (eg, hypnozoites). Primaquine monotherapy is not effective for chloroquine-resistant strains; these strains are usually treated with artemisinin-based combination therapy to halt the erythrocytic asexual reproduction cycle.\n\n(Choice D) No antimalarial agent prevents hemolysis. Primaquine is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency due to increased rates of hemolysis.\n\nEducational objective:\nChloroquine is the treatment of choice for uncomplicated malaria in a chloroquine-sensitive geographic region. It eliminates susceptible erythrocytic forms of all Plasmodium species. Primaquine is added for Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale infections to eradicate the intrahepatic stages (hypnozoites) of these malarial species, which are responsible for relapses.",
    "zh": "该患者在前往拉丁美洲旅行后出现的发热阵发、贫血、血小板减少以及吉姆萨染色可见的红细胞内包涵体，提示患有疟疾，这是一种由蚊子传播的寄生虫感染，由4种主要的疟原虫引起。撒哈拉以南非洲的感染主要由恶性疟原虫引起，而南美洲和中美洲的感染主要由间日疟原虫引起。这两种疟原虫均在印度、东亚和西太平洋国家流行。\n\n疟疾的生命周期在4种疟原虫中相对保守。雌性按蚊叮咬将子孢子传播到宿主血流中；然后子孢子扩散到肝脏，感染肝细胞并复制。受感染肝细胞的裂解将裂殖子释放到血流中，裂殖子迅速侵入循环红细胞。恶性疟原虫感染所有年龄的红细胞，导致高度寄生虫血症；相比之下，间日疟原虫和卵形疟原虫更喜欢年轻、较大的红细胞。\n\n在红细胞侵入后，裂殖子以血红蛋白为食，并从环形体→滋养体→裂殖体成熟。裂殖体的成熟在红细胞内同步发生，导致细胞同时裂解并释放促炎物质，从而引起发热阵发。\n\n与其他物种不同，间日疟原虫和卵形疟原虫在肝脏中形成休眠的潜伏子，并在几周或几个月后重新激活。因此，必须使用靶向红细胞内阶段（例如，氯喹）以及休眠肝脏阶段（例如，伯氨喹）的药物来治疗这些物种，以确保根除和预防复发。\n\n(选项 A) 视网膜病变是与氯喹相关的最严重的长期不良反应。但是，它很少发生，并且与长期使用有关。伯氨喹不会改变氯喹的副作用。\n\n(选项 B 和 E) 伯氨喹对疟疾的红细胞内形式（例如，滋养体）的治疗活性有限；它靶向感染的肝内阶段（例如，潜伏子）。伯氨喹单药治疗对氯喹耐药菌株无效；这些菌株通常使用基于青蒿素的联合治疗方案来阻止红细胞无性生殖周期。\n\n(选项 D) 没有抗疟药能预防溶血。伯氨喹禁用于葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶缺乏症患者，因为溶血发生率增加。\n\n教育目标：\n氯喹是氯喹敏感地理区域中非复杂性疟疾的首选治疗方法。它能消除所有疟原虫的易感红细胞形式。伯氨喹用于间日疟原虫和卵形疟原虫感染，以根除这些疟疾物种的肝内阶段（潜伏子），这些阶段是导致复发的原因。"
