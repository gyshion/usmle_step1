    "en": "A 24-year-old man comes to the office for treatment of opioid use disorder. The patient has a 6-year history of heroin use, which he says has cost him most of his savings. His boss has spoken to him about his erratic moods and inconsistent work performance, and he is now in danger of losing his job. The patient asks for help, saying, \"I have tried so hard to do this on my own. My parents have spent a lot of money on counseling. It helps for a while, but then I go back to using. They are fed up and refuse to see me anymore. I don't want to use, but the craving is so strong.\" The physician refers the patient to an opioid treatment program where he is started on maintenance therapy with methadone. During the next follow-up appointment, he reports a marked reduction in his cravings. Which of the following properties of the administered drug is most likely responsible for the improvement in this patient's condition?",
    "zh": "一名24岁男性前来就诊，寻求阿片类药物使用障碍的治疗。患者有6年海洛因使用史，他说这让他花光了大部分积蓄。他的老板向他谈及了他反复无常的情绪和不稳定的工作表现，他现在面临失业的危险。患者寻求帮助，说：“我曾试图独自解决这个问题。我的父母花了很多钱在咨询上。这在一段时间内有所帮助，但之后我又开始使用。他们已经受够了，拒绝再见我。我不想使用，但渴望太强烈了。”医生将患者转诊至阿片类药物治疗项目，在那里他开始接受美沙酮维持治疗。在下一次复诊时，他报告说他对药物的渴望明显减少。以下哪种所用药物的特性最有可能导致了该患者病情的改善？"

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Methadone is a full mu-opioid receptor agonist used for withdrawal and maintenance treatment for opioid use disorder. It has a long half-life, which allows it to effectively suppress cravings and withdrawal symptoms; it also blocks the euphoric effects of other opioids by maintaining high tolerance levels (Choice B). Adverse effects of methadone include QT interval prolongation and respiratory depression, accounting for its lethality in overdose. (Choices C and E) Methadone, like other opioids, produces dependence, and abrupt discontinuation of methadone causes withdrawal symptoms. The symptoms of methadone withdrawal are more prolonged and less severe than those of heroin due to methadone's long half-life but are still present. (Choice D) Methadone can cause respiratory depression with the potential for lethality in overdose, especially when combined with other CNS depressants. (Choice F) Buprenorphine is a partial agonist used alone or with naloxone (an opioid antagonist) for treatment of opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine is less likely to cause respiratory depression and mortality in overdose compared with methadone.",
    "zh": "美沙酮是一种完全的μ-阿片受体激动剂，用于阿片类药物使用障碍的戒断和维持治疗。它具有长半衰期，这使其能够有效地抑制对药物的渴望和戒断症状；它还通过维持高耐受水平来阻断其他阿片类药物的欣快作用（选项B）。美沙酮的不良反应包括QT间期延长和呼吸抑制，这是其在过量用药中致命的原因。（选项C和E）美沙酮，与其他阿片类药物一样，会产生依赖性，突然停用美沙酮会导致戒断症状。由于美沙酮的半衰期长，美沙酮戒断症状比海洛因戒断症状更长，但程度较轻，但仍然存在。（选项D）美沙酮可引起呼吸抑制，过量用药时具有潜在的致死性，特别是与其它中枢神经系统抑制剂合用时。（选项F）丁丙诺啡是一种部分激动剂，单独使用或与纳洛酮（阿片类药物拮抗剂）联用，用于治疗阿片类药物使用障碍。与美沙酮相比，丁丙诺啡不太可能导致呼吸抑制和过量用药死亡。"
