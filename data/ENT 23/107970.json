    "en": "A 56-year-old man comes to the office due to feeling \"dizzy\" over the past 2 weeks. He works in a warehouse and says he experiences a brief, severe spinning sensation when looking up at objects on a high shelf. Vital signs are normal. Examination shows normal hearing. Ocular movements in a sitting position are normal, but when the patient's head is rotated to the right side off the examination table, he develops vertigo and rotatory nystagmus. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient has vertigo, often described as a spinning (as in this patient), whirling, or tilting sensation that can be due to an underlying disease in either the peripheral or central nervous system. This patient's brief (<1min), episodic vertigo triggered by head position changes (eg, sitting up from bed, looking around a kitchen) is consistent with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the most common cause of vertigo.\n\nRotational head movement is sensed by the semicircular canals, which are filled with endolymphatic fluid. The relative movement of this fluid stimulates hair cells that generate electrical impulses which are transmitted to the brain. BPPV is most often attributed to canalithiasis, or the presence of crystalline debris (canaliths) in the semicircular canals. These canaliths disrupt the normal flow of fluid in the semicircular canals, leading to contradictory signaling from the corresponding canals. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nDiagnosis is based on clinical features. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver can help diagnose BPPV: vertigo and nystagmus are triggered as the patient quickly lies back into a supine position with the head rotated 45 degrees. No further workup is needed in patients with classic presentations. Treatment with canalith repositioning maneuvers (eg, Epley) is typically effective.\n\n(Choices A and E) Carotid baroreceptor dysfunction can lead to wide fluctuations in blood pressure. Hypoperfusion due to this or other causes (eg, arterial stenosis) can lead to lightheadedness, which is frequently interpreted by patients as dizziness. However, this patient's positive Dix-Hallpike and spinning sensation (vs lightheadedness) are more consistent with BPPV.\n\n(Choice B) Elevated endolymphatic pressure in the semicircular canals is thought to underly the development of Ménière disease. In contrast to this patient's presentation, Ménière disease classically presents with episodic vertigo lasting 20 minutes to 24 hours and is associated with unilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness.\n\n(Choice C) Infected fluid in the middle ear (ie, acute otitis media) can lead to elevated hydrostatic pressure in the middle ear, causing a bulging tympanic membrane and sometimes leading to tympanic membrane rupture. However, acute otitis media presents with pain, fevers, and hearing loss, features absent in this patient.\n\nEducational objective:\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo causes brief (<1 min) episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position. Triggering an episode by using provocative head positioning maneuvers (eg, Dix-Hallpike) is diagnostic.",
    "zh": "该患者患有眩晕，通常被描述为旋转（如该患者）、打旋或倾斜感，这可能由于周围神经系统或中枢神经系统的潜在疾病引起。该患者短暂（<1分钟）、阵发性眩晕，由头部位置改变（例如，从床上坐起、环顾厨房）触发，与良性阵发性位置性眩晕（BPPV）一致，BPPV是眩晕最常见的原因。\n\n旋转头部运动由半规管感知，半规管充满内淋巴液。这种液体的相对运动刺激毛细胞，产生传导到大脑的电脉冲。BPPV最常归因于管石症，即半规管中存在晶体碎屑（管石）。这些管石会干扰半规管中液体的正常流动，导致来自相应管的矛盾信号。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n诊断基于临床特征。Dix-Hallpike 检查可帮助诊断 BPPV：当患者快速仰卧，头部旋转 45 度时，会触发眩晕和眼震。对于典型表现的患者，无需进一步检查。使用管石复位手法（例如，Epley）的治疗通常有效。\n\n（选项 A 和 E）颈动脉压力感受器功能障碍可导致血压大幅波动。由此或其他原因（例如，动脉狭窄）引起的低灌注可导致头昏眼花，患者经常将其解释为头晕。然而，该患者的 Dix-Hallpike 试验阳性和旋转感（而非头昏眼花）与 BPPV 更为一致。\n\n（选项 B）半规管内淋巴压力升高被认为是美尼尔病发展的基础。与该患者的表现相反，美尼尔病通常表现为阵发性眩晕，持续 20 分钟至 24 小时，并伴有单侧听力损失、耳鸣和耳胀。\n\n（选项 C）中耳感染性液体（即，急性中耳炎）可导致中耳静水压力升高，引起鼓膜膨胀，有时会导致鼓膜破裂。然而，急性中耳炎表现为疼痛、发热和听力损失，这些特征在该患者中不存在。\n\n教育目标：\n良性阵发性位置性眩晕会导致短暂（<1 分钟）的眩晕发作，由头部位置的变化触发。通过使用激发性头部定位手法（例如，Dix-Hallpike 检查）触发发作具有诊断意义。"
