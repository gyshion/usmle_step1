    "en": "A 34-year-old man comes to the office due to upper abdominal pain. The patient has vague discomfort that happens mostly in the afternoon and at night and is partially relieved by food. He sometimes feels nauseated. He has had no vomiting, black or bloody stools, or weight loss. The patient takes no prescription or over-the-counter medications. Family history is negative for cancer. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals a small ulcer with a clean base in the duodenal bulb. Biopsy of which of the following sites is most likely to demonstrate the infectious agent responsible for this patient's current condition?",

    "en": "Helicobacter pylori & duodenal ulcers\n\nPeptic (eg, duodenal, gastric, gastroesophageal) ulcers are most commonly due to Helicobacter pylori infection or use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Because this patient takes no medications, his ulcer is likely due to H pylori infection. The site of ulcer formation is dependent on relative bacterial colonization density within the stomach. H pylori preferentially colonizes the gastric antrum, particularly early in the disease, although it may occur in other areas of the stomach or spread with time.\n\nColonization of H pylori in the gastric antrum is associated with decreased somatostatin formation and increased gastrin secretion, which stimulate the parietal cells to produce excess acid. This results in an increased acid load emptying into the proximal duodenum, leading to duodenal ulcer (DU) formation. Biopsy of the antrum can confirm H pylori infection in patients with a DU, which characteristically presents with upper abdominal pain that improves with eating. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nIn contrast, gastric ulcers (GUs) are associated with colonization in the gastric corpus (body). The etiology of GUs is not acid related, as these patients typically have normal or reduced acid levels, but is thought to be due to direct mucosal damage and chronic inflammation. Unlike DU pain, GU pain often worsens with eating.\n\n(Choices B and C) Patients with DUs who are infected with H pylori may test positive for the organism at multiple locations within the stomach. However, colonization density is highest within the antrum, not the gastric body or the gastric fundus; therefore, the antrum is the optimal site for biopsy.\n\n(Choices D and E) Although the ulcer occurs in the duodenum, high concentrations of H pylori are not typically found in the duodenal regions, as H pylori can colonize only gastric tissue or areas of gastric metaplasia. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nEducational objective:\nHellicobacter pylori is a common cause of peptic ulcers. Duodenal ulcers are associated with heavy colonization in the gastric antrum, whereas colonization in the gastric corpus is associated with gastric ulcers.",
    "zh": "幽门螺杆菌和十二指肠溃疡\n\n消化性（例如，十二指肠、胃、胃食管）溃疡最常见的原因是幽门螺杆菌感染或使用非甾体抗炎药。由于该患者未服用任何药物，他的溃疡很可能是由于幽门螺杆菌感染引起的。溃疡形成的部位取决于胃内相对的细菌定植密度。幽门螺杆菌优先定植在胃窦，尤其是在疾病早期，尽管它可能发生在胃的其他区域或随着时间的推移而扩散。\n\n幽门螺杆菌在胃窦的定植与生长抑素形成减少和胃泌素分泌增加有关，这刺激壁细胞产生过量的酸。这导致增加的酸负荷排入近端十二指肠，导致十二指肠溃疡（DU）形成。对胃窦进行活检可以确认 DU 患者的幽门螺杆菌感染，其特征是上腹部疼痛，进食后可缓解。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n相比之下，胃溃疡（GUs）与胃体（体部）的定植有关。GUs 的病因与酸无关，因为这些患者通常具有正常或降低的酸水平，但被认为是由直接的粘膜损伤和慢性炎症引起的。与 DU 疼痛不同，GU 疼痛通常因进食而加重。\n\n（选项 B 和 C）患有 DU 并感染幽门螺杆菌的患者，在胃内的多个部位可能检测出该生物体的阳性结果。然而，定植密度在胃窦中最高，而不是在胃体或胃底；因此，胃窦是活检的最佳部位。\n\n（选项 D 和 E）尽管溃疡发生在十二指肠中，但幽门螺杆菌的高浓度通常不在十二指肠区域中发现，因为幽门螺杆菌只能定植胃组织或胃化生的区域。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n教育目标：\n幽门螺杆菌是消化性溃疡的常见原因。十二指肠溃疡与胃窦的严重定植有关，而胃体的定植与胃溃疡有关。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Helicobacter pylori infection and its association with duodenal ulcers, specifically focusing on the preferred site of colonization within the stomach. It also tests the understanding of why biopsy location matters for accurate diagnosis.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that H. pylori preferentially colonizes the gastric antrum in patients with duodenal ulcers. Therefore, a biopsy of the antrum is most likely to reveal the infectious agent.",
