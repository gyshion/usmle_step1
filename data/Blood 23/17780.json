    "en": "A 40-year-old woman, gravida 4 para 4, comes to the clinic due to anemia. A week ago, the patient was seen in the emergency department due to fatigue, shortness of breath, and increasingly heavy, irregular menses. Laboratory evaluation showed a hemoglobin level of 5.4 g/dL. After a transfusion with packed red blood cells, her follow-up hemoglobin level was 7.8 g/dL prior to discharge. Since then, the patient's energy and breathing have improved, and she has had no further menstrual bleeding. However, yellowing of the eyes and face has developed over the last day. Vital signs are normal. Examination reveals scleral icterus. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory results are as follows:\n\nComplete blood count\n\nHemoglobin 5.9 g/dL\nReticulocytes 7%\n\nLiver function study\n\nTotal bilirubin 3.8 mg/dL",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has jaundice and hemolytic anemia a week after a transfusion, findings suggestive of a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR). This reaction occurs in patients who were previously exposed to a foreign, minor red blood cell (RBC) antigen (non-ABO) via mechanisms such as pregnancy, prior transfusion, or intravenous drug use. During the first exposure, only a low, typically undetectable, antibody response is initially mounted. On reexposure via transfusion, the patient's memory B cells produced a larger surge of antibodies, resulting in detectable hemolysis. This is known as an ANAMNESTIC RESPONSE.\n\nDHTR is usually mild and develops >24 hours after transfusion, most commonly after 1-2 weeks. Most patients are asymptomatic and diagnosed only after findings of a newly positive direct antibody (+ Coombs) test and antibody screen. Additional laboratory findings include anemia with compensatory reticulocytosis and evidence of hemolysis (eg, ↑ indirect bilirubin, ↑ lactate dehydrogenase).\n\n(Choices A and B) Mild hemolysis can result from the transfusion of plasma products (eg, fresh frozen plasma, platelets), which can contain donor antibodies that target ABO or minor antigens on recipient RBCs. This reaction does not typically occur with the transfusion of packed RBCs, which this patient received, because RBCs are removed from the plasma layer and washed during the blood-separation process.\n\n(Choice C) An acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is caused by ABO incompatibility (eg, due to clerical error). Patients naturally have preformed antibodies against foreign ABO antigens (eg, anti-B antibodies in a type A patient) that will attack antigens on mismatched donor RBCs (eg, type B donor blood). Massive hemolysis occurs within minutes to hours of transfusion, causing fever, flank pain, and hemoglobinuria.\n\n(Choice D) Anaphylactic transfusion reactions occur within minutes of transfusion initiation and present with wheezing, angioedema, and hypotension, findings not seen in this patient. This reaction can occur in patients with IgA deficiency due to the reaction of recipient anti-IgA antibodies against donor IgA.\n\nEducational objective:\nDelayed hemolytic transfusion reactions are usually mild, hemolytic reactions that occur >24 hours after blood transfusion. They are a type of anamnestic response (delayed immunologic response) that occurs in patients previously exposed to a minor RBC antigen (eg, previous blood transfusion, pregnancy).",
    "zh": "该患者在输血一周后出现黄疸和溶血性贫血，提示延迟性溶血性输血反应(DHTR)。这种反应发生在之前通过怀孕、既往输血或静脉注射药物等机制暴露于异源性次要红细胞(RBC)抗原(非ABO)的患者中。在第一次暴露期间，最初仅产生低水平、通常无法检测到的抗体反应。在通过输血再次暴露后，患者的记忆B细胞产生更大浪涌的抗体，导致可检测到的溶血。这被称为回忆反应。\n\nDHTR通常是轻度的，并且在输血后 >24小时内发生，最常见于1-2周后。大多数患者无症状，仅在发现新出现的直接抗体（+ Coombs）试验和抗体筛查呈阳性后才被诊断出来。其他的实验室发现包括伴有代偿性网织红细胞增多的贫血和溶血的证据（例如，↑间接胆红素，↑乳酸脱氢酶）。\n\n（选项A和B）轻度溶血可能由血浆制品（例如，新鲜冰冻血浆、血小板）的输注引起，这些血浆制品可能含有针对受体RBC上的ABO或次要抗原的供体抗体。这种反应通常不会发生在输注浓缩红细胞（该患者接受的）时，因为在血液分离过程中，RBC会从血浆层中移除并洗涤。\n\n（选项C）急性溶血性输血反应是由ABO血型不合引起的（例如，由于文书错误）。患者自然具有针对异源性ABO抗原的预先形成的抗体（例如，A型患者的抗-B抗体），这些抗体将攻击不匹配的供体RBC上的抗原（例如，B型供者血）。大规模溶血发生在输血后几分钟到几小时内，引起发烧、腰痛和血红蛋白尿。\n\n（选项D）过敏性输血反应发生在输血开始后的几分钟内，表现为喘息、血管性水肿和低血压，这些发现未在该患者中观察到。这种反应可发生在IgA缺乏的患者中，这是由于受体抗-IgA抗体对供体IgA的反应引起的。\n\n教育目标：\n延迟性溶血性输血反应通常是轻度的溶血反应，发生在输血后 >24小时。它们是一种回忆反应（延迟的免疫反应），发生在先前暴露于次要RBC抗原（例如，既往输血、怀孕）的患者中。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTR), including the underlying mechanism, clinical presentation, and diagnostic findings. It requires differentiating DHTR from other types of transfusion reactions based on the timing and specific antibody-antigen interactions involved.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the delayed onset of symptoms (days to weeks after transfusion) and the presence of jaundice and hemolytic anemia. Consider the patient's history of prior exposure to foreign RBC antigens (through pregnancy or transfusion) and the anamnestic antibody response that occurs upon re-exposure.",
