She has a history of seasonal allergies for which she takes over-the-counter antihistamines. The patient ascribes her symptoms to smoking cigarettes and has cut down from a pack to 3 or 4 cigarettes daily. Her mother has rheumatoid arthritis. CT-guided lung biopsy is performed; findings are shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}.",

    "en": "This patient likely has sarcoidosis, a chronic multisystem disorder characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas (eg, epithelioid macrophages, multinucleated giant cells). It typically affects young adults and is more prevalent in African American individuals and in women.\n\nAny organ can be affected, but the lungs are initially involved in most cases. Patients often have the insidious onset of respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea, chest pain) accompanied by fatigue, fever, and weight loss. The disease may also be incidentally detected in asymptomatic patients with typical chest x-ray findings (eg, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, reticular opacities).\n\n(Choice A) Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis commonly occurs in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis and presents with recurrent disease exacerbations. Microscopic examination would likely show mucin within the bronchial lumens with numerous eosinophils and rare Aspergillus hyphae.\n\n(Choice B) Churg-Strauss syndrome (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis) usually presents with chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, and eosinophilia. The granulomas seen with Churg-Strauss syndrome typically have eosinophilic infiltration and extensive necrosis.\n\n(Choices C, E, and G) Desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) are associated with cigarette smoking and typically present with the insidious onset of progressive dyspnea and chronic cough. However, DIP is characterized by numerous intraalveolar macrophages, IPF is associated with patchy fibrosis and inflammation, and PAP demonstrates lipoproteinaceous material within the alveoli.\n\n(Choice D) Hodgkin lymphoma typically presents with lymphadenopathy and B symptoms (eg, fever, night sweats, weight loss), and histopathology demonstrates Reed-Sternberg cells surrounded by inflammatory cells.\n\n(Choice F) Systemic sclerosis results in progressive collagen deposition and fibrosis of the skin and visceral organs (eg, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, kidneys), which can lead to dyspnea and cough. However, biopsy would demonstrate excessive collagen deposition, not granulomas.\n\n(Choice I) Small cell carcinoma is a highly malignant lung cancer that is strongly associated with smoking. Histopathologic features include small cells with scant cytoplasm, granular nuclear chromatin (salt and pepper pattern), and indistinct nucleoli.\n\nEducational objective: Sarcoidosis often presents in young women with the insidious onset of respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea, chest pain) accompanied by fatigue, fever, and weight loss. The characteristic histopathologic feature is noncaseating granulomas, which consist of aggregates of epithelioid macrophages, frequently with multinucleated giant cells. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者可能患有结节病，这是一种慢性多系统疾病，其特征是形成非干酪样肉芽肿（例如，上皮样巨噬细胞、多核巨细胞）。它通常影响年轻人，并且在非裔美国人和女性中更为常见。\n\n任何器官都可能受到影响，但在大多数情况下，肺部最初受到影响。患者通常有呼吸系统症状的隐匿性发病（例如，咳嗽、呼吸困难、胸痛），并伴有疲劳、发烧和体重减轻。这种疾病也可能在无症状患者中偶然发现，这些患者具有典型的胸部X线表现（例如，双侧肺门淋巴结肿大、网状模糊）。\n\n(选项A) 变应性支气管肺曲霉病通常发生在患有哮喘或囊性纤维化的患者中，并表现为复发性疾病加重。显微镜检查可能会显示支气管腔内的粘蛋白，其中有大量的嗜酸性粒细胞和罕见的曲霉菌菌丝。\n\n(选项B) 丘-施综合征（嗜酸性肉芽肿性血管炎）通常表现为慢性鼻窦炎、哮喘和嗜酸性粒细胞增多症。在丘-施综合征中看到的肉芽肿通常具有嗜酸性粒细胞浸润和广泛的坏死。\n\n(选项C、E和G) 脱屑性间质性肺炎（DIP）、特发性肺纤维化（IPF）和肺泡蛋白沉积症（PAP）与吸烟有关，通常表现为进行性呼吸困难和慢性咳嗽的隐匿性发病。然而，DIP的特征是存在大量的肺泡内巨噬细胞，IPF与斑片状纤维化和炎症有关，而PAP显示肺泡内存在脂蛋白样物质。\n\n(选项D) 霍奇金淋巴瘤通常表现为淋巴结肿大和B症状（例如，发烧、盗汗、体重减轻），并且组织病理学显示Reed-Sternberg细胞被炎性细胞包围。\n\n(选项F) 系统性硬化症导致皮肤和内脏器官（例如，胃肠道、肺、肾脏）进行性胶原沉积和纤维化，这可能导致呼吸困难和咳嗽。然而，活检将显示过多的胶原沉积，而不是肉芽肿。\n\n(选项I) 小细胞癌是一种高度恶性的肺癌，与吸烟密切相关。组织病理学特征包括细胞质稀少的小细胞、颗粒状核染色质（椒盐样模式）和模糊的核仁。\n\n教育目标：结节病通常在年轻女性中表现为呼吸系统症状的隐匿性发病（例如，咳嗽、呼吸困难、胸痛），并伴有疲劳、发烧和体重减轻。特征性的组织病理学特征是非干酪样肉芽肿，由上皮样巨噬细胞聚集而成，通常伴有多核巨细胞。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"
