    "en": "An autopsy is being performed on a 4-year-old boy who recently died from a myocardial infarction. The child had a history of intellectual disability. Autopsy shows a prominent forehead and broad nose. There is a diffuse haze over the corneas bilaterally. The heart, liver, and spleen are enlarged. Sampling of the coronary arteries is most likely to reveal intimal accumulation of which of the following substances?",

    "en": "This patient most likely had Hurler syndrome (type I mucopolysaccharidosis), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY, CORNEAL CLOUDING, and COARSE FACIAL FEATURES (eg, frontal bossing, broad nose, flat midface). Hepatosplenomegaly and heart disease are also typical findings.\n\nMucopolysaccharidoses are lysosomal storage disorders resulting from the defective metabolism of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are long, unbranched polysaccharides that are an important component of the ground substance within the extracellular matrix of connective tissues. Hurler syndrome is caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-Iduronidase, which hydrolyzes dermatan and heparan sulfate. Hunter syndrome, a less severe disease than Hurler syndrome, also results in an accumulation of dermatan and heparan sulfate but characteristically does not cause corneal clouding.\n\nPatients with Hurler syndrome have a shortened life expectancy. Death, typically in early childhood, is usually caused by CARDIAC COMPLICATIONS (eg, myocardial infarction); this child’s death from coronary artery disease was likely due to deposition of dermatan and heparan sulfate within the vessels.\n\n(Choice A) Premature coronary artery disease is seen with familial hypercholesterolemia. Cholesterol deposits can lead to tendon xanthomas, xanthelasmas (ie, eyelid plaques), and/or corneal arcus (ie, gray ring around the cornea) but not coarse facial features, intellectual disability, or a diffuse corneal haze.\n\n(Choice B) Accumulation of glucocerebroside within mononuclear cells is seen in Gaucher disease, an autosomal recessive defect in beta-glucocerebrosidase. This condition is characterized by bruising due to thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, progressive neurologic deterioration, and severe bone pain. Premature coronary artery disease does not occur.\n\n(Choice C) Glycogen storage diseases cause defective metabolism of glycogen in the liver and/or muscles. The presentation can include hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hepatomegaly, growth retardation, and/or muscle fatigue/cramping. Cardiomegaly can occur with Pompe disease, but corneal clouding is not a feature.\n\n(Choice E) Niemann-Pick disease results from a deficiency of sphingomyelinase, which leads to the accumulation of sphingomyelin within phagocytes. This disease is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly and progressive neurologic deterioration, but eye findings include a cherry-red spot on the macula, not corneal clouding.",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有 Hurler 综合征（I 型粘多糖贮积症），这是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是严重的智力障碍、角膜混浊和粗糙的面部特征（例如，额头前突、鼻子宽大、中脸扁平）。肝脾肿大和心脏病也是典型表现。\n\n粘多糖贮积症是溶酶体贮积病，由糖胺聚糖 (GAGs) 的代谢缺陷引起。 GAGs 是长链、无分支的多糖，是结缔组织细胞外基质内基质的重要组成部分。 Hurler 综合征是由 alpha-L-Iduronidase 缺乏引起的，该酶水解硫酸皮肤素和硫酸乙酰肝素。 Hunter 综合征，一种比 Hurler 综合征轻的疾病，也会导致硫酸皮肤素和硫酸乙酰肝素的积聚，但其特征是不会引起角膜混浊。\n\nHurler 综合征患者的预期寿命缩短。死亡通常发生在幼儿时期，通常是由心脏并发症（例如，心肌梗死）引起的；这名儿童因冠状动脉疾病死亡很可能是由于硫酸皮肤素和硫酸乙酰肝素在血管内的沉积。\n\n(选项 A) 家族性高胆固醇血症可见过早的冠状动脉疾病。胆固醇沉积可导致肌腱黄瘤、睑黄瘤（即，眼睑斑块）和/或角膜弓（即，角膜周围的灰环），但不会导致粗糙的面部特征、智力障碍或弥漫性角膜混浊。\n\n(选项 B) 葡萄糖脑苷脂在单核细胞内的积聚见于 Gaucher 病，这是一种 beta-葡萄糖脑苷脂酶的常染色体隐性遗传缺陷。该病以血小板减少症引起的瘀伤、肝脾肿大、进行性神经系统恶化和严重的骨痛为特征。不会发生过早的冠状动脉疾病。\n\n(选项 C) 糖原贮积病导致肝脏和/或肌肉中糖原代谢缺陷。表现可包括低血糖症、乳酸性酸中毒、肝肿大、生长迟缓和/或肌肉疲劳/抽筋。 Pompe 病可发生心脏肥大，但角膜混浊不是其特征。\n\n(选项 E) Niemann-Pick 病是由于鞘磷脂酶缺乏引起的，这导致鞘磷脂在吞噬细胞内积聚。该病的特征是肝脾肿大和进行性神经系统恶化，但眼部表现包括黄斑上的樱桃红色斑点，而不是角膜混浊。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of mucopolysaccharidoses, specifically Hurler syndrome, and its characteristic features including intellectual disability, corneal clouding, coarse facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, and cardiac complications due to the accumulation of dermatan and heparan sulfate.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the constellation of symptoms (intellectual disability, corneal clouding, coarse facial features, and early death from myocardial infarction) as suggestive of Hurler syndrome, and then recall that Hurler syndrome is caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase, leading to the accumulation of dermatan and heparan sulfate.",
