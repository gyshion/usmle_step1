    "en": "A 54-year-old previously healthy man comes to the office due to progressive fatigue and weakness for the past 2 months. His weakness predominantly involves the lower extremities, causing him to have difficulty rising from a chair. The patient also has a persistent cough and unintentional 7-kg (15.4-lb) weight loss during the same period. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history and drinks alcohol occasionally. Physical examination shows bilaterally decreased strength in the proximal muscles of the lower extremities with normal bulk and tone. Quadriceps tendon reflexes are diminished bilaterally. Chest x-ray reveals a hilar mass, biopsy of which demonstrates small cells that stain positive for chromogranin and synaptophysin. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient with small cell lung cancer (small cells with neuroendocrine differentiation) has progressive proximal muscle weakness and diminished reflexes in the lower extremities, suggestive of paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). LEMS is an autoimmune disorder characterized by antibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels at the neuromuscular junction. Normally, these calcium channels open in response to a presynaptic action potential, leading to an influx of calcium ions that cause synaptic vesicle fusion and acetylcholine release. LEMS-associated autoantibodies inhibit calcium influx, resulting in reduced acetylcholine release and failure to provoke muscular contractions.\n\nMuscular weakness in LEMS is progressive and predominantly involves the proximal muscles; it typically affects the lower limbs (eg, difficulty rising from a chair or climbing stairs) before the upper limbs (eg, raising arms above the head). Deep tendon reflexes are typically diminished or absent. Both strength and reflexes improve transiently with isometric muscular contractions in a phenomenon known as postexercise facilitation, likely due to a buildup of intracellular calcium with repetitive stimuli. Approximately 50% of patients have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small cell lung cancer. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice B) Autoantibodies against postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors cause myasthenia gravis (MG), another immune-mediated neuromuscular disorder. MG typically involves the extraocular (eg, ptosis, diplopia) and bulbar (eg, dysphonia, dysphagia) muscles before affecting the limbs, and reflexes typically remain intact.\n\n(Choice C) Guillain-Barré syndrome occurs due to immune-mediated, segmental axonal demyelination; however, it typically occurs after an upper respiratory or gastrointestinal (eg, Campylobacter) infection. Rapidly progressive ascending paralysis (distal prior to proximal muscle involvement) is characteristic.\n\n(Choice D) Metastatic disease within the epidural space can cause spinal cord compression. Patients typically develop spastic paraparesis below the level of involvement. Hyperreflexia is common, and urine and stool retention may be seen (depending on the level of involvement).\n\n(Choice E) Protein degradation in cancer cachexia is associated with activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Cancer cachexia causes muscle and fat loss, but weakness would be expected to affect proximal and distal muscles equally and reflexes are preserved.\n\nEducational objective:\nLambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is characterized by antibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels. Patients develop progressive proximal muscle weakness with reduced/absent reflexes that predominantly involves the lower extremities. The syndrome is often associated with malignancy, particularly small cell lung cancer.",
    "zh": "这位患有小细胞肺癌（具有神经内分泌分化的小细胞）的患者出现进行性近端肌肉无力和下肢反射减弱，提示副肿瘤性Lambert-Eaton肌无力综合征（LEMS）。LEMS是一种自身免疫性疾病，其特征是针对神经肌肉接头处突触前电压门控钙通道的抗体。通常，这些钙通道响应突触前动作电位而开放，导致钙离子内流，引起突触小泡融合和乙酰胆碱释放。LEMS相关的自身抗体抑制钙内流，导致乙酰胆碱释放减少，无法引起肌肉收缩。\n\nLEMS中的肌肉无力是进行性的，主要累及近端肌肉；它通常会先影响下肢（例如，难以从椅子上站起来或爬楼梯），然后影响上肢（例如，举起手臂高于头部）。深腱反射通常减弱或消失。力量和反射都随着等距肌肉收缩而短暂改善，这种现象被称为运动后易化，这可能是由于重复刺激引起的细胞内钙积累。大约50%的患者患有潜在的恶性肿瘤，最常见的是小细胞肺癌。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n（选项B）针对突触后烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体的自身抗体引起重症肌无力（MG），这是一种由免疫介导的神经肌肉疾病。MG通常在影响肢体之前累及眼外肌（例如，上睑下垂、复视）和延髓肌（例如，发声困难、吞咽困难），并且反射通常保持完整。\n\n（选项C）格林-巴利综合征是由于免疫介导的节段性轴突脱髓鞘引起的；然而，它通常发生在出现上呼吸道或胃肠道（例如，弯曲杆菌）感染之后。迅速进展的上升性麻痹（先累及远端，然后累及近端肌肉）是其特征。\n\n（选项D）硬膜外腔内的转移性疾病可引起脊髓压迫。患者通常在受累水平以下出现痉挛性截瘫。高反射常见，并且可能会看到尿潴留和便秘（取决于受累水平）。\n\n（选项E）癌症恶病质中的蛋白质降解与泛素-蛋白酶体系统的激活有关。癌症恶病质会导致肌肉和脂肪流失，但预计无力会平等地影响近端和远端肌肉，并且反射会得到保留。\n\n教育目标：\nLambert-Eaton肌无力综合征的特征是针对突触前电压门控钙通道的抗体。患者出现进行性近端肌肉无力，伴有减弱/消失的反射，主要累及下肢。该综合征通常与恶性肿瘤相关，特别是小细胞肺癌。"
