  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The stomach performs several important functions:\n\n*   **Protein digestion:** Gastric parietal cells and chief cells produce hydrochloric acid (HCl) and pepsinogen, respectively. HCl helps denature dietary protein (improving proteolysis) and converts pepsinogen to its active form, pepsin, which preferentially cleaves polypeptides at aromatic amino acid locations. However, patients can still digest protein after undergoing total gastrectomy because of the action of **pancreatic and intestinal proteases**, which degrade dietary proteins into basic amino acids in the small intestine; therefore, it is unnecessary to administer gastric enzymes, HCl, or hydrolyzed protein in these patients (**Choices A, B, and C**).\n*   **Intrinsic factor (IF) secretion:** Parietal cells in the body and fundus of the stomach secrete IF, a glycoprotein that binds to vitamin B₁₂, a **water-soluble vitamin**. The vitamin B₁₂-IF complex is absorbed by enterocytes in the terminal ileum. In patients who have undergone a total **gastrectomy**, IF is no longer produced, and vitamin B₁₂ cannot be absorbed enterally in an efficient manner (only ~1% of ingested vitamin B₁₂ is absorbed without IF). Therefore, **lifelong administration** of B₁₂ is required (eg, vitamin B₁₂ injections) {{exhibit_1}}.\n*   **Gastric reservoir:** The stomach also serves as a reservoir for ingested food. This function is lost after total gastrectomy, and accelerated emptying of hyperosmolar food boluses into the small bowel results in **dumping syndrome**, which is characterized by colicky abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. Avoidance of large meals and low dietary intake of simple sugars improve these symptoms.\n\n(**Choice D**) Medium-chain triglycerides can passively diffuse from the gastrointestinal lumen into enterocytes, but they are best absorbed after being degraded into monoglycerides and free fatty acids by lingual and pancreatic lipase. Supplementation is not necessary in patients with total gastrectomy.\n\n**Educational objective:**\nIntrinsic factor is a glycoprotein that is normally secreted by parietal cells in the stomach that is necessary for the majority (~99%) of vitamin B₁₂ absorption in the ileum. Patients who have undergone a total gastrectomy require lifelong vitamin B₁₂ supplementation due to inability to produce intrinsic factor.",
    "zh": "胃执行几项重要功能：\n\n*   **蛋白质消化：**胃壁细胞和主细胞分别产生盐酸 (HCl) 和胃蛋白酶原。HCl 有助于变性膳食蛋白（改善蛋白水解），并将胃蛋白酶原转化为其活性形式胃蛋白酶，胃蛋白酶优先在芳香族氨基酸位置切割多肽。然而，患者在接受全胃切除术后仍可消化蛋白质，因为**胰腺和肠道蛋白酶**的作用，它们将膳食蛋白降解为小肠中的基本氨基酸；因此，无需对这些患者使用胃酶、HCl 或水解蛋白（**选项 A、B 和 C**）。\n*   **内因子 (IF) 分泌：**胃体和胃底的壁细胞分泌 IF，这是一种与维生素 B₁₂ 结合的糖蛋白，维生素 B₁₂ 是一种**水溶性维生素**。维生素 B₁₂-IF 复合物被回肠末端的肠细胞吸收。在接受全**胃切除术**的患者中，不再产生 IF，并且维生素 B₁₂ 不能以有效的方式通过肠道吸收（没有 IF，只有约 1% 的摄入维生素 B₁₂ 被吸收）。因此，需要**终生服用** B₁₂（例如，维生素 B₁₂ 注射）{{exhibit_1}}。\n*   **胃储库：**胃也充当摄入食物的储库。全胃切除术后会失去此功能，并且高渗食物团加速排空到小肠中会导致**倾倒综合征**，其特征是绞痛性腹痛、恶心和腹泻。避免大餐和低膳食摄入单糖可以改善这些症状。\n\n（**选项 D**）中链甘油三酯可以从胃肠道腔内被动扩散到肠细胞中，但它们在被舌和胰腺脂肪酶降解为单酰甘油和游离脂肪酸后才能被更好地吸收。全胃切除术患者无需补充。\n\n**教育目标：**\n内因子是一种糖蛋白，通常由胃中的壁细胞分泌，是回肠中维生素 B₁₂ 大部分（约 99%）吸收所必需的。由于无法产生内因子，接受全胃切除术的患者需要终生补充维生素 B₁₂。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the physiological functions of the stomach, specifically intrinsic factor production and its role in vitamin B12 absorption. It also assesses the understanding of the consequences of total gastrectomy and the need for lifelong vitamin B12 supplementation.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the stomach produces intrinsic factor, which is essential for vitamin B12 absorption. After a total gastrectomy, intrinsic factor is no longer produced, leading to vitamin B12 deficiency, necessitating lifelong supplementation.",
