    "en": "A 61-year-old man comes to the office due to worsening cough for the past several months. He initially had a morning cough productive of minimal sputum, but now the cough occurs throughout the day with large amounts of yellowish sputum. The patient also has breathlessness on moderate exertion. He has had 3 hospitalizations over the past year for respiratory infections. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years and has had multiple unsuccessful attempts to quit. Oxygen saturation is 88% at rest and decreases to 84% with moderate exertion.",

    "en": "This patient with progressive dyspnea and productive cough in the setting of significant smoking history likely has CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). His recent hospitalizations for respiratory infections likely represent COPD exacerbations.\n\nHypoxemia (ie, low arterial oxygen saturation) is a common complication of advanced COPD and occurs via 2 major mechanisms:\n\n*   Emphysematous destruction of the alveolar walls reduces the pulmonary capillary bed surface area, resulting in decreased diffusing capacity.\n*   Airway obstruction (eg, bronchial inflammation, mucus secretion, emphysematous airway collapse) decreases air exchange, resulting in increased ventilation-perfusion mismatching.\n\nPersistent tissue hypoxia is sensed by specialized peritubular fibroblasts in the renal cortex, which respond by increasing secretion of erythropoietin (EPO). This hormone is released into the circulation, where it acts on the bone marrow to increase production of red blood cells, bolstering the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. The resulting increase in hematocrit, known as SECONDARY POLYCYTHEMIA, is an expected finding in conditions that cause significant chronic hypoxemia (eg, COPD, interstitial lung disease, residence at high altitude).\n\n(Choice A) Air trapping leads to an increase in the functional residual capacity in patients with COPD.\n\n(Choice B) Hypoxic vasoconstriction in advanced COPD increases pulmonary vascular resistance and leads to increased right ventricular afterload.\n\n(Choice D) Airway obstruction in COPD leads to decreased expiratory flow rates. This is apparent as reduced in forced expiratory volume in 1 second.\n\n(Choice E) Left ventricular compliance is increased in conditions that lead to eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy (eg, dilated cardiomyopathy). It is not significantly affected in COPD. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者有进行性呼吸困难和咳痰，且有显著的吸烟史，很可能患有慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD）。他最近因呼吸道感染住院可能代表COPD的加重。\n\n低氧血症（即动脉血氧饱和度低）是晚期COPD的常见并发症，通过以下两种主要机制发生：\n\n*   肺泡壁的肺气肿破坏减少了肺毛细血管床的表面积，导致弥散能力下降。\n*   气道阻塞（例如，支气管炎症、粘液分泌、肺气肿性气道塌陷）减少了气体交换，导致通气-血流比例失调增加。\n\n持续的组织缺氧由肾皮质中的特殊肾小管周围成纤维细胞感知，这些细胞通过增加促红细胞生成素（EPO）的分泌来响应。这种激素被释放到循环中，在那里它作用于骨髓以增加红细胞的产生，从而提高血液的氧气携带能力。由此产生的血细胞比容升高，称为继发性红细胞增多症，是在导致显著慢性低氧血症的疾病（例如，COPD、间质性肺病、居住在高海拔地区）中预期的发现。\n\n（选项A）气滞导致COPD患者的功能残气量增加。\n\n（选项B）晚期COPD中的缺氧性血管收缩增加了肺血管阻力，导致右心室后负荷增加。\n\n（选项D）COPD中的气道阻塞导致呼气流量降低。这表现为第一秒用力呼气量降低。\n\n（选项E）左心室顺应性在导致左心室肥大（例如，扩张型心肌病）的病症中增加。它在COPD中没有显着影响。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}"
