    "en": "A group of forensic pathologist are analyzing tissue samples of adolescents age 13-18 to study the aging process. Autopsy of a 14-year-old boy who died in a motor vehicle accident shows several minimally raised yellow spots on the inner surface of the abdominal aorta. The rest of the cardiovascular findings during the autopsy are unremarkable. He had no known medical problems. There was no family history of cardiovascular disease or sudden cardiac death.",

    "en": "The lesions described during autopsy on the inner surface of the abdominal aorta are consistent with fatty streaks {{exhibit_1}}. These are the earliest lesions in the progression to atherosclerosis and can be seen as early as the second decade of life. Atherosclerosis is a pathophysiologic process that begins in childhood with the development of focal intimal thickening and lipid accumulation. It progresses in the following sequence:\n\n*   Endothelial injury/dysfunction causing increased vascular permeability and enhanced leukocyte adhesion\n*   Accumulation of lipoproteins (LDL) within the vessel wall\n*   Monocyte adhesion to the endothelium, followed by migration and transformation into lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells)\n*   Release of growth factors by adherent platelets, activated macrophages, and endothelial cells\n*   Recruitment of T cells and smooth muscle cell proliferation, which lead to extracellular matrix production\n\nWith advancing age, the chronic inflammatory process initiated by endothelial injury transitions from fatty streaks within the intima (composed mainly of lipid-laden foam cells) into atherosclerotic plaques, such as fibrous cap atheromas and fibrous plaques.\n\n(Choices A, B, D, and E) Eosinophils, fibroblasts, mast cells, and neutrophils are not the predominant cell types found in fatty streaks.\n\nEducational objective:\nFatty streaks are the earliest lesions of atherosclerosis and can be seen as early as the second decade of life. They appear as a collection of lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) in the intima that can eventually progress to atherosclerotic plaques.",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, specifically the composition of fatty streaks, which are the earliest lesions. The predominant cell type in fatty streaks are lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells). \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the description of fatty streaks and recall their composition. Understanding the early stages of atherosclerosis and the role of macrophages is crucial for answering correctly.",
