    "en": "Researchers are studying the relationship between essential hypertension and a common mutation in the structure of a sodium channel protein. A study population is randomly selected and blood samples are obtained for leukocyte genotyping. The prevalence of hypertension is determined based on mean blood pressure measurements obtained using standardized ambulatory blood pressure monitoring conducted over 1 week. Based on the analysis results, the researchers conclude that the sodium channel structure mutation is associated with hypertension.",

    "en": "A CROSS-SECTIONAL study (also known as a prevalence study) simultaneously measures exposures and outcomes. The cross-sectional study has a \"SNAPSHOT\" design that is frequently used in surveys, mostly because it is inexpensive and easy to perform. In this example, a snapshot was obtained of individuals randomly selected from the population; their blood samples were analyzed for the presence of the sodium channel protein mutation and the prevalence of hypertension was CALCULATED. The subjects' blood pressure was measured over 7 days to obtain an average measurement (likely to limit the results being impacted by white-coat hypertension and other transient causes of hypertension).",
    "zh": "横断面研究（也称为患病率研究）同时测量暴露和结局。横断面研究具有“快照”设计，常用于调查，主要是因为它便宜且易于执行。在这个例子中，从人群中随机选择的个体获得了一个快照；分析他们的血样中是否存在钠通道蛋白突变，并计算高血压的患病率。对受试者的血压进行 7 天测量以获得平均测量值（可能限制结果受到白大褂高血压和其他短暂性高血压原因的影响）。"
