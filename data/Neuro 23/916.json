    "en": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the office due to left eye pain that is accentuated by ocular movements. She also has periodic dimming of vision in the same eye. The patient has had several episodes over the last month, most often after a hot shower or intense workout. A year ago, she had an episode of numbness and tingling in her left arm that resolved spontaneously. The patient has no other medical issues and takes no medication. She smokes half a pack of cigarettes a day and does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Vital signs are normal. BMI is 26 kg/m². Ophthalmologic examination shows swelling of the optic disc on the left. Neurologic examination shows a mild intention tremor and broad-based gait.",

    "en": "This patient has eye pain worsened by movement, intermittently decreased vision, and swelling of the optic disc, consistent with OPTIC NEURITIS. In a young female patient, optic neuritis should raise concern for MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS), a chronic immune-mediated disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS) and leads to oligodendrocyte destruction. Demyelinating plaques are commonly seen as hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted MRI of the brain and spinal cord.\n\nMS is characterized by episodic, progressive neurologic deficits that may involve multiple anatomic regions within the CNS (ie, separated in space and time). In addition to optic neuritis, other manifestations of MS include sensory/motor symptoms (eg, arm numbness and tingling), internuclear ophthalmoplegia, cerebellar dysfunction (eg, intention tremor, broad-based gait), and Lhermitte sign (electrical sensations down the back/limbs with neck flexion). Symptom worsening can occur with increased body temperature (eg, exercise, bathing) due to slowing of neuronal conduction in unmyelinated nerves (Uhthoff phenomenon).\n\n(Choice A) Atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries can cause transient ischemia leading to episodic vision loss (amaurosis fugax). However, it would not typically cause eye pain or worsening symptoms with body heat, and would be rare in a young patient without other signs of atherosclerosis.\n\n(Choice B) Brain metastases can cause a variety of neurologic symptoms (eg, cerebellar signs, vision changes) but would be expected to worsen with time, not relapse and remit.\n\n(Choice D) Polycythemia vera can cause transient visual disturbances and other neurologic manifestations due to increased blood viscosity. Although patients may have pruritus or erythema following heat exposure, heat does not worsen neurologic symptoms. Also, this patient does not have other polycythemic manifestations (eg, hypertension, facial plethora).\n\n(Choice E) Neurosyphilis can cause a wide-based gait and pupillary irregularities (Argyll Robertson pupil; ie, accommodates but does not react to light), but there is no pain with eye movement or vision loss. In addition, heat sensitivity and upper extremity weakness would be unexpected.\n\n(Choice F) Vitamin B₁₂ deficiency causes subacute combined degeneration, and patients can develop a broad-based gait. However, in most cases this is slowly progressive and often accompanied by paresthesias in the distal lower extremities. Intention tremor and optic neuritis are not associated with vitamin B₁₂ deficiency.",
    "zh": "该患者出现因运动加重的眼痛、间歇性视力下降和视盘水肿，与视神经炎一致。在年轻女性患者中，视神经炎应引起对多发性硬化症（MS）的关注，MS是一种慢性免疫介导性疾病，影响中枢神经系统（CNS）并导致少突胶质细胞破坏。脱髓鞘斑块通常在脑部和脊髓的T2加权MRI上表现为高信号病灶。\n\nMS的特征是发作性、进行性神经功能缺损，可能涉及CNS内的多个解剖区域（即，在空间和时间上分离）。除了视神经炎外，MS的其他表现包括感觉/运动症状（例如，手臂麻木和刺痛）、核间性眼肌麻痹、小脑功能障碍（例如，意向性震颤、宽步态）和Lhermitte征（颈部屈曲时背部/肢体出现电感）。由于未髓鞘神经中的神经元传导减慢（Uhthoff现象），症状恶化可能发生在体温升高时（例如，运动、洗澡）。\n\n（选项A）颈动脉粥样硬化可引起短暂性缺血，导致发作性视力丧失（一过性黑蒙）。然而，它通常不会引起眼痛或体热加重症状，并且在没有其他动脉粥样硬化体征的年轻患者中很少见。\n\n（选项B）脑转移瘤可引起各种神经系统症状（例如，小脑体征、视力改变），但预计会随着时间的推移而恶化，而不是复发和缓解。\n\n（选项D）真性红细胞增多症可因血液粘度增加而引起短暂性视觉障碍和其他神经系统表现。尽管患者在暴露于热后可能出现瘙痒或红斑，但热量并不会加重神经系统症状。此外，该患者没有其他红细胞增多症表现（例如，高血压、面部多血症）。\n\n（选项E）神经梅毒可引起宽步态和瞳孔不规则（阿-罗瞳孔；即，适应但不对光反应），但眼部运动或视力丧失没有疼痛。此外，热敏感性和上肢无力是意想不到的。\n\n（选项F）维生素B₁₂缺乏症引起亚急性联合变性，患者可出现宽步态。然而，在大多数情况下，这是一个缓慢进展的过程，并且常常伴有远端下肢的麻木。意向性震颤和视神经炎与维生素B₁₂缺乏症无关。"
