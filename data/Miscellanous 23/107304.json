    "en": "A 13-year-old, previously healthy boy is brought to the office due to progressively worsening throat pain over the last 4 days. He also reports malaise and decreased oral intake. The patient has no vomiting or diarrhea. Vaccinations are up to date. The voice sounds muffled. Temperature is 38.8 C (101.8 F). The patient has difficulty opening the mouth due to pain. The left tonsil is markedly enlarged and fluctuant, and the uvula is deviated to the right. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient's history (eg, progressive sore throat, fever) and clinical examination (eg, fluctuant bulge with uvula deviation) are consistent with a PERITONSILLAR ABSCESS, an acute bacterial infection of the region between the tonsil and the pharyngeal muscles. It begins as persistent tonsillitis/pharyngitis and progresses to cellulitis/phlegmon, with pus collecting into an abscess about a week after symptom onset. {{exhibit_2}} The abscess collection in the soft tissue of the palate leads to a visible, fluctuant bulge above the tonsil that pushes the uvula to the contralateral side. It also decreases the space in the posterior pharynx, leading to decreased voice resonance, resulting in the classic muffled, or hot potato voice. Inflammation of the nearby pterygoid muscles leads to TRISMUS; regional (cervical) lymphadenopathy is common (as it is in many other pharyngeal infections). Clinical history and examination are typically sufficient for diagnosis.\n\nPeritonsillar infections are largely thought to be POLYMICROBIAL; cultures typically grow many different organisms (eg, group A Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, respiratory anaerobes). Treatment involves needle aspiration or incision and drainage of the abscess plus antibiotic therapy.\n\n(Choice A) Diphtheria presents with cervical adenopathy, fever, and sore throat. However, it is unlikely in someone who has received normal childhood vaccinations (which include diphtheria) and classically presents with a gray, adherent, posterior pharyngeal pseudomembrane (vs unilateral swelling and uvular deviation).\n\n(Choice B) Epiglottitis is most commonly caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b, which is a part of the normal childhood vaccinations. Although epiglottitis can present with fever, dysphagia, sore throat, and muffled voice, pharyngeal findings are typically normal. {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(Choice D) Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common pathogen involved in otitis externa (ie, swimmer's ear). It presents with pain, erythema, edema, and discharge from the external auditory canal.\n\n(Choice E) Streptococcus pneumoniae frequently causes acute otitis media and acute sinusitis, which do not impact the pharynx.\n\nEducational objective: A peritonsillar abscess typically causes fever and sore throat with trismus, a muffled voice, and uvular deviation. Infections are typically polymicrobial, with group A Streptococcus the most commonly isolated pathogen. {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "该患者的病史（例如，进行性咽喉痛、发烧）和临床检查（例如，悬雍垂偏斜伴波动性隆起）与扁桃体周围脓肿一致，扁桃体周围脓肿是扁桃体和咽肌之间区域的急性细菌感染。它始于持续性扁桃体炎/咽炎，并进展为蜂窝织炎/蜂窝组织炎，症状出现约一周后脓液聚集形成脓肿。{{exhibit_2}} 腭部软组织中的脓肿积聚导致扁桃体上方出现可见的、波动的隆起，将悬雍垂推向对侧。它也减少了后咽的空间，导致声音共振降低，从而导致典型的嘶哑或“热薯”声音。附近翼状肌的炎症导致三叉神经张力障碍；区域性（颈部）淋巴结病很常见（就像在许多其他咽部感染中一样）。临床病史和检查通常足以诊断。\n\n扁桃体周围感染主要被认为是多菌性的；培养物通常会培养出许多不同的生物体（例如，A组链球菌、金黄色葡萄球菌、呼吸道厌氧菌）。治疗包括针吸或切开引流脓肿，以及抗生素治疗。\n\n（选项A）白喉表现为颈部淋巴结病、发烧和咽喉痛。然而，在接种过正常儿童疫苗（包括白喉疫苗）的人中不太可能发生，并且典型表现为灰色、粘附的后咽假膜（vs 单侧肿胀和悬雍垂偏斜）。\n\n（选项B）会厌炎最常见的原因是b型流感嗜血杆菌，它是正常儿童疫苗接种的一部分。尽管会厌炎可表现为发烧、吞咽困难、咽喉痛和声音嘶哑，但咽部检查结果通常是正常的。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n（选项D）铜绿假单胞菌是外耳炎（即游泳者耳）中最常见的病原体。它表现为外耳道疼痛、发红、水肿和分泌物。\n\n（选项E）肺炎链球菌常引起急性中耳炎和急性鼻窦炎，这些不会影响咽部。\n\n教育目标：扁桃体周围脓肿通常会导致发烧和咽喉痛，伴有三叉神经张力障碍、声音嘶哑和悬雍垂偏斜。感染通常是多菌性的，其中A组链球菌是最常分离出的病原体。{{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation and etiology of peritonsillar abscesses. It requires differentiating this condition from other common pharyngeal infections based on specific signs and symptoms.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key clinical features such as muffled voice, trismus, unilateral tonsillar swelling, and uvular deviation, which are characteristic of a peritonsillar abscess.
