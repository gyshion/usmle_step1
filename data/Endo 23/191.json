  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The lesion pictured is a xanthelasma, a type of xanthoma usually found on the medial eyelids. Hyperlipidemia and/or dyslipidemia can result in xanthomas (including xanthelasmas). Xanthelasmas are dermal accumulations of benign-appearing macrophages with abundant, finely vacuolated (foamy) cytoplasm containing cholesterol (free and esterified), phospholipids, and triglycerides. Due in part to insulin resistance promoting increased VLDL production, diabetics may develop a secondary Type IV or V hyperlipidemia (increased VLDL, chylomicrons) and/or a secondary diabetic dyslipidemia with elevated LDL cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol. Thus, in order to determine the type of this patient's lipid disorder and to rule out underlying diabetes, her serum lipids and blood glucose should be measured.\n\n(Choice A) Although this patient may be at increased risk for coronary artery disease due to hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia, she does not currently have symptoms of myocardial infarction. Her current management should be focused on treating her lipid disorder.\n\n(Choice C) The first step in managing this patient is to establish what type of lipid abnormality she has based upon her serum lipid levels and lipoprotein profile. If the results are consistent with an obstructive liver and/or biliary system lesion producing cholestasis and hypercholesterolemia, then liver function tests and abdominal ultrasonography may be warranted.\n\n(Choice D) A CBC and stool guaiac test are performed when searching for occult GI bleeding.\n\n(Choice E) Slit lamp examination and funduscopy could reveal ocular findings associated with this patient's lipid disorder, such as a corneal arcus (lipid deposit) or lipemia retinalis. However, a serum lipid profile should be obtained next in order to establish the type of hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia in this patient.\n\n(Choice F) Xanthelasmas are usually diagnosed based on clinical appearance. Biopsy is not required. Treatment is primarily medical and directed at the underlying lipid abnormality. Surgical excision is not medically necessary, but may be undertaken electively for cosmetic reasons.\n\nEducational objective:\nXanthelasmas, a type of xanthoma, are yellowish macules/papules found on the medial eyelids. They are dermal accumulations of macrophages containing cholesterol and triglycerides, and are generally associated with a primary or secondary hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia. An LDL receptor abnormality is the most common cause.",
    "zh": "图中病变是睑黄瘤，一种通常位于内侧眼睑的黄色瘤。高脂血症和/或血脂异常可导致黄色瘤（包括睑黄瘤）。睑黄瘤是真皮内聚集的、外观呈良性的巨噬细胞，其细胞质内含有丰富的、细小的空泡（泡沫状），含有胆固醇（游离和酯化）、磷脂和甘油三酯。部分由于胰岛素抵抗促进VLDL产生增加，糖尿病患者可能会发生继发性IV型或V型高脂血症（VLDL、乳糜微粒增加）和/或继发性糖尿病性血脂异常，表现为LDL胆固醇升高和HDL胆固醇降低。因此，为了确定该患者的脂质紊乱类型并排除潜在的糖尿病，应检测其血清脂质和血糖。\n\n（选项A）尽管该患者可能因高脂血症或血脂异常而增加患冠心病的风险，但她目前没有心肌梗死的症状。她目前的治疗重点应放在治疗脂质紊乱上。\n\n（选项C）管理该患者的第一步是根据她的血清脂质水平和脂蛋白谱确定她患有什么类型的脂质异常。如果结果与导致胆汁淤积和高胆固醇血症的阻塞性肝脏和/或胆道系统病变相符，则可能需要进行肝功能检查和腹部超声检查。\n\n（选项D）当寻找隐匿性消化道出血时，进行全血细胞计数和粪便潜血试验。\n\n（选项E）裂隙灯检查和眼底镜检查可能会揭示与该患者脂质紊乱相关的眼部发现，例如角膜弓（脂质沉积）或视网膜脂血症。然而，应首先获得血清脂质谱，以确定该患者的高脂血症或血脂异常类型。\n\n（选项F）睑黄瘤通常根据临床表现进行诊断。不需要活检。治疗主要是药物治疗，针对潜在的脂质异常。手术切除在医学上不是必需的，但出于美容原因可以选做。\n\n教育目标：\n睑黄瘤是一种黄色瘤，是位于内侧眼睑的黄斑/丘疹。它们是真皮内聚集的巨噬细胞，含有胆固醇和甘油三酯，通常与原发性或继发性高脂血症或血脂异常相关。 LDL受体异常是最常见的原因。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of xanthelasma presentation and the association with underlying lipid disorders and diabetes. It assesses the ability to recognize the clinical significance of xanthelasma and determine the appropriate next step in management.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the xanthelasma and its association with hyperlipidemia and diabetes. Therefore, the next step should be to evaluate the patient's lipid profile and glucose levels to identify any underlying metabolic abnormalities.",
