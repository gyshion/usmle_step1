    "en": "This patient with prolonged pauses in airflow despite continued thoracic and diaphragmatic activity has OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA). OSA, the most common sleep-related breathing disorder, is characterized by recurrent obstruction of the upper airway.\n\nDuring sleep, there is relaxation of the oropharyngeal and/or soft palate musculature. In patients with OSA, this results in a functional airway collapse that produces periods of reduced (hypopnea) or absent (apnea) airflow despite continued breathing efforts. Apneic episodes may last anywhere from 10 seconds to >1 minute, resulting in hypoxia and hypercapnia. This eventually triggers chemoreceptors in the carotid body and brainstem, leading to transient arousal and resumption of breathing.\n\nPatients may not be aware of apnea, but bed partners commonly report loud snoring with intermittent episodes of silence. This pattern occurs hundreds of times per night, leading to poor sleep quality and chronic fatigue. Risk factors for OSA include obesity, large neck circumference, and reduced oropharyngeal diameter (eg, enlarged tonsils or tongue, retro- or micrognathia).\n\n(Choice A) Patients with advanced heart failure may exhibit Cheyne-Stokes breathing, a cyclic breathing pattern in which apnea is followed by gradually increasing then decreasing tidal volumes (crescendo-decrescendo) until the next apneic period.\n\n(Choice B) Reduced lung compliance in pulmonary fibrosis limits tidal volume (TV) per breath. Patients exhibit rapid, shallow breathing (without apnea) to restore minute ventilation (TV × respiratory rate) and minimize the work of breathing.\n\n(Choice C) Neuromuscular weakness (eg, Guillain-Barré syndrome) results in reduced thoracic and diaphragmatic muscle activity with rapid, shallow breathing; recurrent apnea does not occur.\n\n(Choice D) Severe diabetic ketoacidosis can result in Kussmaul breathing (ie, deep, rapid breathing with associated increased thoracic and diaphragmatic activity). It occurs as a respiratory compensation for severe metabolic acidosis.",
    "zh": "尽管胸廓和膈肌持续活动，但该患者的气流有长时间的停顿，患有阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停 (OSA)。OSA 是最常见的睡眠相关呼吸障碍，其特征是上气道的反复阻塞。\n\n在睡眠期间，口咽和/或软腭的肌肉会松弛。在 OSA 患者中，这会导致气道功能性塌陷，尽管呼吸仍在继续，但会产生气流减少（低通气）或缺失（呼吸暂停）的时段。呼吸暂停发作可能持续 10 秒到 1 分钟以上，导致缺氧和高碳酸血症。这最终会触发颈动脉体和脑干中的化学感受器，导致短暂的觉醒和呼吸恢复。\n\n患者可能不知道自己有呼吸暂停，但床伴通常会报告有响亮的鼾声和间歇性的沉默发作。这种模式每晚都会发生数百次，导致睡眠质量差和慢性疲劳。OSA 的危险因素包括肥胖、颈围大和口咽直径减小（例如，扁桃体或舌头肿大、后缩或小颌症）。\n\n（选项 A）晚期心力衰竭患者可能出现潮式呼吸，这是一种周期性呼吸模式，其中呼吸暂停之后是潮气量逐渐增加然后减少（渐强-渐弱），直到下一个呼吸暂停期。\n\n（选项 B）肺纤维化时肺顺应性降低会限制每次呼吸的潮气量 (TV)。患者表现出快速、浅表的呼吸（无呼吸暂停），以恢复每分钟通气量（TV × 呼吸频率）并最大限度地减少呼吸功。\n\n（选项 C）神经肌肉无力（例如，格林-巴利综合征）会导致胸廓和膈肌活动减少，伴有快速、浅表的呼吸；不会发生反复呼吸暂停。\n\n（选项 D）严重的糖尿病酮症酸中毒可导致库斯马呼吸（即，深而快的呼吸，伴有胸廓和膈肌活动增加）。它作为严重代谢性酸中毒的呼吸代偿而发生。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and its characteristic findings on sleep study recordings. It requires recognizing the pattern of airflow cessation despite continued respiratory effort.\n\nThe key to solving this question is identifying the prolonged pauses in airflow coupled with persistent thoracic and diaphragmatic activity. This pattern is indicative of upper airway obstruction, the hallmark of OSA.",
