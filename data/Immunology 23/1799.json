    "en": "A 72-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department from a nursing facility due to fever, chills, and hypotension. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, ischemic stroke, and neurogenic bladder. She has an indwelling urinary catheter. Temperature is 38.8 C (102 F), blood pressure is 80/40 mm Hg, and pulse is 130/min. The patient is lethargic and disoriented. Her extremities are warm, and her breathing is rapid and shallow. Lungs are clear on auscultation and there are no heart murmurs. There is left costovertebral angle tenderness. The urine in her catheter appears cloudy. Her leukocyte count is elevated with left shift, and urinalysis shows pyuria and bacteriuria.",

    "en": "When observed in the setting of infection, the combination of hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and markedly elevated or decreased body temperature is suggestive of septic shock. Early sepsis is characterized by peripheral vasodilation, a compensatory increase in cardiac output, and warm extremities.\n\nNumerous cytokines are released in sepsis, resulting in widespread SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION. One of the most important mediators of sepsis is TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-ALPHA (TNF-α), an acute-phase cytokine produced by activated macrophages. TNF-α stimulates systemic inflammation via recruitment of additional leukocytes (eg, neutrophils, macrophages) and increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Other cytokines responsible for inducing the systemic inflammatory response in sepsis include IL-1 and IL-6.\n\n(Choice A) IL-3 is a cytokine produced by activated T cells. It stimulates the growth and differentiation of stem cells in the bone marrow.\n\n(Choice B) IL-4 is a cytokine produced by Th2 T-helper cells. It stimulates the growth of B cells and increases the number of Th2 T-helper cells at the site of inflammation.\n\n(Choice C) IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by macrophages and Th2 T-helper cells. IL-10 limits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, interferon-gamma, IL-2, IL-3, TNF-α).\n\n(Choice D) Leukotriene B4 is a metabolite of arachidonic acid. Its main function is to stimulate neutrophil migration to the site of inflammation.\n\n(Choice E) Transforming growth factor-beta is released by macrophages and has anti-inflammatory roles in sepsis, including suppressing the release of IL-1 and TNF-α, and inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation.\n\nEducational objective:\nTumor necrosis factor-alpha is released from activated macrophages and is one of the most important mediators of the systemic inflammatory response in sepsis. Other cytokines responsible for inducing the systemic inflammatory response include IL-1 and IL-6.",
    "zh": "在感染的情况下，低血压、心动过速、呼吸急促以及体温明显升高或降低的组合提示脓毒性休克。早期脓毒症的特征是外周血管舒张、代偿性心输出量增加和四肢温暖。\n\n在脓毒症中，会释放多种细胞因子，导致广泛的全身性炎症。脓毒症最重要的介质之一是肿瘤坏死因子-α（TNF-α），这是一种由活化的巨噬细胞产生的急性期细胞因子。TNF-α通过募集额外的白细胞（例如，中性粒细胞、巨噬细胞）和增加促炎细胞因子的产生来刺激全身炎症。其他导致脓毒症全身炎症反应的细胞因子包括IL-1和IL-6。\n\n（选项A）IL-3是由活化的T细胞产生的细胞因子。它刺激骨髓中干细胞的生长和分化。\n\n（选项B）IL-4是由Th2辅助T细胞产生的细胞因子。它刺激B细胞的生长，并增加炎症部位Th2辅助T细胞的数量。\n\n（选项C）IL-10是由巨噬细胞和Th2辅助T细胞产生的抗炎细胞因子。IL-10限制促炎细胞因子（例如，干扰素-γ、IL-2、IL-3、TNF-α）的产生。\n\n（选项D）白三烯B4是花生四烯酸的代谢产物。它的主要功能是刺激中性粒细胞向炎症部位迁移。\n\n（选项E）转化生长因子-β由巨噬细胞释放，在脓毒症中具有抗炎作用，包括抑制IL-1和TNF-α的释放，并抑制淋巴细胞增殖。\n\n教育目标：\n肿瘤坏死因子-α由活化的巨噬细胞释放，是脓毒症全身炎症反应最重要的介质之一。其他导致全身炎症反应的细胞因子包括IL-1和IL-6。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of sepsis and the role of various cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), in the systemic inflammatory response. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of septic shock and understanding the mechanisms by which cytokines contribute to the condition. \n\nTo solve this question, identify the key features of sepsis in the patient's presentation (fever, hypotension, tachycardia, leukocytosis) and recall the major cytokines involved in the inflammatory cascade. Focus on TNF-α as a primary mediator released by activated macrophages in response to infection.",
