She was recently diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and started on treatment with warfarin. The patient noticed the lesion about a day and a half after starting the medication. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg, and pulse is 88/min and irregularly irregular. Physical examination findings are shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}.\nThe remainder of the skin examination is normal.",

    "en": "This patient was started on warfarin to prevent thromboembolism secondary to atrial fibrillation. The sharply demarcated purpuric lesion likely represents WARFARIN-INDUCED SKIN NECROSIS, a rare complication that results from an excessive decrease in protein C activity; patients with underlying PROTEIN C DEFICIENCY are at increased risk.\n\nProtein C and S are innate anticoagulants that are vitamin K dependent, as are procoagulant factors II, VII, IX, and X. Warfarin inhibits epoxide reductase (responsible for regenerating vitamin K), which leads to decreased levels of these proteins. Factor VII and PROTEIN C are depleted first due to their shorter half-life. The early loss of protein C activity relative to procoagulant factor activity leads to a transient hypercoagulable state that persists until the other procoagulant factors are sufficiently inhibited. In patients with protein C deficiency, this procoagulant state is exaggerated, promoting microvasculature occlusion and hemorrhagic skin necrosis. Underlying protein S deficiency also increases the risk of warfarin-induced skin necrosis, though not to the same extent.\n\nTreatment of warfarin-induced skin necrosis includes discontinuing warfarin and administering fresh frozen plasma or protein C concentrate. The condition may be prevented by the coadministration of heparin during the first several days of warfarin therapy.\n\n(Choice A) Allergic drug reactions are immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions that can have variable cutaneous findings ranging from diffuse erythematous eruptions to extensive blistering and exfoliation (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis); this patient's recent warfarin use and localized skin findings are more suggestive of warfarin-induced skin necrosis.\n\n(Choice B) Antithrombin deficiency can be inherited (autosomal dominant) or acquired (eg, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome) and presents with venous thromboembolism (eg, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and resistance to heparin. Warfarin does not affect antithrombin activity.\n\n(Choice C) Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune phenomenon that causes arterial and venous thrombosis. It can produce skin findings similar to this patient's but would generally be associated with thrombocytopenia and recent heparin use.\n\n(Choice E) Vitamin K deficiency most often occurs in patients with fat malabsorption or those taking broad-spectrum antibiotics. The deficiency increases the inhibitory effect of warfarin on all vitamin K-dependent proteins (both anticoagulant and procoagulant), so it does not alter the relative coagulability balance to encourage warfarin-induced skin necrosis.\n\nEducation objective:\nPatients started on warfarin develop a transient hypercoagulable state due to the short half-life of protein C. This hypercoagulability is further exaggerated by preexisting protein C deficiency and can result in thrombotic occlusion of the microvasculature with skin necrosis. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者开始服用华法林以预防继发于房颤的血栓栓塞。边界清楚的紫癜性病变可能代表华法林诱发的皮肤坏死，这是一种罕见的并发症，是由于蛋白C活性过度降低所致；患有潜在蛋白C缺乏症的患者的风险增加。\n\n蛋白C和S是内源性抗凝血剂，它们与促凝血因子II、VII、IX和X一样，依赖于维生素K。华法林抑制环氧化物还原酶（负责再生维生素K），这会导致这些蛋白质的水平降低。因子VII和蛋白C首先被耗尽，因为它们的半衰期较短。蛋白C活性的早期丧失相对于促凝血因子活性会导致短暂的高凝状态，这种状态会持续存在，直到其他促凝血因子受到充分抑制。在蛋白C缺乏症患者中，这种促凝状态被夸大，促进微血管闭塞和出血性皮肤坏死。潜在的蛋白S缺乏症也会增加华法林诱发皮肤坏死的风险，尽管程度不如蛋白C缺乏症。\n\n华法林诱发皮肤坏死的治疗包括停用华法林并给予新鲜冰冻血浆或蛋白C浓缩物。通过在华法林治疗的最初几天共同使用肝素，可以预防这种情况。\n\n（选项A）药物过敏反应是免疫介导的超敏反应，可有不同的皮肤表现，从弥漫性红斑疹到广泛的起泡和脱屑（例如，Stevens-Johnson综合征/中毒性表皮坏死松解症）；该患者最近使用华法林以及局限性皮肤表现更提示华法林诱发皮肤坏死。\n\n（选项B）抗凝血酶缺乏症可以是遗传性的（常染色体显性遗传），也可以是获得性的（例如，肝硬化、肾病综合征），并表现为静脉血栓栓塞（例如，深静脉血栓形成、肺栓塞）和对肝素的抵抗。华法林不影响抗凝血酶的活性。\n\n（选项C）肝素诱导的血小板减少症是一种自身免疫现象，可引起动脉和静脉血栓形成。它可产生与该患者相似的皮肤表现，但通常与血小板减少症和最近使用肝素有关。\n\n（选项E）维生素K缺乏症最常发生在患有脂肪吸收不良或服用广谱抗生素的患者中。这种缺乏症会增加华法林对所有维生素K依赖性蛋白（抗凝血和促凝血）的抑制作用，因此它不会改变相对的凝血平衡来促进华法林诱发的皮肤坏死。\n\n教育目标：\n开始使用华法林的患者会由于蛋白C的短半衰期而发生短暂的高凝状态。这种高凝性因已存在的蛋白C缺乏症而进一步加剧，并可导致微血管的血栓性闭塞和皮肤坏死。{{exhibit_2}}"
