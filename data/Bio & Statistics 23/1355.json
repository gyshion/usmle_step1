    "en": "Glucose is the major source of energy for all cells of the body. In the majority of tissues, glucose transport along its concentration gradient, from higher concentrations outside the cell toward lower concentrations inside the cell. However, glucose cannot passively diffuse across the cell membrane in any significant amount and requires carrier proteins to aid its crossing. Transport across the cell membrane by carrier proteins (which undergo conformational changes as the substrate is transported, unlike channel proteins) is termed CARRIER-MEDIATED TRANSPORT. Transport that is facilitated by transmembrane proteins without the expenditure of energy is called FACILITATED DIFFUSION. Transmembrane carrier proteins that belong to the GLUT family transport glucose by facilitated diffusion. These proteins are stereoselective and preferentially catalyze the entrance of D-glucose rather than L-glucose into cells. GLUT4 is the insulin-sensitive transporter found in skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes. In these cells, the GLUT4 protein is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles. Under the influence of insulin, the transporter protein is incorporated into the cell membrane. An increased number of transporters in the membrane leads to an increased rate of glucose uptake by the cells. Another important glucose transporter is GLUT2. It facilitates export of glucose from the liver, small intestine, and kidneys into the circulation and also helps to control insulin secretion in the pancreas.",
    "zh": "葡萄糖是身体所有细胞的主要能量来源。在大多数组织中，葡萄糖沿着其浓度梯度转运，从细胞外较高浓度向细胞内较低浓度移动。然而，葡萄糖不能以任何显着量被动扩散穿过细胞膜，需要载体蛋白来帮助其穿过。通过载体蛋白（在转运底物时会发生构象变化，这与通道蛋白不同）跨细胞膜的转运称为载体介导的转运。通过跨膜蛋白促进且不消耗能量的转运称为易化扩散。属于GLUT家族的跨膜载体蛋白通过易化扩散转运葡萄糖。这些蛋白质具有立体选择性，并且优先催化D-葡萄糖而不是L-葡萄糖进入细胞。GLUT4是存在于骨骼肌细胞和脂肪细胞中的胰岛素敏感转运蛋白。在这些细胞中，GLUT4蛋白储存在细胞质囊泡中。在胰岛素的影响下，转运蛋白被整合到细胞膜中。膜中转运蛋白数量的增加导致细胞吸收葡萄糖的速度加快。另一个重要的葡萄糖转运蛋白是GLUT2。它促进葡萄糖从肝脏、小肠和肾脏输出到循环系统中，也有助于控制胰腺中的胰岛素分泌。"
