    "en": "A 75-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to problems with vision and right-sided hemisensory loss that started an hour ago. While in the emergency department, his symptoms gradually worsen and he develops a headache. Head CT reveals multiple, small lobar hemorrhages of varying ages in the occipital and parietal areas with a medium-size acute bleed in the left parietooccipital lobe. Two years ago, the patient developed sudden right arm weakness; neuroimaging at that time demonstrated a small left frontal lobe hemorrhage. He has no head trauma and does not use anticoagulants. This patient most likely suffers from which of the following?",

    "en": "This elderly patient likely has recurrent lobar hemorrhage due to CEREBRAL AMYLOID ANGIOPATHY. Amyloid angiopathy is a consequence of β-amyloid deposition in the walls of small- to medium-sized cerebral arteries, resulting in vessel wall weakening and predisposition to rupture. The disease is not associated with systemic amyloidoses; rather, the amyloidogenic proteins are usually the same as those seen in Alzheimer disease. Amyloid angiopathy is the most common cause of spontaneous LOBAR HEMORRHAGE, particularly in adults age >60. Hemorrhage tends to be recurrent and most often involves the occipital and parietal lobes. Occipital lobe hemorrhage is typically associated with homonymous HEMIANOPSIA; parietal hemorrhage can cause contralateral hemisensory loss. Frontal lobe hemorrhage is less common but may present with contralateral hemiparesis.\n\n(Choice A) Brain arteriovenous malformation is the most common cause of intracranial hemorrhage in children and tends to be a single lesion. This patient's older age and multifocal hemorrhages make the diagnosis less likely.\n(Choices B and C) Carotid artery atherosclerosis and cardiac embolism may cause acute ischemic stroke, which typically presents with sudden neurologic deficits that are maximal at symptom onset. Embolic stroke can present with multiple infarcts involving the cerebral cortex and has a higher likelihood of spontaneous hemorrhagic transformation. However, hemorrhagic transformation would be rare within hours of symptom onset. In addition, this patient's gradually worsening symptoms are more consistent with hemorrhagic stroke.\n(Choice E) Charcot-Bouchard aneurysm rupture is usually due to chronic hypertension and typically causes hemorrhage involving deep brain structures (eg, basal ganglia, cerebellar nuclei, thalamus, pons). This patient's recurrent lobar hemorrhages make this less likely.\n(Choice F) Hypertensive encephalopathy is characterized by PROGRESSIVE headache and nausea/vomiting followed by nonfocal neurologic symptoms (eg, confusion). This patient's focal neurologic deficits and evidence of hemorrhage on neuroimaging exclude this diagnosis.\n(Choice G) Hypoxic encephalopathy occurs from global interruption of the cerebral blood supply (eg, due to cardiac arrest). It most often presents with decreased consciousness (eg, coma, vegetative state) as opposed to focal neurologic deficits with lobar hemorrhage.\n(Choice H) Saccular aneurysm rupture is typically associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage as opposed to intraparenchymal hematoma. Patients usually have an abrupt onset of severe headache (thunderclap headache), and focal neurologic deficits are less common. On CT, subarachnoid hemorrhage appears as hyperattenuation of the sulci and basal cisterns.\n\nEducational objective:\nCerebral amyloid angiopathy is the most common cause of spontaneous lobar hemorrhage, particularly in the elderly. The most common sites of hemorrhage include the occipital and parietal lobes.",
    "zh": "这位老年患者很可能因脑淀粉样血管病而发生复发性叶出血。淀粉样血管病是β-淀粉样蛋白沉积于中小脑动脉壁的结果，导致血管壁变弱，易于破裂。该病与全身性淀粉样变性无关；相反，淀粉样蛋白原性蛋白通常与阿尔茨海默病中见到的相同。淀粉样血管病是自发性叶出血最常见的原因，尤其是在60岁以上的成年人中。出血往往是复发性的，最常累及枕叶和顶叶。枕叶出血通常与同侧偏盲有关；顶叶出血可引起对侧半身感觉缺失。额叶出血较少见，但可能表现为对侧轻偏瘫。\n\n（选项 A）脑动静脉畸形是儿童颅内出血最常见的原因，并且往往是单个病灶。该患者的年龄较大和多灶性出血使该诊断不太可能。\n（选项 B 和 C）颈动脉粥样硬化和心脏栓塞可导致急性缺血性卒中，其典型表现为症状出现时达到峰值的突然神经功能缺损。栓塞性卒中可表现为涉及大脑皮层的多发梗死，并且自发性出血转化的可能性更高。然而，出血转化在症状出现后数小时内是罕见的。此外，该患者的症状逐渐恶化更符合出血性卒中。\n（选项 E）Charcot-Bouchard 动脉瘤破裂通常是由于慢性高血压引起的，并且通常导致涉及深部脑结构（例如，基底神经节、小脑核、丘脑、脑桥）的出血。该患者的复发性叶出血使这种可能性降低。\n（选项 F）高血压脑病的特征是进行性头痛和恶心/呕吐，然后是非局灶性神经系统症状（例如，意识模糊）。该患者的局灶性神经功能缺损和神经影像学检查的出血证据排除了该诊断。\n（选项 G）缺氧性脑病由大脑供血的整体中断引起（例如，由于心脏骤停）。它最常表现为意识水平下降（例如，昏迷、植物人状态），而不是叶出血伴有局灶性神经功能缺损。\n（选项 H）囊性动脉瘤破裂通常与蛛网膜下腔出血相关，而不是脑实质内血肿。患者通常突然出现剧烈头痛（雷击样头痛），并且局灶性神经功能缺损不太常见。在 CT 上，蛛网膜下腔出血表现为脑沟和基底池的高密度。\n\n教育目标：\n脑淀粉样血管病是自发性叶出血最常见的原因，尤其是在老年人中。最常见的出血部位包括枕叶和顶叶。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the etiology of lobar hemorrhages in elderly patients, specifically differentiating between various causes of intracranial bleeding. It requires integrating patient demographics, clinical presentation, and neuroimaging findings to arrive at the most likely diagnosis.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully reviewing the patient's history, including age, onset and progression of symptoms, and past neurological events. Neuroimaging findings, particularly the location and characteristics of the hemorrhage, are crucial. The differential diagnosis should then be narrowed down by considering the typical presentations and risk factors associated with each option.",
