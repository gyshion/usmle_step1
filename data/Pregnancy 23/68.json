  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Classically, cholelithiasis (gallstone disease) is most common in those who are \"fat, fertile, female, and forty.\" The gallstones are formed by the aggregation of bile constituents and are categorized as cholesterol stones, pigment stones, or mixed stones.\n\nPregnancy and the usage of oral contraceptives predispose to gallstone formation, with 5-12% of all women developing gallstones during pregnancy. Estrogenic influence increases cholesterol synthesis by upregulating hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity, which causes the bile to become supersaturated with cholesterol. Progesterone reduces bile acid secretion and slows gallbladder emptying. When the gallbladder is hypomotile or there is more cholesterol than bile salts, the cholesterol precipitates into insoluble crystals that eventually form to make gallstones.\n\n(Choices A, B, C, and D) Cholelithiasis is not secondary to water reabsorption from bile or to the hypersecretion of phospholipids, sodium, bile acids, or bilirubin. Moreover, it is the progesterone-induced gallbladder hypomotility - not hypermotility - that increases the likelihood of developing gallstones.\n\nEducational Objective:\nEstrogen-induced cholesterol hypersecretion and progesterone-induced gallbladder hypomotility are responsible for the increased incidence of cholelithiasis in women who are pregnant or using oral contraceptives.",
    "zh": "经典情况下，胆石症（胆结石病）最常见于“肥胖、生育、女性、四十岁”的人群。 胆结石由胆汁成分聚集形成，分为胆固醇结石、色素结石或混合结石。\n\n怀孕和口服避孕药的使用容易导致胆结石的形成，所有女性中，有5-12% 在怀孕期间发生胆结石。 雌激素的影响通过上调肝脏 HMG-CoA 还原酶活性来增加胆固醇合成，这会导致胆汁变得胆固醇过饱和。 孕酮会减少胆汁酸分泌并减慢胆囊排空。 当胆囊蠕动减弱或胆固醇多于胆盐时，胆固醇会沉淀成不溶性晶体，最终形成胆结石。\n\n（选项 A、B、C 和 D）胆石症并非继发于胆汁中的水重吸收，也不是继发于磷脂、钠、胆汁酸或胆红素的过度分泌。 此外，增加患胆结石可能性的是孕酮诱导的胆囊蠕动减弱——而不是过度蠕动。\n\n教育目标：\n雌激素诱导的胆固醇过度分泌和孕酮诱导的胆囊蠕动减弱是导致孕妇或服用口服避孕药的女性胆石症发病率增加的原因。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology of gallstone formation, specifically in the context of pregnancy. It requires knowledge of how hormonal changes during pregnancy affect bile composition and gallbladder function.\n\nTo solve this question, one should recall the risk factors for gallstone formation and the specific hormonal influences of estrogen and progesterone on cholesterol metabolism and gallbladder motility during pregnancy. The correct answer integrates these two key pathophysiological mechanisms.",
    "zh": "本题考察对胆结石形成的病理生理学的理解，特别是在妊娠的背景下。 需要了解妊娠期间的激素变化如何影响胆汁成分和胆囊功能。\n\n要解决这个问题，应该回忆胆结石形成的风险因素以及雌激素和孕酮对妊娠期间胆固醇代谢和胆囊动力的具体激素影响。 正确答案整合了这两个关键的病理生理机制。"
