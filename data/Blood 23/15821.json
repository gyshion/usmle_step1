    "en": "A 70-year-old man develops progressive fatigue and easy bruising. He has had unintentional weight loss and episodic fevers. Physical examination shows splenomegaly and enlarged lymph nodes in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions. Complete blood count reveals anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis. Peripheral blood smear shows an increased number of small, mature-appearing, abnormal lymphocytes, which express CD20 and kappa light chains. During treatment, the patient receives an agent that directly binds and inhibits BCL-2 protein.",

    "en": "This patient's lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and increased number of mature lymphocytes in the blood that express B-cell markers (CD20+, kappa light chains) indicate CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (CLL). This disease is characterized by the progressive accumulation of MATURE B cells in hematopoietic tissues (leading to anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly) and peripheral blood (leading to leukocytosis) due to genetic mutations that lengthen B-cell survival.\n\nIn most cases of CLL, B-cell survival is promoted by the overexpression of BCL-2 on the mitochondrial membrane. BCL-2 is an antiapoptotic protein that prevents stress signals from triggering the intrinsic apoptotic cascade, which is mediated by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and the subsequent activation of caspases. Treatment of CLL with BCL-2 inhibitors (eg, venetoclax) makes tumor cells more sensitive to stress signals (eg, chemotherapy) by increasing the activation of caspases, which leads to cell death.\n\n(Choice A) Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor that prevents the destruction of ubiquinated intracellular proteins, can be used against neoplasms that generate excessive amounts of protein (eg, multiple myeloma).\n\n(Choice B) Because cancer cells produce new antigens (neoantigens) not seen in normal cells, they generally have mutations that allow them to evade cytotoxic T-cell detection. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as antibodies against PD-1 (eg, pembrolizumab) or CTLA-4, prevent cancer cells from evading cytotoxic T-cell detection.\n\n(Choice D) Olaparib inhibits poly-ADP ribose polymerase, the enzyme that mediates the repair of single-strand DNA breaks. It is often used to treat breast, ovarian, or prostate cancer in individuals with BRCA mutations.\n\n(Choice E) Many forms of chemotherapy target rapidly dividing cells by inhibiting DNA replication during S phase (eg, purine analogs). BCL-2 does not mediate DNA replication or repair.\n\n(Choice F) Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against the B-cell surface marker CD20. Although it is often used for CLL, it mediates cell death by binding to the B-cell surface (antibody-mediated cytotoxicity).\n\nEducational objective:\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia is associated with overexpression of BCL-2, an anti-apoptotic protein, on the mitochondrial membrane. Treatment with a BCL inhibitor causes cancer cell death by promoting cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, which subsequently activates caspases.",
    "zh": "该患者的淋巴结肿大、脾肿大和血液中表达B细胞标志物（CD20+，κ轻链）的成熟淋巴细胞数量增加，提示慢性淋巴细胞白血病（CLL）。这种疾病的特征是造血组织中成熟B细胞的进行性积累（导致贫血、血小板减少症、淋巴结肿大和脾肿大）和外周血中（导致白细胞增多），这是由于延长B细胞存活的基因突变所致。\n\n在大多数CLL病例中，B细胞的存活由线粒体膜上BCL-2的过度表达促进。BCL-2是一种抗凋亡蛋白，可防止应激信号触发内在凋亡级联反应，该反应由细胞色素c从线粒体释放以及随后半胱天冬酶的激活介导。用BCL-2抑制剂（例如，维奈托克）治疗CLL可使肿瘤细胞对应激信号（例如，化疗）更敏感，这是通过增加半胱天冬酶的激活，从而导致细胞死亡。\n\n（选项A）硼替佐米是一种蛋白酶体抑制剂，可阻止泛素化细胞内蛋白的破坏，可用于治疗产生过量蛋白质的肿瘤（例如，多发性骨髓瘤）。\n\n（选项B）由于癌细胞产生正常细胞中未见的新抗原（新抗原），它们通常具有使其能够逃避细胞毒性T细胞检测的突变。免疫检查点抑制剂，例如针对PD-1（例如，帕博利珠单抗）或CTLA-4的抗体，可防止癌细胞逃避细胞毒性T细胞的检测。\n\n（选项D）奥拉帕利抑制聚ADP核糖聚合酶，这是一种介导单链DNA断裂修复的酶。它通常用于治疗BRCA突变的个体的乳腺癌、卵巢癌或前列腺癌。\n\n（选项E）许多形式的化疗通过抑制S期的DNA复制来靶向快速分裂的细胞（例如，嘌呤类似物）。BCL-2不介导DNA复制或修复。\n\n（选项F）利妥昔单抗是一种针对B细胞表面标志物CD20的单克抗体。尽管它经常用于CLL，但它通过与B细胞表面结合来介导细胞死亡（抗体介导的细胞毒性）。\n\n教学目标：\n慢性淋巴细胞白血病与线粒体膜上抗凋亡蛋白BCL-2的过度表达有关。用BCL抑制剂治疗通过促进细胞色素c从线粒体释放而导致癌细胞死亡，随后激活半胱天冬酶。"
