    "en": "A 69-year-old woman comes to the office due to memory concerns. The patient first began having difficulties with her memory a year ago, and her symptoms have steadily worsened. She often forgets the content of conversations she has with her son and frequently walks to another room, only to forget what she went there to do. The patient lives alone and has no difficulty cooking, cleaning, or otherwise caring for herself. She manages her own finances. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Temperature is 36.9 C (98.4 F), blood pressure is 132/83 mm Hg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 14/min. The patient is alert and oriented. Neurological examination reveals no focal deficits. She scores 22/30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.",

    "en": "This patient's mild memory impairment, abnormal Montreal Cognitive Assessment score (<26/30) and ability to function independently are consistent with MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, also known as mild neurocognitive disorder. MCI is diagnosed when there is objective evidence of cognitive deficits that do not interfere with activities of daily living (ADLs) (eg, bathing, preparing meals, managing finances). In contrast, a diagnosis of DEMENTIA, also known as major neurocognitive disorder, requires the presence of progressive cognitive deficits that impair ADLs.\nMCI is common in older age, with >10% of patients age >70 meeting criteria. Patients with subjective memory concerns should be evaluated objectively through cognitive testing because certain memory issues (eg, difficulty remembering names, decreased processing speed) may represent normative age-related cognitive changes. When evaluating for MCI, it is important to rule out reversible causes of cognitive impairment such as depression-related cognitive impairment, hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, impaired sleep (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and adverse effects of pharmacotherapy (eg, benzodiazepines).\n(Choices A, C, and F) This patient does not meet criteria for dementia (ie, progressive cognitive deficit that impairs ADLs). Alzheimer disease presents with early and prominent memory impairment. Frontotemporal dementia presents with personality and behavioral changes. Vascular dementia is characterized by focal neurological deficits and evidence of cerebrovascular disease on imaging.\n(Choice B) Although depression may be associated with reversible cognitive impairment, this patient does not meet criteria for major depressive disorder.\n(Choice E) Although mild memory issues may be a part of normal aging (eg, difficulty remembering names, decreased processing speed), this patient's objective evidence of cognitive impairment on formal cognitive testing is not normal and requires further evaluation.\nEducational objective:\nMild cognitive impairment is diagnosed when cognitive decline is present but activities of daily living (eg, bathing, preparing meals, managing finances) are preserved. In contrast, dementia is diagnosed when cognitive decline interferes with activities of daily living.",
    "zh": "该患者的轻度记忆障碍、异常的蒙特利尔认知评估评分（<26/30）以及独立的功能能力与轻度认知障碍（MCI，也称为轻度神经认知障碍）一致。当存在不干扰日常生活活动（ADLs，例如，洗澡、准备饭菜、管理财务）的客观认知缺陷证据时，即可诊断为MCI。相比之下，痴呆，也称为重度神经认知障碍，需要存在影响ADLs的进行性认知缺陷。\nMCI在老年人中很常见，超过10%的70岁以上患者符合标准。对于主观记忆问题的患者，应通过认知测试进行客观评估，因为某些记忆问题（例如，难以记住名字、处理速度下降）可能代表与年龄相关的正常认知变化。当评估MCI时，重要的是要排除可逆性认知障碍的原因，例如抑郁症相关的认知障碍、甲状腺功能减退症、维生素B12缺乏症、睡眠障碍（例如，阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停）和药物治疗的不良反应（例如，苯二氮卓类药物）。\n（选项A、C和F）该患者不符合痴呆的标准（即，影响ADLs的进行性认知缺陷）。阿尔茨海默病表现为早期和突出的记忆障碍。额颞叶痴呆表现为性格和行为改变。血管性痴呆的特征是局灶性神经功能缺损和影像学上脑血管疾病的证据。\n（选项B）尽管抑郁症可能与可逆性认知障碍相关，但该患者不符合重度抑郁症的标准。\n（选项E）尽管轻微的记忆问题可能是正常衰老的一部分（例如，难以记住名字、处理速度下降），但该患者在正式认知测试中客观的认知障碍证据并不正常，需要进一步评估。\n教育目标：\n当存在认知能力下降，但日常生活活动（例如，洗澡、准备饭菜、管理财务）得以保留时，即可诊断为轻度认知障碍。相比之下，当认知能力下降干扰日常生活活动时，诊断为痴呆。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its differentiation from normal aging, depression-related cognitive impairment, and various forms of dementia. It emphasizes the key distinction that MCI involves objective cognitive deficits that do not significantly impair activities of daily living.\nTo solve this question, one must carefully evaluate the patient's reported symptoms, objective cognitive assessment scores (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), and functional status. The absence of significant impairment in activities of daily living, despite objective cognitive deficits, is the hallmark of MCI and helps differentiate it from dementia.",
