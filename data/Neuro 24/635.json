He was watching television when his arm \"threw the remote control across the room.\" His past medical history is significant for long-standing hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The patient does not use alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. Physical examination shows wild, large-amplitude, flinging movements affecting the proximal muscles of his right arm. {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The subthalamic nucleus is a lens-shaped structure located ventral (inferior) to the thalamus, dorsal (superior) to the substantia nigra, and medial to the internal capsule. It is a component of the basal ganglia and plays an important role in the modulation of basal ganglia output. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nDamage to the subthalamic nucleus can decrease excitation of the globus pallidus internus, thereby reducing inhibition of the thalamus. This may result in contralateral HEMIBALLISM, a movement disorder characterized by wild, involuntary, large-amplitude, flinging movements involving the proximal limbs (eg, arm and/or leg) on one side of the body. This most commonly occurs in the setting of LACUNAR STROKE, which is often a consequence of long-standing hypertension and diabetes mellitus.\n\n(Choice A) Atrophy of the caudate nucleus occurs in Huntington disease, which is characterized by the insidious onset of chorea (involuntary, low-amplitude movements involving the distal limbs), dementia, and behavioral abnormalities.\n\n(Choice B) Damage to the internal capsule may occur with lacunar infarcts, but patients typically have contralateral pure motor or combined sensorimotor deficits.\n\n(Choice C) Atrophy of the lentiform nucleus (eg, globus pallidus and putamen) occurs in Wilson disease (hepatolenticular degeneration), which is characterized by liver (eg, hepatitis, cirrhosis), psychiatric (eg, depression, personality changes), and neurologic (eg, dysarthria, movement disorder) abnormalities.\n\n(Choice D) Degeneration of the substantia nigra occurs in Parkinson disease, which is characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor.\n\n(Choice F) Lacunar stroke involving the ventral posterior lateral nucleus and ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus typically results in complete contralateral sensory loss. Damage to the thalamus may also cause thalamic syndrome, characterized by contralateral burning or stabbing pain over one side of the body.",
    "zh": "丘脑底核是一个透镜状结构，位于丘脑腹侧（下方）、黑质背侧（上方）和内囊内侧。它是基底神经节的一部分，在调节基底神经节输出中起重要作用。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n丘脑底核损伤可降低苍白球内侧部的兴奋，从而减少对丘脑的抑制。这可能导致对侧偏身投掷症，这是一种以肢体近端（例如，手臂和/或腿）一侧出现剧烈、不自主、大幅度投掷样运动为特征的运动障碍。这种情况最常发生在腔隙性卒中，这通常是长期高血压和糖尿病的后果。\n\n（选项 A）亨廷顿病中发生尾状核萎缩，其特征是逐渐出现舞蹈症（涉及远端肢体的不自主、小幅度运动）、痴呆和行为异常。\n\n（选项 B）内囊损伤可能发生在腔隙性梗死中，但患者通常具有对侧纯运动或感觉运动复合体缺陷。\n\n（选项 C）威尔逊病（肝豆状核变性）中发生豆状核（例如，苍白球和壳核）萎缩，其特征是肝脏（例如，肝炎、肝硬化）、精神病（例如，抑郁症、人格改变）和神经系统（例如，构音障碍、运动障碍）异常。\n\n（选项 D）帕金森病中发生黑质变性，其特征是运动迟缓、僵硬和静止性震颤。\n\n（选项 F）涉及丘脑腹后外侧核和丘脑腹后内侧核的腔隙性卒中通常导致完全对侧感觉缺失。丘脑损伤也可能导致丘脑综合征，其特征是在身体一侧出现对侧烧灼样或刺痛样疼痛。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the basal ganglia and the clinical presentation of hemiballism, specifically its association with subthalamic nucleus lesions. It also requires understanding the common etiology of such lesions, particularly lacunar strokes in patients with hypertension and diabetes.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the characteristic flinging movements of hemiballism and associating them with the subthalamic nucleus. Additionally, considering the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes should lead to the consideration of lacunar stroke as the underlying cause.",
