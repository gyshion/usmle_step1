  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Many progressive neurologic diseases may be associated with cystic degeneration of the putamen, but Wilson's disease is the most likely of these to be emphasized on the USMLE.\n\nThe putamen (Choice B) can be identified on coronal sections (either in gross specimens as above or on imaging studies) in a location immediately deep (medial) to the insula and lateral to the globus pallidus and internal capsule.\n\n(Choice A) The globus pallidus is the orange-colored structure on the above image immediately medial to the degenerated putamen. It is considered part of the basal ganglia along with the caudate and putamen.\n\n(Choice C) The internal capsule is the white matter structure that separates the globus pallidus and putamen from the caudate nucleus anteriorly and from the thalamus posteriorly on coronal sections.\n\n(Choice D) In its full three dimensional structure, the caudate nucleus is a curved or \"C-shaped\" structure that can be identified in the inferolateral walls of the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles. However, only a small cross-section is visible in the image above next to the lateral ventricles. This structure is affected in HUNTINGTON'S disease.\n\n(Choice E) The amygdala is a group of neurons in the medial temporal lobe located adjacent to the hippocampus that plays a role in the limbic system. The amygdala can be identified on the image above as the circular grey matter structures in the medial temporal lobe immediately inferior to the globus pallidus and putamen. The amygdala mediates fear and some sympathetic stimulation in humans.\n\nEducational Objective:\nWilson's disease can cause cystic degeneration of the putamen as well as damage to other basal ganglia structures. The putamen is located medial to the insula and lateral to the globus pallidus on coronal sections.",
    "zh": "许多进行性神经系统疾病可能与壳核的囊性变性有关，但威尔逊病最有可能在 USMLE 中被强调。\n\n壳核（选项 B）可以在冠状切面（如上图中的大体标本或影像学研究）中被识别出来，其位置紧靠（内侧）于岛叶深处，并位于苍白球和内囊的外侧。\n\n（选项 A）苍白球是上图中位于变性壳核正内侧的橙色结构。它与尾状核和壳核一起被认为是基底神经节的一部分。\n\n（选项 C）内囊是将苍白球和壳核与尾状核从前方分开，并与丘脑从后方分开的白质结构。\n\n（选项 D）在其完整的三维结构中，尾状核是一个弯曲或“C 形”结构，可以在侧脑室前角的下外侧壁中被识别出来。然而，在上图中，只有一小部分横截面可见于侧脑室旁边。该结构受到亨廷顿氏病的影响。\n\n（选项 E）杏仁核是位于内侧颞叶的一组神经元，与海马体相邻，在边缘系统中起作用。杏仁核可以在上图中被识别出来，作为内侧颞叶中位于苍白球和壳核正下方的圆形灰质结构。杏仁核调节人类的恐惧和一些交感神经刺激。\n\n教育目标：\n威尔逊病可导致壳核囊性变性以及对其他基底神经节结构的损害。壳核位于冠状切面上的岛叶内侧，苍白球外侧。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of brain anatomy, specifically the location and identification of the putamen and other basal ganglia structures on a coronal section. It also touches on the pathology of Wilson's disease and its association with putaminal degeneration.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully analyze the brain section and identify the structure indicated by the arrow. Use your knowledge of anatomical relationships to differentiate the putamen from other nearby structures like the globus pallidus, internal capsule, caudate nucleus, and amygdala.",
    "zh": "此题考察对脑部解剖结构的认识，特别是冠状切面上壳核和其他基底神经节结构的位置和识别。它还涉及威尔逊病的病理学及其与壳核变性的关系。\n\n要解决此问题，请仔细分析脑部切片并识别箭头所指示的结构。利用你对解剖关系的了解，将壳核与其他附近的结构（如苍白球、内囊、尾状核和杏仁核）区分开来。"
