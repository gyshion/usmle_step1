    "en": "A 45-year-old quadriplegic man with suspected bacterial pneumonia is admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous antibiotics. Over the next 24 hours, he develops progressive respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Prior to intubation, a skeletal muscle relaxant is administered and the patient subsequently goes into cardiac arrest. His attached cardiac monitor shows ventricular fibrillation. While he is being resuscitated, his serum potassium level is drawn and later comes back as 9.5 mEq/L.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agent that, like acetylcholine, attaches to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and depolarizes the neuromuscular end plate. Unlike acetylcholine, succinylcholine is not degraded by acetylcholinesterase, resulting in continuous stimulation of the end plate (reflected by initial transient fasciculations). However, the sodium channels surrounding the end plate rapidly become inactivated and cannot reopen until the end plate is repolarized. Thus, succinylcholine-induced depolarization remains isolated to the end plate, resulting in development of a flaccid paralysis (phase 1 block). Eventually, with continued administration of succinylcholine, the continuous depolarization of the end plate gives way to gradual repolarization as the nAChR becomes desensitized to the effects of succinylcholine. This is termed phase II block and is similar to non-depolarizing blockade.\n\nBecause the nAChR is a nonselective cation channel, its opening not only allows sodium influx but also potassium release. Exaggerated hyperkalemia and life-threatening arrhythmias can occur in patients with crush or burn injuries, denervating injuries or diseases (eg, quadriplegia and Guillain-Barré syndrome), and myopathies. These pathologic states cause up-regulation of muscle nAChRs and/or rhabdomyolysis, which can result in the release of large amounts of potassium when succinylcholine is administered. In these patients, non-depolarizing agents such as vecuronium or rocuronium are better choices (Choice E).\n\n(Choice A) The nondepolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agent atracurium releases histamine and can produce a fall in blood pressure, flushing, and bronchoconstriction. It is also metabolized to laudanosine, which can provoke seizures.\n\n(Choice B) Baclofen is a muscle relaxant that affects GABAB receptors at the level of the spinal cord.\n\n(Choice C) Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant effective in malignant hyperthermia. It acts on ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum and prevents release of calcium into the cytoplasm of muscle fibers.\n\nEducational objective: Succinylcholine can cause significant muscle release and life-threatening arrhythmias in patients at high risk for hyperkalemia, including those with burns, myopathies, crush injuries, and denervating injuries or disease.",
    "zh": "琥珀酰胆碱是一种去极化神经肌肉阻滞剂，与乙酰胆碱一样，它与烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体（nAChR）结合并使神经肌肉终板去极化。与乙酰胆碱不同，琥珀酰胆碱不被乙酰胆碱酯酶降解，导致终板持续刺激（最初的短暂肌束震颤）。然而，围绕终板的钠离子通道迅速失活，并且在终板复极化之前无法重新开放。因此，琥珀酰胆碱诱导的去极化仍然局限于终板，导致出现弛缓性麻痹（I期阻滞）。最终，随着琥珀酰胆碱的持续给药，终板的持续去极化会让位于逐渐复极化，因为nAChR对琥珀酰胆碱的作用变得不敏感。这被称为II期阻滞，类似于非去极化阻滞。\n\n由于nAChR是非选择性阳离子通道，它的开放不仅允许钠离子内流，还允许钾离子释放。在患有挤压或烧伤、神经支配损伤或疾病（例如，四肢瘫痪和格林-巴利综合征）以及肌病的患者中，可能会发生过度高钾血症和危及生命的arrhythmias。这些病理状态会导致肌肉nAChR的上调和/或横纹肌溶解，这会导致在琥珀酰胆碱给药时释放大量钾。在这些患者中，非去极化药物如维库溴铵或罗库溴铵是更好的选择（选项E）。\n\n（选项A）非去极化神经肌肉阻滞剂阿曲库铵释放组胺，可引起血压下降、潮红和支气管收缩。它也会代谢为拉丹宁，可诱发癫痫发作。\n\n（选项B）巴氯芬是一种肌肉松弛剂，影响脊髓水平的GABAB受体。\n\n（选项C）丹曲林是一种对恶性高热有效的肌肉松弛剂。它作用于肌浆网上的ryanodine受体，并阻止钙释放到肌纤维的细胞质中。\n\n教学目标：琥珀酰胆碱可在高危高钾血症患者中引起显着的肌肉释放和危及生命的arrhythmias，包括那些患有烧伤、肌病、挤压伤以及神经支配损伤或疾病的患者。"
