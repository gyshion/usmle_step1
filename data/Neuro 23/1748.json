    "en": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department after injuring his right knee in a bicycle accident. Physical examination shows a swollen right knee with abrasion of the overlying skin. Distal motor and sensory innervation is intact, and popliteal and pedal pulses are normal. No other significant trauma is noted. X-ray reveals a nondisplaced patellar fracture. The patient is referred to orthopedics and placed in a leg cylinder cast. On follow-up a week after cast placement, he has paresthesia and numbness of the dorsum of the right foot with weakness in foot dorsiflexion and eversion. Which of the following is the most likely site of nerve compression in this patient? {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}",

    "en": "This patient's dorsal foot numbness and weakness of foot dorsiflexion and eversion are due to compression of the common fibular (peroneal) nerve by his cast. The common fibular nerve originates in the popliteal fossa as the lateral branch of the sciatic nerve. After coursing around the posterolateral head and lateral neck of the fibula, it divides into superficial and deep branches:\n\n*   The superficial branch innervates the muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg (foot eversion) and provides sensation to the dorsum of the foot and lateral shin.\n*   The deep branch innervates the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg (foot and toe dorsiflexion) and provides sensation to the web space between the first and second toes.\n\nCommon fibular nerve injury from extrinsic compression (eg, pressure from cast, surgical positioning) most commonly occurs at the fibular head because of its bony prominence and the superficial position of the nerve. Fracture of the fibular neck (weakest point of the proximal fibula) is another common cause of common fibular nerve injury.\n\n(choices a",
    "zh": "该患者的足背麻木和足背屈及外翻无力是由于石膏压迫腓总（腓骨）神经所致。腓总神经起于腘窝，是坐骨神经的侧支。在绕过腓骨后外侧头和腓骨颈外侧后，它分为浅支和深支：\n\n*   浅支支配小腿外侧室的肌肉（足外翻），并向足背和胫骨外侧提供感觉。\n*   深支支配小腿前室的肌肉（足和足趾背屈），并向第一和第二足趾之间的蹼状空间提供感觉。\n\n腓总神经因外部压迫（例如，石膏的压力、手术体位）引起的损伤最常发生在腓骨头，因为其骨性突出和神经的浅表位置。腓骨颈骨折（腓骨近端的薄弱点）是腓总神经损伤的另一个常见原因。\n\n（选项 a"
