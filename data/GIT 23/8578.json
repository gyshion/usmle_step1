    "en": "A 54-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis is brought to the emergency department by his wife, who found him agitated and confused. She reports that he was nauseous and vomited bright red blood several times yesterday. His cirrhosis is secondary to chronic hepatitis C infection, and he has received treatment for esophageal varices in the past. Physical examination reveals abdominal distension, decreased liver span, and testicular atrophy. A jerky, irregular flexion-extension tremor involving his hands is seen with wrist extension.",

    "en": "This patient has hepatic encephalopathy, likely due to his recent gastrointestinal bleeding causing a corresponding increase in nitrogen absorption by the gut. The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is related to increased circulatory levels of AMMONIA and other neurotoxins due to failure of the liver to metabolize waste products. Under normal conditions, astrocytes regulate neurotransmission by taking up glutamate present in the synapse, preventing excessive neuronal excitation. Through the action of glutamine synthetase, glutamate undergoes a condensation reaction with ammonia to form glutamine (a non-neuroactive compound). Glutamine is then released by the astrocytes and taken up by neurons, where it is converted back to glutamate for use as a neurotransmitter (glutamate-glutamine cycle).\n\nWhen excess ammonia is present in the blood, it crosses the blood-brain barrier and is taken up by astrocytes, increasing glutamine production. The presence of excess glutamine within astrocytes leads to increased intracellular osmolarity, causing astrocyte swelling and impaired glutamine release. Hyperammonemia consequently decreases the amount of glutamine available for conversion to glutamate in neurons, resulting in disruption of excitatory neurotransmission. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) α-ketoglutarate functions as a key intermediate in the TCA cycle and as a nitrogen transporter in metabolic reactions. In the setting of hyperammonemia, ammonia is detoxified to glutamate via glutamate dehydrogenase, depleting α-ketoglutarate and impairing energy metabolism in the brain.\n\n(Choice B) Alanine is an amino group transporter in the glucose-alanine cycle in liver and muscle tissue. This process allows tissues that use amino acids for fuel to shunt excess nitrogen back to the liver.\n\n(Choice C) Aspartate is a nonessential amino acid that functions as a substrate in the urea cycle and as part of the malate-aspartate shuttle that transfers cytosolic-reducing equivalents into the mitochondrial matrix.\n\n(Choice D) Carbamoyl phosphate is a urea cycle intermediate synthesized by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, which transfers an ammonia molecule from glutamine or glutamate to a phosphorylated bicarbonate. Carbamoyl phosphate production is decreased in patients with advanced liver disease.\n\nEducational objective:\nHyperammonemia in advanced liver failure occurs as a direct result of the cirrhotic liver's inability to metabolize nitrogenous waste products. Ammonia crosses the blood-brain barrier and causes excess glutamine to accumulate within astrocytes. This decreases the amount of glutamine available for conversion to glutamate in the neurons, resulting in disruption of excitatory neurotransmission.",
    "zh": "该患者患有肝性脑病，这很可能与他最近的胃肠道出血有关，导致肠道对氮的吸收相应增加。肝性脑病的病理生理学与氨和其他神经毒素的循环水平升高有关，原因是肝脏无法代谢废物。在正常情况下，星形胶质细胞通过摄取突触中存在的谷氨酸来调节神经传递，从而防止过度兴奋神经元。通过谷氨酰胺合成酶的作用，谷氨酸与氨发生缩合反应形成谷氨酰胺（一种非神经活性化合物）。然后谷氨酰胺由星形胶质细胞释放，并被神经元摄取，在那里它被转化为谷氨酸，用作神经递质（谷氨酸-谷氨酰胺循环）。\n\n当血液中存在过量的氨时，它会穿过血脑屏障，并被星形胶质细胞摄取，从而增加谷氨酰胺的产生。星形胶质细胞内存在过量的谷氨酰胺会导致细胞内渗透压升高，导致星形胶质细胞肿胀和谷氨酰胺释放受损。因此，高氨血症降低了神经元中可转化为谷氨酸的谷氨酰胺量，导致兴奋性神经传递中断。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项A) α-酮戊二酸是三羧酸循环中的一个关键中间体，也是代谢反应中的氮转运体。在高氨血症的情况下，氨通过谷氨酸脱氢酶解毒成谷氨酸，从而耗尽α-酮戊二酸并损害大脑的能量代谢。\n\n(选项B) 丙氨酸是肝脏和肌肉组织中葡萄糖-丙氨酸循环中的氨基转运体。这个过程允许使用氨基酸作为燃料的组织将过量的氮转运回肝脏。\n\n(选项C) 天冬氨酸是一种非必需氨基酸，在尿素循环中和作为将胞质还原当量转移到线粒体基质中的苹果酸-天冬氨酸穿梭的一部分。\n\n(选项D) 氨甲酰磷酸是由氨甲酰磷酸合成酶I合成的尿素循环中间体，该酶将氨分子从谷氨酰胺或谷氨酸转移到磷酸化的碳酸氢盐。氨甲酰磷酸的产生在晚期肝病患者中减少。\n\n教育目标：\n晚期肝功能衰竭中的高氨血症是肝硬化肝脏无法代谢含氮废物产品的直接结果。氨穿过血脑屏障，导致过量的谷氨酰胺在星形胶质细胞内积聚。这降低了神经元中可转化为谷氨酸的谷氨酰胺量，从而导致兴奋性神经传递中断。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy, specifically the role of ammonia and glutamine in astrocyte function. It assesses understanding of how liver failure leads to increased ammonia levels, which in turn affects glutamine production in astrocytes.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical scenario as hepatic encephalopathy. Recall that in hyperammonemia, astrocytes increase glutamine production to detoxify ammonia, leading to elevated glutamine levels within these cells. Eliminate options that are not directly involved in ammonia detoxification or are decreased in liver failure.",
