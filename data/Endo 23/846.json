    "en": "A 56-year-old man is evaluated for progressive visual impairment. The patient works as part of the grounds crew at an airport, and says he has trouble identifying aircraft at a distance and with filling out paperwork at the end of his shift. His medical history includes poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and gout. A year ago, the patient underwent an uncomplicated repair of a {{exhibit_1}} hernia. Physical examination shows bilateral clouding of the lens. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable. Which of the following metabolic conversions is most likely contributing to this patient's current condition?",

    "en": "This patient has cataracts, an opacification of the lens of the eye that can lead to blindness, likely a result of long-standing hyperglycemia due to poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Certain cells (eg, retinal, endothelial, lens, renal mesangial, Schwann) are more vulnerable to hyperglycemia-induced damage because they are unable to regulate glucose transport when circulating levels are high.\n\nMultiple metabolic pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia-induced tissue damage:\n\n*   **Advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs):** Glucose can nonenzymatically attach to proteins and lipids, forming irreversible glycosylation products that slowly stabilize into irreversible products. Under hyperglycemic conditions, AGEs accumulate and facilitate deposition of LDL in blood vessel walls and inflammatory cell invasion that causes atherosclerosis and microangiopathic complications. High glucose levels in the aqueous humor may also induce nonenzymatic glycation of lens proteins, which contributes to cataract formation.\n\n*   **Polyol pathway overactivity:** The enzyme aldose reductase converts glucose to sorbitol, which is then oxidized to fructose by the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase. With hyperglycemia, formation of sorbitol occurs faster than its metabolism to fructose, resulting in its accumulation. Sorbitol increases the osmotic pressure in tissues and stimulates the influx of water, leading to osmotic cellular injury. In addition, oxidative stress resulting from the depletion of NADPH (aldose reductase consumes NADPH) also contributes to cataract formation and other diabetic complications such as retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and nephropathy.\n\n(Choices A and B) Aldose reductase also catalyzes the conversion of galactose (obtained from dietary lactose) to galactitol, but sorbitol dehydrogenase is incapable of oxidizing galactitol to its corresponding keto sugar (tagatose, a food sweetener). In galactosemia (galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency), excess galactitol is produced, which causes cataracts in newborns.\n\n(Choice D) In the hexose monophosphate shunt, glucose-6-phosphate is converted to 6-phosphogluconolactone by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), generating the reducing equivalent NADPH. G6PD deficiency results in hemolytic anemia during times of increased oxidative stress.\n\n(Choice E) Lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate under anaerobic conditions. Excess lactate forms in hypoxic states, causing metabolic acidosis.\n\n**Educational objective:**\nIn hyperglycemic states, aldose reductase converts glucose to sorbitol at a rate faster than sorbitol can be metabolized. Sorbitol accumulates in certain cells such as lens cells, causing an influx of water and resulting in osmotic cellular injury. Depletion of NADPH by aldose reductase also increases oxidative stress, which accelerates development of cataracts and diabetic microvascular complications (eg, neuropathy, retinopathy).",
    "zh": "该患者患有白内障，即眼睛晶状体的混浊，可导致失明，这很可能是由于控制不良的糖尿病引起的长期高血糖所致。某些细胞（例如，视网膜、内皮细胞、晶状体、肾脏系膜细胞、施万细胞）更容易受到高血糖引起的损伤，因为当循环水平较高时，它们无法调节葡萄糖转运。\n\n多种代谢途径参与了高血糖诱导的组织损伤的发病机制：\n\n*   **晚期糖基化终末产物（AGEs）：** 葡萄糖可以非酶促地附着在蛋白质和脂质上，形成不可逆的糖基化产物，这些产物缓慢地稳定为不可逆的产物。在高血糖条件下，AGEs 积累并促进 LDL 在血管壁中的沉积以及炎症细胞浸润，从而导致动脉粥样硬化和微血管病变并发症。房水中高水平的葡萄糖也可能诱导晶状体蛋白的非酶促糖基化，这有助于白内障的形成。\n\n*   **多元醇途径过度活跃：** 酶醛糖还原酶将葡萄糖转化为山梨醇，然后被酶山梨醇脱氢酶氧化为果糖。在高血糖的情况下，山梨醇的形成速度快于其代谢为果糖的速度，导致其积聚。山梨醇增加了组织中的渗透压并刺激水的涌入，导致渗透性细胞损伤。此外，由于 NADPH 的耗竭（醛糖还原酶消耗 NADPH）而产生的氧化应激也有助于白内障的形成以及其他糖尿病并发症，如视网膜病变、周围神经病变和肾病。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）醛糖还原酶还催化半乳糖（从膳食乳糖中获得）转化为半乳糖醇，但山梨醇脱氢酶无法将半乳糖醇氧化为其相应的酮糖（塔格糖，一种食物甜味剂）。在半乳糖血症（半乳糖 1-磷酸尿苷酰转移酶缺乏症）中，产生过多的半乳糖醇，这会导致新生儿患上白内障。\n\n（选项 D）在己糖单磷酸旁路中，葡萄糖-6-磷酸被酶葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶 (G6PD) 转化为 6-磷酸葡萄糖酸内酯，生成还原当量 NADPH。G6PD 缺乏会导致氧化应激增加时的溶血性贫血。\n\n（选项 E）乳酸脱氢酶在厌氧条件下催化丙酮酸转化为乳酸。过多的乳酸形成于缺氧状态，引起代谢性酸中毒。\n\n**教育目标：**\n在高血糖状态下，醛糖还原酶将葡萄糖转化为山梨醇的速度快于山梨醇的代谢速度。山梨醇在某些细胞（如晶状体细胞）中积聚，导致水流入并导致渗透性细胞损伤。醛糖还原酶对 NADPH 的消耗也会增加氧化应激，从而加速白内障和糖尿病微血管并发症（例如，神经病变、视网膜病变）的发展。"
