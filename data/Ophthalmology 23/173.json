    "en": "A 63-year-old man comes to the office due to blurred vision in both eyes for the last 2 days. The blurriness is worse when he reads but is not noticeable when he drives. The patient has no associated headache, double vision, or weakness. However, he did start taking diphenhydramine several days ago for seasonal allergies. Past medical history is unremarkable. Vital signs are normal. On physical examination, there is edema and clear drainage affecting the nasal mucosa. Funduscopic examination is normal. This patient's visual symptoms are most likely due to blockade of which of the following mediators?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has impaired visual accommodation due to ANTICHOLINERGIC (anti-muscarinic) effects of FIRST-GENERATION ANTIHISTAMINES (eg, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine). Antihistamines are designed to relieve the allergic symptoms caused by release of histamine from mast cells (eg, rhinorrhea, itchy eyes and nose, urticaria). However, first-generation antihistamines can have prominent side effects due to blockade of other receptors, including alpha-adrenergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic receptors.\n\nThe ciliary muscle attaches to the lens via the zonular fibers. Contraction of the muscle reduces tension on the fibers, allowing the lens to become more spherical and increasing its refractive power. The ciliary muscle is under parasympathetic control from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus/ciliary ganglion. Inhibition of this pathway by muscarinic agents will limit ACCOMMODATION and cause blurring of vision for close objects. The pupillary sphincter also receives parasympathetic innervation from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, and patients on antimuscarinic agents may have mydriasis (pupillary dilation) as well.\n\n(Choice B) First-generation antihistamines easily cross the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system, where they interfere with the normal neurotransmitter functions of histamine. Side effects can include drowsiness and cognitive dysfunction.\n\n(Choice C) Leukotrienes are inflammatory mediators that contribute to nasal, ocular, and respiratory symptoms in patients with allergic disorders and asthma. Antihistamines do not interfere with leukotriene formation or action.\n\n(Choice D) Alpha-adrenergic blockade causes peripheral vasodilation, resulting in hypotension and postural dizziness.\n\n(Choice E) Serotonin receptor blockade by antihistamines causes appetite stimulation and weight gain.\n\nEducational objective:\nIn addition to blocking histamine receptors, first-generation antihistamines (eg, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine) have antimuscarinic, anti-alpha adrenergic, and anti-serotonergic properties. Anticholinergic effects on the ocular ciliary muscles impair accommodation and cause blurring of vision for close objects.",
    "zh": "该患者由于第一代抗组胺药（如氯苯那敏、苯海拉明）的抗胆碱能（抗毒蕈碱）作用而出现视力调节障碍。抗组胺药旨在缓解由肥大细胞释放组胺引起的过敏症状（如鼻漏、眼鼻瘙痒、荨麻疹）。然而，第一代抗组胺药由于阻滞其他受体（包括α-肾上腺素能、5-羟色胺能和胆碱能受体），可产生明显的副作用。\n\n睫状肌通过睫状小带附着于晶状体。肌肉的收缩会降低纤维的张力，从而使晶状体变得更圆，并增加其折射力。睫状肌受来自Edinger-Westphal核/睫状神经节的副交感神经控制。毒蕈碱类药物抑制该通路将限制调节并导致近距离物体的视力模糊。瞳孔括约肌也接受来自Edinger-Westphal核的副交感神经支配，服用抗毒蕈碱药物的患者也可能出现瞳孔散大。\n\n（选项B）第一代抗组胺药容易穿过血脑屏障进入中枢神经系统，在那里它们干扰组胺的正常神经递质功能。副作用可包括嗜睡和认知功能障碍。\n\n（选项C）白三烯是炎症介质，可导致过敏性疾病和哮喘患者出现鼻、眼和呼吸系统症状。抗组胺药不干扰白三烯的形成或作用。\n\n（选项D）α-肾上腺素能阻滞导致周围血管舒张，导致低血压和体位性头晕。\n\n（选项E）抗组胺药对5-羟色胺受体的阻滞会导致食欲刺激和体重增加。\n\n教育目的：\n除了阻滞组胺受体外，第一代抗组胺药（如氯苯那敏、苯海拉明）还具有抗毒蕈碱、抗α-肾上腺素能和抗5-羟色胺能特性。对眼睫状肌的抗胆碱能作用会损害调节并导致近距离物体视力模糊。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the side effects of first-generation antihistamines, specifically their anticholinergic properties and their impact on visual accommodation. It requires knowledge of the pathophysiology of accommodation and the receptor targets of various drug classes.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the patient's symptoms (blurred vision, worse with reading) and the medication taken (diphenhydramine, a first-generation antihistamine). Recall the off-target effects of first-generation antihistamines, particularly their anticholinergic activity, and relate this to the mechanism of accommodation involving the ciliary muscle and acetylcholine.",
