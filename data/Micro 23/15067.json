The patient tried to squeeze open the lesions, but this led to profuse bleeding with no expression of pus. She works at a pet store in Mississippi and has regular contact with a variety of animals. Skin examination findings are shown below {{exhibit_1}}.\n\nBiopsy of the lesions reveals large endothelial cells forming vascular channels with a mixed neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltrate. Immunohistochemical staining for human herpesvirus 8 is negative.",

    "en": "Bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is characterized by the formation of highly vascular lesions in the skin and other organs due to infection with the small, gram-negative bacterium *Bartonella henselae*. The major reservoir for this organism is domesticated cats, and transmission to humans primarily occurs after a CAT SCRATCH or bite. Patients with intact immunity who are exposed to *B. henselae* often develop cat-scratch disease (regional lymphadenopathy), but those with ADVANCED AIDS are at risk for the more severe clinical syndrome of BA.\n\nPatients with BA develop violaceous, cutaneous lesions that are highly vascular. Lesions form over weeks or months and are typically associated with fever, weight loss, and other constitutional symptoms. As these lesions are similar to those seen in Kaposi sarcoma, tissue testing for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is typically performed (HHV-8 testing will be positive in Kaposi sarcoma and negative in BA). Biopsy with histopathology confirms the diagnosis and usually reveals large endothelial cells forming small vascular channels surrounded by a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Modified silver stain can also identify the organism.\n\n(Choice A) *Actinomyces israelii* is a branching, gram-positive bacterium that grows in filaments. It primarily causes a cervicofacial infection that begins as a slowly growing mass which evolves into multiple abscesses and draining sinus tracts with yellow (\"sulfur\") granules. Histopathology typically shows chronic inflammatory granulation tissue surrounding dense fibrosis.\n\n(Choice C) *Blastomyces dermatitidis* is a dimorphic fungus that primarily causes acute or chronic pneumonia but can also spread to the skin, leading to verrucous lesions with irregular borders. Culture is usually required for diagnosis and histology will show granulomas.\n\n(Choice D) *Mycobacterium marinum* is a nontuberculous mycobacterium that is found in fresh and salt water. It can inoculate areas of broken skin (eg, abrasions) and result in an infection marked by cutaneous papules, ulcers, and scarring. Histology reveals granulomatous inflammation.\n\n(Choice E) *Staphylococcus aureus* skin infections (eg, folliculitis) are more common in patients with HIV. However, these infections typically develop over a few days and are associated with purulent fluid.\n\nEducational objective:\nBacillary angiomatosis is primarily seen in patients with advanced AIDS. It is caused by the gram-negative bacterium *Bartonella henselae*, which is typically transmitted by a cat scratch. Patients usually develop highly vascular, violaceous, cutaneous lesions over weeks or months. Histology of the lesions reveals large endothelial cells forming small vascular channels with a surrounding inflammatory infiltrate. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "杆菌性血管瘤病 (BA) 的特征是在皮肤和其他器官中形成高度血管化的病变，这是由于感染了小型革兰氏阴性细菌 *汉赛巴尔通体 (Bartonella henselae)*。该病原体的主要宿主是家猫，它主要通过猫抓伤或咬伤传播给人类。免疫功能正常的患者接触到 *B. henselae* 后，通常会患上猫抓病（局部淋巴结病），但晚期艾滋病患者则面临更严重的 BA 临床综合征风险。\n\nBA 患者会发生紫红色、皮肤病变，这些病变高度血管化。病变在几周或几个月内形成，通常与发烧、体重减轻和其他全身症状相关。由于这些病变与卡波西肉瘤的病变相似，因此通常进行人疱疹病毒 8 型 (HHV-8) 的组织检测（HHV-8 检测在卡波西肉瘤中呈阳性，在 BA 中呈阴性）。活检与组织病理学检查证实了诊断，通常显示大型内皮细胞形成小的血管通道，周围有混合性炎症浸润。改良银染也可以识别病原体。\n\n(选项 A) *以色列放线菌 (Actinomyces israelii)* 是一种分支的革兰氏阳性细菌，生长在丝状体中。它主要引起颈面部感染，开始时为缓慢生长的肿块，发展成多个脓肿和引流窦道，并伴有黄色（“硫磺”）颗粒。组织病理学检查通常显示慢性炎症性肉芽组织围绕致密纤维化。\n\n(选项 C) *皮炎芽生菌 (Blastomyces dermatitidis)* 是一种二形性真菌，主要引起急慢性肺炎，但也可能扩散到皮肤，导致边缘不规则的疣状病变。诊断通常需要培养，组织学检查将显示肉芽肿。\n\n(选项 D) *海分枝杆菌 (Mycobacterium marinum)* 是一种非结核分枝杆菌，存在于淡水和盐水中。它会接种到破损的皮肤区域（例如擦伤），并导致感染，其特征是皮肤丘疹、溃疡和瘢痕形成。组织学检查显示肉芽肿性炎症。\n\n(选项 E) *金黄色葡萄球菌 (Staphylococcus aureus)* 皮肤感染（例如毛囊炎）在 HIV 感染患者中更常见。然而，这些感染通常在几天内发生，并伴有脓性液体。\n\n教育目标：\n杆菌性血管瘤病主要见于晚期艾滋病患者。它是由革兰氏阴性细菌 *汉赛巴尔通体 (Bartonella henselae)* 引起的，通常通过猫抓伤传播。患者通常会在几周或几个月内出现高度血管化、紫红色的皮肤病变。病变的组织学检查显示大型内皮细胞形成小的血管通道，周围有炎症浸润。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of bacillary angiomatosis, its etiology, clinical presentation in immunocompromised patients, and diagnostic findings. It requires differentiating bacillary angiomatosis from other skin lesions in HIV-positive individuals.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's HIV status, the appearance of the lesions (tender nodules, bleeding without pus), the patient's occupation (pet store worker), and the negative HHV-8 staining. These clues point towards bacillary angiomatosis caused by Bartonella henselae.",
