    "en": "Officials of a public health department report a higher than normal prevalence of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) among children age 5-12 in their community. They observe that some households in the community are exposed to chemical waste from a nearby factory and worry that exposure to this waste is responsible for the increased prevalence of AML. A case-control study is designed to evaluate the health department officials' claim that exposure to chemical waste is associated with AML in childhood.",

    "en": "A CASE-CONTROL STUDY is the most appropriate study design for evaluating the public health officials' claim. In case-control studies, 2 groups of subjects are created: CASES (subjects WITH the disease of interest) and CONTROLS (subjects WITHOUT the disease of interest). In this example, AML is the disease of interest; therefore, children with AML should be used as cases and children without AML should be used as controls. Cases and controls should be selected REGARDLESS of exposure status to the chemical waste.",
    "zh": "病例对照研究是评估公共卫生官员说法的最合适的研究设计。在病例对照研究中，创建了2组受试者：病例（患有感兴趣疾病的受试者）和对照（未患感兴趣疾病的受试者）。在本例中，AML是感兴趣的疾病；因此，应将AML患儿用作病例，将未患AML的儿童用作对照。选择病例和对照不应考虑是否接触化学废物。"
