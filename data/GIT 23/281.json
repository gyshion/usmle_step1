    "en": "A 35-year-old man with a history of alcohol use disorder is brought to the emergency department with hematemesis. Prior to this, he has had three episodes of vomiting. His BP is 110/80 mmHg and pulse is 98/min. He has no jaundice. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. There is no hepatomegaly. Endoscopy shows longitudinal mucosal tears at the gastroesophageal junction. Which of the following factors is most directly related to the pathogenesis of this patient's current condition?",

    "en": "Longitudinal mucosal tears at the esophagogastric-squamocolumnar junction describe Mallory-Weiss syndrome. Most commonly, these tears occur secondary to rapid INCREASE of intraabdominal and intraluminal gastric pressure, as happens during retching and vomiting. Other precipitating factors include coughing, hiccupping, other repeated abdominal straining, and abdominal trauma. Additionally, hiatal hernias are found in about half of patients with Mallory-Weiss syndrome and are considered a strong predisposing factor. Mallory-Weiss syndrome is very commonly associated with chronic alcohol use.\n\nMallory-Weiss tears can be asymptomatic or can lead to gastrointestinal hemorrhage that manifests as hematemesis. About 10% of all upper gastrointestinal bleeds are from Mallory-Weiss syndrome. The intensity of hemorrhage and amount of blood loss varies widely according to the length and depth of the tears, but is almost never life-threatening.\n\n(Choice B) Increased venous pressure is associated with potentially life-threatening hemorrhage from esophageal varices. Esophageal varices occur in patients with cirrhosis who often have other signs of chronic liver disease—such as jaundice, spider nevi, palmar erythema, gynecomastia, and a history of chronic alcohol use. Endoscopy is diagnostic.\n\n(Choices C and D) Local inflammation plays a role in the development of chronic gastritis and esophagitis. Acid reflux is characteristic of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Neither condition is known for significant upper GI bleeding.\n\n(Choice E) Diminished blood perfusion to the small bowel and colon may result from arterial occlusion by embolus, thrombosis of the venous system, or low cardiac output. Ischemic bowel is the result, and it is a very dangerous condition. Ischemic bowel occurs most often in older patients.\n\nEducational objective:\nMallory-Weiss tears account for about 10% of cases of upper GI hemorrhage. They occur due to increased intraluminal gastric pressure due to retching, vomiting, or other abdominal straining.",
    "zh": "食管胃鳞柱交界处的纵向黏膜撕裂描述了Mallory-Weiss综合征。最常见的是，这些撕裂继发于腹内压和胃内腔压的快速升高，如干呕和呕吐时发生。其他诱发因素包括咳嗽、打嗝、其他反复的腹部用力以及腹部外伤。此外，在约一半的Mallory-Weiss综合征患者中发现食管裂孔疝，这被认为是强有力的易感因素。Mallory-Weiss综合征通常与慢性酒精使用有关。\n\nMallory-Weiss撕裂可能无症状，也可能导致胃肠道出血，表现为呕血。大约10%的全部上消化道出血来自Mallory-Weiss综合征。出血强度和失血量根据撕裂的长度和深度而差异很大，但几乎从不危及生命。\n\n（选项B）静脉压升高与食管静脉曲张引起的潜在危及生命的出血有关。食管静脉曲张发生在肝硬化患者中，这些患者通常有其他慢性肝病的体征——如黄疸、蜘蛛痣、手掌红斑、男性乳房发育，以及慢性酒精使用史。内镜检查具有诊断意义。\n\n（选项C和D）局部炎症在慢性胃炎和食管炎的发展中起作用。胃酸反流是胃食管反流病（GERD）的特征。这两种情况都不以显著的上消化道出血而闻名。\n\n（选项E）小肠和结肠的血供减少可能由栓塞引起的动脉闭塞、静脉系统血栓形成或低心排出量引起。结果是缺血性肠病，这是一种非常危险的情况。缺血性肠病最常发生在老年患者中。\n\n教育目标：\nMallory-Weiss撕裂约占上消化道出血病例的10%。它们是由于干呕、呕吐或其他腹部用力导致的胃内腔压力升高而发生的。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Mallory-Weiss syndrome, its etiology, and clinical presentation. Mallory-Weiss syndrome is characterized by longitudinal mucosal tears at the gastroesophageal junction, typically caused by a rapid increase in intraabdominal and intraluminal gastric pressure due to retching and vomiting.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical scenario of hematemesis following episodes of vomiting in a patient with a history of alcohol use disorder. Identify the key pathophysiologic mechanism of increased intraabdominal pressure as the primary factor leading to the mucosal tears.",
