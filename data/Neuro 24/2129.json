    "en": "A 62-year-old man is brought to the office by his son due to memory impairment and frequent falls. The patient has been living alone since the death of his wife a year ago. His son, who is visiting from out of town, found his father in poor living conditions. The patient was forgetful and did not know the location of various items in his house, where he has lived for more than 20 years. His gait is also unsteady, and he had several falls. The son says his father has always been \"a drinker\" and may have been drinking more recently. On physical examination, bilateral lateral gaze palsy and nystagmus are present. Muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes are normal, but the gait is ataxic. On memory testing, he recalls 0 out of 3 objects after 5 minutes. A lesion of which of the following labeled structures on a normal brain MRI is most specifically associated with this patient's current condition? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient, with a history of alcohol use disorder, presents with oculomotor dysfunction (nystagmus, lateral gaze palsy), ataxia, and encephalopathy (confusion, memory impairment). This constellation of symptoms is consistent with the classic triad of Wernicke encephalopathy (WE), a complication of THIAMINE DEFICIENCY. Thiamine is a cofactor for multiple enzymes involved in glucose metabolism; deficiency results in the brain's inability to use glucose and turn it into energy, leading to neuronal damage and necrosis. Areas of the brain with high metabolic demand are particularly susceptible; the MAMMILLARY BODIES are nearly universally affected and demonstrate focal hemorrhage or atrophy on imaging. Other commonly involved areas include the thalamus, periaqueductal gray substance, and locus ceruleus.\n\nThiamine deficiency occurs most commonly in ALCOHOL USE DISORDER but can also manifest with any form of malnutrition (eg, anorexia, advanced malignancy). Infusion of dextrose-containing solutions without concurrent thiamine supplementation acutely lowers thiamine levels and can precipitate WE; however, some patients with severe deficiency can develop symptoms without a clear inciting event. The chronic effects of thiamine deficiency lead to KORSAKOFF SYNDROME, which is characterized by anterograde and retrograde amnesia, apathy, lack of insight, and confabulation. Attention, social behavior, and long-term memory are relatively preserved.\n\n(Choice A) Demyelination of the pons (central pontine myelinolysis) can occur with overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia. It can result in locked-in syndrome, in which patients can move their eyes but cannot move or verbally communicate. The pons is not typically involved in WE.\n\n(Choice B) The mammillary bodies (labeled B in the image) are part of the limbic system and are critically involved in memory formation. They are highly susceptible to thiamine deficiency and are almost always affected in Wernicke encephalopathy. Lesions here are strongly associated with the memory deficits seen in this patient.\n\n(Choice C) The fornix is a bundle of axons originating from the hippocampal subiculum that projects to the mammillary bodies. Although it can (rarely) be involved in WE, the mammillary bodies are more specifically associated.\n\n(Choice D) The splenium of the corpus callosum is not typically affected in WE. Lesions (demyelinating or ischemic) in this structure will clinically result in alexia without agraphia.\n\n(Choice E) The pineal gland synthesizes melatonin and is involved in circadian rhythm; it is not typically involved in WE.\n\n(Choice F) Alcohol-associated cerebellar degeneration also causes ataxia but does not typically cause confusion or ophthalmoplegia. The cerebellum is less frequently involved in WE.\n\nEducational objective:\nWernicke encephalopathy is a complication of thiamine deficiency and is characterized by oculomotor dysfunction, encephalopathy, and ataxia. Chronic deficiency results in Korsakoff syndrome (eg, anterograde and retrograde amnesia, confabulation, apathy). Thiamine is involved in glucose metabolism, and areas of the brain with high metabolic demands are particularly susceptible; the mammillary bodies are most commonly affected. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者有酒精使用障碍病史，表现为动眼神经功能障碍（眼球震颤、外展神经麻痹）、共济失调和脑病（意识模糊、记忆力减退）。这种症状组合与韦尼克脑病 (WE) 的典型三联征相符，韦尼克脑病是硫胺素缺乏症的并发症。硫胺素是参与葡萄糖代谢的多种酶的辅因子；缺乏导致大脑无法使用葡萄糖并将其转化为能量，从而导致神经元损伤和坏死。大脑中代谢需求高的区域特别容易受到影响；乳头体几乎普遍受到影响，并在影像学上表现出局灶性出血或萎缩。其他常见受累区域包括丘脑、中脑导水管周围灰质和蓝斑核。\n\n硫胺素缺乏症最常发生在酒精使用障碍中，但也可能表现为任何形式的营养不良（例如，厌食症、晚期恶性肿瘤）。在未同时补充硫胺素的情况下输注含葡萄糖溶液会急剧降低硫胺素水平，并可能诱发韦尼克脑病；然而，一些患有严重缺乏症的患者可能会在没有明确诱发事件的情况下出现症状。硫胺素缺乏症的慢性影响会导致科萨科夫综合征，其特征是顺行性和逆行性遗忘、冷漠、缺乏洞察力和虚构。注意力、社会行为和长期记忆相对保留。\n\n（选项 A）脑桥脱髓鞘（中央性脑桥髓鞘溶解症）可发生于过度快速纠正慢性低钠血症时。它可导致闭锁综合征，在这种情况下，患者可以移动眼睛，但不能移动或口头交流。脑桥通常不涉及韦尼克脑病。\n\n（选项 B）乳头体（在图像中标记为 B）是边缘系统的一部分，并且与记忆形成密切相关。它们对硫胺素缺乏症高度敏感，几乎总是受韦尼克脑病的影响。此处的病变与该患者的记忆缺陷密切相关。\n\n（选项 C）穹窿是源自海马腹侧并投射到乳头体的轴突束。虽然它（很少）可能涉及韦尼克脑病，但乳头体更具体地相关。\n\n（选项 D）胼胝体压部通常不受韦尼克脑病的影响。该结构中的病变（脱髓鞘或缺血性）将在临床上导致无失语症的失读症。\n\n（选项 E）松果体合成褪黑激素并参与昼夜节律；它通常不涉及韦尼克脑病。\n\n（选项 F）酒精相关的脑干小脑变性也会导致共济失调，但通常不会引起意识模糊或眼肌麻痹。小脑较少参与韦尼克脑病。\n\n教育目标：\n韦尼克脑病是硫胺素缺乏症的并发症，其特征是动眼神经功能障碍、脑病和共济失调。慢性缺乏会导致科萨科夫综合征（例如，顺行性和逆行性遗忘、虚构、冷漠）。硫胺素参与葡萄糖代谢，大脑中代谢需求高的区域特别容易受到影响；乳头体最常受到影响。{{exhibit_2}}"
