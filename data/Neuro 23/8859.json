    "en": "A 32-year-old woman describes five episodes of intractable vomiting over the last year. The episodes last several hours and are associated with a sensation that the room is spinning or tilting. At these times, it is difficult for her to walk because she loses her balance. She cannot relate the timing of the episodes to any particular inciting event. Physical examination reveals stability in the Romberg position and during tandem walk. Proprioception is intact.",

    "en": "This patient is experiencing vertigo due to vestibular dysfunction. Vertigo is a sensation of motion when no motion is present or an exaggerated sense of motion for a given bodily movement. It must be distinguished from other sensations that are often described by patients using similar terminology, such as imbalance, light-headedness, and syncope. Vertigo resulting from vestibular dysfunction tends to be of sudden onset, interfere with walking, and cause nausea and vomiting. Typical causes of vestibulopathy include Meniere's disease, perilymphatic fistulas, benign positional vertigo, labyrinthitis, and acoustic neuromas.\n\n(Choice A) Disease of the posterior column of the spinal cord can occur in syphilis (i.e., tabes dorsalis) and vitamin B12 deficiency. Typical symptoms include ataxia, decreased proprioception and vibratory sense, and hyporeflexia. This patient's normal neurologic exam makes posterior column disease unlikely.\n\n(Choice B) Vagal nerve damage can present as hoarseness, dysphagia, abnormal gastrointestinal motility, or tachycardia. Vagal nerve dysfunction will not cause vertigo.\n\n(Choice C) Optic tract dysfunction will result in visual problems. Vision deficits do not typically cause vertigo, but may cause people to feel unsteady on their feet.\n\n(Choice E) Cerebellar dysfunction presents as ataxia, imbalance, incoordination, and nystagmus. Patients with cerebellar dysfunction will be unable to perform tandem walking due to their imbalance.\n\n(Choice F) The frontal cortex controls executive functions and response inhibition. Damage to the frontal cortex results in \"frontal release\" symptoms, such as personality change, inability to organize or plan, and disinhibition.\n\nEducational Objective:\nVertigo is a sensation of excessive motion compared to physical reality. It is most commonly due to dysfunction within the vestibular system.",
    "zh": "该患者正在经历由于前庭功能障碍引起的眩晕。眩晕是指在没有运动时出现运动的感觉，或者对于给定的身体运动，运动感觉被夸大。必须将其与其他经常被患者使用相似术语描述的感觉区分开来，例如不平衡、头晕和晕厥。由前庭功能障碍引起的眩晕往往突然发作，干扰行走，并引起恶心和呕吐。前庭病变的典型病因包括梅尼埃病、前庭瘘、良性阵发性位置性眩晕、迷路炎和听神经瘤。\n\n(选项A) 脊髓后索疾病可发生在梅毒（即脊髓痨）和维生素B12缺乏症中。典型症状包括共济失调、本体感觉和震动觉减退以及反射减弱。该患者正常的神经系统检查使后索疾病不太可能。\n\n(选项B) 迷走神经损伤可表现为声音嘶哑、吞咽困难、胃肠道蠕动异常或心动过速。迷走神经功能障碍不会引起眩晕。\n\n(选项C) 视束功能障碍将导致视觉问题。视力缺陷通常不会引起眩晕，但可能导致人们感觉站立不稳。\n\n(选项E) 小脑功能障碍表现为共济失调、不平衡、不协调和眼球震颤。小脑功能障碍患者由于其不平衡而无法进行串联行走。\n\n(选项F) 额叶皮质控制执行功能和反应抑制。额叶皮质损伤会导致“额叶释放”症状，例如性格改变、无法组织或计划以及去抑制。\n\n教育目标：\n眩晕是一种相对于物理现实的过度运动感觉。它最常见的原因是前庭系统内的功能障碍。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of vertigo and its common causes, specifically differentiating it from other balance disorders and identifying the underlying anatomical structures responsible. It assesses the ability to correlate clinical symptoms with specific neurological pathways.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the patient's symptoms as characteristic of vertigo. Then, by considering the differential diagnoses for vertigo and the specific physical examination findings (normal Romberg, normal tandem walk, intact proprioception), the most likely affected structure can be identified. Elimination of other options based on their typical presentations is also a key strategy.",
