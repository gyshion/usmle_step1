    "en": "A 45-year-old man comes to the office due to a 6-month history of headache, sweating, and pain in his lower back, knees, and small joints of his hands. The pain increases with physical activity. He is unable to remove his wedding ring due to swollen fingers. The patient has also experienced excessive urination and loss of libido. Examination shows a prominent jaw and enlarged supraorbital ridges. The patient's hands are notably broad with thickened fingers. Multiple skin tags are noted on the nape of the neck. Laboratory evaluation reveals low serum testosterone levels. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's joint symptoms?",
    "zh": "一名45岁的男性因6个月的头痛、出汗以及下背部、膝盖和手部小关节疼痛而就诊。疼痛随着体力活动而加剧。由于手指肿胀，他无法取下结婚戒指。患者还出现了尿频和性欲减退。体格检查显示下颌突出和眶上缘增大。患者的手明显宽大，手指增厚。颈后部可见多发皮赘。实验室评估显示血清睾酮水平低。以下哪一项最可能是导致该患者关节症状的根本原因？"

    "en": "Acromegaly {{exhibit_1}} has common features of acromegaly, including coarsening of facial features (eg, brow protrusion, prognathism), broadening of the hands, and skin involvement (eg, skin tags, hyperhidrosis). Acromegaly is caused by excessive production of GROWTH HORMONE (GH) and is most often due to a pituitary somatotroph adenoma. Excess GH both directly and indirectly (via release of insulin-like growth factor-1 from the liver) leads to overgrowth of many tissues, including bone, cartilage, and visceral organs.\n\nAcromegaly can affect the joints in both the axial and the appendicular skeleton. Excessive GH causes HYPERPLASIA of articular chondrocytes and synovial hypertrophy, which may appear on X-ray as widening of the joint space. As acromegalic arthropathy continues, there is degeneration of articular cartilage and periarticular bone resembling osteoarthritis.\n\nComplications of the pituitary mass itself include headache, visual field defects (compression of optic chiasm), and abnormalities of other pituitary hormones. HYPOGONADISM can occur secondary to hyperprolactinemia (from disrupted negative regulation of prolactin secretion) or directly due to compression of pituitary gonadotrophs.\n\n(Choice A) Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) can cause arthritis due to accumulation of iron in the articular cartilage and synovium. Although HH can also cause central hypogonadism, this patient's skeletal and facial features are more consistent with acromegaly.\n\n(Choice B) Crystal deposition arthritis typically presents initially with acute inflammatory monarthritis at the first metatarsophalangeal joints and knees (gout), or knees, wrists, shoulders, and elbows (pseudogout [ie, calcium pyrophosphate deposition arthritis]). These disorders would not cause facial changes or hypogonadism.\n\n(Choice C) Sarcoidosis is characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas in various tissues. Sarcoid arthropathy often occurs acutely in association with erythema nodosum and hilar adenopathy (Lofgren syndrome); chronic arthritis is less common and usually occurs in patients with significant pulmonary disease.\n\n(Choice E) Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) involves a complex inflammatory response, culminating in an influx of monocytes that differentiate into inflammatory macrophages in the synovium. RA commonly presents with chronic swelling of the metacarpophalangeal joints but does not cause enlargement of the supraorbital ridges or jaw.",
    "zh": "肢端肥大症{{exhibit_1}}具有肢端肥大症的常见特征，包括面部特征粗糙（例如，眉弓突出、前颌），手部变宽，以及皮肤受累（例如，皮赘、多汗症）。肢端肥大症是由生长激素 (GH) 过量产生引起的，通常是由于垂体生长激素细胞腺瘤所致。过量的GH既可直接，也可间接（通过从肝脏释放胰岛素样生长因子-1）导致许多组织过度生长，包括骨骼、软骨和内脏器官。\n\n肢端肥大症可影响中轴骨骼和四肢骨骼的关节。过量的GH导致关节软骨细胞增生和滑膜肥大，这可能在X射线上表现为关节间隙的扩大。随着肢端肥大性关节病的持续发展，会出现关节软骨和关节周围骨的退变，类似于骨关节炎。\n\n垂体肿块本身的并发症包括头痛、视野缺损（视交叉受压）和其他垂体激素的异常。性腺功能减退症可能继发于高催乳素血症（由于催乳素分泌的负调节受损）或直接由于垂体促性腺细胞受压。\n\n（选项A）遗传性血色素沉着病 (HH) 可因铁在关节软骨和滑膜中的积累而引起关节炎。尽管HH也可导致中枢性性腺功能减退症，但该患者的骨骼和面部特征更符合肢端肥大症。\n\n（选项B）晶体沉积性关节炎通常最初表现为急性炎症性单关节炎，累及第一跖趾关节和膝关节（痛风），或膝、腕、肩和肘关节（假性痛风[即，焦磷酸钙沉积性关节炎]）。这些疾病不会引起面部改变或性腺功能减退症。\n\n（选项C）结节病特征在于各种组织中非干酪性肉芽肿的形成。结节病性关节病常与结节性红斑和肺门淋巴结病（Lofgren综合征）相关联而急性发作；慢性关节炎较少见，通常发生在患有严重肺部疾病的患者中。\n\n（选项E）类风湿性关节炎 (RA) 涉及复杂的炎症反应，最终导致单核细胞涌入，并在滑膜中分化为炎症性巨噬细胞。RA常表现为掌指关节慢性肿胀，但不会导致眶上缘或下颌增大。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of acromegaly, its clinical presentation, and the underlying pathophysiology affecting the joints. It also requires differentiating acromegaly from other arthritic conditions based on the patient's specific symptoms and physical findings.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the constellation of symptoms including headache, sweating, joint pain, enlarged jaw and supraorbital ridges, thickened fingers, skin tags, and low testosterone. Recognize these as classic signs of acromegaly caused by excessive growth hormone, leading to hypertrophy of articular cartilage.",
