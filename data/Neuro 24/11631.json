    "en": "A 35-year-old woman comes to the office due to trouble seeing out of her right eye. The patient started having blurry vision and pain with eye movement 2 days ago. She has no headache, vertigo, slurred speech, numbness, or weakness. Two years ago, {{exhibit_1}} the patient had an episode of double vision that spontaneously resolved after a few weeks. On physical examination, she has an afferent pupillary defect with markedly reduced visual acuity on the right. Funduscopy reveals blurring of the optic disk margins in the right eye. MRI of the {{exhibit_2}} brain reveals multiple, ovoid white matter lesions with perpendicular orientation to the lateral ventricles. This patient's condition is most likely caused by an inappropriate immune response directed against which of the following cells?",

    "en": "The patient's presentation, including blurry vision, optic disk blurring, and multiple white matter lesions on MRI, is consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The pathogenesis of MS involves an autoimmune response targeting oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells of the CNS. Helper T cells abnormally react to antigens in myelin, causing inflammation and myelin destruction. Astrocytes are glial cells that contribute to the blood-brain barrier and glial scar formation, but are not typically the primary target of the immune response in MS. Ependymal cells line the ventricles and produce cerebrospinal fluid and are not targeted in MS. Microglial cells are the resident macrophages of the CNS and participate in myelin destruction, but are not the primary target. Schwann cells are the myelin-producing cells of the peripheral nervous system and are targeted in conditions like Guillain-Barré syndrome, not MS.",
    "zh": "患者的表现，包括视力模糊、视盘模糊和MRI上多发白质病灶，与多发性硬化症（MS）一致。MS是一种中枢神经系统（CNS）的自身免疫性脱髓鞘疾病。MS的发病机制涉及针对少突胶质细胞（CNS的髓鞘生成细胞）的自身免疫反应。辅助性T细胞异常地对髓鞘中的抗原起反应，引起炎症和髓鞘破坏。星形胶质细胞是参与血脑屏障和神经胶质瘢痕形成的神经胶质细胞，但通常不是MS中免疫反应的主要靶标。室管膜细胞排列在脑室中并产生脑脊液，不是MS的靶标。小胶质细胞是CNS的常驻巨噬细胞，参与髓鞘破坏，但不是主要靶标。许旺细胞是周围神经系统的髓鞘生成细胞，是格林-巴利综合征等疾病的靶标，而不是MS。"
