    "en": "A 38-year-old woman is being evaluated for intermittent tingling and numbness of the left hand for the past several months. Her symptoms predominantly involve the fourth and fifth digits and are often brought on by driving a car. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An electrodiagnostic study is performed, during which a nerve stimulator is placed on the left fifth digit and a surface recorder is placed over the ulnar nerve above the elbow. Electrical stimulus is applied, and the graph obtained is shown below. Results from the asymptomatic contralateral extremity are also shown. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "Nerve conduction study (NCS) measures the amplitude, velocity, and latency of an electrical stimulus applied to an isolated nerve and can help differentiate between demyelinating and axonal neuropathies.\n\n- Demyelinating neuropathies are caused by damage to the myelin sheath. Loss of insulation results in delayed (or blocked) nerve conduction velocity.\n- Axonal neuropathies are caused by damage to the nerve axon. Loss of axon fibers results in reduced signal amplitude.\n\nThis patient has a delay in left-sided ulnar nerve conduction velocity, indicating a DEMYELINATING ulnar mononeuropathy. Focal nerve compression (eg, compression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow) is the most common cause of mononeuropathy and results in nerve ischemia, leading to apoptosis of Schwann cells and localized demyelination. In addition to sensory symptoms, patients with ulnar neuropathy may also have weakness of the fourth and fifth digits, elbow pain, and worsening of symptoms with elbow or wrist flexion. Severe disease can lead to wasting of the hand muscles and an ulnar claw deformity.\n\n(Choice A) An axonal neuropathy would primarily show diminished amplitude, rather than reduced velocity of nerve conduction. Common causes of axonal neuropathy include diabetes mellitus, toxins (eg, chemotherapeutic drugs), hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, and vasculitis.\n\n(Choice B) Neuronal cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglia and the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Neuronal cell body damage could potentially result in reduced signal amplitude if there is secondary axonal degeneration.\n\n(Choice C) Myasthenia gravis is due to autoimmune attack on the acetylcholine receptors of the postsynaptic membrane. This causes fatigable weakness of the ocular, facial, and proximal muscles. NCS is typically normal, but muscle stimulation studies demonstrate a reduction in motor signal strength with repetitive stimuli.\n\n(Choice E) Botulinum toxin blocks acetylcholine release from presynaptic membranes of the neuromuscular junction by impairing fusion of secretory vesicles with the synaptic membrane. Patients typically develop cranial neuropathies with symmetric, descending flaccid paralysis. NCS is typically normal; muscle stimulation studies may show a reduction in motor signal strength that improves with repetitive stimuli.\n\nEducational objective:\nUlnar neuropathy is characterized by numbness of the fourth and fifth digits, pain, and weakness. It is most commonly caused by compressive injury, leading to tissue ischemia and demyelination (Schwann cell injury). A nerve conduction study can help differentiate demyelinating versus axonal neuropathies; demyelination causes slowed or blocked nerve conduction velocity whereas axonal injury leads to a reduction in signal strength.",
    "zh": "神经传导研究 (NCS) 测量施加于孤立神经的电刺激的幅度、速度和潜伏期，有助于区分脱髓鞘性和轴突性神经病。\n\n- 脱髓鞘性神经病是由髓鞘损伤引起的。绝缘丧失导致神经传导速度延迟（或阻滞）。\n- 轴突性神经病是由神经轴突损伤引起的。轴突纤维的缺失导致信号幅度降低。\n\n该患者的左侧尺神经传导速度延迟，表明存在脱髓鞘性尺神经单神经病变。局部神经压迫（例如，肘部尺神经受压）是单神经病变的最常见原因，导致神经缺血，进而导致许旺细胞凋亡和局部脱髓鞘。除了感觉症状外，患有尺神经病变的患者还可能出现第四和第五个手指无力、肘部疼痛，并且随着肘部或腕部屈曲而症状加重。严重疾病可导致手部肌肉萎缩和尺爪畸形。\n\n(选项 A) 轴突性神经病主要表现为信号幅度降低，而不是神经传导速度降低。轴突性神经病的常见原因包括糖尿病、毒素（例如化疗药物）、甲状腺功能减退症、维生素 B12 缺乏症和血管炎。\n\n(选项 B) 神经元胞体位于背根神经节和脊髓前角。如果继发轴突变性，神经元胞体损伤可能会导致信号幅度降低。\n\n(选项 C) 重症肌无力是由于自身免疫攻击突触后膜上的乙酰胆碱受体引起的。这会导致眼肌、面部和近端肌肉的易疲劳性无力。NCS 通常是正常的，但肌肉刺激研究表明，重复刺激时运动信号强度降低。\n\n(选项 E) 肉毒毒素通过损害分泌小泡与突触膜的融合来阻断乙酰胆碱从神经肌肉接头的前突触膜释放。患者通常会出现颅神经病，伴有对称性、下降性弛缓性麻痹。NCS 通常是正常的；肌肉刺激研究可能显示运动信号强度降低，并且随着重复刺激而改善。\n\n教育目标：\n尺神经病变的特征是第四和第五个手指麻木、疼痛和无力。它最常见的原因是压迫性损伤，导致组织缺血和脱髓鞘（许旺细胞损伤）。神经传导研究可以帮助区分脱髓鞘性神经病变与轴突性神经病变；脱髓鞘导致神经传导速度减慢或阻滞，而轴突损伤导致信号强度降低。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of nerve conduction studies (NCS) and the differentiation between demyelinating and axonal neuropathies. It requires the interpretation of NCS findings to identify the primary pathological process affecting the nerve.\n\nTo solve this question, one must analyze the provided NCS waveforms, noting the latency and amplitude changes in the affected limb compared to the asymptomatic limb. Recognizing that delayed conduction velocity points to demyelination and reduced amplitude suggests axonal damage is key to selecting the correct answer.",
