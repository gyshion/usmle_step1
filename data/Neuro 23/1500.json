    "en": "A 5-month-old boy is brought to the office out of concern that he has developmental delay. The patient has 3 older siblings that were much more active and interactive at the boy's age. The family just moved to the United States from South America and did not previously have consistent primary care. Physical examination shows that the boy is unable to push up on his forearms when prone and does not seem to recognize his parents. Comprehensive laboratory evaluation shows impaired tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has impaired tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis, a disorder affecting metabolism of phenylalanine and other amino acids. The most common disorder of phenylalanine metabolism is phenylketonuria (PKU), which is due to phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency and results in an inability to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine. Impaired synthesis of BH4 (often due to dihydropteridine reductase deficiency) also affects this pathway because BH4 is an essential cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase; the resulting elevation in phenylalanine and its neurotoxic by-products causes developmental delay, similar to PKU (Choice C).\n\nUnlike PKU, however, impaired BH4 synthesis affects other amino acid pathways because BH4 is also a cofactor for hydroxylase enzymes involved in the production of essential neurotransmitters:\n\nConversion of tyrosine to L-dopa: L-dopa is the precursor for catecholamine (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) production, and reduced catecholamines lead to additional neurologic manifestations (eg, dystonia, autonomic dysfunction).\nConversion of tryptophan to serotonin: Impaired serotonin production can lead to dysregulation of mood, appetite, and sleep.\n\nA phenylalanine-restricted diet is recommended for both PKU and impaired BH4 synthesis, but the latter condition also requires BH4 supplementation. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl-CoA by choline acetyltransferase at the neuromuscular junction. Choline acetyltransferase does not require tetrahydrobiopterin as a cofactor.\n\n(Choice B) GABA inhibits presynaptic transmission in the CNS and is formed by glutamate decarboxylation, a reaction catalyzed by glutamate decarboxylase. This enzyme does not require tetrahydrobiopterin as a cofactor.",
    "zh": "该患者的四氢生物蝶呤 (BH4) 合成受损，这是一种影响苯丙氨酸和其他氨基酸代谢的疾病。苯丙氨酸代谢最常见的疾病是苯丙酮尿症 (PKU)，它是由苯丙氨酸羟化酶缺乏引起的，导致无法将苯丙氨酸转化为酪氨酸。BH4 合成受损（通常是由于二氢蝶啶还原酶缺乏所致）也会影响此途径，因为 BH4 是苯丙氨酸羟化酶的必需辅因子；由此导致的苯丙氨酸及其神经毒性副产物升高会导致发育迟缓，类似于 PKU (选项 C)。\n\n然而，与 PKU 不同的是，BH4 合成受损会影响其他氨基酸途径，因为 BH4 也是参与必需神经递质生成的羟化酶的辅因子：\n\n酪氨酸转化为左旋多巴：左旋多巴是儿茶酚胺（多巴胺、去甲肾上腺素、肾上腺素）的前体，儿茶酚胺减少会导致额外的神经系统表现（例如，肌张力障碍、自主神经功能障碍）。\n色氨酸转化为血清素：血清素生成受损可导致情绪、食欲和睡眠失调。\n\n建议对 PKU 和 BH4 合成受损患者采用限制苯丙氨酸的饮食，但后者还需要补充 BH4。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项 A) 乙酰胆碱由胆碱和乙酰辅酶 A 通过胆碱乙酰转移酶在神经肌肉接头处合成。胆碱乙酰转移酶不需要四氢生物蝶呤作为辅因子。\n\n(选项 B) GABA 抑制中枢神经系统中的突触前传递，由谷氨酸脱羧形成，该反应由谷氨酸脱羧酶催化。该酶不需要四氢生物蝶呤作为辅因子。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency and its impact on neurotransmitter synthesis, specifically serotonin. The clinical vignette describes a patient with developmental delay and impaired tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis, requiring the examinee to identify the deficient substance.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that BH4 is a cofactor for enzymes involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters like serotonin. Therefore, impaired BH4 synthesis leads to decreased serotonin production, making serotonin the most likely deficient substance.",
