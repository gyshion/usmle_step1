  "explanation": {
    "en": "In this surgical specimen, a longitudinally opened portion of the intestine (identified by the laminar transverse folds) has another intestinal segment that is ischemic (ie, dusky appearance) within its lumen. This is diagnostic of intussusception, an invagination of a portion of the intestine into an adjacent segment. \n\nIntussusception classically occurs in children age 6 months to 3 years, often following a viral infection. Viral stimulation of lymphoid follicles within the small intestine (Peyer patches) can lead to hypertrophy of those areas, which can then act as lead points that become trapped by peristalsis and dragged into a distal portion of the intestine. The most common location is at the ileocecal junction, as in this patient, and is likely due to a dense concentration of Peyer patches in the terminal ileum. \n\nClassic presentation is characterized by periods of inconsolability with colicky abdominal pain correlating with waves of peristalsis at the affected site; air enema usually reduces the intussusception. If untreated, impaired venous return of the invaginated segment can lead to ischemia and necrosis of the intestinal wall. Late findings correlating to bowel ischemia include currant jelly stools (ie, containing blood and mucus) and signs of peritonitis (eg, severe pain, rebound tenderness) warranting urgent surgical intervention, as in this patient. \n\n(Choice A) Eosinophilic infiltration of the lamina propria within the mucosal layer of the intestines is characteristic of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. This typically presents with chronic abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, or diarrhea; peritoneal signs and invaginated intestinal segments would not be seen. \n\n(Choice C) Intraluminal bacterial overgrowth occurs when the small intestine is colonized by excessive microbes normally found in the colon. However, most patients are older adults with a history of motility disorders or pancreatitis, and symptoms include bloating and diarrhea. \n\n(Choice D) Clostridioides difficile infection causes neutrophilic infiltration of the colonic wall and may be complicated by peritonitis due to toxic megacolon. Invagination of the intestine would not occur. \n\n(Choice E) Pyloric stenosis is caused by smooth muscle hypertrophy at the gastric outlet and presents with vomiting in infants age 3-6 weeks. This patient's age and intestinal findings are inconsistent with this diagnosis. \n\nEducational objective: \nIntussusception, which presents with colicky abdominal pain, is characterized by telescoping of one intestinal segment into an adjacent one, most commonly at the ileocecal junction. Pathophysiology usually involves hypertrophy of intestinal lymphoid follicles (Peyer patches), which can act as lead points of the invaginated bowel.",
    "zh": "在此手术标本中，纵向打开的肠道部分（由层状横向褶皱识别）在其管腔内有另一个缺血的肠段（即呈暗淡外观）。这诊断为肠套叠，即部分肠道向相邻节段内套叠。\n\n肠套叠通常发生在6个月至3岁的儿童中，通常继发于病毒感染。病毒刺激小肠内的淋巴滤泡（Peyer斑）可导致这些区域肥大，然后这些区域可充当先导点，这些先导点会被蠕动捕获并拖入肠道的远端部分。最常见的位置是在回盲部，如该患者，这可能是由于末端回肠中Peyer斑的密集聚集。 \n\n典型表现的特征是阵发性难以安抚的绞痛性腹痛，与受累部位的蠕动波相关；空气灌肠通常可减轻肠套叠。如果未经治疗，套叠段的静脉回流受损可导致肠壁缺血和坏死。与肠道缺血相关的晚期发现包括果酱样便（即，含有血液和粘液）和腹膜炎体征（例如，剧烈疼痛、反跳痛），需要紧急外科干预，如该患者。 \n\n（选项A）肠道粘膜层内固有层的嗜酸性粒细胞浸润是嗜酸性粒细胞性胃肠炎的特征。这通常表现为慢性腹痛、恶心/呕吐或腹泻；不会看到腹膜体征和肠段套叠。 \n\n（选项C）管腔内细菌过度生长发生在小肠被通常在结肠中发现的过量微生物定植时。然而，大多数患者是老年人，有动力障碍或胰腺炎病史，症状包括腹胀和腹泻。 \n\n（选项D）艰难梭菌感染导致结肠壁中性粒细胞浸润，并可能因中毒性巨结肠而并发腹膜炎。不会发生肠道套叠。 \n\n（选项E）幽门狭窄是由胃出口的平滑肌肥大引起的，表现为3-6周龄婴儿的呕吐。该患者的年龄和肠道发现与该诊断不符。 \n\n教育目标：\n肠套叠表现为绞痛性腹痛，其特征是部分肠道向相邻肠段内套叠，最常见于回盲部。病理生理学通常涉及肠道淋巴滤泡（Peyer斑）的肥大，其可充当肠道套叠的先导点。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of intussusception, its etiology, presentation, and underlying pathophysiology related to lymphoid follicle hypertrophy. It also requires differentiating intussusception from other causes of abdominal pain in infants. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical scenario of intussusception based on the age, symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, peritonitis signs), and surgical findings. Then, identify the most likely underlying cause, which is hypertrophy of lymphoid follicles (Peyer patches) acting as lead points for the telescoping of the intestine.",
