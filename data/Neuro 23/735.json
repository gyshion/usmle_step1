    "en": "This patient with confusion, headache, fever, and nuchal rigidity likely has MENINGITIS. In bacterial meningitis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis typically shows elevated opening pressure, increased neutrophils, decreased glucose, and elevated protein. The characteristic appearance of any observed bacteria on CSF Gram stain provides preliminary identification of the pathogen and allows tailoring of antibiotic therapy (whereas cultures take time to grow).\n\nThe most common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults of all ages is Streptococcus pneumoniae, a lancet-shaped gram-positive cocci found in pairs. S pneumoniae meningitis often follows a pulmonary infection or mild upper respiratory tract infection that has weakened ciliary clearance and the epithelial barrier. Patients with immunocompromise (eg, alcohol use disorder, diabetes mellitus, asplenia) are at greater risk for bacterial meningitis.\n\n(Choice A) Encapsulated budding yeasts are characteristic of cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal infection primarily seen in those with profound immunocompromise (eg, AIDS). Patients typically have slowly progressive headache, low-grade fever, and confusion over a few weeks (not 1-2 days). Although most cases are marked by low CSF glucose and protein levels, CSF leukocytes are usually mildly elevated and predominantly mononuclear.\n\n(Choice C) Enteroviruses (nonenveloped single-stranded RNA viruses) are the most common cause of viral (aseptic) meningitis. Although patients with viral meningitis often have sudden-onset meningeal symptoms, CSF usually has normal glucose, mildly elevated protein (eg, to <150 mg/dL), and a leukocyte count <250 cells/mm³.\n\n(Choice D) Haemophilus influenzae is a gram-negative coccobacillus. H influenzae infection is less common now that vaccination with the Hib capsule vaccine (a protein capsule polysaccharide conjugate vaccine) has become widespread.\n\n(Choice E) Lyme meningitis, a tick-transmitted spirochetal infection, typically presents with a syndrome similar to viral meningitis. CSF analysis usually shows a lymphocyte-predominant meningitis with mild leukocyte elevation, minimal change in glucose, and slightly elevated protein.\n\nEducational objective:\nBacterial meningitis causes an increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neutrophil count and protein concentration as well as a decrease in CSF glucose. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia, otitis media, and meningitis in adults. S pneumoniae appears on Gram stain as lancet-shaped gram-positive cocci in pairs.",
    "zh": "该患者出现意识模糊、头痛、发烧和颈项强直，很可能患有脑膜炎。在细菌性脑膜炎中，脑脊液 (CSF) 分析通常显示开放压升高、中性粒细胞增加、葡萄糖降低和蛋白质升高。在脑脊液革兰染色中观察到的任何细菌的特征性外观提供了病原体的初步鉴定，并允许定制抗生素治疗（而培养需要时间才能生长）。\n\n所有年龄段成年人细菌性脑膜炎最常见的原因是肺炎链球菌，一种呈矛头状的革兰氏阳性球菌，成对出现。肺炎链球菌性脑膜炎通常继发于肺部感染或轻度上呼吸道感染，后者削弱了纤毛清除率和上皮屏障。免疫功能低下的患者（例如，酒精使用障碍、糖尿病、脾切除）患细菌性脑膜炎的风险更高。\n\n(选项 A) 有包膜的出芽酵母是隐球菌性脑膜炎的特征，这是一种主要见于严重免疫功能低下的患者（例如，艾滋病）的真菌感染。患者通常会在几周内出现缓慢进展的头痛、低烧和意识模糊（不是 1-2 天）。虽然大多数病例的特点是脑脊液葡萄糖和蛋白质水平低，但脑脊液白细胞通常轻度升高，且主要为单核细胞。\n\n(选项 C) 肠道病毒（无包膜单链 RNA 病毒）是病毒性（无菌性）脑膜炎最常见的原因。虽然病毒性脑膜炎患者通常有突发的脑膜症状，但脑脊液通常有正常的葡萄糖、轻度升高的蛋白质（例如，<150 mg/dL）和白细胞计数 <250 个/mm³。\n\n(选项 D) 流行性感冒嗜血杆菌是一种革兰氏阴性杆菌。现在，由于使用 Hib 荚膜疫苗（一种蛋白质荚膜多糖结合疫苗）的疫苗接种已得到广泛推广，因此流感嗜血杆菌感染已变得不那么常见。\n\n(选项 E) 莱姆病脑膜炎，一种蜱传播的螺旋体感染，通常表现为类似于病毒性脑膜炎的综合征。脑脊液分析通常显示以淋巴细胞为主的脑膜炎，伴有轻度白细胞升高、葡萄糖变化最小和蛋白质轻度升高。\n\n教育目标：细菌性脑膜炎导致脑脊液 (CSF) 中性粒细胞计数和蛋白质浓度增加，以及脑脊液葡萄糖减少。肺炎链球菌是成人社区获得性肺炎、中耳炎和脑膜炎的主要原因。肺炎链球菌在革兰染色中呈矛头状革兰氏阳性球菌对出现。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to diagnose bacterial meningitis based on clinical presentation and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, specifically identifying the most common causative pathogen in adults. It requires correlating CSF findings such as elevated opening pressure, pleocytosis with neutrophilic predominance, low glucose, and high protein with specific bacterial etiologies.\n\nTo solve this question, analyze the patient's symptoms and CSF results to determine the most likely diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Then, consider the typical morphology and common causes of bacterial meningitis in adults, particularly in the context of the patient's risk factors. Evaluate each option based on the characteristic features of the described pathogen and its associated meningitis.",
