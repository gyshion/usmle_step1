    "en": "A 28-year-old woman comes to the office due to a 4-month history of amenorrhea. She has also had a whitish nipple discharge from both breasts. The patient has taken several pregnancy tests at home that have been negative. She has also had increased fatigue, depressed mood, and weight gain over this time. The patient has had no headaches or vision changes. She has no prior medical problems and takes no medications. On physical examination, there is thinning of the outer third of the eyebrows. The thyroid is enlarged and nontender to palpation. Abdominal and pelvic examinations are normal. The skin appears dry. Laboratory results are as follows:\n\nBeta-hCG, serum negative\nThyroxine (T4) 2.5 µg/dL\nTSH 11.0 µU/mL\nProlactin 30 ng/mL (<20 ng/mL)\nAntithyroid peroxidase antibodies positive",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Her low thyroxine (T4), elevated TSH, and antithyroid peroxidase antibodies are further indicative of primary hypothyroidism from chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, there is a compensatory increase in hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) production as thyroid hormone levels fall, stimulating increased secretion of TSH by the pituitary.\n\nProlactin is regulated primarily by the inhibitory effects of dopaminergic neurons from the hypothalamus. However, lactotroph cells express TRH receptors, and TRH stimulates synthesis and release of prolactin. The elevated TRH levels in the pituitary in patients with primary hypothyroidism can therefore increase prolactin secretion and lead to hyperprolactinemia.\n\nIn premenopausal women, hyperprolactinemia can cause galactorrhea. Prolactin suppresses GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus, leading to reduced secretion of LH (and to a lesser extent FSH) and subsequent hypogonadism, anovulation, and amenorrhea. Symptoms in men are often nonspecific, but can include infertility, decreased libido, and impotence.\n\n(Choices A and B) The most common cause of primary hypothyroidism is chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. Most patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis produce thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies, but it is TRH (not the autoantibodies) that triggers prolactin release.\n\n(Choice C) Antidopaminergic drugs (eg, antipsychotics, metoclopramide) can reduce the inhibitory effect of dopamine on prolactin secretion and lead to hyperprolactinemia, but TSH has little effect on dopamine pathways.\n\n(Choice E) The stimulatory effect of TRH on pituitary lactotrophs is mediated by TRH receptors on lactotroph cells, not by effects on dopaminergic pathways. Overproduction of dopamine would inhibit lactotroph activity.\n\n(Choice F) Effects of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis on prolactin secretion are mediated primarily by TRH, not TSH.\n\nEducational objective:\nProlactin production is regulated primarily by inhibitory effects of hypothalamic dopaminergic pathways. However, prolactin secretion is stimulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). In patients with primary hypothyroidism, the increased production of TRH by the hypothalamus can lead to hyperprolactinemia.",
    "zh": "她的低甲状腺素 (T4)、升高的TSH和抗甲状腺过氧化物酶抗体进一步表明，她患有由慢性自身免疫性（桥本）甲状腺炎引起的原发性甲状腺功能减退症。在原发性甲状腺功能减退症患者中，随着甲状腺激素水平下降，下丘脑促甲状腺激素释放激素 (TRH) 的产生会代偿性增加，从而刺激垂体分泌更多的TSH。\n\n催乳素主要受下丘脑多巴胺能神经元的抑制作用调节。然而，泌乳素细胞表达TRH受体，TRH刺激催乳素的合成和释放。因此，原发性甲状腺功能减退症患者垂体中TRH水平升高可增加催乳素分泌，导致高催乳素血症。\n\n在绝经前妇女中，高催乳素血症可引起溢乳。催乳素抑制下丘脑分泌GnRH，导致LH（以及较小程度的FSH）的分泌减少，进而导致性腺功能减退、无排卵和闭经。男性的症状通常不特异，但可能包括不育、性欲减退和阳痿。\n\n（选项A和B）原发性甲状腺功能减退症最常见的原因是慢性自身免疫性（桥本）甲状腺炎。大多数桥本甲状腺炎患者会产生甲状腺过氧化物酶自身抗体，但触发催乳素释放的是TRH（而不是自身抗体）。\n\n（选项C）抗多巴胺能药物（如抗精神病药、甲氧氯普胺）可降低多巴胺对催乳素分泌的抑制作用，并导致高催乳素血症，但TSH对多巴胺通路几乎没有影响。\n\n（选项E）TRH对垂体泌乳素细胞的刺激作用是通过泌乳素细胞上的TRH受体介导的，而不是通过对多巴胺能通路的效应介导的。多巴胺过度产生会抑制泌乳素细胞的活性。\n\n（选项F）下丘脑-垂体-甲状腺轴对催乳素分泌的影响主要由TRH介导，而不是由TSH介导。\n\n教育目标：\n催乳素的产生主要受下丘脑多巴胺能通路的抑制作用调节。然而，催乳素的分泌受促甲状腺激素释放激素 (TRH) 的刺激。在原发性甲状腺功能减退症患者中，下丘脑产生的TRH增加可导致高催乳素血症。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and its influence on prolactin secretion, specifically in the context of primary hypothyroidism. It requires knowledge of the compensatory mechanisms involving TRH and its effect on lactotrophs.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the signs and symptoms of primary hypothyroidism (amenorrhea, galactorrhea, fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, thinning eyebrows, enlarged thyroid, elevated TSH, low T4, positive antithyroid peroxidase antibodies) and understanding that the elevated TRH in this condition stimulates prolactin secretion.",
