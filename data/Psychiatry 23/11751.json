    "en": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the office due to overwhelming anxiety and stress. The patient is an accountant and has been under increasing job-related pressure for the past 6 weeks due to an upcoming tax deadline. She says, \"The worst part is that I get really nervous all of a sudden and then feel shaky, dizzy, and nauseated and start to sweat. It happened while I spoke to my boss a few weeks ago, and I had to excuse myself.\" The patient is especially worried about having an episode during a work meeting, although she notes that her symptoms have also occurred while she was relaxing at home. She says, \"I've stopped going out with my friends because I never know when I'm going to feel this way.\" The patient has no significant medical history and does not use alcohol or drugs. Blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination and laboratory evaluation show no abnormalities.",

    "en": "This patient's repeated episodes of acute-onset anxiety accompanied by physical symptoms (shaking, dizziness, nausea, sweating) are characteristic of PANIC DISORDER. Diagnosis requires RECURRENT, UNEXPECTED PANIC ATTACKS, typically reaching a peak within minutes and followed by persistent CONCERN about ADDITIONAL ATTACKS and/or changes in behavior (eg, patient may restrict activities due to fear of an attack). Characteristic physical symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms. A key feature is that at least some of the attacks are SPONTANEOUS with no obvious trigger (eg, when an individual is relaxing or emerging from sleep [ie, nocturnal panic attack]).\n\n(Choice A) ACUTE STRESS DISORDER involves exposure to a traumatic event followed by development of characteristic symptoms (eg, re-experiencing, avoidance, arousal) lasting from 3 days to 1 month. Although this patient experiences work-related stress, her description of unexpected panic attacks at home makes panic disorder more likely. Adjustment disorder requires that symptoms develop in response to an identifiable stressor and do not meet criteria for another mental disorder.\n\n(Choice B) Although this patient experiences work-related stress, her description of UNEXPECTED PANIC ATTACKS at home makes panic disorder more likely. ADJUSTMENT DISORDER requires that symptoms develop in response to an identifiable stressor and do not meet criteria for another mental disorder.\n\n(Choice C) In GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER, individuals experience chronic, excessive worry for at least 6 months about multiple issues (eg, work, health, finances), which may or may not precipitate panic attacks. In panic disorder, the content of anxious thoughts is more specific (concern about having future panic attacks) and panic attacks are unexpected.\n\n(Choice E) Patients with SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER may experience panic attacks in response to social situations (identifiable stimulus) and fear negative evaluation by others rather than the panic symptoms themselves.\n\n(Choice F) SPECIFIC PHOBIA is characterized by fear of a specific object or situation, such as flying, heights, or animals. Panic attacks are triggered by the phobic stimulus and are not spontaneous.\n\nKey clinical pearls:\n\nPANIC ATTACKS are characterized by abrupt surges of intense fear or discomfort that reach a peak within minutes and are accompanied by physical symptoms. They can be EXPECTED (triggered by a known stimulus) or UNEXPECTED (occurring without an obvious trigger).\n\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF DSM-5 ANXIETY DISORDERS:\n\n- Social anxiety disorder (social phobia): Anxiety restricted to social & performance situations, FEAR OF SCRUTINY & EMBARRASSMENT.\n- Panic disorder: RECURRENT, UNEXPECTED panic attacks.\n- Specific phobia: Excessive anxiety about a SPECIFIC OBJECT or situation (phobic stimulus).\n- Generalized anxiety disorder: CHRONIC MULTIPLE WORRIES, anxiety, tension.",
    "zh": "该患者反复发作的、急性起病的焦虑伴有躯体症状（颤抖、头晕、恶心、出汗）是惊恐障碍的特征。诊断需要反复、意外的惊恐发作，通常在几分钟内达到高峰，随后持续担心会再次发作和/或行为改变（例如，患者可能因为害怕发作而限制活动）。特征性的躯体症状包括胸痛、呼吸短促、心动过速以及胃肠道和神经系统症状。一个关键特征是至少部分发作是自发的，没有明显的诱因（例如，当个人放松或刚从睡眠中醒来时[即夜间惊恐发作]）。\n\n(选项A) 急性应激障碍涉及暴露于创伤性事件，随后出现持续3天至1个月的特征性症状（例如，再体验、回避、唤醒）。尽管该患者经历了与工作相关的压力，但她对在家中发生意外惊恐发作的描述使惊恐障碍更有可能。适应障碍需要症状在对可识别的应激源的反应中发展，并且不符合其他精神疾病的标准。\n\n(选项B) 尽管该患者经历了与工作相关的压力，但她对在家中发生意外惊恐发作的描述使惊恐障碍更有可能。适应障碍需要症状在对可识别的应激源的反应中发展，并且不符合其他精神疾病的标准。\n\n(选项C) 在广泛性焦虑症中，个体对多个问题（例如，工作、健康、财务）至少持续6个月的慢性、过度担忧，这可能导致也可能不会诱发惊恐发作。在惊恐障碍中，焦虑想法的内容更具体（担心未来发生惊恐发作），并且惊恐发作是意外的。\n\n(选项E) 社交焦虑症患者可能会对社交场合（可识别的刺激）作出反应而出现惊恐发作，并且害怕他人负面评价，而不是惊恐症状本身。\n\n(选项F) 特定恐惧症的特征是对特定物体或情境的恐惧，例如飞行、高处或动物。惊恐发作由恐惧刺激触发，而不是自发的。\n\n关键临床要点：\n\n惊恐发作的特征是突然涌现的强烈恐惧或不适感，在几分钟内达到高峰，并伴有躯体症状。它们可以是预期的（由已知的刺激触发）或意想不到的（发生在没有明显诱因的情况下）。\n\nDSM-5焦虑症的鉴别诊断：\n\n- 社交焦虑症（社交恐惧症）：焦虑仅限于社交和表现场合，害怕被审视和尴尬。\n- 惊恐障碍：反复、意外的惊恐发作。\n- 特定恐惧症：对特定物体或情境的过度焦虑（恐惧刺激）。\n- 广泛性焦虑症：慢性多重担忧、焦虑、紧张。"

It requires understanding the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder, acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobia.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully analyze the patient's chief complaint and history, paying close attention to the nature of the anxiety episodes (onset, triggers, duration, associated symptoms), and the patient's concerns and behaviors. Compare these findings to the diagnostic criteria for each of the listed anxiety disorders to identify the most fitting diagnosis.",
