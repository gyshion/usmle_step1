    "en": "A 3-month-old boy is evaluated for large-volume diarrhea and failure to thrive. The patient was born via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 38 weeks gestation. His mother reports that the pregnancy was uncomplicated and there is no family history of gastrointestinal disease. Physical examination shows mild abdominal distension, muscle wasting, and pitting edema. Histochemical evaluation reveals absence of enteropeptidase activity in the proximal intestinal villi. ",

    "en": "Pancreatic enzyme activation {{exhibit_1}}\nAlthough chemical digestion of proteins begins in the stomach, the majority of enzymatic breakdown and absorption occurs in the small intestine. Dietary proteins exist predominately as polypeptides; in order to be absorbed, they must be hydrolyzed to tripeptides, dipeptides, and amino acids. Hydrolysis begins in the stomach with the activation of pepsin by hydrochloric acid; it continues in the proximal small intestine, catalyzed by the pancreatic enzymes trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase, and elastase.\n\nPancreatic enzymes, including trypsin, are secreted in their inactive forms. ENTEROPEPTIDASE, a duodenal brush border enzyme, is responsible for activation of trypsin from its inactive precursor, trypsinogen. Once active, trypsin functions to cleave peptide bonds in dietary proteins and activate the other pancreatic enzymes. Enteropeptidase deficiency leads to both protein and fat malabsorption as trypsin is required to activate enzymes required for both lipid and protein digestion. The disease causes diarrhea, failure to thrive, and edema (due to hypoproteinemia).\n\n(Choice A) Amylase is produced by the salivary glands and pancreas; it catalyzes the hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates to simple sugars.\n\n(Choice B) Bile salts are formed through bile acid conjugation with amino acids glycine and taurine. This increases their solubility, allowing them to aid in lipid digestion and absorption through the formation of micelles.\n\n(Choice C) Lactase is produced by the intestinal brush border and is responsible for the hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and galactose. Lactase non-persistence commonly develops during mid-childhood, resulting in lactose intolerance.\n\n(Choice D) Chief cells of the stomach release the inactive form of pepsin, pepsinogen. Exposure to hydrochloric acid in the stomach activates pepsin, initiating protein digestion.\n\n(Choice E) Secretin is a peptide hormone secreted by the S cells of the duodenum; it stimulates the secretion of bicarbonate from the pancreas and inhibits gastric acid secretion in the stomach. Neutralization of the acidic pH of food entering the duodenum from the stomach is necessary for the proper function of pancreatic enzymes.",
    "zh": "胰酶激活 {{exhibit_1}}\n虽然蛋白质的化学消化始于胃，但大部分酶促分解和吸收发生在小肠中。膳食蛋白质主要以多肽形式存在；为了被吸收，它们必须水解成三肽、二肽和氨基酸。水解始于胃，通过盐酸激活胃蛋白酶；它继续在近端小肠中进行，由胰酶胰蛋白酶、胰凝乳蛋白酶、羧肽酶和弹性蛋白酶催化。\n\n胰酶，包括胰蛋白酶，以其非活性形式分泌。肠肽酶是一种十二指肠刷状缘酶，负责将胰蛋白酶从其非活性前体胰蛋白酶原中激活。一旦激活，胰蛋白酶就会发挥作用，切割膳食蛋白质中的肽键并激活其他胰酶。肠肽酶缺乏导致蛋白质和脂肪吸收不良，因为胰蛋白酶需要激活脂质和蛋白质消化所需的酶。该疾病会导致腹泻、生长迟缓和水肿（由于低蛋白血症）。\n\n(选项 A) 淀粉酶由唾液腺和胰腺产生；它催化复杂碳水化合物水解为单糖。\n\n(选项 B) 胆汁盐通过胆汁酸与氨基酸甘氨酸和牛磺酸的结合形成。这增加了它们的溶解度，使它们能够通过形成胶束来帮助脂质的消化和吸收。\n\n(选项 C) 乳糖酶由肠刷状缘产生，负责将乳糖水解为葡萄糖和半乳糖。乳糖酶不耐受通常在中年儿童时期出现，导致乳糖不耐受。\n\n(选项 D) 胃的主细胞释放胃蛋白酶的非活性形式，胃蛋白酶原。暴露于胃中的盐酸会激活胃蛋白酶，启动蛋白质消化。\n\n(选项 E) 促胰液素是由十二指肠的 S 细胞分泌的肽激素；它刺激胰腺分泌碳酸氢盐并抑制胃中的胃酸分泌。中和食物从胃进入十二指肠的酸性 pH 值对于胰酶的正常功能是必要的。"

It assesses the understanding of protein digestion and the consequences of impaired trypsin activation.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that enteropeptidase activates trypsin.
