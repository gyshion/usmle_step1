    "en": "A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to left-sided weakness and slurred speech upon awakening 30 minutes ago. The patient was asymptomatic when he went to bed last night. Medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is a former smoker with a 30-pack-year history. Physical examination shows a right gaze preference, left lower facial droop, and hemiplegia and hemisensory loss on the left. CT scan of the brain reveals early infarction in the right middle cerebral artery territory with no acute hemorrhage. The patient is hospitalized for further management. Several hours later, he becomes progressively obtunded with elevated intracranial pressure. A repeat CT scan reveals edema in the region of acute infarction causing mass effect. Which of the following is the primary contributor to the pathogenesis of this patient's raised intracranial pressure?",

    "en": "This patient had a right hemispheric ISCHEMIC STROKE and developed altered mental status and increased intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to CEREBRAL EDEMA. The fixed volume of the skull necessitates that a significant increase in volume of any component of the CNS (eg, brain tissue, blood, cerebrospinal fluid) will raise ICP. This increased ICP can cause progressive NEUROLOGIC IMPAIRMENT through direct pressure-induced cell injury or mechanical damage due to brain herniation.\n\nIrreversible ischemic neural and glial cell injury initiates a sequence of chemical changes that promote edema:\n\n*   **Cytotoxic (ionic) edema** begins hours after the ischemic injury due to decreased ATP. The failure of ATP-dependent ion pumps, combined with the release of excitatory amino acids (eg, glutamate), leads to the accumulation of intracellular Na+ and water in neural and glial cells despite an intact blood-brain barrier.\n*   **Vasogenic edema** follows 24-48 hours later, when the release of inflammatory mediators disrupts the tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier, allowing proteins (eg, albumin) and water to enter the interstitial space. This vasogenic phase can cause persistent cerebral edema for weeks after the initial injury.\n\n(Choice A) Although a decrease in oncotic pressure can cause peripheral edema (eg, nephrotic syndrome), it is not a significant factor in the development of cerebral edema. Mannitol is used in the treatment of cerebral edema because it increases plasma oncotic pressure and temporarily disrupts the blood-brain barrier, allowing movement of fluid out of the CNS to decrease ICP.\n\n(Choice C) Inadequate absorption of cerebrospinal fluid at the arachnoid granulations can cause communicating hydrocephalus. Although this process raises ICP, ventriculomegaly would likely be prominent on CT scan.\n\n(Choice D) Increased hydrostatic pressure secondary to central venous thrombosis or hypertensive encephalopathy can cause cerebral edema and increased ICP. However, patients typically have gradually worsening headache before development of neurologic abnormalities.\n\n(Choice E) Gliosis is the process of repairing damaged tissue in the CNS by proliferating astrocytes and microglia. This process occurs slowly in the months to years after CNS injury and would not be expected to cause acute changes in ICP.\n\nEducational objective: The primary mechanism underlying cytotoxic (early) edema following cerebral ischemia is the accumulation of intracellular Na+ and water due to the failure of ATP-dependent ion transporters in hypoxic cells. Cerebral edema causes progressive neurologic damage by raising intracranial pressure, which can directly damage neural tissue or result in mechanical damage due to brain herniation. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有右半球缺血性卒中，继发于脑水肿，出现精神状态改变和颅内压升高（ICP）。颅骨的固定容积决定了中枢神经系统任何组成部分的体积显著增加（例如，脑组织、血液、脑脊液）都会导致ICP升高。这种ICP升高可能通过直接的压力诱导细胞损伤或脑疝引起的机械损伤导致进行性神经功能障碍。\n\n不可逆的缺血性神经元和神经胶质细胞损伤引发一系列促进水肿的化学变化：\n\n*   **细胞毒性（离子）水肿**在缺血性损伤后数小时开始，这是由于ATP减少所致。ATP依赖性离子泵功能衰竭，加上兴奋性氨基酸（例如，谷氨酸）的释放，导致神经元和神经胶质细胞内Na+和水的积聚，尽管血脑屏障完好。\n*   **血管源性水肿**在24-48小时后发生，炎症介质的释放破坏了血脑屏障的紧密连接，使蛋白质（例如，白蛋白）和水进入间质间隙。这种血管源性阶段可在最初损伤后数周内引起持续性脑水肿。\n\n(选项A) 尽管胶体渗透压降低可引起周围水肿（例如，肾病综合征），但它并不是脑水肿发展的重要因素。甘露醇用于治疗脑水肿，因为它可增加血浆胶体渗透压并暂时破坏血脑屏障，从而使液体从CNS移出以降低ICP。\n\n(选项C) 蛛网膜颗粒对脑脊液的吸收不足可引起交通性脑积水。尽管这一过程会升高ICP，但在CT扫描上，脑室扩张可能较为明显。\n\n(选项D) 中心静脉血栓形成或高血压脑病继发静水压升高可引起脑水肿和ICP升高。然而，患者通常在出现神经系统异常之前会出现逐渐加重的头痛。\n\n(选项E) 神经胶质增生是通过增殖星形胶质细胞和小胶质细胞来修复中枢神经系统受损组织的过程。这一过程在中枢神经系统损伤后数月至数年内缓慢发生，预计不会引起ICP的急性变化。\n\n教育目标：缺血性脑卒中后细胞毒性（早期）水肿的主要机制是由于缺氧细胞中ATP依赖性离子转运蛋白的功能衰竭，导致细胞内Na+和水的积聚。脑水肿通过升高颅内压引起进行性神经系统损伤，这可以直接损伤神经组织或导致脑疝引起的机械损伤。{{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology of cerebral edema following an ischemic stroke, specifically the role of ATP-dependent ion transporter failure in cytotoxic edema. It requires knowledge of the early mechanisms contributing to increased intracranial pressure after a stroke.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the acute presentation of stroke and the subsequent development of cerebral edema.
