    "en": "The most frequent CNS tumor in immunosuppressed patients is a primary CNS lymphoma. This CNS tumor is commonly associated with AIDS.\n\nPrimary CNS lymphomas appear microscopically as dense, cellular aggregates of uniform, atypical lymphoid cells. The majority of primary CNS lymphomas arise from B-cells. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common subtype. The cells of CNS lymphomas are commonly positive for the B-cell markers CD20 and CD79a.\n\nPrimary CNS lymphomas are universally associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The clinical presentation is non-specific. Mental status changes, seizures, or progressive focal neurologic deficits may occur. Most of CNS lymphomas are high-grade and respond poorly to chemotherapy.\n\n(Choice G) Meningiomas are not associated with immunosuppressive diseases, nor are they associated with EBV. Meningiomas are located adjacent to the brain surface and are attached to the dura mater.\n\n(Choice H) Craniopharyngiomas are located in the suprasellar region and can be calcified. Craniopharyngiomas can cause visual disturbances and endocrinopathies (such as hypopituitarism).\n\n(Choice I) Intracranial schwannomas are most commonly located at the cerebellopontine angle. They cause symptoms of CN VIII compression (hearing loss, tinnitus, loss of balance).\n\nEducational Objective:\nPrimary CNS lymphomas occur in immunosuppressed patients, such as those suffering from AIDS. These tumors arise from B cells and are universally associated with EBV. They are high-grade tumors with a poor prognosis.",
    "zh": "免疫抑制患者中最常见的中枢神经系统肿瘤是原发性中枢神经系统淋巴瘤。这种中枢神经系统肿瘤通常与艾滋病相关。\n\n原发性中枢神经系统淋巴瘤在显微镜下表现为密集、细胞聚集的均一、非典型淋巴样细胞。大多数原发性中枢神经系统淋巴瘤起源于B细胞。弥漫性大B细胞淋巴瘤是最常见的亚型。中枢神经系统淋巴瘤的细胞通常对B细胞标志物CD20和CD79a呈阳性。\n\n原发性中枢神经系统淋巴瘤与Epstein-Barr病毒(EBV)普遍相关。临床表现不特异。可能出现精神状态改变、癫痫发作或进行性局灶性神经功能缺损。大多数中枢神经系统淋巴瘤为高级别，对化疗反应差。\n\n(选项G) 脑膜瘤与免疫抑制性疾病无关，也与EBV无关。脑膜瘤位于脑表面附近，并附着于硬脑膜。\n\n(选项H) 颅咽管瘤位于鞍上区，可钙化。颅咽管瘤可引起视觉障碍和内分泌疾病(如垂体功能减退症)。\n\n(选项I) 颅内神经鞘瘤最常见于桥小脑角。它们引起CN VIII压迫的症状(听力损失、耳鸣、平衡感丧失)。\n\n教育目标：\n原发性中枢神经系统淋巴瘤发生在免疫抑制患者中，如患有艾滋病的患者。这些肿瘤起源于B细胞，并与EBV普遍相关。它们是高级别肿瘤，预后较差。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of CNS lymphomas, specifically primary CNS lymphoma in the setting of HIV/AIDS, including its association with EBV and typical histological features. It also tests the ability to differentiate it from other common brain tumors based on clinical presentation and association with immunosuppression.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key association between HIV/AIDS, a solitary brain mass, and the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the tumor cells. This combination strongly suggests primary CNS lymphoma, which is a common opportunistic tumor in immunocompromised individuals.",
    "zh": "此题考察对中枢神经系统淋巴瘤的认识，特别是HIV/AIDS情况下的原发性中枢神经系统淋巴瘤，包括其与EBV的关联以及典型的组织学特征。同时测试根据临床表现和与免疫抑制的关系将其与其他常见脑肿瘤区分的能力。\n\n解决此题，需要认识到HIV/AIDS、孤立性脑肿块以及肿瘤细胞中Epstein-Barr病毒(EBV)的存在之间的关键联系。这种组合强烈提示原发性中枢神经系统淋巴瘤，这是一种常见的免疫功能低下个体的机会性肿瘤。"
