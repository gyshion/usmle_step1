  "explanation": {
    "en": "Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive hemoglobinopathy. Affected patients must inherit 2 mutant genes for hemoglobin S (HbS), one from each parent. In order for an offspring of 2 parents without sickle cell anemia to be affected, both parents must carry the sickle cell trait. Any offspring resulting from such pairings will have a 1 in 4 chance of having sickle cell disease (SCD). This patient is a carrier of the sickle cell trait as she has a child with sickle cell anemia.\n\nHemoglobin electrophoresis, a type of gel electrophoresis, is used to determine if the patient's new husband also has sickle cell trait. Abnormal hemoglobin (eg, HbS), moves at a slower speed than normal hemoglobin due to the replacement of glutamic acid by valine. The husband's test results combined with the maternal family history will determine the risk that future offspring will inherit sickle cell anemia. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) The chorionic villi are part of the placenta and, as such, are fetal tissue. Once fetal DNA is obtained, DNA sequencing can be performed to evaluate for sickle cell mutation. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) can be performed at 10-14 weeks gestation. However, it is relatively invasive and carries a risk of miscarriage, spotting/bleeding, infection, and other complications. CVS is not helpful to a patient who wishes to determine her risk prior to conception.\n\n(Choice B) It is not necessary to perform maternal hemoglobin electrophoresis as it has been established from this patient's history that she has sickle cell trait.\n\n(Choice C) Northern blots use electrophoresis to separate RNA by size, followed by the application of a DNA probe to detect a specific RNA molecule. This allows for the quantification of the RNA expression of specific genes. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a more appropriate test for SCD as it involves the separation of protein (eg, hemoglobin) rather than RNA.\n\n(Choice E) A karyotype is a visual analysis of all the chromosomes in a cell ordered by size and stained to reveal chromosomal banding. SCD results from a single nucleotide mutation, not from any abnormality in overall chromosome structure. Disorders due to chromosomal abnormalities include Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY), Turner syndrome (45,XO) and trisomy disorders. {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "镰状细胞性贫血是一种常染色体隐性血红蛋白病。受影响的患者必须从父母双方各遗传一个血红蛋白S（HbS）突变基因。为了使没有镰状细胞性贫血的父母所生的后代受到影响，父母双方都必须携带镰状细胞性状。任何由这种配对产生的后代都有 1/4 的机会患有镰状细胞病 (SCD)。这位患者是镰状细胞性状的携带者，因为她有一个患有镰状细胞性贫血的孩子。\n\n血红蛋白电泳是一种凝胶电泳，用于确定患者的新婚丈夫是否也有镰状细胞性状。异常血红蛋白（例如，HbS）的移动速度比正常血红蛋白慢，这是由于谷氨酸被缬氨酸取代。丈夫的检测结果结合母亲的家族史将决定未来后代患上镰状细胞性贫血的风险。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n（选项 A）绒毛是胎盘的一部分，因此是胎儿组织。一旦获得胎儿 DNA，就可以进行 DNA 测序以评估镰状细胞突变。绒毛取样 (CVS) 可以在妊娠 10-14 周时进行。然而，它具有相对的侵入性，并伴有流产、点滴/出血、感染和其他并发症的风险。对于希望在怀孕前确定其风险的患者，CVS 无济于事。\n\n（选项 B）没有必要进行母亲血红蛋白电泳，因为从这位患者的病史中已经确定她有镰状细胞性状。\n\n（选项 C）Northern 印迹使用电泳按大小分离 RNA，然后应用 DNA 探针来检测特定的 RNA 分子。这允许量化特定基因的 RNA 表达。血红蛋白电泳是 SCD 更合适的检测方法，因为它涉及分离蛋白质（例如，血红蛋白）而不是 RNA。\n\n（选项 E）核型分析是对细胞中所有染色体按大小排序并染色以显示染色体带的视觉分析。SCD 源于单个核苷酸突变，而不是整体染色体结构的任何异常。由于染色体异常引起的疾病包括克氏综合征 (47,XXY)、特纳综合征 (45,XO) 和三体综合征。{{exhibit_3}}"
