    "en": "A 76-year-old woman is brought to the hospital after her daughter found her unresponsive in the morning. The patient and her daughter walked extensively during a family outing the previous day; the patient then skipped dinner and went to bed as soon as they returned home. Medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with an oral medication. Blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg and pulse is 102/min. The patient is diaphoretic and responds only to pain. Blood glucose is 34 mg/dL. Her condition rapidly improves after administration of an intravenous bolus of dextrose, but she becomes confused again several hours later. Repeat blood glucose is 39 mg/dL.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's persistent hypoglycemia indicates excessive insulin secretion caused by her diabetes medication, which is most likely a sulfonylurea (eg, glyburide, glimepiride). Sulfonylureas bind to a receptor on pancreatic beta cells and inhibit the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, altering the cell's resting potential and resulting in calcium influx stimulating exocytosis of insulin secretory granules. The increased insulin secretion occurs independent of blood glucose concentrations (ie, even when blood glucose concentrations are low).\n\nHypoglycemia with sulfonylureas can be induced by exercise, missed meals, or initiation of additional antidiabetic medications. The risk is greater in the elderly population and in patients with chronic kidney disease or hepatic impairment (due to slower drug metabolism and clearance). The hypoglycemia may reoccur following successful initial treatment until the drug has been fully cleared.\n\n(Choice A) Acarbose is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that decreases intestinal carbohydrate digestion and glucose absorption, thereby blunting postprandial hyperglycemia. It is not associated with hypoglycemia because the medication does not induce insulin secretion.\n\n(Choice C) Metformin is a biguanide that decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis and intestinal glucose absorption and increases peripheral glucose uptake and use. Because metformin does not increase endogenous insulin production, it is not associated with hypoglycemia.\n\n(Choice D) Thiazolidinediones (eg, pioglitazone) increase insulin sensitivity by increasing glucose use and decreasing glucose production in adipose tissue, muscle, and liver. Thiazolidinediones do not increase endogenous insulin production and therefore carry a low risk of hypoglycemia.\n\n(Choice E) Unlike sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (eg, sitagliptin) and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (eg, exenatide ) increase glucose-dependent insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. The effects on insulin release diminish as glucose levels approach normal (eg, fasting state), and therefore, hypoglycemia risk is very low.\n\nEducational objective:\nSulfonylureas (eg, glyburide, glimepiride) increase insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells independent of blood glucose concentration. These medications have a high incidence of hypoglycemia, especially in the elderly population.",
    "zh": "该患者持续性低血糖表明其糖尿病药物导致胰岛素分泌过多，这最可能是磺酰脲类药物（例如，格列本脲、格列美脲）所致。磺酰脲类药物与胰腺β细胞上的受体结合并抑制ATP敏感性钾通道，改变细胞的静息电位，导致钙内流，刺激胰岛素分泌颗粒的外吐。胰岛素分泌增加与血糖浓度无关（即，即使血糖浓度较低）。\n\n磺酰脲类药物引起的低血糖可能由运动、漏餐或开始其他降糖药物引起。老年人群和患有慢性肾病或肝功能不全的患者（由于药物代谢和清除较慢）的风险更大。在成功初始治疗后，低血糖可能会复发，直到药物被完全清除。\n\n（选项A）阿卡波糖是一种α-葡萄糖苷酶抑制剂，可减少肠道碳水化合物的消化和葡萄糖的吸收，从而减轻餐后高血糖。它与低血糖无关，因为该药物不诱导胰岛素分泌。\n\n（选项C）二甲双胍是一种双胍类药物，可减少肝脏糖异生和肠道葡萄糖吸收，并增加外周葡萄糖的摄取和利用。由于二甲双胍不增加内源性胰岛素的产生，因此它与低血糖无关。\n\n（选项D）噻唑烷二酮类药物（例如，吡格列酮）通过增加脂肪组织、肌肉和肝脏中葡萄糖的利用和减少葡萄糖的产生来提高胰岛素敏感性。噻唑烷二酮类药物不增加内源性胰岛素的产生，因此发生低血糖的风险较低。\n\n（选项E）与磺酰脲类药物不同，二肽基肽酶-4抑制剂（例如，西格列汀）和胰高血糖素样肽-1激动剂（例如，艾塞那肽）增加胰腺β细胞中葡萄糖依赖性胰岛素的释放。胰岛素释放的影响随着血糖水平接近正常而降低（例如，空腹状态），因此，低血糖风险非常低。\n\n教育目标：\n磺酰脲类药物（例如，格列本脲、格列美脲）通过胰腺β细胞增加胰岛素分泌，而与血糖浓度无关。这些药物具有高发病率的低血糖症，尤其是在老年人群中。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of different antidiabetic medications and their association with hypoglycemia, particularly focusing on sulfonylureas. It also assesses the ability to recognize the clinical presentation of hypoglycemia and identify the most likely causative agent in a patient with type 2 diabetes.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's symptoms as hypoglycemia and consider the medications that can cause it, especially those that stimulate insulin secretion independently of glucose levels.
