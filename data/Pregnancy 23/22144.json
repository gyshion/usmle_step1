    "en": "This patient presents with a constellation of findings suggestive of congenital syphilis. The patient delivered a preterm infant (32 weeks gestation) who was small for gestational age with low Apgar scores. The placenta was pale and enlarged, and the umbilical cord showed inflammation with abscess-like foci of necrosis surrounding the umbilical vessels. These findings, particularly the umbilical cord inflammation and necrosis in the setting of preterm delivery and a small-for-gestational-age infant, are highly indicative of congenital syphilis. Congenital syphilis is caused by transplacental transmission of Treponema pallidum spirochetes. In response to the infection, fetal inflammatory cells are recruited to the umbilical vessels, leading to cord inflammation and perivascular necrosis (necrotizing funisitis). Placental compromise can lead to fetal hypoxia and growth restriction. The placenta may appear grossly pale and enlarged with hydropic villi. Newborns with suspected congenital syphilis require non-treponemal testing (eg, rapid reagin test, VDRL) and affected infants require penicillin therapy to prevent late manifestations such as saddle nose, notched teeth, and Hutchinson's teeth. Routine prenatal care, including screening for and treating maternal syphilis, is crucial for prevention.\n\n(Choice A) ACE inhibitors can cross the placenta and are associated with fetal growth restriction, renal dysfunction, oligohydramnios, and neonatal respiratory distress. However, they do not cause umbilical cord inflammation with abscess-like foci of necrosis.\n\n(Choice B) Partial hydatidiform moles result from fertilization of an ovum by two sperm and can cause enlarged, hydropic placental villi with foci of trophoblastic proliferation. While hydropic villi can be seen, the characteristic umbilical cord inflammation and necrosis are not typical features of a molar pregnancy.\n\n(Choice C) Placenta accreta occurs when the placental villi implant on or invade the uterine myometrium. Placental examination typically reveals missing (retained) placental tissue and adherent myometrial fibers. This condition is not associated with umbilical cord inflammation and necrosis.\n\n(Choice D) Rh(D) incompatibility occurs when maternal anti-D antibodies attack Rh(D)-positive fetal red blood cells, leading to fetal anemia, growth restriction, and fetal hydrops (eg, pale, enlarged placenta). However, it does not cause umbilical cord inflammation with abscess-like foci of necrosis.\n\nEducational objective: Patients with an atypical delivery (eg, preterm, small for gestational age) require placental evaluation. Umbilical cord inflammation with abscess-like foci of necrosis suggests congenital syphilis (ie, spirochete infection with Treponema pallidum).",
    "zh": "该患者表现出一系列提示先天性梅毒的发现。患者分娩了一个早产儿（妊娠32周），该婴儿小于胎龄，Apgar评分较低。胎盘苍白且增大，脐带显示炎症，脐血管周围有脓肿样坏死灶。这些发现，特别是早产和小于胎龄婴儿的脐带炎症和坏死，高度提示先天性梅毒。先天性梅毒是由梅毒螺旋体通过胎盘传播引起的。为了应对感染，胎儿炎症细胞被募集到脐血管，导致脐带炎症和血管周围坏死（坏死性脐炎）。胎盘受损可导致胎儿缺氧和生长受限。胎盘可能外观苍白增大，伴有水肿绒毛。怀疑患有先天性梅毒的新生儿需要进行非梅毒螺旋体检测（例如，快速血浆反应素试验，VDRL），受影响的婴儿需要青霉素治疗以预防晚期表现，如鞍鼻、切牙和Hutchinson齿。包括筛查和治疗孕妇梅毒在内的常规产前护理对于预防至关重要。\n\n(选项A) ACE抑制剂可以穿过胎盘，并与胎儿生长受限、肾功能障碍、羊水过少和新生儿呼吸窘迫有关。然而，它们不会引起脐带炎症和脓肿样坏死灶。\n\n(选项B) 部分性葡萄胎是由一个卵子被两个精子受精引起的，可导致绒毛膜滋养细胞增殖的病灶，胎盘绒毛肿大、水肿。虽然可以看到水肿绒毛，但特征性的脐带炎症和坏死不是葡萄胎的典型特征。\n\n(选项C) 胎盘植入发生在胎盘绒毛植入或侵入子宫肌层时。胎盘检查通常显示胎盘组织缺失（残留）和粘附的肌纤维。这种情况与脐带炎症和坏死无关。\n\n(选项D) Rh(D)血型不合发生在母亲抗D抗体攻击Rh(D)阳性胎儿红细胞时，导致胎儿贫血、生长受限和胎儿水肿（例如，苍白、增大的胎盘）。然而，它不会引起脐带炎症和脓肿样坏死灶。\n\n教育目标：分娩异常的患者（例如，早产、小于胎龄）需要进行胎盘评估。脐带炎症伴脓肿样坏死灶提示先天性梅毒（即，梅毒螺旋体感染）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation and diagnosis of congenital syphilis, particularly focusing on the placental and umbilical cord findings associated with this infection. It requires differentiating congenital syphilis from other pregnancy complications that can lead to fetal compromise and abnormal placental findings.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully reviewing the clinical vignette for key findings such as preterm delivery, small for gestational age infant, and specific placental and umbilical cord abnormalities. The presence of umbilical cord inflammation with abscess-like foci of necrosis is a critical clue pointing towards an infectious etiology, specifically congenital syphilis, which should then be considered in the differential diagnosis.",
