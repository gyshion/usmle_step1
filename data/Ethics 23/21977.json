He has a 35-pack-year smoking history and reports that he continues to smoke about 10-15 cigarettes daily. Family history is significant for lung cancer in his mother. His father died following a stroke at age 65. When asked about whether he has considered quitting, the patient replies that he is not ready to stop smoking. He says, \"I know I probably should, but I'm just too stressed at work to give up my cigarettes right now. To be honest, I'm probably smoking closer to a pack a day.\"",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a family history of lung cancer and multiple risk factors for cardiovascular illness, including smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and family history of stroke. Although he states that he is NOT READY to quit smoking, he is ambivalent and aware that he probably should. An effective approach to patients who are not ready to quit is to explore their ambivalence (eg, worries about quitting vs not quitting), with the goal of enhancing the patient's internal motivation to make a change.\n\nBased on principles of motivational interviewing, the physician should acknowledge resistance to change and help the patient identify discrepancies between habits and long-term goals. Issues relevant to the patient's situation (eg, concern about his ability to manage work stress without tobacco) and other possible barriers (eg, fear of nicotine withdrawal, failure, or gaining weight; enjoyment of tobacco) should be explored in a nonjudgmental way. Concerns about not quitting, such as fear of long-term health risks, can then be elicited to highlight ambivalence. Once the patient has identified the potential benefits and barriers to quitting, the physician can target these specific issues (eg, education, counseling, medication).\n\n(Choice A) This response redirects the conversation to the benefits of quitting and fails to acknowledge or explore the patient's resistance to change and his personal barriers to quitting.\n\n(Choice B) Although this statement acknowledges the patient's stress and conveys optimism about his ability to quit, it fails to address his ambivalent feelings, which may cause the patient to feel misunderstood and judged for his reluctance to quit.\n\n(Choice D) This response explores the patient's understanding of specific health risks of smoking but misses the opportunity to develop the patient's internal motivation to quit.\n\n(Choice E) The physician should first explore the patient's personal concerns and barriers to quitting before discussing smoking cessation treatment options.\n\nEducational objective:\nFor patients who are not ready to quit smoking, it is helpful to explore their perspective about the pros and cons of continuing to smoke. Acknowledging resistance in a nonjudgmental manner while exploring ambivalence can help develop patients' internal motivation to change.",
    "zh": "这位患者有肺癌家族史，并且有多种心血管疾病的危险因素，包括吸烟、高血压、高脂血症和中风家族史。尽管他声明他还未准备好戒烟，但他内心是矛盾的，并且意识到他可能应该戒烟。对于尚未准备好戒烟的患者，一种有效的方法是探讨他们的矛盾心理（例如，对戒烟与不戒烟的担忧），目的是增强患者改变的内在动力。\n\n基于动机性访谈的原则，医生应承认对改变的抵抗，并帮助患者识别习惯与长期目标之间的差异。应以不带评判的方式探讨与患者情况相关的问题（例如，担心在没有烟草的情况下如何管理工作压力）和其他可能的障碍（例如，对尼古丁戒断、失败或体重增加的恐惧；享受烟草）。然后可以引发对不戒烟的担忧，例如对长期健康风险的恐惧，以突出矛盾心理。一旦患者确定了戒烟的潜在益处和障碍，医生就可以针对这些具体问题（例如，教育、咨询、药物治疗）。\n\n(选项 A) 这种回应将谈话转移到戒烟的好处上，并且未能承认或探讨患者对改变的抵抗以及他个人戒烟的障碍。\n\n(选项 B) 虽然这种陈述承认了患者的压力，并表达了他戒烟能力的乐观态度，但它未能解决他矛盾的感觉，这可能导致患者感到被误解和因为他不愿意戒烟而被评判。\n\n(选项 D) 这种回应探讨了患者对吸烟特定健康风险的理解，但错失了培养患者戒烟内在动力的机会。\n\n(选项 E) 医生应首先探讨患者个人对戒烟的担忧和障碍，然后再讨论戒烟治疗方案。\n\n教育目标：\n对于尚未准备好戒烟的患者，探索他们对继续吸烟的利弊的看法是有帮助的。以不带评判的方式承认抵抗，同时探索矛盾心理，有助于培养患者改变的内在动力。"
