  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Sexual history is an essential part of a patient's medical history but is a topic that may be uncomfortable for both patients and physicians. The best approach is to try to put the patient at ease by normalizing the sexual history as a routine component of the medical history. The physician's demeanor should convey that the sexual history is routinely obtained and necessary to provide good health care, similar to other key parts of the physician-patient interaction (eg, obtaining substance use history, physical examination) that might be experienced as intrusive in other contexts. By inquiring about sexual history in the same clinical and empathetic manner used for other aspects of a history and physical, physicians can place a patient at ease and create a trusting space in which a patient can talk about potentially uncomfortable and intimate topics.\n\n(Choice A) It is inappropriate to defer this critical aspect of the history to a later date based on an unverified assumption of patient discomfort. The patient's responses may indicate the need for additional STD testing, which should not be deferred.\n\n(Choice C) This statement has a judgmental tone and implies that the patient's lack of openness might negatively impact her treatment. It is unlikely to facilitate open communication.\n\n(Choice D) Although it may be appropriate to explore a patient's discomfort with a particular topic, this question is premature because it relies on the unverified assumption that the patient is uncomfortable with the topic, which may make her defensive. Normalizing sexual history and explaining why it is important is more likely to be productive.\n\n(Choice E) It would be inappropriate to offer a diagnosis that requires a full evaluation and workup.\n\nEducational objective:\nSexual history is an essential part of gathering a complete medical history. This topic may be uncomfortable for both patient and physician, so it is important to normalize it as a routine part of a medical evaluation.",
    "zh": "性史是患者病史的重要组成部分，但对于患者和医生来说，这可能是一个令人不舒服的话题。最好的方法是尝试通过将性史作为病史的常规组成部分来缓解患者的紧张情绪。医生的举止应表明，性史是例行获取的，并且是提供良好医疗保健的必要组成部分，类似于医患互动中的其他关键部分（例如，获取药物使用史、体格检查），这些在其他情况下可能被视为侵入性的。通过以与其他病史和体格检查相同的方式进行临床和同情式的询问，医生可以让患者放松，并创建一个信任的空间，让患者可以谈论潜在的不舒服和私密的话题。\n\n（选项 A）根据未经证实的患者不适假设，将病史的这一关键方面推迟到以后的日期是不合适的。患者的反应可能表明需要进行额外的性病检测，这不应推迟。\n\n（选项 C）这种说法带有评判的语气，并暗示患者缺乏开放性可能会对其治疗产生负面影响。这不太可能促进开放的沟通。\n\n（选项 D）尽管探索患者对特定话题的不适可能合适，但这个问题为时过早，因为它依赖于未经证实的假设，即患者对该话题感到不舒服，这可能会让她产生防御心理。使性史正常化并解释其重要性更有可能富有成效。\n\n（选项 E）在需要全面评估和检查的情况下提供诊断是不合适的。\n\n教育目标：\n性史是收集完整病史的重要组成部分。对于患者和医生来说，这个话题可能令人不适，因此将其作为医学评估的常规部分使其正常化非常重要。"
