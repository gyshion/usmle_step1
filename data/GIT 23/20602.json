    "en": "This patient has acute pancreatitis {{exhibit_2}} presenting with abdominal pain, epigastric tenderness, and an elevated serum amylase level. In addition, he has severe hypertriglyceridemia, which is the likely cause of his pancreatitis. Triglyceride-induced pancreatitis (TIP) is usually seen in patients with triglyceride levels >1,000 mg/dL. The risk is elevated in patients with diabetes mellitus, obesity, or excessive alcohol use.\n\nTIP is initiated by impaired blood flow in pancreatic capillaries due to excessive concentrations of chylomicrons and VLDL particles. The resulting tissue ischemia releases pancreatic lipases into the plasma, hydrolyzing triglycerides to yield very high local concentrations of inflammatory free fatty acids.\n\nManagement of TIP requires rapid lowering of triglyceride levels, often with an Insulin infusion. Insulin upregulates lipoprotein lipase, which hydrolyzes triglycerides in chylomicrons and VLDL; the liberated fatty acids are largely taken up and esterified in adipose tissue, and plasma triglyceride levels are lowered. In addition, insulin reduces the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase in adipose tissue (Choice B), suppressing the release of fatty acids.\n\n(Choice A) AMP-activated protein kinase (AAPK) suppresses sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, leading to decreased hepatic fatty acid synthesis and VLDL production. Metformin stimulates AAPK, leading to suppression of lipogenesis and lower circulating triglyceride levels. However, insulin does not increase AAPK activity.\n\n(Choice C) HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cholesterol production. Insulin increases the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, promoting increased cholesterol synthesis; increasing HMG-CoA reductase activity will not lower serum triglyceride levels.\n\n(Choice E) Pyruvate carboxylase catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, which can be used to drive lipid synthesis (citrate-malate shuttle) or diverted to gluconeogenesis. Insulin downregulates (not upregulates) its activity in the liver, leading to reduced gluconeogenesis and hepatic fatty acid production.\n\nEducational objective:\nTriglyceride-induced pancreatitis is initiated by impaired blood flow in pancreatic capillaries due to excessive concentrations of chylomicrons and VLDL particles. Insulin upregulates lipoprotein lipase (an enzyme that hydrolyzes triglycerides in chylomicrons and VLDL) in adipose tissue capillaries; the liberated fatty acids are taken up by adipose cells, lowering serum triglyceride levels. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有急性胰腺炎{{exhibit_2}}，表现为腹痛、上腹部压痛和血清淀粉酶水平升高。此外，他患有严重的甘油三酯血症，这很可能是其胰腺炎的原因。甘油三酯诱导性胰腺炎（TIP）通常见于甘油三酯水平>1,000毫克/分升的患者。糖尿病、肥胖或过量饮酒的患者风险会增加。\n\nTIP是由胰腺毛细血管血流受损引起的，原因是乳糜微粒和VLDL颗粒浓度过高。由此产生的组织缺血导致胰腺脂肪酶释放到血浆中，水解甘油三酯，产生局部浓度非常高的炎症性游离脂肪酸。\n\nTIP的治疗需要快速降低甘油三酯水平，通常需要胰岛素输注。胰岛素上调脂蛋白脂酶，脂蛋白脂酶水解乳糜微粒和VLDL中的甘油三酯；释放的脂肪酸主要被摄取并酯化到脂肪组织中，降低血浆甘油三酯水平。此外，胰岛素可降低脂肪组织中激素敏感性脂肪酶的活性（选项B），从而抑制脂肪酸的释放。\n\n（选项A）AMP活化蛋白激酶(AAPK)抑制固醇调节元件结合蛋白-1和乙酰辅酶A羧化酶，导致肝脏脂肪酸合成和VLDL生成减少。二甲双胍刺激AAPK，导致脂质生成受到抑制和循环甘油三酯水平降低。然而，胰岛素不会增加AAPK的活性。\n\n（选项C）HMG-CoA还原酶催化胆固醇生成的限速步骤。胰岛素增加HMG-CoA还原酶的活性，促进胆固醇合成增加；增加HMG-CoA还原酶活性不会降低血清甘油三酯水平。\n\n（选项E）丙酮酸羧化酶催化丙酮酸转化为草酰乙酸，草酰乙酸可用于驱动脂质合成（柠檬酸-苹果酸穿梭）或转移到糖异生。胰岛素下调（而非上调）其在肝脏中的活性，导致糖异生减少和肝脏脂肪酸生成减少。\n\n教育目标：\n甘油三酯诱导性胰腺炎是由胰腺毛细血管血流受损引起的，原因是乳糜微粒和VLDL颗粒浓度过高。胰岛素上调脂肪组织毛细血管中的脂蛋白脂酶（一种水解乳糜微粒和VLDL中甘油三酯的酶）；释放的脂肪酸被脂肪细胞摄取，降低血清甘油三酯水平。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of triglyceride-induced pancreatitis and the mechanism of insulin in lowering triglyceride levels by stimulating lipoprotein lipase. It also tests understanding of the function of other enzymes and their regulation by insulin.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's hypertriglyceridemia as the likely cause of pancreatitis. Recall that insulin stimulates lipoprotein lipase, which hydrolyzes triglycerides, thereby reducing their levels and improving the patient's condition.",
    "zh": "本题考察对甘油三酯诱导性胰腺炎的认识，以及胰岛素通过刺激脂蛋白脂酶降低甘油三酯水平的机制。它还考察了对其他酶的功能及其受胰岛素调节的理解。\n\n要解决这个问题，要认识到患者的高甘油三酯血症是胰腺炎的可能原因。回想一下，胰岛素刺激脂蛋白脂酶，脂蛋白脂酶水解甘油三酯，从而降低其水平并改善患者的病情。"
