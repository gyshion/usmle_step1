    "en": "This patient with recurrent headaches and seizures has multiple flow voids in the left temporoparietal lobe demonstrated by MRI, consistent with a CEREBRAL ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATION (AVM) {{exhibit_2}}. \n\nAVMs are vascular malformations in which blood courses directly from arteries to veins, without passing through an intervening capillary bed. These tangled vessels with turbulent flow can lead to aneurysm development, bleeding, and damage to the surrounding brain. Microscopy of AVMs shows abnormal vessels, including irregular arteries and large veins with thickened walls, and gliotic brain tissue. \n\nAVMs frequently present in children and young adults with headaches and seizures as well as intracranial hemorrhage (eg, intraparenchymal, subarachnoid hemorrhage). Some patients are initially asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally by imaging. A nest of abnormal vessels with \"bag of worms\" appearance may be seen on angiography. MRI may reveal prior hemorrhage and multiple dark flow voids, indicative of swift blood flow. \n\n(Choice A) Dense perivascular aggregates of atypical lymphoid cells are a histologic feature of primary CNS lymphoma, which is typically a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Although clinical symptoms may include seizures, it usually presents in older adults or immunocompromised patients. MRI would likely reveal an enhancing mass. \n\n(Choice B) Lipid-laden macrophages with phagocytized myelin debris are seen in the demyelinating plaques of multiple sclerosis. Symptoms are variable but commonly include unilateral visual disturbance (eg, optic neuritis) and focal sensory and motor deficits. MRI typically reveals periventricular white matter lesions. \n\n(Choice C) Histologic findings in cerebral *Toxoplasma gondii* infection include necrotic debris with surrounding inflammation, tachyzoites, and pseudocysts of bradyzoites. Although seizures and headaches are a frequent manifestation, CNS toxoplasmosis usually occurs in immunocompromised patients. Imaging would likely reveal ring-enhancing lesions. \n\n(Choice D) Necrosis surrounded by malignant cells (pseudopalisading necrosis) and microvascular proliferation are features of glioblastoma, a high-grade infiltrating astrocytoma. It commonly presents with seizures, headache, and neurologic deficits in middle-aged or older adults (rather than children). MRI would likely reveal a mass with central hemorrhagic necrosis, vasogenic edema, and possible extension to the contralateral hemisphere. \n\nEducational objective: \nCerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are vascular malformations histologically characterized by a tangle of abnormal vessels, including large veins with thickened walls and irregular arteries. AVMs may present with intracranial hemorrhage, headache, and/or seizures. Radiologic findings include abnormal vasculature with a \"bag of worms\" appearance and multiple dark flow voids. {{exhibit_3}}{{exhibit_4}}{{exhibit_5}}{{exhibit_6}}{{exhibit_7}}{{exhibit_8}}{{exhibit_9}}{{exhibit_10}}",
    "zh": "这位有反复头痛和癫痫发作的患者，在MRI显示其左侧颞顶叶有多发流空，这与脑动静脉畸形（AVM）相符 {{exhibit_2}}。\n\nAVM是一种血管畸形，血液直接从动脉流向静脉，而没有通过中间的毛细血管床。这些紊乱的血管伴有湍流，可导致动脉瘤形成、出血，并损害周围的脑组织。AVM的显微镜检查显示异常血管，包括不规则的动脉和血管壁增厚的大静脉，以及神经胶质增生脑组织。\n\nAVM常在儿童和年轻人中表现为头痛和癫痫发作以及颅内出血（如脑实质内、蛛网膜下腔出血）。一些患者最初无症状，通过影像学检查偶然诊断。血管造影可见“蠕虫包”样外观的异常血管巢。MRI可能显示既往出血和多发暗流空，提示血流迅速。\n\n(选项A) 非典型淋巴细胞的致密血管周围聚集是原发性中枢神经系统淋巴瘤的组织学特征，通常为弥漫性大B细胞淋巴瘤。尽管临床症状可能包括癫痫发作，但通常发生于老年人或免疫功能低下患者。MRI可能会显示增强的肿块。\n\n(选项B) 含有吞噬髓磷脂碎片的脂质丰富的巨噬细胞见于多发性硬化的脱髓鞘斑块中。症状各异，但通常包括单侧视觉障碍（如视神经炎）和局灶性感觉和运动功能障碍。MRI通常显示脑室周围的白质病变。\n\n(选项C) 脑弓形虫病感染的组织学发现包括坏死碎片伴周围炎症、速殖子和缓殖子的假包囊。尽管癫痫发作和头痛是常见的表现，但中枢神经系统弓形虫病通常发生在免疫功能低下患者中。影像学检查可能会显示环形增强病灶。\n\n(选项D) 被恶性细胞包绕的坏死（假栅状坏死）和微血管增生是胶质母细胞瘤（一种高级别浸润性星形细胞瘤）的特征。它通常在中年或老年人（而非儿童）中表现为癫痫发作、头痛和神经功能缺损。MRI可能会显示一个肿块，伴有中央出血性坏死、血管源性水肿，并可能延伸到对侧半球。\n\n教育目标：\n脑动静脉畸形（AVM）是一种血管畸形，其组织学特征为异常血管缠结，包括血管壁增厚的大静脉和不规则的动脉。AVM可表现为颅内出血、头痛和/或癫痫发作。影像学表现包括具有“蠕虫包”外观的异常血管和多发暗流空。{{exhibit_3}}{{exhibit_4}}{{exhibit_5}}{{exhibit_6}}{{exhibit_7}}{{exhibit_8}}{{exhibit_9}}{{exhibit_10}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), their clinical presentation (headaches, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage), and characteristic imaging findings (multiple flow voids, abnormal vasculature). It also tests the ability to differentiate AVMs from other conditions presenting with similar symptoms, such as CNS lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, toxoplasmosis, and glioblastoma. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of the clinical vignette (young patient, headaches, seizures) and the MRI findings (multiple flow voids). Consider the most likely diagnosis based on these findings, and then select the histopathological feature most consistent with that diagnosis. Rule out other options based on their typical clinical and imaging presentations.",
