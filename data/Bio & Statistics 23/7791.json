    "en": "DNA methylation refers to the addition of methyl groups to nucleotide residues (often adenine and cytosine) by DNA methyltransferase, an enzyme that uses S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) as the methyl group donor.\n\nDNA methylation is an epigenetic process by which eukaryotic organisms modify gene expression without altering the genetic code. For example, methylation of cytosine-guanine dinucleotide repeats (CpGs) in the promoter region of genes effectively silences transcription of those genes. Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked disorder caused by an increased number of CGG trinucleotide repeats on the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, leading to hypermethylation of cytosine residues and FMR1 inactivation.\n\nCytosine methylation is also used in genomic imprinting, a phenomenon in which an offspring’s genes are expressed in a parent-specific manner. For instance, an allele inherited from the father may be inactivated or “imprinted” by methylation so that only the allele from the mother is expressed.\n\n(Choices A and D) Aneuploidy refers to the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes and is the result of chromosomal nondisjunction during mitosis or meiosis.\n\n(Choice B) Epistasis is a phenomenon in which the allele of one gene affects the phenotypic expression of alleles in another gene.\n\n(Choice E) Pleiotropy refers to the phenomenon in which a single gene influences multiple phenotypic traits.\n\nEducational objective:\nGenomic imprinting refers to the phenomenon in which an offspring’s genes are expressed in a parent-specific manner. Genomic imprinting is caused by DNA methylation, an epigenetic process in which genes can be silenced by attaching methyl groups to cytosine residues in the DNA molecule.",
    "zh": "DNA 甲基化是指 DNA 甲基转移酶将甲基添加到核苷酸残基（通常是腺嘌呤和胞嘧啶）的过程，该酶使用 S-腺苷甲硫氨酸 (SAM) 作为甲基供体。\n\nDNA 甲基化是一种表观遗传过程，真核生物通过该过程修饰基因表达，而不会改变遗传密码。例如，在基因启动子区域中，胞嘧啶-鸟嘌呤二核苷酸重复序列 (CpGs) 的甲基化会有效地沉默这些基因的转录。脆性 X 综合征是一种 X 连锁疾病，由脆性 X 精神发育迟滞 1 (FMR1) 基因上 CGG 三核苷酸重复序列数量增加引起，导致胞嘧啶残基过度甲基化和 FMR1 失活。\n\n胞嘧啶甲基化也用于基因组印记，这是一种后代基因以亲本特异性方式表达的现象。例如，从父亲那里遗传的等位基因可能通过甲基化失活或“印记”，因此仅表达来自母亲的等位基因。\n\n（选项 A 和 D）非整倍体是指染色体数量异常，是细胞有丝分裂或减数分裂过程中染色体不分离的结果。\n\n（选项 B）上位性是一种现象，其中一个基因的等位基因会影响另一个基因中等位基因的表型表达。\n\n（选项 E）多效性是指单个基因影响多种表型特征的现象。\n\n教育目标：\n基因组印记是指后代基因以亲本特异性方式表达的现象。基因组印记是由 DNA 甲基化引起的，DNA 甲基化是一种表观遗传过程，通过将甲基附着到 DNA 分子中的胞嘧啶残基上，基因可以被沉默。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of genomic imprinting and the role of DNA methylation in this process. It requires understanding how methylation affects gene expression and its specific involvement in parent-specific gene expression patterns.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that DNA methylation is a key mechanism in genomic imprinting. Understand that imprinting involves silencing genes based on parental origin, and connect this to the enzyme's role in methylating cytosine residues.",
