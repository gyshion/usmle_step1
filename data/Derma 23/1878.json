Care staff members accompanying the patient report that she fell 3 days ago but has not mentioned any pain. No signs of injury were noted until a large area of discoloration was seen at the upper arm during bathing. Past medical history is unremarkable, and the patient takes no medications. Vital signs are normal. Skin examination findings are shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}. There is no associated warmth, and the patient shows no signs of discomfort during palpation of the affected area.",

    "en": "This patient has a large area of **ecchymosis** involving the upper extremity. Patients and caregivers often use the term \"bruise\" to describe a variety of hemorrhagic skin lesions. However, the specific visual appearance often gives clues to the etiology of the lesion.\n\nAn ecchymosis is a cutaneous or subcutaneous collection of **extravasated blood** measuring at least 1 cm in diameter. Ecchymoses can arise superficially without a history of noticeable trauma, but they frequently indicate a deep hemorrhage (hematoma) due to bony fracture, ligamentous rupture, or muscular injury. These lesions do not blanch under pressure because the red blood cells are not contained within the vasculature. Ecchymoses often pass through an evolution of color change (blue or red to brown, green, and yellow), which can be used to estimate the age of the injury. This property is especially useful in cases of suspected abuse when other historical details are unknown or inconsistent.\n\n(Choice A) Angiomas are chronic vascular malformations that most commonly appear as soft, well-demarcated, red or blue nodules. Capillary hemangiomas are usually small and superficial whereas cavernous hemangiomas are usually larger and more likely to involve deeper structures.\n\n(Choice C) Lentigines are small tan or brown macules most often seen on the sun-exposed skin of a middle-aged or elderly person.\n\n(Choices D and E) Petechia (<5 mm diameter) and purpura (5 mm to 1 cm) are cutaneous or subcutaneous collections of extravasated blood from small-vessel bleeding that are often associated with platelet dysfunction or capillary fragility. They occur most commonly in areas of increased venous pressure (eg, ankles, feet). Palpable purpura are an indicator of leukocytoclastic vasculitis.\n\n(Choice F) Telangiectasias are small, permanent dilations of superficial capillaries or venules. Telangiectasias will blanch under pressure and are commonly seen in aging, chronic solar damage, long-term glucocorticoid use, rosacea, and a variety of systemic disorders.\n\nEducational objective:\nEcchymoses frequently indicate a deep hemorrhage (hematoma) due to bony fracture, ligamentous rupture, or muscular injury. They do not blanch under pressure as the red blood cells are not contained within the vasculature. Ecchymoses often pass through an evolution of color change (blue or red to brown, green, and yellow), which can be used to estimate the age of the injury.",
    "zh": "该患者的上肢出现大面积的**瘀斑**。患者和护理人员通常使用“瘀伤”一词来描述各种出血性皮肤病变。然而，特定的视觉外观通常可以提供关于病变病因的线索。\n\n瘀斑是皮肤或皮下**外渗血液**的聚集，直径至少为1厘米。瘀斑可以在没有明显外伤史的情况下浅表出现，但它们经常表明由于骨折、韧带断裂或肌肉损伤引起的深层出血（血肿）。这些病变在受到压力时不会变白，因为红细胞没有被包含在血管系统中。瘀斑通常会经历颜色变化（蓝色或红色变为棕色、绿色和黄色），这可以用来估计损伤的年龄。此属性在怀疑虐待的情况下特别有用，因为其他病史细节未知或不一致。\n\n（选项 A）血管瘤是慢性血管畸形，最常表现为柔软、边界清晰的红色或蓝色结节。毛细血管性血管瘤通常较小且表浅，而海绵状血管瘤通常较大，更有可能累及更深层的结构。\n\n（选项 C）雀斑是小的棕褐色或棕色斑点，最常见于中年或老年人的日晒皮肤上。\n\n（选项 D 和 E）瘀点（直径<5毫米）和紫癜（5毫米至1厘米）是皮肤或皮下外渗血液的聚集，由小血管出血引起，通常与血小板功能障碍或毛细血管脆性有关。它们最常发生在静脉压力增加的区域（例如，踝部、足部）。可触及的紫癜是白细胞破碎性血管炎的指标。\n\n（选项 F）毛细血管扩张是浅表毛细血管或静脉的小而永久性的扩张。毛细血管扩张在受到压力时会变白，并且常见于衰老、慢性日光损伤、长期使用糖皮质激素、酒渣鼻和各种全身性疾病。\n\n教学目标：\n瘀斑经常表明由于骨折、韧带断裂或肌肉损伤引起的深层出血（血肿）。它们在受到压力时不会变白，因为红细胞没有被包含在血管系统中。瘀斑通常会经历颜色变化（蓝色或红色变为棕色、绿色和黄色），这可以用来估计损伤的年龄。"
