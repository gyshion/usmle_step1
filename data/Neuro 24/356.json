    "en": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother due to seizures, which are usually characterized by a blank stare and lip-smacking followed by generalized shaking. The patient occasionally bites his tongue during the episodes and feels confused afterward. The seizures have been refractory to various antiepileptic medications, and lamotrigine is prescribed. The patient should be instructed to seek medical care immediately if which of the following symptoms occurs?",

    "en": "Lamotrigine is an antiseizure medication that works by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels. It can be used to treat focal and generalized seizures and is also effective for bipolar disorder. Patients using lamotrigine often develop a benign rash; however, a potentially life-threatening rash due to Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) can also occur, particularly in children.\nSJS and TEN represent different end points along the same disease continuum: SJS manifests with skin detachment involving <10% of the body surface area; TEN has >30% involvement. Patients with SJS/TEN typically develop flu-like symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, myalgia), followed by extensive cutaneous and mucosal lesions. Histopathologically, lesions are characterized by epidermal necrosis and subepidermal bullae.\nThe first appearance of any rash requires discontinuation of the drug immediately because SJS/TEN and benign rash cannot be distinguished reliably. Other antiepileptic medications associated with SJS/TEN include carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin.\n(Choices A and C) Gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea) are relatively common with metformin, as well as some antiepileptic medications, but are usually not life-threatening.\n(Choice B) ACE inhibitors can cause a nonproductive cough secondary to elevated bradykinin and substance P levels; this adverse effect can be mitigated by switching to an angiotensin II receptor blocker.\n(Choice D) Gingival hyperplasia is a common adverse effect of phenytoin, appearing in about half of patients who have been taking the medication for 3-4 months. It occurs due to increased expression of platelet-derived growth factor, which causes the proliferation of gingival cells.\n(Choice F) Red-orange urinary discoloration is a harmless side effect of rifampin, a medication used for the treatment of tuberculosis.",
    "zh": "拉莫三嗪是一种抗癫痫药物，通过阻断电压门控钠离子通道发挥作用。它可用于治疗局灶性和全身性癫痫发作，对双相情感障碍也有效。使用拉莫三嗪的患者通常会发生良性皮疹；然而，也可能发生由Stevens-Johnson综合征 (SJS) 或中毒性表皮坏死松解症 (TEN) 引起的潜在危及生命的皮疹，尤其是在儿童中。\nSJS 和 TEN 代表同一疾病连续谱中的不同终点：SJS表现为皮肤脱离，涉及<10%的体表面积；TEN累及>30%。SJS/TEN患者通常会出现流感样症状（例如，发烧、不适、肌痛），随后出现广泛的皮肤和粘膜病变。组织病理学上，病变的特征是表皮坏死和表皮下大疱。\n任何皮疹的首次出现都需要立即停药，因为无法可靠地区分SJS/TEN和良性皮疹。与其他与SJS/TEN相关的抗癫痫药物包括卡马西平、苯巴比妥和苯妥英钠。\n（选项A和C）胃肠道症状（例如，腹痛、腹泻）在二甲双胍以及一些抗癫痫药物中相对常见，但通常不会危及生命。\n（选项B）ACE抑制剂可引起继发于缓激肽和P物质水平升高的非生产性咳嗽；这种不良反应可以通过换用血管紧张素II受体阻滞剂来缓解。\n（选项D）牙龈增生是苯妥英钠的常见不良反应，大约一半服用该药物3-4个月的患者会出现牙龈增生。它是由血小板衍生生长因子表达增加引起的，导致牙龈细胞增生。\n（选项F）红橙色尿液变色是利福平（一种用于治疗结核病的药物）的无害副作用。"
