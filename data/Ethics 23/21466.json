    "en": "A 23-year-old graduate student comes to the emergency department after being sexually assaulted by a man she met at a bar 5 days ago. The night of the incident, the patient recalls a man introducing himself and handing her a drink. Shortly afterward, she left with him and walked to her apartment, but she is unable to remember the remainder of the night. The following morning, the patient awoke to an empty apartment, and her clothes were strewn across the floor. She felt panicky and decided to take a shower to calm down. The patient mentions that she decided to come in for evaluation after talking to campus crisis services earlier today. She states she has not reported the incident to the authorities due to her hazy memory.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has experienced SEXUAL ASSAULT. Many patients who have been sexually assaulted do not seek medical attention. This hesitancy is typically due to fear of judgment with disclosure. Because physicians are often the first line of support for survivors of sexual assault, their response to the disclosure has a significant impact on patient comfort during the conversation and examination.\n\nThe initial statement made after a patient discloses sexual assault should be supportive, nonjudgmental, and patient centered, with emphasis on promoting safety and trust (eg, \"it's important that you feel safe here\"). Because sexual assault can make the survivor feel powerless (loss of control), the opening statement should also empower patients by allowing them to guide the evaluation and set the pacing (eg, \"please let me know if you need to stop or take a break at any point.\"). Direct questioning about the assault and its effects, which can be perceived as threatening or result in flashbacks and retraumatization, should be avoided initially (Choice C).\n\n(Choice A) Although a pelvic examination may be indicated (eg, forensic evidence collection, sexually transmitted disease testing), it should not be the focus of the initial statement after patients make a vulnerable disclosure of sexual assault. Adequate time should be spent reassuring safety and allowing patients to direct the pacing of the evaluation. In contrast, recommending that patients undergo a pelvic examination without first setting them at ease and discussing the indications and benefits may lead to retraumatization.\n\n(Choice B) Emergency contraception is important to address following sexual assault; however, it should be discussed with the patient after establishing rapport, performing the examination, and obtaining appropriate testing (eg, urine pregnancy test).\n\n(Choice E) Although trauma can affect memory, the most likely cause of this patient's hazy memory is the assailant's use of a mind-altering drug. In addition, the statement is dismissive of the patient's reason to not file a police report, and it may make her feel pressured to involve the police or feel guilty if she chooses not to.",
    "zh": "该患者遭受了性侵犯。许多遭受性侵犯的患者不会寻求医疗救助。这种犹豫通常是由于害怕在披露时受到评判。由于医生通常是性侵犯幸存者的第一道支持防线，他们对披露的反应对患者在谈话和检查中的舒适度有重大影响。\n\n在患者披露性侵犯后所做的初步声明应具有支持性、不带评判性，并以患者为中心，强调促进安全和信任（例如，“重要的是你在这里感到安全”）。由于性侵犯会使幸存者感到无助（失去控制），因此开场白也应赋予患者权力，让他们能够引导评估并设定节奏（例如，“如果你需要停止或在任何时候休息一下，请告诉我”）。最初应避免直接询问有关袭击及其影响的问题，因为这可能被视为威胁或导致闪回和再次创伤（选项 C）。\n\n（选项 A）虽然可能需要进行骨盆检查（例如，法医证据收集、性传播疾病检测），但这不应是患者进行性侵犯的脆弱披露后的初步声明的重点。应该花足够的时间来确保安全，并允许患者指导评估的节奏。相比之下，在没有先让患者安心并讨论适应症和益处的情况下，建议患者进行骨盆检查可能会导致再次创伤。\n\n（选项 B）紧急避孕在性侵犯后进行讨论很重要；然而，应在建立融洽关系、进行检查和获得适当检测（例如，尿妊娠试验）后与患者讨论。\n\n（选项 E）虽然创伤会影响记忆，但该患者记忆模糊最可能的原因是袭击者使用了精神改变药物。此外，该声明对患者不报案的原因不予理会，并且可能让她感到有压力要涉及警方，或者如果她选择不报案，会感到内疚。"
