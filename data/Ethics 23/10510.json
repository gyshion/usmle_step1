  "explanation": {
    "en": "The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule provides instructions on management of protected health information (PHI). The main goal of HIPAA is protection of patient privacy and confidentiality. A physician can respond to a family member's request for information only if the patient has specifically provided verbal or written authorization for release of information to the family member.\n\nDue to public health concerns, notifiable infections (eg, HIV, chlamydia, tuberculosis) are an exception to the Privacy Rule and should be reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); many states offer partner notification services by local health departments (rather than individual clinicians) to protect patient privacy. However, human papillomavirus infection (eg, genital warts) is not a notifiable infection, and PHI disclosure without patient consent (eg, partner notification) would be a violation of HIPAA.\n\n(Choice A) Asking the husband to put his wife on the phone to obtain a verbal release of information may inappropriately pressure the patient to consent to disclosure of her personal health information. The patient should be approached privately regarding release of information, which preferably should be obtained in writing.\n\n(Choice B) Requesting proof of the caller's identity is irrelevant as information cannot be released without the patient's authorization. Although HIPAA does not require proof of identity to respond to callers, providers may establish their own rules for verifying identity.\n\n(Choice D) Asking whether the patient's wife is aware that he is calling does not address the issue at hand, which is the requirement for a release of information prior to disclosure of medical information.\n\n(Choice E) It would be inappropriate for the physician to ask the patient's husband about his physical symptoms as they do not have a patient-doctor relationship at this time. Furthermore, discussing these symptoms may inadvertently violate the patient's confidentiality. Recommending that the husband seek medical evaluation for his symptoms would be reasonable.",
    "zh": "《健康保险流通与责任法案》(HIPAA)隐私规则提供了关于受保护健康信息(PHI)管理的指导。HIPAA的主要目标是保护患者隐私和保密。只有当患者明确提供了口头或书面授权允许向家庭成员披露信息时，医生才能回应家庭成员的信息请求。\n\n由于公共卫生方面的担忧，应向疾病控制与预防中心(CDC)报告需要上报的感染(如HIV、衣原体、结核病)；许多州通过当地卫生部门(而不是个别临床医生)提供伴侣通知服务，以保护患者隐私。然而，人乳头瘤病毒感染(如生殖器疣)不是一种需要上报的感染，未经患者同意披露PHI(如伴侣通知)将违反HIPAA。\n\n(选项A)要求丈夫让他的妻子接电话以获取口头的信息披露授权，可能不恰当地迫使患者同意披露她的个人健康信息。应该私下联系患者，告知信息披露事宜，最好以书面形式获得授权。\n\n(选项B)要求来电者提供身份证明是无关紧要的，因为未经患者授权，不得披露信息。虽然HIPAA不要求提供身份证明来回应来电者，但提供者可以制定自己的规则来验证身份。\n\n(选项D)询问患者的妻子是否知道他正在打电话，并没有解决手头的问题，即在披露医疗信息之前需要获得信息披露授权。\n\n(选项E)医生询问患者的丈夫关于他的身体症状是不合适的，因为他们目前没有医患关系。此外，讨论这些症状可能会无意中违反患者的保密性。建议丈夫就其症状寻求医疗评估是合理的。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of HIPAA regulations regarding the release of patient information to family members. It emphasizes the importance of patient consent and confidentiality.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the core principle of HIPAA, which is protecting patient privacy. Recognize that information can only be released with the patient's explicit consent, and consider the ethical implications of each response.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了关于向家庭成员披露患者信息的HIPAA法规知识。它强调了患者同意和保密的重要性。\n\n最好的方法是确定HIPAA的核心原则，即保护患者隐私。认识到只有在获得患者明确同意的情况下才能披露信息，并考虑每种回答的伦理影响。"
