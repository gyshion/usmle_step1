    "en": "A 58-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to a 3-hour history of abrupt-onset weakness and numbness of the right lower extremity, as well as urinary incontinence. Two months ago, the patient was hospitalized due to left-sided weakness that resolved spontaneously after several hours. At that time, MRI of the head and MR angiography of the head and neck were normal, but the patient was found to have atrial fibrillation. An oral anticoagulant was prescribed at discharge, but the patient has been nonadherent with therapy. Blood pressure is 162/94 mm Hg and pulse is 102/min and irregularly irregular. Physical examination shows weakness and sensory loss in the right lower extremity. Babinski sign is present on the right. Speech is normal, and there is no facial weakness. Examination of the right upper extremity and the left extremities is unremarkable. An embolic occlusion affecting which of the following vascular regions is the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms?",
    "zh": "一名58岁男性因右下肢突发性无力和麻木，伴有尿失禁，来到急诊科就诊，病程3小时。两个月前，该患者因左侧肢体无力而住院，数小时后自发缓解。当时，头部MRI和头颈部MR血管造影正常，但患者被诊断为心房颤动。出院时处方口服抗凝药，但患者未按时服药。血压162/94 mmHg，脉搏102次/分钟，不规则。体格检查显示右下肢无力和感觉缺失。右侧存在Babinski征。言语正常，无面部无力。右侧上肢和左侧肢体检查无异常。影响以下哪个血管区域的栓塞最有可能导致患者目前的症状？"

    "en": "This patient has had a stroke, resulting in motor and sensory deficits of the right leg (sparing the right arm). Based on the somatotopic organization of the brain (ie, homunculus), this is suggestive of a lesion affecting the medial portions of the left primary motor and somatosensory cortices. The patient's urinary incontinence is further suggestive of a lack of cortical inhibition of the micturition reflex, which occurs primarily in the frontal micturition center (medial frontal lobe). These areas are all supplied by the ANTERIOR CEREBRAL ARTERY. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nThe Circle of Willis is somewhat protective against ischemic injury because it provides a potential alternate pathway for cerebral arterial blood flow. The anterior communicating artery (ACom) provides an anastomotic pathway between the bilateral anterior cerebral arteries, which may limit the severity of infarction if occlusion occurs proximal to the ACom (Choice B). Therefore, in a symptomatic anterior cerebral artery stroke, it is more likely that the obstruction is located distal to the origin of the ACom, where collateral blood flow does not occur.\n\n(Choice C) The inferior division of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) supplies the lateral portions parietal and temporal cortices. Occlusion typically causes sensory deficits of the arm and face, with sparing of motor function. In addition, visual field defects, Wernicke aphasia (dominant hemisphere), and profound hemineglect (nondominant hemisphere) often occur.\n\n(Choice D) The superior division of the MCA impacts the frontal lateral cortex, resulting in motor and, sometimes, sensory deficits that impact the face and arm. Broca aphasia (dominant hemisphere) is common. Hemineglect (nondominant hemisphere) is variable.\n\n(Choice E) Occlusion of the proximal MCA (ie, MCA stem infarct) results in profound deficits due to the large area impacted. Deficits include hemiparesis, hemianesthesia, global aphasia (dominant hemisphere), hemineglect (nondominant hemisphere), gaze preference, and visual deficits (homonymous hemianopia). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有卒中，导致右腿出现运动和感觉障碍（右臂未受累）。基于大脑的体位组织（即，体感定位），这提示病变影响左侧初级运动皮质和体感皮质的内侧部分。患者的尿失禁进一步提示缺乏对排尿反射的皮质抑制，而这种抑制主要发生在额叶排尿中枢（内侧额叶）。这些区域均由大脑前动脉供血。{{exhibit_1}}\n\nWillis环在某种程度上可以保护免受缺血性损伤，因为它为脑动脉血流提供了一条潜在的替代途径。前交通动脉 (ACom) 提供双侧大脑前动脉之间的吻合途径，如果闭塞发生在 ACom 近端（选项 B），则可能会限制梗死的严重程度。因此，在有症状的大脑前动脉卒中中，梗阻更有可能位于 ACom 起始部的远端，此处不会发生侧支血流。\n\n（选项 C）大脑中动脉 (MCA) 的下分支为外侧顶叶和颞叶皮质供血。闭塞通常会导致手臂和面部出现感觉障碍，并保留运动功能。此外，常发生视野缺损、韦尼克失语（优势半球）和严重偏侧忽视（非优势半球）。\n\n（选项 D）MCA 的上分支影响额叶外侧皮质，导致影响面部和手臂的运动和（有时）感觉障碍。Broca失语症（优势半球）很常见。偏侧忽视（非优势半球）是可变的。\n\n（选项 E）近端 MCA（即，MCA 脑干梗死）的闭塞会导致由于受影响区域较大而出现严重的缺陷。缺陷包括偏瘫、偏身感觉缺失、全面性失语（优势半球）、偏侧忽视（非优势半球）、凝视偏向和视觉缺陷（同向性偏盲）。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cerebral artery anatomy and stroke syndromes, specifically the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and its clinical presentation. It also assesses understanding of the Circle of Willis and its role in collateral blood flow. \n\nTo solve this question, correlate the patient's symptoms (leg weakness and incontinence) with the brain regions supplied by each artery. Remember the homunculus and the location of motor and sensory representation for the lower extremities. Consider the impact of collateral circulation from the Circle of Willis.",
