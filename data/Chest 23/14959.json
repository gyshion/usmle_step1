    "en": "A 27-year-old woman comes to the office due to exertional dyspnea over the past 3 months. The patient initially had shortness of breath during exercise but now becomes dyspneic with routine activities. She has had no cough, fever, or leg swelling but has noticed increased fatigue over this time. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals a loud pulmonic component of S2 but is otherwise unremarkable. Chest x-ray is normal. Echocardiography shows elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular structure and function are normal. Which of the following patterns of chemical mediators is most likely present in this patient's pulmonary arteries?",
    "zh": "一名27岁的女性因过去3个月的劳力性呼吸困难前来就诊。患者最初在运动时出现呼吸短促，但现在日常活动也会出现呼吸困难。她没有咳嗽、发烧或腿部肿胀，但注意到这段时间以来疲劳感增加。患者不吸烟、不饮酒，也不使用违禁药物。生命体征在正常范围内。体格检查显示S2的肺动脉瓣成分响亮，但其他方面无异常。胸片正常。超声心动图显示肺动脉收缩压升高和右心室肥大。左心室结构和功能正常。以下哪种化学介质模式最有可能存在于该患者的肺动脉中？"

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This young woman with progressive dyspnea and fatigue and a loud pulmonic component of S2 on physical examination likely has PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH). PAH results from progressive remodeling of the small- and medium-sized pulmonary arteries/arterioles. Endothelial dysfunction leads to an increase in vasoconstrictive, proproliferative mediators (eg, endothelin, thromboxane A2) and a decrease in vasodilative, antiproliferative mediators (eg, nitric oxide, prostacyclin). The relative imbalance in these mediators leads to vasoconstriction and smooth muscle proliferation with intimal thickening of the vascular walls; consequently, there is increased pulmonary vascular resistance and elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. Over time, the right ventricle is unable to pump against the increased afterload, and right-sided heart failure develops.\n\nMedical therapy for PAH targets the mediator imbalance created by endothelial dysfunction. Endothelin receptor antagonists (eg, bosentan) are used to reduce vasoconstriction, while prostacyclin analogues (eg, epoprostenol) and nitric oxide-enhancing agents (eg, sildenafil) are used to promote vasodilation. All of these agents help reduce tissue proliferation. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices B, C, D, and E) These changes in the levels of prostacyclin, thromboxane, and nitric oxide are not consistent with the changes that occur in PAH.\n\nEducational objective:\nPulmonary arterial hypertension results from endothelial dysfunction that leads to an increase in vasoconstrictive, proproliferative mediators (eg, endothelin, thromboxane A2) and a decrease in vasodilative, antiproliferative mediators (eg, nitric oxide, prostacyclin). The relative imbalance in these mediators leads to vasoconstriction and intimal-wall thickening with a consequent increase in pulmonary vascular resistance.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), specifically the imbalance of vasoactive mediators. It assesses the understanding of how endothelial dysfunction leads to increased vasoconstrictive mediators (endothelin, thromboxane A2) and decreased vasodilative mediators (nitric oxide, prostacyclin).\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation suggestive of PAH and recall the changes in vasoactive mediators associated with the disease.
