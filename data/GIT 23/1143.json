    "en": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to diarrhea and a low-grade fever. He attends a day care center where other children have developed similar symptoms. The patient has no known medical conditions. He is up to date with age-appropriate vaccinations. The patient has not traveled abroad. Physical examination shows abdominal tenderness on deep palpation but no rigidity. Stool cultures are diagnostic for *Shigella sonnei* infection. The outbreak is reported to public health authorities and is traced to consumption of potato salad handled by a food worker who recently had a mild diarrheal illness. The organism responsible for this patient's infection initially invades the intestinal epithelium through {{exhibit_1}}",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Shigellosis is an infectious form of hemorrhagic diarrhea that can be caused by a variety of *Shigella* species (eg, *S dysenteriae, flexneri, sonnei*). *Shigella* invades cells within the intestinal epithelial barrier, including enterocytes and microfold (M) cells. M cells are found at the base of mucosal villi that overlie Peyer patches in the ileum, and normally transfer antigens from the gut lumen to the basal membrane via transcytosis. Macrophages and lymphocytes aggregate near a special pocket (microfold) at the base of M cells, where they can sample antigens and mount an immune response.\n\n*Shigella* most easily penetrates the epithelial barrier by passing through M cells. Once at the basolateral surface, *Shigella* can more efficiently enter enterocytes and then spread laterally into other epithelial cells without reentering the gut lumen (ie, actin-based motility). The bacterium also induces macrophage apoptosis, resulting in a massive inflammatory response that causes denuding and ulceration of the mucosa with subsequent BLOODY and MUCOID stools.\n\n**(Choice A)** Endothelial cells form the innermost lining of blood vessels. Shiga toxin produced by *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 and *S dysenteriae*, not *S sonnei*, can cause toxicity to renal endothelial cells, leading to hemolytic uremic syndrome. However, all *Shigella* species are transmitted via the fecal-oral route and initiate infection by disrupting the intestinal epithelial barrier.\n\n**(Choice B)** Enteroendocrine cells in the gastrointestinal tract secrete hormones such as somatostatin and cholecystokinin. They are not involved in the pathogenesis of *Shigella* infection.\n\n**(Choice C)** Goblet cells secrete mucus into the gut lumen, and mucous release is increased in inflammatory states, including *Shigella* diarrhea. However, goblet cells do not uptake bacteria.\n\n**(Choice E)** Paneth cells, which occur in small groups at the base of intestinal crypts, are both phagocytic and secretory, thereby providing first-line immune defense against microorganisms. They secrete lysozyme (an enzyme that dissolves the cell walls of many bacteria) and defensins (polypeptides with antimicrobial properties) but do not uptake *Shigella*.\n\nEducational objective:\n*Shigella* initially invades the intestinal epithelial barrier by passing through microfold (M) cells overlying ileal Peyer patches. Once at the basolateral mucosal surface, *Shigella* can more efficiently enter enterocytes and then spread laterally into other epithelial cells, causing cell death and ulceration with bloody/mucoid diarrhea.",
    "zh": "志贺菌病是一种感染性出血性腹泻，可由多种*志贺菌*物种引起（例如，*痢疾志贺菌、弗氏志贺菌、宋内志贺菌*）。*志贺菌*侵入肠上皮屏障内的细胞，包括肠细胞和微皱褶 (M) 细胞。M 细胞位于覆盖回肠中 Peyer 斑的粘膜绒毛的基部，通常通过转胞吞作用将抗原从肠腔转移到基底膜。巨噬细胞和淋巴细胞聚集在 M 细胞基部的特殊口袋（微皱褶）附近，在那里它们可以取样抗原并引发免疫反应。\n\n*志贺菌*最容易通过 M 细胞穿透上皮屏障。一旦到达基底外侧表面，*志贺菌*就可以更有效地进入肠细胞，然后横向扩散到其他上皮细胞，而无需重新进入肠腔（即，基于肌动蛋白的运动）。这种细菌还会诱导巨噬细胞凋亡，导致大规模炎症反应，导致粘膜剥脱和溃疡，随后出现血性、黏液性粪便。\n\n**(选项 A)** 内皮细胞形成血管的最内层。由*大肠杆菌* O157:H7 和*痢疾志贺菌*产生的志贺毒素，而非*宋内志贺菌*，可导致对肾脏内皮细胞的毒性，从而导致溶血性尿毒症综合征。但是，所有*志贺菌*物种均通过粪口途径传播，并通过破坏肠上皮屏障来引发感染。\n\n**(选项 B)** 胃肠道中的肠内分泌细胞分泌激素，如生长抑素和胆囊收缩素。它们不参与*志贺菌*感染的发病机制。\n\n**(选项 C)** 杯状细胞将粘液分泌到肠腔中，在炎症状态下（包括*志贺菌*腹泻）会增加粘液释放。但是，杯状细胞不摄取细菌。\n\n**(选项 E)** 潘氏细胞以小簇形式存在于肠隐窝的底部，既有吞噬作用也有分泌作用，从而提供针对微生物的一线免疫防御。它们分泌溶菌酶（一种溶解许多细菌细胞壁的酶）和防御素（具有抗菌特性的多肽），但不摄取*志贺菌*。\n\n教育目标：\n*志贺菌*最初通过穿过覆盖回肠 Peyer 斑的微皱褶 (M) 细胞来侵入肠上皮屏障。一旦到达基底外侧粘膜表面，*志贺菌*就可以更有效地进入肠细胞，然后横向扩散到其他上皮细胞，导致细胞死亡和溃疡，并伴有血性/黏液性腹泻。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathogenesis of Shigella infection, specifically the initial invasion of the intestinal epithelium via microfold (M) cells overlying Peyer patches. Understanding the mechanism of bacterial entry into the intestinal lining is crucial for understanding the disease process.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that Shigella utilizes M cells to cross the intestinal barrier. Eliminate options that are not involved in bacterial uptake or are primarily involved in other functions within the intestinal epithelium.",
