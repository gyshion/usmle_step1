    "en": "Total iron stores in the body are tightly regulated at the point of intake, with gastrointestinal absorption adjusted to match daily losses. HH is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by INCREASED INTESTINAL IRON ABSORPTION; because there is no specific mechanism to excrete unneeded iron, the excess iron (typically 0.5-1.0 g/yr) accumulates in the parenchymal organs (eg, liver, heart).\n\nHH is usually silent in early adulthood, manifesting only after >20 g of iron has accumulated in the body. Men typically begin to develop symptoms in their 30s and 40s. However, PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN have ongoing BLOOD (and iron) LOSSES due to MENSTRUATION, which partially offsets the excess iron absorption. Women therefore develop manifestations later, typically several years after menopause (ie, variable expressivity based on sex).\n\n(Choices A and C) Most patients with HH have inactivating mutations in the *HFE* gene that cause impaired hepcidin secretion. Disease development requires biallelic genetic mutations (ie, affecting both alleles); heterozygotes are unaffected. Although biallelic *HFE* inactivation is necessary to develop the condition, most patients (>70%) with biallelic mutations never develop HH (ie, the disease exhibits incomplete penetrance) due to genetic and environmental modifiers. However, this patient developed HH manifestations at a typical age for women, which would not be explained by heterozygosity or incomplete penetrance.\n\n(Choice B) Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and citric acid enhance the absorption of inorganic iron in the gastrointestinal tract and therefore might lead to earlier disease manifestations instead of slowing its onset.\n\n(Choice E) Frequent blood transfusions can also lead to iron overload and hemosiderosis (iron accumulation in parenchymal tissues). The opposite, therapeutic phlebotomy, is the preferred treatment for HH and has been shown to slow its progression.

    "zh": "体内总铁储存量在摄入点受到严格调节，胃肠道吸收会根据每日损失量进行调整。HH 是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是肠道铁吸收增加；由于没有特定的机制来排出不需要的铁，过量的铁（通常为 0.5-1.0 克/年）会在实质性器官（如肝脏、心脏）中积累。\n\nHH 通常在成年早期处于潜伏期，只有在体内积累了 >20 克铁后才会显现。男性通常在 30 多岁和 40 多岁时开始出现症状。然而，绝经前女性由于月经而持续发生失血（和铁流失），这部分抵消了过量的铁吸收。因此，女性的发病时间较晚，通常在绝经后几年（即，基于性别的可变表达）。\n\n（选项 A 和 C）大多数 HH 患者的 *HFE* 基因发生失活突变，导致铁调素分泌受损。疾病发展需要双等位基因遗传突变（即，影响两个等位基因）；杂合子不受影响。尽管双等位基因 *HFE* 失活是发展该病症所必需的，但大多数具有双等位基因突变的患者（>70%）从未患上 HH（即，该疾病表现出不完全外显率），这归因于遗传和环境修饰因素。然而，该患者在女性的典型年龄出现了 HH 表现，这无法用杂合性或不完全外显率来解释。\n\n（选项 B）抗坏血酸（维生素 C）和柠檬酸可增强胃肠道对无机铁的吸收，因此可能导致疾病更早出现，而不是减缓其发病。\n\n（选项 E）频繁的输血也可能导致铁超载和含铁血黄素沉着症（铁在实质组织中的积累）。相反，治疗性放血是 HH 的首选治疗方法，并已被证明可以减缓其进展。普鲁士蓝染色后的肝脏光镜检查如下图所示：{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), its autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, and factors influencing the age of onset, particularly the protective effect of premenopausal menstrual bleeding in women. It also tests understanding of the role of HFE gene mutations and iron absorption.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that HH is an autosomal recessive disorder. Consider factors that might delay iron accumulation in women compared to men, such as menstrual blood loss. Rule out options that would either not affect or accelerate iron accumulation.",
