    "en": "A 35-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to severe right leg pain. She is a concert pianist with no known medical issues. During rehearsal, she began experiencing cramping of the right foot that did not improve with stretching or rest. The pain quickly spread to her calf, and the patient now rates the pain as 9 out of 10 in intensity. On examination, the right foot and calf appear pale and cool compared with the left, and sensation is diminished. Right-sided dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are absent, and the popliteal pulse is barely palpable. Emergency embolectomy is performed and a gelatinous mass causing arterial occlusion is successfully removed. Histopathologic section of the mass is shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}. Which of the following is the most likely origin of this patient's embolus?",
    "zh": "一名35岁的女性因右腿剧烈疼痛被送往急诊科。她是一名音乐会钢琴家，没有已知的病史。在排练期间，她开始感到右脚抽筋，通过伸展或休息没有改善。疼痛迅速蔓延到她的腿肚，患者现在将疼痛的强度评为10分中的9分。体格检查显示，与左侧相比，右脚和腿肚苍白且冰凉，感觉减退。右侧足背动脉和胫后动脉搏动消失，腘动脉搏动勉强可触及。进行了紧急栓子切除术，成功切除了导致动脉闭塞的胶状肿块。肿块的组织病理学切片显示在展品{{exhibit_1}}中。以下哪项最可能是该患者栓子的来源？"

    "en": "This patient presented with ACUTE LIMB ISCHEMIA, as evidenced by the 6 Ps: pain, pallor, poikilothermia (coolness to touch), paresthesia, paralysis, and reduced or absent pulses. The ischemia resulted from SYSTEMIC EMBOLIZATION of a gelatinous mass, with histopathology demonstrating an amorphous extracellular matrix with scattered stellate myxoma cells in mucopolysaccharide ground substance; this is consistent with tumor fragments from an ATRIAL MYXOMA {{exhibit_2}}.\n\nMyxomas are the most common primary cardiac neoplasm. Approximately 80% of these benign tumors originate in the LEFT ATRIUM. Patients can initially present with nonspecific constitutional symptoms (eg, fatigue, low-grade fever, weight loss) or systemic embolization (eg, stroke, mesenteric ischemia, acute limb ischemia), as in this patient. In addition, the tumor can cause position-dependent obstruction of the mitral valve, leading to signs and symptoms that mimic MITRAL VALVE STENOSIS (eg, dyspnea, cough, mid-diastolic murmur).\n\n(Choices A and E) The aortic and mitral valves can be the source of systemic embolism due to vegetations from bacterial endocarditis or nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (Libman-Sacks endocarditis). However, only 5% of myxomas originate on the mitral valve and even fewer originate on the aortic valve.\n\n(Choice B) A complex atherosclerotic plaque or mural thrombus attached to the walls of the descending aorta can lead to systemic embolization to the kidneys, bowel, or lower extremities. However, myxomas very rarely originate from the aorta.\n\n(Choice D) A mural thrombus can originate in the left ventricular cavity in patients with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, especially with recent anterior wall myocardial infarction. Other than the left atrium, the right atrium is the most common site for myxoma development. It is quite rare for myxomas to originate in either ventricle.\n\nEducational objective: Myxomas are the most common primary cardiac neoplasm and approximately 80% originate in the left atrium. Patients may present with symptomatic mitral valve obstruction that may worsen with certain body positions, constitutional findings (eg, fever, weight loss), or systemic embolization (eg, stroke, mesenteric ischemia, acute limb ischemia).",
    "zh": "该患者表现为急性肢体缺血，表现为6个P：疼痛、苍白、变温（触觉冰凉）、感觉异常、瘫痪以及脉搏减弱或消失。缺血是由于胶状肿块的全身栓塞所致，组织病理学显示无定形细胞外基质，其中散在星形粘液瘤细胞，存在于粘多糖基质中；这与心房粘液瘤{{exhibit_2}}的肿瘤碎片相符。\n\n粘液瘤是最常见的心脏原发性肿瘤。大约80%的良性肿瘤起源于左心房。患者最初可能表现出非特异性的全身症状（如疲劳、低烧、体重减轻）或全身栓塞（如卒中、肠系膜缺血、急性肢体缺血），如本患者。此外，肿瘤可引起位置依赖性的二尖瓣梗阻，导致类似于二尖瓣狭窄的体征和症状（如呼吸困难、咳嗽、中舒张期杂音）。\n\n（选项A和E）主动脉瓣和二尖瓣可能是全身栓塞的来源，这归因于细菌性心内膜炎或非细菌性血栓性心内膜炎（Libman-Sacks心内膜炎）的赘生物。然而，只有5%的粘液瘤起源于二尖瓣，起源于主动脉瓣的甚至更少。\n\n（选项B）连接到降主动脉壁的复杂动脉粥样硬化斑块或壁内血栓可导致肾脏、肠或下肢的全身栓塞。然而，粘液瘤很少起源于主动脉。\n\n（选项D）壁内血栓可在严重左心室收缩功能障碍的患者中起源于左心室腔，尤其是在近期发生前壁心肌梗死的情况下。除了左心房，右心房是粘液瘤最常见的发生部位。粘液瘤起源于任一心室的情况非常罕见。\n\n教育目标：粘液瘤是最常见的心脏原发性肿瘤，大约80%起源于左心房。患者可能出现有症状的二尖瓣梗阻，这种梗阻可能因某些体位、全身表现（如发烧、体重减轻）或全身栓塞（如卒中、肠系膜缺血、急性肢体缺血）而加重。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cardiac myxomas, their typical location in the left atrium, and their potential for systemic embolization leading to acute limb ischemia. It also assesses the ability to recognize the histopathological features of a myxoma.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of acute limb ischemia and the description of a gelatinous mass. Recall that myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumor, predominantly found in the left atrium, and can cause systemic embolization.",
