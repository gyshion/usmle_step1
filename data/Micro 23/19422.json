    "en": "This patient's chronic cough, weight loss, cervical lymphadenopathy, and cavitary pulmonary lesions on chest imaging suggest active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis usually results in lifelong latent infection due to the formation of granulomas, which wall off the pathogen and limit spread. However, the formation and maintenance of granulomas rely on coordination between monocytes and T lymphocytes. Host conditions that weaken these aspects of immune function often significantly increase the risk of reactivation TB; these include the following:\n\n*   Chronic kidney disease is associated with impaired function of monocytes and the cell-mediated immune response due to uremia and hypoalbuminemia. Risk of TB is increased 6- to 50-fold in this population and is greatest in those with end-stage disease.\n*   Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is associated with immune impairment and alterations to cytokine signaling, which weaken the development and maintenance of granulomas. Risk of TB is greatest in those with chronic hyperglycemia (eg, this patient with hemoglobin A1c of 8.5%).\n\nIncreased risk of reactivation TB is also seen in those with immunosuppression (eg, HIV, immunomodulatory/glucocorticoid medications), substance abuse, malnutrition, and advanced age.\n\n(Choice A) A tall body habitus is often seen in Marfan syndrome. Although these individuals have an increased risk of spontaneous pneumothorax, manifestations would include acute shortness of breath and imaging evidence of air between the lung and chest wall.\n\n(Choice B) Patients who work with hot tubs and swimming pools can develop hypersensitivity pneumonitis due to inhalation of Mycobacterium avium, a nontuberculous mycobacterium. Although most cases are marked by acute dyspnea, chronic symptoms can occur. However, imaging would generally show patchy, ground-glass pulmonary infiltrates, not a cavitary lesion.\n\n(Choice C) Living with pets increases the risk of asthma due to increased exposure to allergens. Asthma is typically marked by recurrent bronchoconstriction with acute periods of dyspnea, wheeze, and cough. Chest x-ray may show hyperinflation and bronchial thickening but not cavitary infiltration.\n\n(Choice D) Travel to areas endemic for TB can increase risk of exposure and subsequent infection. Endemic regions include India, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia. Denmark has a low incidence of TB; it is unlikely that the patient acquired the infection during his visit to this country.",
    "zh": "该患者的慢性咳嗽、体重减轻、颈部淋巴结肿大以及胸部影像学检查显示的空洞性肺部病变提示活动性肺结核（TB）。接触结核分枝杆菌通常会导致终生潜伏感染，这源于肉芽肿的形成，肉芽肿将病原体隔离并限制其扩散。然而，肉芽肿的形成和维持依赖于单核细胞和T淋巴细胞之间的协调。削弱这些免疫功能方面的宿主状况通常会显著增加结核病复发的风险，其中包括：\n\n*   慢性肾病与由于尿毒症和低白蛋白血症引起的单核细胞功能和细胞介导的免疫反应受损有关。该人群中结核病的风险增加6至50倍，在终末期疾病患者中风险最高。\n*   控制不佳的糖尿病与免疫功能受损和细胞因子信号传导的改变有关，这会削弱肉芽肿的形成和维持。结核病的风险在患有慢性高血糖症的患者中最高（例如，该患者的血红蛋白A1c为8.5%）。\n\n在免疫抑制患者（例如，HIV、免疫调节剂/糖皮质激素药物）、药物滥用、营养不良和高龄患者中，也可见结核病复发的风险增加。\n\n（选项A）高大的体型常在马凡综合征中出现。虽然这些人自发性气胸的风险增加，但表现将包括急性呼吸急促和肺与胸壁之间有空气的影像学证据。\n\n（选项B）从事热水浴缸和游泳池工作的人可能会因吸入鸟分枝杆菌（一种非结核分枝杆菌）而患上超敏性肺炎。虽然大多数病例的特征是急性呼吸困难，但也会出现慢性症状。然而，影像学检查通常会显示斑片状、毛玻璃状的肺部浸润，而不是空洞性病变。\n\n（选项C）与宠物一起生活会因增加过敏原的暴露而增加哮喘的风险。哮喘通常以复发性支气管收缩为特征，伴有急性呼吸困难、喘息和咳嗽。胸部X线检查可能显示过度充气和支气管增厚，但没有空洞性浸润。\n\n（选项D）前往结核病流行地区会增加暴露和随之感染的风险。流行地区包括印度、撒哈拉以南非洲和东南亚。丹麦的结核病发病率较低；患者不太可能在访问该国期间感染。"
