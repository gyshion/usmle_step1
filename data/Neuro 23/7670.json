    "en": "This patient has a large pituitary adenoma (macroadenoma) {{exhibit_2}}. In addition to metabolic effects related to alterations in pituitary hormone production, large adenomas can cause symptoms due to compression of surrounding structures; mass effect headaches are common.\n\nBecause of the close approximation of the pituitary to the optic chiasm, pituitary tumors can cause compression of optic nerve fibers (CN II) as they decussate at the chiasm, leading to impaired vision in the temporal fields (ie, bitemporal hemianopia). Unusually severe or acute pituitary enlargement (eg, pituitary apoplexy) can also occasionally affect the oculomotor nerve (CN III), leading to diplopia.\n\n(Choice A) Facial (eg, Bell) palsy typically results from inflammation (eg, herpes simplex virus) or surgical injury to the facial nerve (CN VII).\n(Choice C) Pituitary adenomas are not associated with hemiparesis, which is more commonly caused by stroke.\n(Choice D) Unilateral ataxia would result from unilateral damage to the cerebellum or sensory pathways, not from a lesion in the pituitary.\n(Choice E) Upward gaze palsy occurs as a component of Parinaud (ie, dorsal midbrain) syndrome, which results from damage to the posterior commissure.\n\nEducational objective:\nLarge pituitary adenomas can cause bitemporal hemianopia due to compression of the optic chiasm. {{exhibit_3}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical manifestations of a large pituitary adenoma, specifically focusing on the neurological deficits caused by mass effect on adjacent structures.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves correlating the imaging findings of a pituitary macroadenoma with potential neurological deficits. Recognizing the anatomical proximity of the pituitary gland to the optic chiasm is crucial for identifying the most likely visual field defect.",
