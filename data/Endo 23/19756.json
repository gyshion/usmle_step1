    "en": "A 6-month-old boy is brought to the office for a well-child visit. He is babbling, sitting with support, and rolling over. The patient is exclusively breastfed and has not yet started solid foods. The parents note that he has been straining while passing stool, which has been hard in consistency, over the last few weeks. The patient was diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism based on newborn screening results, and levothyroxine was initiated at age 2 weeks. He also takes daily vitamin D and iron supplements. The patient has no other chronic medical conditions. Vital signs are normal for age. Weight gain is appropriate for age, but length has decreased from the 60th to the 40th percentile since the last visit. Physical examination is unremarkable. Thyroid function testing at age 4 months was normal. Results of routine follow-up laboratory testing are as follows:\n\nTSH 8.0 µU/mL\nFree thyroxine 0.3 ng/dL (normal: 0.5-2.3)",
    "zh": "一名6个月大的男孩因健康体检来到诊所。他正在咿呀学语，在支撑下坐着，并且会翻身。患者完全母乳喂养，尚未开始食用固体食物。父母注意到他在过去几周排便时一直很费力，大便呈硬块状。根据新生儿筛查结果，该患者被诊断为先天性甲状腺功能减退症，并在2周大时开始服用左甲状腺素。他每天还服用维生素D和铁补充剂。患者没有其他慢性病史。生命体征符合年龄。体重增长符合年龄，但自上次就诊以来，身高从第60百分位数下降到第40百分位数。体格检查无特殊发现。4个月大时进行的甲状腺功能检测结果正常。常规随访实验室检查结果如下：\n\n促甲状腺激素 (TSH) 8.0 µU/mL\n游离甲状腺素 0.3 ng/dL（正常值：0.5-2.3）"

    "en": "This patient with treated congenital hypothyroidism has elevated TSH and low free thyroxine (T4), findings concerning for ineffective therapy with synthetic thyroid hormone (ie, levothyroxine). The most common cause of inadequate thyroid hormone levels in infants with treated congenital hypothyroidism is rapid growth, which increases the physiologic need for thyroid hormone. Another common reason for ineffective therapy is decreased absorption of levothyroxine.\n\nCo-administration with various foods (eg, soy products) or drugs (eg, iron, calcium, antacids) can lead to poor intestinal absorption of levothyroxine. In this case, iron binding to levothyroxine in the gastrointestinal tract caused circulating levothyroxine levels to decrease, resulting in symptoms of hypothyroidism (eg, constipation, poor linear growth) and increased TSH production. Because this patient's thyroid function tests at age 4 months were normal, iron supplementation was likely started in the past 2 months to treat the physiologic waning of iron stores that occurs at this age. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice B) Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) deficiency is characterized by low total T4 but normal TSH and free T4 levels. Patients do not require treatment because they are asymptomatic and euthyroid.\n\n(Choice C) Excessive thyroid hormone supplementation would result in inhibition of TSH production and elevated T4 levels with signs of hyperthyroidism (eg, tachycardia, irritability, increased bowel movements).\n\n(Choice D) Deficiency of iodine, which is required for thyroid hormone synthesis, rarely causes hypothyroidism in resource-rich countries due to dietary iodine found in salt. Breast milk also provides adequate iodine for infants, making this diagnosis unlikely.\n\n(Choice E) Thyroid hormone resistance is caused by thyroid hormone receptor mutations and results in elevated TSH and T4 levels due to impaired feedback inhibition. Signs of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism can occur due to varying tissue sensitivity to thyroid hormones.\n\nEducational objective:\nCo-administration of levothyroxine with various foods (eg, soy products) and certain medications (eg, iron, calcium, antacids) can lead to poor intestinal absorption of levothyroxine and symptoms of hypothyroidism while on therapy. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该接受治疗的先天性甲状腺功能减退症患者TSH升高，游离甲状腺素(T4)降低，提示合成甲状腺激素（即左甲状腺素）治疗无效。在接受治疗的先天性甲状腺功能减退症婴儿中，甲状腺激素水平不足的最常见原因是快速生长，这增加了对甲状腺激素的生理需求。治疗无效的另一个常见原因是左甲状腺素吸收减少。\n\n与各种食物（如大豆制品）或药物（如铁、钙、抗酸剂）同时服用会导致左甲状腺素的肠道吸收不良。在这种情况下，铁与胃肠道中的左甲状腺素结合，导致循环左甲状腺素水平降低，导致甲状腺功能减退症的症状（如便秘、线性生长不良）和TSH产生增加。由于该患者4个月大的时候的甲状腺功能检查是正常的，所以很可能在过去的2个月里开始补充铁剂，以治疗该年龄段发生的铁储备的生理性衰减。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项B) 甲状腺素结合球蛋白(TBG)缺乏症的特征是总T4低，但TSH和游离T4水平正常。患者不需要治疗，因为他们无症状且甲状腺功能正常。\n\n(选项C) 甲状腺激素补充过量会导致TSH产生受到抑制，T4水平升高，并出现甲状腺功能亢进的症状（如心动过速、易怒、排便次数增加）。\n\n(选项D) 碘缺乏症是甲状腺激素合成所必需的，由于在盐中发现了膳食碘，所以这种疾病很少在资源丰富的国家引起甲状腺功能减退症。母乳也为婴儿提供充足的碘，因此这种诊断不太可能。\n\n(选项E) 甲状腺激素抵抗是由甲状腺激素受体突变引起的，由于反馈抑制受损，导致TSH和T4水平升高。由于组织对甲状腺激素的敏感性不同，可能会出现甲状腺功能减退症或甲状腺功能亢进的体征。\n\n教育目标：\n左甲状腺素与各种食物（如大豆制品）和某些药物（如铁、钙、抗酸剂）同时服用会导致左甲状腺素的肠道吸收不良，并在治疗期间出现甲状腺功能减退症的症状。 {{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of congenital hypothyroidism management, specifically the causes of ineffective levothyroxine therapy in infants. It requires understanding the impact of iron supplementation on levothyroxine absorption and interpreting thyroid function tests.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's history of congenital hypothyroidism and current lab values indicating inadequate treatment. Consider common causes of levothyroxine malabsorption, such as co-administration with iron supplements, and rule out other less likely etiologies based on the clinical scenario.",
