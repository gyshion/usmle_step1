    "en": "A 64-year-old man comes to the office due to progressive low back pain for the past several months that is beginning to interfere with his job. The patient describes pain in the lower back and buttocks, which worsens with prolonged standing or walking and improves with lying down. He also has occasional sharp, shooting pain that radiates down his right leg. The patient works as a greeter for a local supermarket and was recently given a written warning for taking too many breaks during his shift. He has a history of hypertension and osteoarthritis. Spine imaging reveals degenerative joint changes and a large osteophyte compressing the spinal nerve root exiting through the right neural foramen between the L5 and S1 vertebrae. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient has lumbosacral radiculopathy due to an osteophyte at the L5-S1 neural foramen resulting in compression of the L5 nerve root. Spinal nerves in the lumbosacral spine exit below their corresponding vertebral body level (eg, L5 nerve root exits between L5 and S1 vertebral bodies). However, because of the presence of multiple spinal nerve roots in the lumbosacral area (ie, cauda equina), nerve root compression can occur at different vertebral levels through 2 distinct mechanisms:\n\n- Spinal spondylosis: Degenerative changes and osteophyte formation can narrow the neural foramina. This leads to nerve root compression as it passes through the neural foramina (in this patient, an osteophyte is compressing the exiting L5 nerve root).\n\n- Vertebral disc herniation: A tear in the intervertebral disc annulus can lead to herniation of the nucleus pulposus. If this occurs laterally, it can compress the exiting nerve root as it passes through the neural foramina. However, if it occurs more centrally, it can protrude into the spinal canal and compress other nerves in the cauda equina that exit one or more levels below the area of herniation.\n\nL5 radiculopathy causes sensory loss and back pain that radiates down the leg in an L5 dermatomal distribution (eg, buttocks, lateral thigh and calf, dorsal foot). Weakness occurs in muscles innervated by fibers from the L5 spinal root, which include the tibialis anterior (foot dorsiflexion and inversion), peroneus (foot eversion), and extensor hallucis longus (great toe extension). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}\n\n(Choice A) The patellar (knee) reflex is mediated by the quadriceps muscle, which is innervated by L2-L4 nerve roots.\n\n(Choice B) Decreased rectal tone can be seen with damage to the pudendal nerve, which originates from the S2-S4 nerve roots.\n\n(Choice C) The skin overlying the inguinal region is innervated by fibers from the L1 spinal nerve root that travel in the ilioinguinal and genitofemoral nerves.\n\n(Choice E) Hip flexion occurs due to contraction of the iliopsoas, which is innervated by the L2-L4 nerve roots.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nSpinal nerves in the lumbosacral spine exit through the neural foramina that is below the corresponding vertebral body level (eg, L5 nerve root exits between L5 and S1 vertebral bodies) and can be compressed at the neural foramina due to osteophyte formation. In addition to back pain, L5 radiculopathy often presents with sensory loss over the lateral thigh, calf, and dorsal foot and weakness of great toe extension and foot dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion.",
    "zh": "该患者患有腰骶神经根病，是由于L5-S1神经孔的骨赘导致L5神经根受压。腰骶椎的脊神经从其相应的椎体水平下方穿出（例如，L5神经根从L5和S1椎体之间穿出）。然而，由于腰骶区域存在多条脊神经根（即，马尾），神经根受压可以通过2种不同的机制发生在不同的椎体水平：\n\n- 脊柱脊椎病：退行性变和骨赘形成可使神经孔变窄。这会导致神经根在穿过神经孔时受压（在该患者中，骨赘正在压迫穿出的L5神经根）。\n\n- 椎间盘突出：椎间盘纤维环撕裂可导致髓核突出。如果这种情况发生在侧面，它可以压迫穿过神经孔的穿出神经根。然而，如果它发生在更靠中心的位置，它可以突出到脊髓管中并压迫马尾中从突出区域下方一个或多个水平穿出的其他神经。\n\nL5神经根病会导致感觉丧失和腰痛，并沿着L5皮节分布的腿部放射（例如，臀部、大腿外侧和小腿、足背）。虚弱发生在由L5脊髓根的纤维支配的肌肉中，这些肌肉包括胫骨前肌（足背屈和内翻）、腓骨肌（足外翻）和拇长伸肌（大脚趾伸展）。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}\n\n（选项A）髌腱（膝盖）反射由股四头肌介导，股四头肌由L2-L4神经根支配。\n\n（选项B）直肠张力降低可见于阴部神经损伤，阴部神经源自S2-S4神经根。\n\n（选项C）覆盖腹股沟区域的皮肤由来自L1脊神经根的纤维支配，这些纤维沿腹股沟和股生殖神经走行。\n\n（选项E）髋屈曲是由于髂腰肌收缩引起的，髂腰肌由L2-L4神经根支配。\n\n教育目标：\n\n腰骶椎的脊神经通过神经孔穿出，该神经孔位于相应的椎体水平下方（例如，L5神经根从L5和S1椎体之间穿出），并且由于骨赘形成，可在神经孔处受压。除了腰痛，L5神经根病通常表现为大腿外侧、小腿和足背的感觉丧失，以及大脚趾伸展和足背屈、内翻和外翻无力。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of lumbosacral radiculopathy, specifically L5 nerve root compression, and its associated clinical findings. It requires understanding of spinal nerve root anatomy and dermatomal/myotomal distributions. \n\nThe best approach is to identify the affected nerve root (L5) based on the clinical scenario and then recall the muscles innervated by that nerve root. Knowing the dermatomal distribution can also help to rule out other options.",
