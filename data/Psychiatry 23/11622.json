    "en": "A 35-year-old woman comes to the office due to insomnia and fatigue over the past month. She has felt increasingly depressed, irritable, and worthless since being let go from her job 5 weeks ago. The week prior to her last menstrual period was particularly difficult, and she stayed in bed most of the day. Over the last month, the patient has lost 3.6 kg (8 lb) and has felt unmotivated and unable to concentrate on looking for new work. Other medical conditions include hypothyroidism and migraine headaches. The patient drinks 1 or 2 glasses of wine a few times a week and smokes marijuana once a month. Medications include levothyroxine and naproxen. Physical examination is normal. TSH level is 0.9 μIU/mL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Major depressive disorder\n\n* ≥5 of the following symptoms lasting ≥2 weeks (at least one symptom must be either depressed mood or loss of interest/pleasure):\n    * Depressed mood\n    * Loss of interest or pleasure\n    * Change in appetite or weight\n    * Insomnia or hypersomnia\n    * Psychomotor retardation or agitation\n    * Low energy\n    * Poor concentration or indecisiveness\n    * Thoughts of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt\n    * Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide\n    * No history of mania or hypomania\n    * Not due to substances or another medical condition\n\nThis patient's symptoms (eg, depressed mood, feelings of worthlessness, low energy, insomnia, weight loss, and poor concentration) lasting ≥2 weeks meets the criteria for MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD). The presence of MDD criterion symptoms for ≥2 weeks is all that is required for diagnosis, but the median duration of an MDD episode is approximately 6 months. Accurate diagnosis of MDD requires ruling out medical and substance-induced causes. Despite a history of hypothyroidism in this patient, her normal TSH level indicates that her hypothyroidism is adequately controlled with levothyroxine and would not be considered a medical cause of her depression (Choice C).\n\nPatients with sufficient depressive symptoms are diagnosed with MDD even if there is a clear psychosocial stressor that precipitated the depression (ie, this patient meets the criteria for MDD and therefore cannot be diagnosed with an adjustment disorder) (Choice A). In patients who do not meet the criteria for MDD, adjustment disorder with depressed mood may be diagnosed if sadness, distress, and functional impairment develop ≤3 months following a psychosocial stressor.\n\n(Choice B) This patient has no known history of hypomanic episodes required for a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder.\n\n(Choice E) Persistent depressive disorder is diagnosed when depressive symptoms have lasted ≥2 years. It includes both pure dysthymia and chronic major depression.\n\n(Choice F) Some women with mood disorders report that their symptoms worsen before their menstrual periods. However, in premenstrual dysphoric disorder, depressive symptoms must remit with the onset of menses and the diagnosis must be confirmed by daily prospective ratings over several cycles.\n\n(Choice G) In substance-induced depressive disorder, a substance (eg, drug of abuse, medication, toxin) is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance. The extent of this patient's substance use makes it an unlikely cause of her depressive disorder.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients with sufficient depressive symptoms are diagnosed with major depressive disorder even if there is a clear psychosocial stressor that precipitated the depression.",
    "zh": "重度抑郁症\n\n* 以下≥5个症状持续≥2周（至少一个症状必须是抑郁情绪或失去兴趣/愉悦感）：\n    * 抑郁情绪\n    * 失去兴趣或愉悦感\n    * 食欲或体重变化\n    * 失眠或嗜睡\n    * 精神运动迟滞或激越\n    * 低能量\n    * 注意力不集中或优柔寡断\n    * 感到自卑或不适当的内疚感\n    * 反复出现死亡或自杀的念头\n    * 无躁狂或轻躁狂病史\n    * 并非由物质或另一种医学疾病引起\n\n该患者的症状（例如，抑郁情绪、感到自卑、低能量、失眠、体重减轻和注意力不集中）持续≥2周，符合重度抑郁症（MDD）的诊断标准。确诊只需要符合MDD诊断标准症状≥2周，但MDD发作的中位持续时间约为6个月。准确诊断MDD需要排除医学和物质诱发的病因。尽管该患者有甲状腺功能减退症病史，但她正常的TSH水平表明她的甲状腺功能减退症已通过左甲状腺素得到充分控制，并且不会被认为是她抑郁症的医学原因（选项C）。\n\n即使患者有明显的心理社会应激源诱发抑郁症，如果患者有足够的抑郁症状，也会被诊断为MDD（即，该患者符合MDD的诊断标准，因此不能被诊断为适应障碍）（选项A）。对于不符合MDD诊断标准的患者，如果出现悲伤、痛苦和功能障碍在心理社会应激源后≤3个月内发生，则可诊断为伴抑郁情绪的适应障碍。\n\n（选项B）该患者没有双相II型障碍诊断所需的轻躁狂发作史。\n\n（选项E）当抑郁症状持续≥2年时，诊断为持续性抑郁障碍。它包括单纯性心境恶劣和慢性重度抑郁症。\n\n（选项F）一些患有情绪障碍的女性报告说，她们的症状在月经前会恶化。然而，在经前期烦躁障碍中，抑郁症状必须在月经开始时缓解，并且诊断必须通过对几个周期的每日前瞻性评级来确认。\n\n（选项G）在物质诱发的抑郁障碍中，一种物质（例如，滥用药物、药物、毒素）被判断为与情绪障碍有关。该患者的物质使用程度使其不太可能成为其抑郁障碍的原因。\n\n教育目标：\n即使有明显的心理社会应激源诱发抑郁症，如果患者有足够的抑郁症状，也会被诊断为重度抑郁症。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and the ability to differentiate it from other depressive disorders, adjustment disorders, and conditions caused by medical issues or substances. It emphasizes the importance of meeting specific symptom counts and durations while ruling out alternative etiologies.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully review the patient's symptoms against the DSM-5 criteria for MDD, paying close attention to the number and duration of symptoms. It is crucial to systematically exclude other diagnoses, such as adjustment disorder, depressive disorder due to a medical condition, substance-induced mood disorder, bipolar disorder, persistent depressive disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, by evaluating the presence or absence of their defining features.",
