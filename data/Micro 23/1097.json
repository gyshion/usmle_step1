    "en": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department with worsening somnolence, lethargy, and decreased urine output. The patient has no prior medical conditions but had abdominal cramps and diarrhea several days ago that later became frankly bloody. Physical examination shows mild pallor and moist mucous membranes. Laboratory studies reveal elevated blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. Peripheral blood smear shows fragmented erythrocytes.",

    "en": "Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a major cause of acute renal failure in children. It is characterized by the triad of renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Most cases occur due to underlying enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection, particularly with the O157:H7 serotype.\n\nEHEC is a gram-negative, enteric rod that acquires the ability to produce Shiga toxin from a lysogenic bacteriophage. Shiga toxin enters the cytosol of host cells and cleaves a protein motif off the 60S ribosomal subunit, which irreversibly halts host protein synthesis and causes cell death. Toxin-mediated injury to the colonic mucosa and the colonic capillaries causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. The absorption of Shiga toxin into the systemic circulation causes glomerular (renal insufficiency) and vascular (thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia) injury in a minority of patients, leading to HUS.\n\nThe primary reservoir for EHEC is the gastrointestinal tract of healthy cattle. Humans primarily acquire the organism after consuming contaminated, undercooked beef. Because low infectious doses (10-100 organisms) are required for disease, meatpacking facilities that process high volumes of ground beef are an important source of outbreaks. Other less common routes of transmission include person-to-person contact and fruits and vegetables contaminated with manure.\n\n(Choice A) Canned foods that are contaminated with Clostridium botulinum can be associated with foodborne illness due to the consumption of preformed botulinum toxin. Patients typically develop descending, symmetric paralysis.\n\n(Choices B and D) The consumption of preformed, heat-stable Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin causes self-limited nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping 1-6 hours after ingestion. Dairy (eg, custard), produce, meats, eggs (eg, mayonnaise), and salads are common culprits and are usually inoculated during preparation by a food handler.\n\n(Choice C) Bacillus cereus enterotoxin is classically associated with reheated rice. It causes a vomiting-predominant, foodborne illness that clinically resembles the illness seen with S aureus enterotoxin.\n\n(Choice E) Consumption of raw oysters can lead to infection with Vibrio parahaemolyticus (which causes voluminous watery diarrhea similar to cholera) and Vibrio vulnificus (which causes sepsis with high mortality), as well as other Vibrio infections.\n\n(Choice F) The consumption of raw eggs or incompletely cooked poultry can lead to Salmonella gastroenteritis, which usually causes watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and fever.\n\nEducational objective:\nEnterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is primarily contracted after eating undercooked ground beef. EHEC produces Shiga toxin, which causes hemorrhagic colitis and can lead to hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS is characterized by acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia; children age <10 are at greatest risk.",
    "zh": "溶血性尿毒症综合征 (HUS) 是儿童急性肾衰竭的主要原因。其特征是肾功能不全、血小板减少症和微血管病性溶血性贫血三联征。大多数病例是由于潜在的产肠出血性大肠杆菌 (EHEC) 感染引起的，特别是 O157:H7 血清型。\n\nEHEC 是一种革兰氏阴性肠杆菌，通过溶原性噬菌体获得产生志贺毒素的能力。志贺毒素进入宿主细胞的细胞质，并从 60S 核糖体亚基上切割一个蛋白质基序，从而不可逆地阻止宿主蛋白质的合成并导致细胞死亡。毒素介导的对结肠粘膜和结肠毛细血管的损伤会导致腹痛和血性腹泻。志贺毒素吸收到全身循环中，会在少数患者中引起肾小球（肾功能不全）和血管（血小板减少症、微血管病性溶血性贫血）损伤，从而导致 HUS。\n\nEHEC 的主要宿主是健康牛的胃肠道。人类主要是在食用受污染的、未煮熟的牛肉后感染这种生物。由于疾病只需要低感染剂量（10-100 个生物体），因此加工大量碎牛肉的肉类加工设施是爆发疫情的重要来源。其他不太常见的传播途径包括人际接触以及被粪便污染的水果和蔬菜。\n\n（选项 A）被肉毒梭菌污染的罐头食品可能与因食用预制肉毒杆菌毒素而引起的食源性疾病有关。患者通常会发生下降性、对称性麻痹。\n\n（选项 B 和 D）食用预制、耐热的金黄色葡萄球菌肠毒素会导致摄入后 1-6 小时出现自限性恶心、呕吐和腹部绞痛。乳制品（例如，蛋奶冻）、农产品、肉类、鸡蛋（例如，蛋黄酱）和沙拉是常见的罪魁祸首，它们通常是在由食品处理人员制备时接种的。\n\n（选项 C）蜡样芽孢杆菌肠毒素与再加热的米饭有关。它会导致呕吐为主的食源性疾病，临床上类似于金黄色葡萄球菌肠毒素引起的疾病。\n\n（选项 E）食用生牡蛎可导致副溶血性弧菌（引起大量水样腹泻，类似于霍乱）和创伤弧菌（引起高死亡率的败血症）感染，以及其他弧菌感染。\n\n（选项 F）食用生鸡蛋或未完全煮熟的家禽会导致沙门氏菌胃肠炎，通常会导致水样腹泻、腹部绞痛、呕吐和发烧。\n\n教育目标：\n产肠出血性大肠杆菌 (EHEC) 主要是在食用未煮熟的碎牛肉后感染的。EHEC 产生志贺毒素，引起出血性结肠炎，并可导致溶血性尿毒症综合征 (HUS)。HUS 的特征是急性肾衰竭、血小板减少症和微血管病性溶血性贫血；10 岁以下的儿童风险最高。"
