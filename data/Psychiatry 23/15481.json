    "en": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office due to anxiety that has intensified since he was promoted to a managerial position. Whereas he previously worked alone, his new position requires him to interact with a team of five employees and handle customer service complaints. The patient says he is anxious throughout the day and fears that he will say something embarrassing or that his coworkers and customers will notice his anxiety and think he is incompetent. He says he was very quiet and shy growing up and would always get anxious when meeting new people. He has a few friends with whom he socializes, but he typically has three or four alcoholic drinks before going out with them to feel more relaxed. The patient does not feel depressed, and his sleep and appetite are normal. A medication with which of the following mechanisms of action would be most appropriate for this patient?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's marked anxiety in social situations is consistent with SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER (SAD). His fears of saying something embarrassing and negative evaluation by others are characteristic of the disorder. SAD is a common anxiety disorder with typical onset in childhood or adolescence. If untreated, the disorder can cause major impairment in social and occupational functioning and is often complicated by depression and self-medication with alcohol.\n\nDrugs that inhibit the reuptake of serotonin are first-line medications for social anxiety disorder. Patients are commonly started on a SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITOR (SSRI) although there is also good evidence for the efficacy of SEROTONIN-NOREPINEPHRINE REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SNRIs). These medications work by blocking the serotonin transporter, causing an increase in the availability of serotonin in the synaptic cleft.\n\n(Choice A) Beta blockers have been used to treat performance-only social anxiety disorder. They are taken on an as-needed basis and are most useful for patients with prominent physiological symptoms such as tachycardia or tremor. A beta blocker would not be appropriate for this patient who is generally socially anxious (ie, anxiety not limited to performance situations) and who experiences impairing anxiety on a daily basis.\n\n(Choice B) Dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonism are the mechanisms of action of second-generation antipsychotics. These drugs are not indicated for SAD.\n\n(Choice C) GABAₐ receptor agonism is the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are effective in SAD but are generally used as second-line agents due to their potential for tolerance, abuse, and dependence. They should be avoided in this patient who has a history of self-medication with alcohol.\n\n(Choice D) Histamine receptor antagonism is the mechanism of action of antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine). Although they have sedative effects, they are not effective in treating anxiety.\n\n(Choice E) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are effective for SAD but are not used as a first-line treatment due to their side effect profile and dietary restrictions.\n\nEducational objective:\nSocial anxiety disorder is characterized by anxiety and fear of scrutiny in social situations and can result in marked social-occupational impairment. Preferred pharmacotherapy is medication that inhibits serotonin reuptake (SSRIs or SNRIs).",
    "zh": "该患者在社交场合的明显焦虑与社交焦虑症 (SAD) 相符。他对说出令人尴尬的话以及受到他人负面评价的恐惧是该疾病的特征。SAD 是一种常见的焦虑症，通常在儿童或青少年时期发病。如果未经治疗，该疾病可导致社交和职业功能严重受损，并且常常伴有抑郁症和饮酒自我治疗。\n\n抑制血清素再摄取的药物是治疗社交焦虑症的一线药物。患者通常开始使用选择性血清素再摄取抑制剂 (SSRI)，尽管也有充分的证据表明血清素-去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂 (SNRI) 的疗效。这些药物通过阻断血清素转运蛋白起作用，从而增加突触间隙中血清素的可用性。\n\n(选项 A)  β 受体阻滞剂已被用于治疗仅表现为在特定情境（如表演）的社交焦虑症。它们是按需服用的，并且对于具有明显生理症状（如心动过速或震颤）的患者最有用。β 受体阻滞剂不适用于该患者，该患者通常在社交方面感到焦虑（即，焦虑不限于特定情境），并且每天都会经历损害其功能的焦虑。\n\n(选项 B) 多巴胺和血清素受体拮抗是第二代抗精神病药的作用机制。这些药物不适用于 SAD。\n\n(选项 C) GABAₐ 受体激动是苯二氮卓类药物的作用机制。苯二氮卓类药物对 SAD 有效，但由于其潜在的耐受性、滥用和依赖性，通常用作二线药物。应避免在该患者中使用，该患者有饮酒自我治疗的病史。\n\n(选项 D) 组胺受体拮抗是抗组胺药（例如，苯海拉明）的作用机制。尽管它们具有镇静作用，但对治疗焦虑症无效。\n\n(选项 E) 单胺氧化酶抑制剂对 SAD 有效，但由于其副作用特征和饮食限制，不被用作一线治疗。\n\n教育目标：\n社交焦虑症的特征是在社交场合对审视的焦虑和恐惧，并可能导致明显的社会-职业功能障碍。首选的药物治疗是抑制血清素再摄取的药物（SSRI 或 SNRI）。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the diagnosis and pharmacotherapy for social anxiety disorder. It requires the identification of the most appropriate first-line medication based on the patient's presentation and the mechanism of action of various drug classes.\n\nTo solve this question, first, recognize the clinical features suggestive of social anxiety disorder. Then, recall the first-line treatment options for this condition and their respective mechanisms of action, differentiating them from second-line or less effective treatments.",
