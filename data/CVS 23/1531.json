    "en": "The graph in the question stem illustrates an action potential typical of cardiac pacemaker cells, such as those found in the sinoatrial node. These action potentials are different from non-pacemaker cardiac action potentials in that phases 1 and 2 are absent and phase 4 represents a slow depolarization phase.\n\nPacemaker cells are unique in that they exhibit automaticity (an inherent ability to depolarize without any external influences). Automaticity is made possible by a inward, mixed sodium-potassium current (the funny current) that occurs during phase 4 of the action potential (Choice E). This current gradually brings the membrane potential closer to threshold, at which point phase 0 depolarization occurs due to a large increase in calcium influx (arrow). Pacemaker cell depolarization is then followed by phase 3 (repolarization), which is caused by an outward potassium current (Choice B).\n\nIn cardiomyocytes and Purkinje cells (non-pacemaker cells), phase 4 corresponds to the resting membrane potential and is typically stable at approximately -90 mV (near the equilibrium potential of potassium). Phase 0 of the non-pacemaker action potential is mediated by rapid sodium influx (Choice A). In contrast to the slower calcium-mediated depolarization of pacemaker cells. Phase 1 is an early short repolarization occurring immediately after depolarization that is caused by increased outflow of potassium and decreased sodium conductance. Phase 2 is the plateau phase of the action potential, during which an inward calcium current counteracts the outward movement of potassium ions that started in phase 1 (Choice F). Phase 3 (repolarization) occurs as the inward calcium current ceases while potassium continues to rush out of the cell.\n\nEducational objective:\nIn cardiac pacemaker cells, phase 0 depolarization is mediated by an inward flux of calcium. This differs from phase 0 of cardiomyocytes and Purkinje cells, which results from an inward sodium current.",
    "zh": "问题干中的图表说明了心肌起搏细胞（如窦房结中的细胞）的典型动作电位。这些动作电位与非起搏心肌动作电位的不同之处在于，没有1相和2相，而4相代表一个缓慢的去极化阶段。\n\n起搏细胞的独特之处在于它们表现出自律性（在没有任何外部影响的情况下进行去极化的固有能力）。自律性是由内向的、混合的钠钾电流（奇怪电流）实现的，该电流发生在动作电位的4相（选项E）。该电流逐渐使膜电位接近阈值，此时由于钙内流的大幅增加（箭头），发生0相去极化。然后，起搏细胞去极化后是3相（复极化），这由钾外流电流引起（选项B）。\n\n在心肌细胞和浦肯野细胞（非起搏细胞）中，4相对应静息膜电位，通常稳定在约-90 mV（接近钾的平衡电位）。非起搏动作电位的0相由快速的钠内流介导（选项A）。与起搏细胞较慢的钙介导的去极化相反。1相是去极化后立即发生的早期短暂复极化，由钾外流增加和钠电导降低引起。2相是动作电位的平台期，在此期间，内向的钙电流抵消了1相开始的钾离子的外流（选项F）。3相（复极化）发生在内向钙电流停止，而钾继续涌出细胞时。\n\n教育目标：\n在心肌起搏细胞中，0相去极化由钙的内流介导。这与心肌细胞和浦肯野细胞的0相不同，后者的0相由钠内流引起。"
