  "explanation": {
    "en": "In determining the etiology of a pleural effusion, differentiating whether the effusion is transudative or exudative is an important step. The Light criteria allows differentiation of these two types of effusion via analysis of the protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels of the fluid.\n\nTransudative pleural effusions form due to an imbalance in hydrostatic or oncotic pressure. Heart failure causes increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary circulation due to backup of blood flow from the failing left ventricle. This increased pressure leads to leakage of fluid from the pulmonary capillaries and causes a transudative pleural effusion, which is characterized by low protein and low lactate dehydrogenase levels compared to serum values.\n\nIn contrast, exudative effusions result from inflammatory disruption of vascular permeability (eg, infection, malignancy) and demonstrate high protein levels (Choice B) due to increased capillary permeability and reduced sieving of proteins as fluid traverses the capillary wall. Lactate dehydrogenase levels also tend to be high in exudative effusions.\n\n(Choice A) High amylase content is suggestive of a pleural effusion due to pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, or esophageal rupture.\n\n(Choice C) High leukocyte count is typical of a complicated parapneumonic effusion or some types of malignant pleural effusion. Transudative effusions do not demonstrate high leukocyte counts.\n\n(Choice D) Low glucose content is seen in the setting of malignant or infectious pleural effusion due to consumption of glucose by bacteria, neutrophils, and/or malignant cells.\n\nEducational objective:\nHeart failure can cause transudative pleural effusion due to an increase in pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure. Light criteria are useful to differentiate transudative and exudative pleural effusions; transudative effusions are characterized by low protein and lactate dehydrogenase content compared to serum values.",
    "zh": "在确定胸腔积液的病因时，区分积液是漏出液还是渗出液是一个重要的步骤。 Light标准允许通过分析液体的蛋白质和乳酸脱氢酶水平来区分这两种积液。\n\n漏出性胸腔积液的形成是由于静水压或渗透压失衡所致。心力衰竭会导致肺循环中的静水压升高，这是由于来自衰竭的左心室的血流回流所致。这种压力升高导致液体从肺毛细血管渗漏，并引起漏出性胸腔积液，其特征是与血清值相比，蛋白质和乳酸脱氢酶水平较低。\n\n相比之下，渗出性积液是由血管通透性的炎症破坏引起的（例如，感染、恶性肿瘤），并表现出高蛋白水平（选项B），这是由于毛细血管通透性增加和液体穿过毛细血管壁时蛋白质的筛分减少所致。渗出性积液中的乳酸脱氢酶水平也往往很高。\n\n（选项A）淀粉酶含量高提示胸腔积液是由于胰腺炎、胰腺假性囊肿或食管破裂所致。\n\n（选项C）白细胞计数高是复杂性副肺炎积液或某些类型的恶性胸腔积液的典型特征。漏出性积液不会显示高白细胞计数。\n\n（选项D）低葡萄糖含量见于恶性或感染性胸腔积液，这是由于细菌、中性粒细胞和/或恶性细胞消耗葡萄糖所致。\n\n教育目标：\n心力衰竭可因肺毛细血管静水压升高而导致漏出性胸腔积液。 Light标准可用于区分漏出性和渗出性胸腔积液；漏出性积液的特征是与血清值相比，蛋白质和乳酸脱氢酶含量较低。"

It requires understanding of the Light criteria and the pathophysiology of heart failure leading to transudative effusions.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the signs of heart failure (elevated JVP, edema, Kerley B lines) and understand that heart failure typically causes a transudative effusion. Recall that transudative effusions are characterized by low protein and low lactate dehydrogenase levels compared to serum values.",
