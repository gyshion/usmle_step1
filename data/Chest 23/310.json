The patient has been gaining weight appropriately, and her parents have no concerns. When questioned about the home environment, the mother says that she started smoking cigarettes after delivery due to the stress of sleep deprivation. The mother did not smoke during pregnancy, and the father is a nonsmoker. Support is provided, and the mother is counseled regarding the risks of secondhand smoke exposure.",

    "en": "Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure can adversely affect nearly every organ system, most notably the respiratory tract (eg, pneumonia, asthma). One of the most serious effects of SHS exposure is the increased risk for SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME (SIDS).\n\nSIDS refers to the unexpected death of a previously healthy infant with an inconclusive postmortem examination. Almost all cases are associated with at least 1 risk factor, such as prematurity, an unsafe sleep environment, and smoke exposure. Smoke exposure likely contributes to SIDS by causing IMPAIRED AROUSAL and cardiovascular response to stimuli (eg, hypoxemia).\n\nThe risk of SIDS is further increased in cases of MATERNAL CIGARETTE USE DURING PREGNANCY, which is associated with impaired fetal oxygenation and direct exposure of the fetus to toxins (eg, nicotine, carbon monoxide). The degree of risk correlates with the amount of cigarette use, suggesting a dose-response relationship between smoking and SIDS.\n\n(Choice A) Because maternal smoking during pregnancy (not seen here) increases the risk of preterm delivery, the risk of prematurity-associated complications (eg, apnea of prematurity) is also increased. However, these risks do not increase with postnatal SHS exposure. Moreover, apnea of prematurity typically presents with apneic episodes in the first 2-3 days of life.\n\n(Choice B) SHS increases the risk for respiratory tract disease and recurrent otitis media in children; parents who smoke outside the home should be counseled on cessation because chemicals from cigarette smoke are adsorbed and retained by clothing, skin, and hair and therefore still pose a risk to children. SHS is not associated with an increased risk for epilepsy.\n\n(Choice C) SHS does not increase the risk for failure to thrive in infancy. In fact, SHS may be associated with childhood obesity.\n\n(Choice E) SHS exposure in childhood increases the risk for atrial fibrillation in adulthood but is not associated with ventricular arrhythmias.\n\nEducational objective: Maternal tobacco use during pregnancy and secondhand smoke exposure are associated with an increased risk for SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME (SIDS). Pathophysiology of the association between smoke exposure and SIDS may relate to impaired arousal and cardiovascular response to stimuli (eg, airflow obstruction).",
    "zh": "二手烟 (SHS) 暴露会对几乎每个器官系统产生不利影响，尤其是呼吸道（例如，肺炎、哮喘）。 SHS 暴露最严重的后果之一是婴儿猝死综合征 (SIDS) 的风险增加。\n\nSIDS 指的是此前健康的婴儿在尸检结果不明确的情况下意外死亡。 几乎所有病例都与至少 1 个危险因素有关，例如早产、不安全的睡眠环境和吸烟暴露。 烟雾暴露可能通过导致对刺激的觉醒和心血管反应受损（例如，低氧血症）而导致 SIDS。\n\n在孕期母亲吸烟的情况下，SIDS 的风险会进一步增加，这与胎儿氧合受损和胎儿直接暴露于毒素（例如，尼古丁、一氧化碳）有关。 风险程度与吸烟量相关，这表明吸烟与 SIDS 之间存在剂量-反应关系。\n\n(选项 A) 因为孕期母亲吸烟（此处未见）会增加早产的风险，早产相关并发症（例如，早产儿呼吸暂停）的风险也会增加。 然而，这些风险不会随着产后 SHS 暴露而增加。 此外，早产儿呼吸暂停通常在出生后的头 2-3 天内出现呼吸暂停发作。\n\n(选项 B) SHS 会增加儿童呼吸道疾病和复发性中耳炎的风险； 应就戒烟向在户外吸烟的父母提供咨询，因为香烟烟雾中的化学物质会被衣服、皮肤和头发吸附和保留，因此仍然会对儿童构成风险。 SHS 与癫痫风险增加无关。\n\n(选项 C) SHS 不会增加婴儿生长迟缓的风险。 事实上，SHS 可能与儿童肥胖有关。\n\n(选项 E) 儿童期 SHS 暴露会增加成年期房颤的风险，但与室性心律失常无关。\n\n教育目标：孕期母亲使用烟草和二手烟暴露与婴儿猝死综合征 (SIDS) 的风险增加相关。 烟雾暴露与 SIDS 之间联系的病理生理学可能与对刺激的觉醒和心血管反应受损（例如，气流阻塞）有关。"

    "en": "This question assesses the risks associated with secondhand smoke exposure in infants, specifically focusing on the increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). It also tests understanding of the pathophysiology linking smoke exposure to impaired arousal and cardiovascular response.\n\nThe best approach is to recall the known associations between secondhand smoke and infant health, particularly the strong link to SIDS. Eliminate options that are not directly related to the effects of smoke exposure, focusing on the most significant and well-established risks.",
