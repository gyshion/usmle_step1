    "en": "The misuse of stimulants by college students to enhance academic performance is prevalent. This patient's acute onset of paranoia, restlessness, and hypervigilance, and physical signs of mydriasis, tachycardia, hypertension, and diaphoresis, are most likely due to stimulant intoxication. Transient paranoid psychosis can develop in intoxication with all major stimulants, including prescription medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (eg, amphetamines, methylphenidate). SUBSTANCE-INDUCED PSYCHOTIC DISORDER is diagnosed when stimulant intoxication presents with prominent psychotic symptoms.\n\nSubstance-induced psychotic disorders must be differentiated from primary psychiatric disorders such as bipolar manic episodes and psychotic disorders. This student's prominent physical signs and lack of psychiatric history, combined with the temporal association between staying up to study and acute onset of psychosis, make a stimulant-induced psychotic disorder more likely.\n\n(Choice A) Patients experiencing a bipolar manic episode can also have decreased sleep, pressured speech, physical restlessness, and psychotic features. However, the temporal association of studying for exams and the patient's abnormal vital signs, mydriasis, and diaphoresis make substance intoxication more likely.\n\n(Choice B) Primary psychotic disorders are diagnoses of exclusion that require ruling out substance use and medical etiologies. Brief psychotic disorder is a rare condition characterized by acute onset of \\u22651 psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech or behavior) lasting \\u22651 days but <1 month, with eventual complete resolution. This patient's physical findings (ie, mydriasis, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis), the prevalence of stimulant misuse on college campuses, and the temporal association between intense studying and symptom onset make substance-induced psychosis much more likely than brief psychotic disorder.\n\n(Choices C and D) These diagnoses would not be considered at this point due to insufficient duration of psychotic symptoms. The essential feature of delusional disorder is \\u22651 delusion lasting \\u22651 month without other psychotic symptoms. Schizophreniform disorder involves \\u22652 psychotic symptoms lasting \\u22651 month but <6 months.\n\nEducational objective:\nStimulant intoxication can present with paranoid ideation and must be differentiated from primary psychiatric disorders. Physical signs of stimulant intoxication include mydriasis, tachycardia, hypertension, and diaphoresis.",
    "zh": "大学生滥用兴奋剂来提高学习成绩的情况很普遍。该患者突然出现的偏执、不安和过度警惕，以及瞳孔散大、心动过速、高血压和出汗等体征，很可能是由于兴奋剂中毒所致。在所有主要的兴奋剂中毒中，包括用于治疗注意力缺陷多动障碍的处方药（例如，苯丙胺、哌甲酯），都可能发生短暂的偏执性精神病。当兴奋剂中毒表现出明显的精神病性症状时，诊断为物质诱发的精神病性障碍。\n\n物质诱发的精神病性障碍必须与原发性精神疾病，如双相情感障碍躁狂发作和精神病性障碍相鉴别。该学生明显的体征和缺乏精神病史，再加上熬夜学习与精神病急性发作之间的时间关联，使得兴奋剂诱发的精神病性障碍更有可能。\n\n(选项 A) 经历双相情感障碍躁狂发作的患者也可能出现睡眠减少、语速加快、身体不安和精神病性特征。然而，考试学习与患者异常的生命体征、瞳孔散大和出汗之间的时序关联，使得物质中毒更有可能。\n\n(选项 B) 原发性精神病性障碍是一种排除性诊断，需要排除物质使用和医学病因。短暂性精神病性障碍是一种罕见疾病，其特征是突然出现\\u22651个精神病性症状（例如，妄想、幻觉、言语或行为紊乱），持续\\u22651天但<1个月，最终完全缓解。该患者的体征（即，瞳孔散大、心动过速、高血压、出汗）、大学校园中兴奋剂滥用的普遍性，以及紧张学习与症状发作之间的时间关联，使得物质诱发的精神病性障碍比短暂性精神病性障碍的可能性大得多。\n\n(选项 C 和 D) 由于精神病性症状持续时间不足，目前不考虑这些诊断。妄想症的基本特征是\\u22651个妄想持续\\u22651个月，没有其他精神病性症状。分裂样精神障碍涉及\\u22652个精神病性症状持续\\u22651个月但<6个月。\n\n教育目标：\n兴奋剂中毒可表现为偏执观念，必须与原发性精神疾病相鉴别。兴奋剂中毒的体征包括瞳孔散大、心动过速、高血压和出汗。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to differentiate between primary psychotic disorders and substance-induced psychotic disorders, particularly in the context of stimulant intoxication in a young adult. It requires recognizing the constellation of psychotic symptoms alongside specific physical signs suggestive of stimulant use.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully evaluating the patient's presentation, including the acute onset of symptoms, the temporal relationship to a precipitating event (intense studying), the presence of physical signs consistent with stimulant use (mydriasis, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis), and the absence of a prior psychiatric history. Ruling out primary psychiatric disorders based on diagnostic criteria and duration is also crucial.",
