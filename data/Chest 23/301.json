    "en": "A 64-year-old man comes to the clinic due to several weeks of persistent cough, fever, and weight loss. He smokes a pack of cigarettes daily and drinks 10-12 beers on weekends. Chest x-ray reveals an infiltrate in the left upper lobe. The patient is prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for both aspiration and community-acquired pneumonia, but his symptoms worsen despite taking the medication as prescribed. Sputum Gram stain does not reveal any organisms. Lung biopsy findings are shown in {{exhibit_1}} the image below: {{exhibit_2}} This patient has cough, fever, weight loss, and an upper lobe lesion on chest x-ray, raising strong suspicion for active pulmonary tuberculosis. {{exhibit_3}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis cannot be visualized on Gram stain due to the high lipid content (mycolic acid) of its cell wall. Most cases are diagnosed by acid-fast sputum testing and culture, but tissue microscopy typically shows granulomas characterized by {{exhibit_4}} epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated Langhans giant cells. {{exhibit_5}}",

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Granulomas often form after tissue macrophages encounter pathogens or substances that cannot be easily digested or removed. M tuberculosis can evade intracellular killing by macrophages and reproduce within phagolysosomes. Infected macrophages present mycobacterial antigens to naive CD4 helper T cells in pulmonary lymph nodes and secrete IL-12, which induces activated T helper cells to differentiate into T helper subtype 1 (Th1) cells.\n\nProliferating Th1 cells migrate to sites of infection, where they release interferon-gamma, which activates macrophages, improves intracellular killing of ingested mycobacteria, and recruits additional macrophages by increasing production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Activated macrophages can also limit the spread of mycobacteria by differentiating into epithelioid and giant cells that surround residual foci of mycobacteria, trapping them inside the necrotic, cheese-like area of a caseating granuloma.\n\n(Choice A) C3a is a split product anaphylatoxin derived from C3. It stimulates the release of histamine by mast cells, which increases vascular permeability and vasodilation.\n\n(Choice B) Fibroblast growth factor has a variety of proliferative effects, including stimulation of angiogenesis and fibroblast proliferation during formation of granulation tissue. It does not have a primary role in the formation of granulomas.\n\n(Choice C) Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor induces stem cell differentiation into monocytes and other granulocytes (eg, neutrophils, eosinophils). However, it does not induce granuloma formation.\n\n(Choice D) IL-4 is a cytokine that stimulates the differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into the Th2 subset, which plays an important role in humoral immunity and allergic reactions by stimulating B-cell proliferation and isotype switching to IgE.\n\n(Choice E) Interferon-alpha is a primary mediator of the immune response to virus-infected cells. However, in contrast to interferon-gamma, it limits macrophage proliferation and does not drive granuloma formation.\n\nEducational objective:\nT helper subtype 1 cells release interferon-gamma, leading to the activation of macrophages, a process critical for control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Activated macrophages form mature phagolysosomes that destroy phagocytosed mycobacteria and can differentiate into epithelioid and Langhans giant cells to wall off extracellular mycobacteria within caseating granulomas.",
    "zh": "组织巨噬细胞遇到病原体或不易被消化或清除的物质后，通常会形成肉芽肿。结核分枝杆菌可以逃避免疫细胞的胞内杀伤，并在吞噬溶酶体中繁殖。被感染的巨噬细胞将分枝杆菌抗原呈递给肺淋巴结中幼稚CD4辅助T细胞，并分泌IL-12，从而诱导活化的辅助T细胞分化为辅助T细胞1型（Th1）细胞。\n\n增殖的Th1细胞迁移到感染部位，在那里释放干扰素-γ，激活巨噬细胞，改善吞噬结核分枝杆菌的胞内杀灭，并通过增加肿瘤坏死因子-α的产生来招募额外的巨噬细胞。活化的巨噬细胞还可以通过分化为上皮样细胞和巨细胞来限制结核分枝杆菌的扩散，这些细胞包围着结核分枝杆菌的残留灶，将它们困在干酪样坏死肉芽肿的区域内。\n\n（选项A）C3a是C3的裂解产物过敏毒素。它刺激肥大细胞释放组胺，从而增加血管通透性和血管舒张。\n\n（选项B）成纤维细胞生长因子具有多种增殖作用，包括在肉芽组织形成过程中刺激血管生成和成纤维细胞增殖。它在肉芽肿的形成中没有主要作用。\n\n（选项C）粒细胞-巨噬细胞集落刺激因子诱导干细胞分化为单核细胞和其他粒细胞（例如，中性粒细胞，嗜酸性粒细胞）。然而，它不诱导肉芽肿形成。\n\n（选项D）IL-4是一种细胞因子，可刺激幼稚CD4 T细胞分化为Th2亚型，Th2通过刺激B细胞增殖和同种型转换为IgE，在体液免疫和过敏反应中起重要作用。\n\n（选项E）干扰素-α是机体对病毒感染细胞的免疫反应的主要介质。然而，与干扰素-γ相比，它限制巨噬细胞增殖，并且不驱动肉芽肿的形成。\n\n教学目标：\n辅助T细胞1型细胞释放干扰素-γ，导致巨噬细胞活化，这个过程对于控制结核分枝杆菌感染至关重要。活化的巨噬细胞形成成熟的吞噬溶酶体，破坏被吞噬的结核分枝杆菌，并可以分化为上皮样细胞和朗汉斯巨细胞，以将细胞外结核分枝杆菌隔离在干酪样肉芽肿内。"
