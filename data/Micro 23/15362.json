  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has molluscum contagiosum (MC), a benign skin condition caused by a poxvirus. MC is most common in young children, but older patients who are sexually active, participate in contact sports, or are immunocompromised (eg, HIV) are also at increased risk.\n\nMC classically presents as firm, shiny, dome-shaped, flesh-colored papules that often have a central umbilication. Lesions are nontender but may be pruritic. Affected areas in adults usually include the lower abdomen, genitalia, and upper thighs because sexual contact is the most common route of transmission. However, autoinoculation can lead to spread on any part of the body (except the palms and soles), and patients who are immunosuppressed are at increased risk for widespread disease.\n\nMicroscopy of the lesions shows INTRACYTOPLASMIC EOSINOPHILIC INCLUSION BODIES (molluscum bodies) composed of poxvirus within keratinocytes in the epidermis. Lesions usually self-resolve within 6-12 months but typically last longer in immunocompromised patients.\n\n(Choice A) Genital herpes simplex virus causes acute episodes of painful vesicles and ulcers, which are not present in this patient. In addition, microscopy of herpes shows multinucleated cells.\n\n(Choice B) Human herpesvirus 8 in immunocompromised patients causes Kaposi sarcoma, which typically presents with nontender, discolored (eg, pink, purple, red) papules on the extremities, face, and genitalia. Biopsy shows whorls of spindle cell proliferation and extravasated red blood cells.\n\n(Choice C) Condyloma acuminata (due to human papillomavirus) are typically soft, verrucous anogenital lesions without a central indentation. Microscopy shows papillomatosis and perinuclear cytoplasmic vacuolation (koilocytosis).\n\n(Choice E) Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, classically presents with a painless genital ulcer in its primary stage. Secondary syphilis can cause condyloma lata, which are pale papules and plaque-like genital lesions. Although the diagnosis is normally confirmed through serologic testing, microscopy would show spirochetes on darkfield examination rather than molluscum bodies in keratinocytes.\n\nEducational objective:\nMolluscum contagiosum is caused by a poxvirus and presents with small, firm, rounded, papules that often have a central umbilication. Adults who are immunocompromised (eg, HIV) or sexually active are at increased risk. Biopsy shows INTRACYTOPLASMIC EOSINOPHILIC INCLUSION BODIES of poxvirus in keratinocytes. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有传染性软疣（MC），这是一种由痘病毒引起的良性皮肤病。MC在幼儿中最常见，但性活跃、参加接触性运动或免疫功能低下（如HIV）的年长患者也有较高的风险。\n\nMC的典型表现为坚硬、有光泽、圆顶状、肤色丘疹，通常有中央脐凹。皮损无压痛，但可能瘙痒。成人受影响的部位通常包括下腹部、生殖器和大腿上部，因为性接触是最常见的传播途径。然而，自体接种会导致蔓延到身体的任何部位（手掌和足底除外），并且免疫抑制的患者发生广泛性疾病的风险增加。\n\n病变显微镜检查显示，表皮角质形成细胞内有由痘病毒组成的胞质内嗜酸性包涵体（软疣小体）。皮损通常在6-12个月内自愈，但在免疫功能低下的患者中通常持续更长时间。\n\n（选项A）生殖器单纯疱疹病毒引起急性发作的疼痛性水疱和溃疡，该患者无此症状。此外，疱疹的显微镜检查显示多核细胞。\n\n（选项B）人类疱疹病毒8型在免疫功能低下的患者中引起卡波西肉瘤，其典型表现为四肢、面部和生殖器上无压痛、变色（如粉红色、紫色、红色）的丘疹。活检显示梭形细胞增殖的漩涡和溢出的红细胞。\n\n（选项C）尖锐湿疣（由人乳头瘤病毒引起）通常是柔软、疣状的肛门生殖器病变，无中央凹陷。显微镜检查显示乳头瘤病和核周细胞质空泡变性（空泡变性）。\n\n（选项E）梅毒，由梅毒螺旋体引起，其典型表现为在其一期出现无痛性生殖器溃疡。二期梅毒可引起扁平湿疣，即苍白丘疹和斑块样生殖器病变。虽然诊断通常通过血清学检查确认，但显微镜检查会在暗视野下显示螺旋体，而不是角质形成细胞中的软疣小体。\n\n教育目标：\n传染性软疣是由痘病毒引起的，表现为小的、坚硬的、圆形的丘疹，通常具有中央脐凹。免疫功能低下（如HIV）或性活跃的成年人风险增加。活检显示角质形成细胞中痘病毒的胞质内嗜酸性包涵体。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the clinical presentation and etiology of molluscum contagiosum, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. It also requires differentiating it from other sexually transmitted infections and skin conditions.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the characteristic firm, shiny papules with central umbilication, especially in an HIV-positive patient. Understanding the microscopic findings (INTRACYTOPLASMIC EOSINOPHILIC INCLUSION BODIES) further confirms the diagnosis.",
    "zh": "此题考察了对传染性软疣的临床表现和病因学的了解，特别是免疫功能低下个体的表现。同时也需要将其与其他性传播感染和皮肤病进行鉴别。\n\n解决此题的关键在于识别具有特征性的坚硬、有光泽、中央有脐凹的丘疹，尤其是在HIV阳性患者中。理解显微镜下发现（胞质内嗜酸性包涵体）进一步证实了诊断。"
