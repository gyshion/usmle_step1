    "en": "An 18-month-old girl is brought to the office by her parents due to concerns about her development. The girl squeals and babbles nonspecific sounds like \"bababa.\" Last week, she started saying \"mama\" when she sees her mom. She points at objects that she wants and will retrieve an object when asked. The patient can use a spoon but often spills food and prefers to feed herself with her fingers. She walks independently and loves to climb. She often imitates her parents' actions such as holding a toy phone to her ear. During the visit, the child scribbles with a crayon and excitedly shows her father the drawing. The patient's mother says, \"My daughter is such a happy child. I don't know why she won't speak more. Her sister had so many words by this age.\"",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient is an 18-month-old girl who is not meeting developmental milestones for language. At 18 months, a child should be able to say at least 3 words in addition to \"mama\" and \"dada.\" This patient only says \"mama\" and babbles. She does have age-appropriate gross motor skills (walking easily, climbing) and fine motor skills (scribbling, feeding herself with fingers, retrieving objects). She also demonstrates social/cognitive skills such as imitating actions and showing her drawing. However, her language development is significantly delayed. Therefore, the most appropriate response is to acknowledge the delay and express concern for a language delay. {{exhibit_1}} shows the developmental milestones of toddlers. At 18 months, language milestones include saying $\\ge$3 words (plus \"mama\" & \"dada\"). This patient only says \"mama.\" This finding is suggestive of ISOLATED LANGUAGE DELAY.\n\n(A) This is the correct answer. It acknowledges the parents' concerns and accurately identifies a potential language delay, which is supported by the patient's presentation and developmental milestones. The next step would be to investigate the cause of the language delay, such as an AUDIOLOGY EVALUATION to assess for hearing loss.\n\n(B) This response is dismissive and does not address the parents' valid concerns. While children do develop at different rates, the delay in language is significant enough to warrant further investigation, not just a deferral of evaluation.\n\n(C) Selective mutism is a failure to speak in specific social situations (e.g., school) but not in others (e.g., home). This child's language impairment is global, not situation-specific, and therefore selective mutism is unlikely.\n\n(D) Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by impaired social communication/interactions and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior or interests. While language delay can be an early sign of autism, this child has age-appropriate social interactions (imitating actions, showing drawings, interacting with parents). Therefore, autism spectrum disorder is unlikely to be the primary diagnosis based on the information provided.\n\n(E) This response is incorrect because the child is clearly not within the normal range for language development at 18 months. The delay is significant enough to warrant concern and further evaluation.\n\nEducational objective:\nFailure to say $\\ge$3 words in addition to \"mama\" and \"dada\" at age 18 months is indicative of language delay. Initial evaluation includes audiology testing to assess for potential hearing loss.",
    "zh": "患者是一名18个月大的女孩，她没有达到语言发育的里程碑。在18个月时，孩子应该能够说至少3个单词，除了“妈妈”和“爸爸”之外。这个患者只说“妈妈”和咿呀学语。她确实具备与年龄相符的大运动技能（轻松行走，攀爬）和精细运动技能（涂鸦，用手指喂食，取回物体）。她还表现出社交/认知技能，例如模仿动作和展示她的图画。然而，她的语言发育明显迟缓。因此，最合适的反应是承认这种迟缓，并表达对语言发育迟缓的担忧。{{exhibit_1}}显示了幼儿的发育里程碑。在18个月时，语言里程碑包括说$\\ge$3个单词（加上“妈妈”和“爸爸”）。这个患者只说“妈妈”。这个发现提示孤立的语言发育迟缓。\n\n(A) 这是正确的答案。它承认了父母的担忧，并准确地确定了潜在的语言发育迟缓，这得到了患者的呈现和发育里程碑的支持。下一步将是调查语言发育迟缓的原因，例如进行听力评估以评估听力损失。\n\n(B) 这种反应是轻视的，没有解决父母的合理担忧。虽然孩子们确实以不同的速度发育，但语言发育迟缓足以引起进一步的调查，而不仅仅是推迟评估。\n\n(C) 选择性缄默症是指在特定的社交场合（例如学校）无法说话，但在其他场合（例如家里）可以说话。这个孩子的语言障碍是普遍的，而不是特定于情境的，因此选择性缄默症不太可能。\n\n(D) 自闭症谱系障碍的特征是社交交流/互动受损以及行为或兴趣的受限、重复模式。虽然语言发育迟缓可能是自闭症的早期征兆，但这个孩子具有与年龄相符的社交互动（模仿动作、展示图画、与父母互动）。因此，根据提供的信息，自闭症谱系障碍不太可能是主要诊断。\n\n(E) 这种反应是不正确的，因为孩子在18个月大的时候显然没有达到语言发育的正常范围。这种迟缓足以引起担忧并需要进一步评估。\n\n教育目标：\n在18个月大时，除了“妈妈”和“爸爸”之外，不能说$\\ge$3个单词，表明语言发育迟缓。初步评估包括听力测试，以评估潜在的听力损失。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of developmental milestones in toddlers, specifically focusing on language development at 18 months of age. It requires the clinician to differentiate between normal developmental variations and significant delays, and to formulate an appropriate response to parental concerns.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the patient's age and then compare her reported abilities to the established developmental milestones for that age, particularly in the domain of language. Based on this comparison, the clinician can then choose the most empathetic and medically appropriate response that acknowledges the concern and suggests further investigation.",
