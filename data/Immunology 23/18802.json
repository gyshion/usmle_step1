    "en": "A 29-year-old woman comes to the office with a 2-month history of right lower quadrant pain and intermittent diarrhea. Vital signs are normal. The examination is unremarkable except for right lower quadrant tenderness. After confirmatory testing, the patient is given a delayed ileal-release medication that works by binding to a cytosolic receptor, translocating to the nucleus, and inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kB).",

    "en": "This patient has chronic right lower abdominal pain with tenderness and intermittent diarrhea, symptoms that raise suspicion for CROHN DISEASE with ongoing active inflammation. Patients with mild Crohn disease (eg, limited area of inflammation, no evidence of systemic involvement) are often treated with a targeted-release glucocorticoid such as budesonide to reduce inflammation and induce disease remission.\n\nGlucocorticoids, like many other lipid-derived hormones (eg, progesterone, estrogen), bind to a cytosolic receptor rather than a cell surface receptor. The glucocorticoid-receptor complex can then translocate into the nucleus, bind to the relevant DNA regions, and cause a tissue-specific alteration in transcription. In immune cells, the effects of glucocorticoids include inhibition of proinflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kB), which results in reduced expression of cytokines and inflammatory mediators (eg, TNF-alpha) along with decreased immune cell survival and propagation. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nOral budesonide (often given in a delayed-release preparation that targets the ileum) is especially useful in Crohn disease because it has high topical potency and less systemic adverse effects than other glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) due to high first-pass metabolism.\n\n(Choices A and E) Azathioprine and mycophenolate can be used to reduce inflammation in patients with moderate-severe Crohn disease by inhibition of de novo purine synthesis, which immune cells (eg, B and T cells) are especially dependent on during proliferation. Both agents inhibit key enzymes in the purine synthesis pathway (which occurs in the cytosol) rather than inhibiting transcription factors.\n\n(Choice C) Although infliximab can be used to induce remission in patients with moderate-severe Crohn disease, it is a monoclonal antibody that reduces inflammation by binding to and inhibiting the proinflammatory effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a cytokine that is primarily found extracellularly.\n\n(Choice D) Methotrexate and its breakdown products are folic acid analogues that can reduce inflammation by competitively inhibiting multiple folate-dependent enzymes rather than inhibiting transcription factors.\n\nEducational objective:\nBudesonide, like other glucocorticoids, reduces inflammation by binding to a cytosolic receptor, translocating into the nucleus, and inhibiting proinflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kB). It is especially useful in reducing transmural bowel inflammation in patients with Crohn disease because it has high topical potency and limited systemic adverse effects due to high first-pass metabolism.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Crohn's disease treatment, specifically the use of budesonide for mild disease and its mechanism of action as a glucocorticoid. It also requires understanding the mechanisms of action of other immunosuppressants used in Crohn's disease.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's presentation as suggestive of mild Crohn's disease. Recall that budesonide, a targeted-release glucocorticoid, is often used for mild Crohn's due to its topical potency and reduced systemic side effects.
