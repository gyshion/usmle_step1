  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is A. The esophagus is normally lined by nonkeratinized, stratified squamous epithelium. However, chronic exposure to acidic stomach contents can damage the epithelial surface and result in the release of cytokines and growth factors that cause esophageal stem cells to differentiate into an alternate epithelial cell type (columnar epithelium with goblet cells) better suited for an acidic environment. This substitution of one differentiated epithelial cell type for another in response to adverse environmental conditions is called metaplasia. Metaplasia is also seen in the trachea and bronchi of chronic cigarette smokers; there, the irritative effect of smoke leads to replacement of normal ciliated columnar cells with heartier stratified squamous epithelium. Although this cellular adaptation reduces epithelial injury, it also eliminates the cell types that contain cilia and produce mucus, which increases the risk for respiratory infection. Metaplasia is a reversible condition, but continued environmental stress can lead to malignant transformation (metaplasia > dysplasia > invasive cancer). For instance, the metaplasia seen in the distal esophagus in response to chronic acid exposure (Barrett esophagus) is associated with a risk for malignant transformation into esophageal adenocarcinoma. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choice B) Hyperplasia refers to an increase in the number of cells within a tissue due to hormones or growth factors. Psoriasis is characterized by epidermal hyperplasia that results in acanthosis (ie, epidermal thickening).\n\n(Choice C) Neoplasia refers to uncontrolled clonal cellular growth; it can be malignant (ie, capable of invading and metastasizing) or benign. A firm, fixed breast mass is concerning for a malignant neoplasm, such as invasive ductal carcinoma, which is characterized by infiltrative neoplastic epithelial cells.\n\n(Choice D) Dysplasia (ie, disordered growth) is often characterized by abnormal cellular architecture and cytologic atypia. Irregular moles (eg, dysplastic nevi) likely contain dysplastic melanocytes.\n\n(Choice E) Hypertrophy is an increase in the size, but not the number, of cells. Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur with aortic stenosis due to the higher systolic pressures necessitating increased myocardial effort.\n\n(Choice F) Atrophy is a reduction in cell size and number. It can occur in skeletal muscles secondary to disuse, such as a period of immobility (eg, patient with a mobility disability).",
    "zh": "正确答案是A。食管通常由非角化、复层鳞状上皮覆盖。然而，长期暴露于酸性胃内容物可损伤上皮表面，并导致细胞因子和生长因子的释放，这些细胞因子和生长因子导致食管干细胞分化成另一种上皮细胞类型（柱状上皮，其间散布杯状细胞），更适合酸性环境。这种用一种分化的上皮细胞类型代替另一种分化的上皮细胞类型以应对不利环境条件的情况称为化生。在慢性吸烟者的气管和支气管中也可见化生；在那里，烟雾的刺激作用导致正常纤毛柱状细胞被更坚韧的复层鳞状上皮细胞取代。虽然这种细胞适应可减少上皮损伤，但它也会消除含有纤毛并产生粘液的细胞类型，从而增加呼吸道感染的风险。化生是一种可逆的病理改变，但持续的环境压力可导致恶性转化（化生 > 异型增生 > 浸润性癌）。例如，在远端食管中因长期酸暴露（Barrett 食管）而发生的化生与恶性转化为食管腺癌的风险相关。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(选项B) 增生是指由于激素或生长因子导致组织内细胞数量增加。银屑病的特征是表皮增生，导致棘层增生（即表皮增厚）。\n\n(选项C) 肿瘤是指不受控制的克隆细胞生长；它可以是恶性的（即能够侵袭和转移）或良性的。质硬、固定的乳房肿块提示恶性肿瘤，如浸润性导管癌，其特征是浸润性肿瘤性上皮细胞。\n\n(选项D) 异型增生（即无序生长）的特征通常是细胞结构异常和细胞学异型性。不规则的痣（例如，发育不良性痣）可能包含发育不良的黑素细胞。\n\n(选项E) 肥大是指细胞体积增大，但数量没有增加。主动脉瓣狭窄可引起左心室肥大，因为较高的收缩压需要增加心肌的努力。\n\n(选项F) 萎缩是细胞体积和数量的减少。它可发生在骨骼肌中，继发于废用，例如一段时间的制动（例如，行动不便的患者）。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of metaplasia, a reversible change in which one differentiated cell type is replaced by another in response to adverse environmental stimuli. It specifically assesses the ability to recognize metaplasia in different organ systems and differentiate it from other cellular adaptations like hyperplasia, neoplasia, hypertrophy, and atrophy.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the core concept of metaplasia described in the vignette (columnar epithelium with goblet cells in the esophagus due to chronic acid exposure). Then, evaluate each option to determine which scenario represents a similar adaptive cellular change in response to chronic environmental stress. Recall common examples of metaplasia in different tissues, such as the respiratory tract and esophagus.",
