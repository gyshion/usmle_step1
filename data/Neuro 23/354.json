  "explanation": {
    "en": "This case presents a classic picture of trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux). This condition presents with episodes of sudden and severe pain in the distribution of CN V (particularly V2 and V3). The pain is described as \"stabbing\" or like an \"electrical shock\"; it is usually unilateral, and does not last more than few seconds; but occurs repeatedly. Pain is triggered by any stimulus to CN V, for example chewing, teeth brushing, shaving or washing an affected area of the face, swallowing, or exposure to hot or cold temperatures. These painful episodes may occur for several months. In the majority of cases, trigeminal neuralgia is not caused by any structural abnormality and its pathogenesis remains unclear.\n\nCarbamazepine is the drug of choice for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. It is effective in pain reduction in up to 80% of patients. Like phenytoin, it inhibits neuronal high-frequency firing by reducing the ability of sodium channels to recover from inactivation. Carbamazepine can cause aplastic anemia, so CBC should be monitored regularly. Carbamazepine is a P450 inducer that increases the metabolism of many other medications, thereby decreasing their effectiveness.\n\n(Choices A and G) Baclofen and valproic acid can be used for trigeminal neuralgia, but are not first-line choices.\n\n(Choice B) Haloperidol is a neuroleptic medication used for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute psychoses, acute mania, and Tourette syndrome. It is not indicated in trigeminal neuralgia.\n\n(Choice E) Propranolol has various uses, including migraine prophylaxis and the reduction of portal venous pressure to prevent variceal bleed. It is not used for trigeminal neuralgia.\n\n(Choice F) Phenobarbital is effective for the management of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. It is not used for trigeminal neuralgia.\n\nEducational objective:\nTrigeminal neuralgia presents with brief episodes of sudden and severe \"electric shock-like\" or \"stabbing\" pain in the distribution of CN V (particularly V2 and V3). Carbamazepine is the drug of choice.",
    "zh": "本病例呈现了三叉神经痛（痛性抽搐）的典型表现。 这种疾病表现为CN V（特别是V2和V3）分布区域的突发性和剧烈疼痛发作。 疼痛被描述为“刺痛”或“电击”； 它通常是单侧的，持续时间不超过几秒钟； 但会反复发生。 疼痛由任何对CN V的刺激触发，例如咀嚼，刷牙，剃须或清洗面部受影响区域，吞咽或暴露于冷热温度。 这些疼痛发作可能持续数月。 在大多数情况下，三叉神经痛不是由任何结构异常引起的，其发病机制仍不清楚。\n\n卡马西平是治疗三叉神经痛的首选药物。 在高达80%的患者中，它能有效减轻疼痛。 与苯妥英钠一样，它通过降低钠离子通道从失活中恢复的能力来抑制神经元高频放电。 卡马西平可引起再生障碍性贫血，因此应定期监测血常规。 卡马西平是P450诱导剂，可增加许多其他药物的代谢，从而降低其有效性。\n\n（选项A和G）巴氯芬和丙戊酸可用于三叉神经痛，但不是一线选择。\n\n（选项B）氟哌啶醇是一种用于治疗精神分裂症、急性精神病、急性躁狂症和图雷特综合征的神经安定剂。 它不适用于三叉神经痛。\n\n（选项E）普萘洛尔有多种用途，包括偏头痛预防和降低门静脉压力以预防静脉曲张出血。 它不用於三叉神经痛。\n\n（选项F）苯巴比妥可有效控制全身强直-阵挛性癫痫发作。 它不用於三叉神经痛。\n\n教育目标：\n三叉神经痛表现为CN V（特别是V2和V3）分布区域的突发性和剧烈的“电击样”或“刺痛”疼痛发作。 卡马西平是首选药物。"
