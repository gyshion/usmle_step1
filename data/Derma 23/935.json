  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has actinic keratoses (AKs), which most commonly present as erythematous papules with overlying whitish scale. They are often \"felt more than seen\" and have a rough, sandpaper-like texture on palpation. The lesions are small and flat at first, but may enlarge and become elevated. Usually their size does not exceed 10 mm in diameter. Hyperkeratosis in such lesions may become prominent and form cutaneous horns.\n\nAKs develop in genetically predisposed individuals age 40-60 under the influence of excessive sun exposure. The most commonly affected areas are the face, ears, scalp, and the dorsa of the arms and hands, but any other chronically sun-exposed site (legs, back, upper chest) can be involved. AK is regarded as a premalignant condition, but less than 1% of AKs per year will evolve into invasive squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n(Choice B) Acute atopic dermatitis occurs most often in infants and children and manifests with highly pruritic erythematous papules and plaques. Light microscopy demonstrates spongiosis (edema of the epidermis) {{exhibit_2}}.\n\n(Choice C) Pityriasis rosea often begins as a solitary pink or brown scaly plaque with central clearing on the trunk, neck, or extremities (herald patch). It is followed by development of an ovoid maculopapular rash with lesions classically oriented in an oblique direction along the skin tension lines on the back (Christmas tree pattern) {{exhibit_3}}.\n\n(Choice D) Psoriasis presents with well-circumscribed raised papules and plaques covered with a thick silvery scale. The lesions are located on the scalp, trunk, and extensor areas of the extremities (elbows and knees) {{exhibit_4}}.\n\n(Choice E) Seborrheic keratoses occur in elderly individuals and present as \"stuck-on\", deeply pigmented or flesh-colored lesions with a velvety or \"greasy\" surface {{exhibit_5}}. Educational objective: Actinic keratosis (AK) develops on chronically sun-exposed areas of the skin in predisposed individuals. The lesions consist of erythematous papules with a central scale and a rough sandpaper-like texture. AKs are considered premalignant lesions and have the potential to progress to squamous cell carcinoma {{exhibit_6}}. {{exhibit_7}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有日光性角化病 (AKs)，最常见的表现为覆有白色鳞屑的红斑丘疹。它们通常是“触感大于可见”，触诊时具有粗糙的砂纸样质地。病灶最初较小且扁平，但可能会增大并隆起。通常，它们的尺寸不超过10毫米。此类病灶中的角化过度可能会变得明显并形成皮角。\n\nAKs发生在有遗传易感性且年龄在40-60岁的人群中，受过度日晒的影响。最常受影响的部位是面部、耳朵、头皮以及手臂和手背，但任何其他长期暴露在阳光下的部位（腿、背部、上胸部）都可能受到影响。 AK被认为是癌前病变，但每年不到1%的AKs会发展成浸润性鳞状细胞癌。\n\n（选项B）急性特应性皮炎最常发生在婴儿和儿童中，表现为高度瘙痒的红斑丘疹和斑块。光镜检查显示海绵形成（表皮水肿） {{exhibit_2}}。\n\n（选项C）玫瑰糠疹通常始于躯干、颈部或四肢上的单个粉红色或棕色鳞屑斑块，中央有清除区（前驱斑）。 随后出现卵圆形斑丘疹皮疹，病灶通常沿背部皮肤张力线以倾斜方向排列（圣诞树模式） {{exhibit_3}}。\n\n（选项D）银屑病表现为边界清楚的隆起丘疹和斑块，覆盖着厚厚的银色鳞屑。病灶位于头皮、躯干和四肢伸展部位（肘部和膝盖） {{exhibit_4}}。\n\n（选项E）脂溢性角化病发生在老年人中，表现为“粘连状”、深色色素沉着或肉色病灶，表面呈天鹅绒状或“油腻” {{exhibit_5}}。教学目标：日光性角化病 (AK) 发生在有易感人群的长期暴露在阳光下的皮肤区域。 病灶由红斑丘疹组成，中间有鳞屑，质地粗糙如砂纸。 AKs被认为是癌前病变，并且有可能发展为鳞状细胞癌 {{exhibit_6}}。 {{exhibit_7}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of actinic keratosis, a common premalignant skin condition caused by chronic sun exposure. It assesses the ability to recognize the clinical presentation of actinic keratosis and differentiate it from other skin conditions.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the patient's history of sun exposure as a farmer, the location of the lesions on the forehead, and the description of the lesions as rough and scaly. Rule out other options based on their typical presentations and patient demographics.",
