    "en": "An 18-year-old woman comes to the office to discuss test results. She was evaluated one week ago for recurrent vulvovaginal discharge and reported being sexually active with two partners, using oral contraceptives sometimes. The patient was counseled on safe sexual practices and tested for sexually transmitted diseases. The results have returned as positive for HIV. She has no significant medical history and takes no medications other than oral contraceptives. The patient's family history is significant for a mother with schizophrenia and a paternal uncle with alcohol use disorder who lives in the home with them. On hearing her test results and the recommendation to start antiretroviral therapy, she is visibly upset.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a new diagnosis of HIV infection and will require lifelong antiretroviral therapy. Nonadherence to antiretroviral drugs is associated with greater probability of treatment failure and drug resistance, and this patient is likely at risk for nonadherence due to significant stressors (eg, family mental illness). Young patients also commonly have decreased adherence due to financial instability and frequent changes in health insurance coverage.\n\nThe first step in maximizing long-term adherence is building a solid THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENT characterized by OPENNESS and MUTUAL TRUST. Establishing a good physician-patient partnership in which the patient feels his or her GOALS and PRIORITIES are being addressed and the physician is acting in the patient's INTEREST is a necessity.\n\nOnce the therapeutic relationship is established, specific interventions to maximize adherence are likely to be more effective. Strategies with proven benefit include simplifying the drug regimen (eg, combination pills, once-daily dosing), automated reminder systems (eg, smartphone application), and frequent review of medication adverse effects.\n\n(Choice B) As the patient's fund of knowledge and understanding of HIV infection increase, progressively sophisticated education can be provided regarding the natural history and complications of the disease. However, focusing on complications at the initial visit is likely to overwhelm the patient and distract from forming a therapeutic alliance.\n\n(Choice C) Once a medication plan has been determined and the patient is instructed on implementation, frequent follow-up should be scheduled to review the treatment plan and identify any ongoing barriers to adherence. However, this is not a primary objective in the initial encounter.\n\n(Choice D) This patient has significant psychosocial stressors and may benefit from counseling or other interventions. However, as with antiretroviral therapy, the success of these measures will be greatest if provided in the context of an established physician-patient therapeutic relationship.\n\n(Choice E) Reinforcing verbal counseling with written instruction can improve adherence, especially for patients with multiple conditions and medications. However, the medication regimen should not be initiated until the patient fully understands the diagnosis and trust has been established between the physician and patient.",
    "zh": "该患者新诊断出HIV感染，需要终生抗逆转录病毒治疗。不遵守抗逆转录病毒药物与治疗失败和耐药性的可能性增加有关，而且由于重要的压力因素（例如，家庭精神疾病），该患者很可能面临不依从的风险。年轻患者也常常由于经济不稳定和健康保险覆盖范围的频繁变化而导致依从性降低。\n\n最大限度地提高长期依从性的第一步是建立一个以开放和相互信任为特征的稳固的治疗环境。建立良好的医患合作关系，让患者感到他的目标和优先事项正在得到解决，并且医生正在为患者的利益而行动，这是必要的。\n\n一旦建立了治疗关系，最大限度地提高依从性的具体干预措施可能更有效。已被证明有益的策略包括简化药物治疗方案（例如，复方药、每日一次给药）、自动提醒系统（例如，智能手机应用程序）以及频繁审查药物不良反应。\n\n（选项B）随着患者对HIV感染的知识和理解的增加，可以提供关于该疾病的自然病程和并发症的逐步完善的教育。然而，在初次就诊时关注并发症可能会使患者不堪重负，并分散形成治疗联盟的注意力。\n\n（选项C）一旦确定了用药计划，并指导患者实施，就应安排频繁的随访以审查治疗计划并确定任何持续存在的依从性障碍。但是，这在初次接触中不是主要目标。\n\n（选项D）该患者有重要的社会心理压力因素，可能从咨询或其他干预措施中受益。然而，与抗逆转录病毒治疗一样，这些措施的成功将在已建立的医患治疗关系的背景下实现最大化。\n\n（选项E）用书面说明强化口头咨询可以提高依从性，特别是对于患有多种疾病和服用多种药物的患者。但是，在患者完全了解诊断并且医生和患者之间建立了信任关系之前，不应开始用药方案。"

It emphasizes the significance of addressing the patient's goals and priorities in the treatment plan.\n\nThe best approach is to prioritize establishing a strong physician-patient relationship based on trust and openness.
