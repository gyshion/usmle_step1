    "en": "Sometimes axons become severed due to trauma. Such injury causes specific changes in both the proximal and distal segments of the axon, as well as in the neuronal body.\n\nWallerian degeneration occurs in the segment of axon that has lost connection with the cell body. It represents the degeneration of axon and myelin distal to a point of injury. First, swelling and irregularity are noted in the distal segment of the axon. Within a week the axon is destroyed and its fragments are digested by Schwann cells and macrophages. Similar degenerative changes occur in the segment of axon that lies proximal to the injury. Degeneration of the proximal segment extends to the closest node of Ranvier.\n\nThe changes seen in the neuronal body after the axon is severed are called AXONAL REACTION. The cell body shows signs of cellular edema. It becomes swollen and rounded, with the nucleus displaced to the periphery. Nissl substance becomes fine, granular and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (central chromatolysis). Axonal reaction becomes visible in 24-48 hours after the injury. Maximal changes in the neuronal body occur approximately 12 days after the injury. These changes reflect an increased synthesis of protein by the cells in order to regenerate the severed axon.\n\n(Choice A) Degenerative diseases are characterized by progressive loss of neurons with associated reactive glial changes. Neuronal loss in these conditions is selective; it affects one or more well-defined neuronal groups. Alzheimer's, Pick's, and Huntington's disease are all examples of degenerative disorders.\n\n(Choice B) Transient but profound hypoxia, ischemia or toxic injury may lead to the loss of neurons. Irreversible neuronal injury manifests with shrinkage of the neuronal body, deep eosinophilia of the cytoplasm, pyknosis of the nucleus and loss of Nissl substance.\n\n(Choice D) Compression atrophy may occur due to increased intracranial pressure or a mass lesion. A decrease in the size and number of neurons is characteristic of compression atrophy.\n\n(Choice E) Normal aging is characterized by atrophy and gradual neuronal loss. Axonal reaction is not associated with this process.\n\nEducational Objective:\nThe changes in the body of a neuron after the axon has been severed are called axonal reaction. This process reflects an increased protein synthesis that facilitates axon repair. Enlarged, rounded cells with peripherally located nuclei and dispersed finely granular Nissl substance are seen.",
    "zh": "有时由于外伤，轴突会断裂。这种损伤会导致轴突的近端和远端节段以及神经元体发生特异性变化。\n\nWallerian 变性发生在与细胞体失去连接的轴突节段。它代表了损伤点远端的轴突和髓鞘的变性。首先，在轴突远端节段中观察到肿胀和不规则性。在一周内，轴突被破坏，其碎片被施万细胞和巨噬细胞消化。类似的退行性改变发生在损伤近端的轴突节段。近端节段的变性延伸至最近的朗飞结。\n\n轴突断裂后神经元体中出现的变化称为轴突反应。细胞体显示出细胞性水肿的迹象。它变得肿胀和圆形，核移位到外周。尼氏体变得精细、呈颗粒状并分散在整个细胞质中（中心性染色质溶解）。轴突反应在损伤后 24-48 小时内变得可见。神经元体中的最大变化大约在损伤后 12 天发生。这些变化反映了细胞增加蛋白质合成以再生断裂的轴突。\n\n(选项 A) 退行性疾病的特征是神经元的进行性丧失以及相关的反应性神经胶质细胞变化。在这些情况下，神经元损失是选择性的；它影响一个或多个定义明确的神经元群。阿尔茨海默病、皮克病和亨廷顿病都是退行性疾病的例子。\n\n(选项 B) 短暂但严重的缺氧、缺血或毒性损伤可能导致神经元损失。不可逆的神经元损伤表现为神经元体萎缩、细胞质深嗜伊红性、核固缩和尼氏体消失。\n\n(选项 D) 压迫性萎缩可能由于颅内压升高或占位性病变而发生。神经元的大小和数量减少是压迫性萎缩的特征。\n\n(选项 E) 正常老化的特征是萎缩和逐渐的神经元损失。轴突反应与此过程无关。\n\n教育目标：\n轴突断裂后神经元体内的变化称为轴突反应。此过程反映了增加的蛋白质合成，从而促进轴突修复。观察到细胞增大、圆形，细胞核位于外周，尼氏体呈精细颗粒状分散。"
