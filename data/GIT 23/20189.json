    "en": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the office due to colicky abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea 15-20 minutes after meals. These episodes are accompanied by light-headedness and diaphoresis. She feels normal between the episodes and at night. The patient underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery 4 weeks ago for obesity. She is otherwise healthy, and her only medication is a daily multivitamin. On physical examination, the patient has a well-healed midline abdominal scar. Mild epigastric tenderness to palpation is present. The remainder of the examination is normal.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's symptoms are consistent with DUMPING SYNDROME, a common complication of gastric surgery.\n\nNormally, food moves through the stomach slowly, ensuring proper digestion. First, the fundus relaxes (ie, accommodation), which allows the stomach to function as a reservoir and facilitates digestion by acid and proteases. As food moves to the antrum, it is broken down by high-amplitude muscular contractions. The PYLORIC SPHINCTER serves as a barrier and allows only tiny, properly digested food particles to move to the small intestine.\n\nWhen the pyloric sphincter is surgically removed or circumvented, as in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, INCOMPLETELY DIGESTED FOOD PARTICLES enter the small intestine rapidly. The undigested material is often HYPEROSMOLAR and causes fluid movement from the intravascular space to the intestinal lumen. Activation of autonomic (sympathetic) reflexes and the release of vasoactive hormones (eg, serotonin, vasoactive intestinal peptide) may also occur. The resulting dumping syndrome is characterized by symptoms related to the following, which typically occur within 10-30 minutes after eating:\n\n*   Excessive intestinal fluid: Abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea\n*   Vasomotor hyperactivity: Diaphoresis, palpitations, flushing\n*   Intravascular volume depletion: Hypotension, tachycardia\n\n(Choice A) Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth can occur after surgical creation of a blind intestinal loop that promotes bacterial colonization. It manifests with diarrhea, bloating, nausea, and abdominal cramps. Autonomic symptoms (eg, diaphoresis) are not typical, and this patient's symptom onset shortly after meals is more consistent with dumping syndrome.\n\n(Choices B and E) Vagal nerve injury, which impairs gastric muscular contractions and accommodation, and pyloric sphincter spasm would both delay the passage of food through the stomach. This can manifest as early satiety, nausea, and postprandial vomiting. Diarrhea and diaphoresis are not consistent with these disorders.\n\n(Choice C) Stenosis of the gastrojejunostomy would prevent food from entering the small intestine, leading to postprandial vomiting and abdominal pain. It would not cause diarrhea or diaphoresis.\n\nEducational objective: The pyloric sphincter prevents incompletely digested hyperosmolar food particles from entering the intestines too rapidly; when the sphincter is bypassed or surgically removed, dumping syndrome may occur. Symptoms are related to excessive intestinal fluid (eg, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea), vasomotor hyperactivity (eg, diaphoresis, palpitations, flushing), and intravascular volume depletion (eg, hypotension, tachycardia).",
    "zh": "该患者的症状与倾倒综合征一致，这是胃部手术常见的并发症。\n\n正常情况下，食物缓慢通过胃，确保充分消化。首先，胃底放松（即，顺应性），这使胃能够充当储存库，并促进酸和蛋白酶的消化。当食物移动到胃窦时，它被高振幅的肌肉收缩分解。幽门括约肌充当屏障，仅允许微小的、充分消化的食物颗粒移动到小肠。\n\n当幽门括约肌被手术切除或绕过时，如在Roux-en-Y胃旁路术中，未完全消化的食物颗粒迅速进入小肠。未消化的物质通常是高渗的，导致液体从血管内空间移动到肠腔。自主神经（交感神经）反射的激活以及血管活性激素（如血清素、血管活性肠肽）的释放也可能发生。由此产生的倾倒综合征的特征在于与以下相关的症状，这些症状通常在进食后10-30分钟内发生：\n\n*   过多的肠液：腹部绞痛、腹泻、恶心\n*   血管舒缩功能亢进：出汗、心悸、潮红\n*   血管内容量减少：低血压、心动过速\n\n（选项A）在手术创建盲肠环后，可发生小肠细菌过度生长，从而促进细菌定植。其表现为腹泻、腹胀、恶心和腹部绞痛。自主神经症状（如出汗）不典型，并且该患者的症状在餐后不久出现，更符合倾倒综合征。\n\n（选项B和E）迷走神经损伤，损害胃部肌肉收缩和顺应性，以及幽门括约肌痉挛，都会延迟食物通过胃。这可表现为早期饱腹感、恶心和餐后呕吐。腹泻和出汗与这些疾病不符。\n\n（选项C）胃空肠吻合口狭窄会阻止食物进入小肠，导致餐后呕吐和腹痛。它不会引起腹泻或出汗。\n\n教育目标：幽门括约肌可防止未完全消化的高渗食物颗粒过快进入肠道；当括约肌被绕过或手术切除时，可能发生倾倒综合征。症状与过多的肠液（如腹部绞痛、腹泻、恶心）、血管舒缩功能亢进（如出汗、心悸、潮红）和血管内容量减少（如低血压、心动过速）有关。"
