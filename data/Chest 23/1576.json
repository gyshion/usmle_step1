  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient is a lung transplant recipient on immunosuppressants, making him susceptible to opportunistic infections. The symptoms of progressive dyspnea, cough, and fever, along with diffuse interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray, are suggestive of pneumonia. The lung biopsy findings, which include enlarged cells with intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (owl's eye appearance), are characteristic of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Herpesviridae family. Therefore, an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus is the most likely organism responsible for the patient's condition. Choices B, D, and E are incorrect because while influenza, rhinovirus, and adenovirus are viruses that can cause respiratory illness, the biopsy findings are not typical for these viruses. Choice C is incorrect because Nocardia and Actinomyces are bacteria that form filamentous branching gram-positive rods, and their typical presentation and biopsy findings differ. Choice F is incorrect because Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) presents with foamy alveolar material and cystic forms, and while PCP is common in transplant recipients, the biopsy findings are not consistent with PCP.",
    "zh": "该患者是接受免疫抑制剂治疗的肺移植受者，这使其容易受到机会性感染。进行性呼吸困难、咳嗽和发热的症状，以及胸部 X 光片上的弥漫性间质浸润，提示肺炎。肺活检结果，包括具有核内和胞质内包涵体（猫头鹰眼外观）的肿大细胞，是巨细胞病毒 (CMV) 感染的特征。CMV 是一种有包膜双链 DNA 病毒，属于疱疹病毒科。因此，有包膜双链 DNA 病毒是最有可能导致患者病情的病原体。选项 B、D 和 E 不正确，因为虽然流感病毒、鼻病毒和腺病毒是可引起呼吸道疾病的病毒，但活检结果并非这些病毒的典型表现。选项 C 不正确，因为诺卡菌属和放线菌是形成丝状分支革兰氏阳性杆菌的细菌，它们的典型表现和活检结果有所不同。选项 F 不正确，因为肺孢子虫肺炎 (PCP) 表现为泡沫状肺泡物质和囊性形式，虽然 PCP 在移植受者中很常见，但活检结果与 PCP 不一致。"
