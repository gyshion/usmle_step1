    "en": "A 16-year-old primigravida comes to the emergency department in active labor. A fetal heartbeat is undetectable, and she delivers a stillborn boy vaginally. Examination of the stillborn shows several dysmorphic features, including closely set eyes and an elongated nasal structure. A fetal autopsy reveals fused cerebral hemispheres with an absent forebrain fissure and a single intracranial ventricle. This patient's autopsy findings are most indicative of which of the following types of congenital anomalies?",

    "en": "The physical features of this stillborn are consistent with holoprosencephaly, an incomplete division of the forebrain (prosencephalon) into 2 hemispheres. Cleavage of the prosencephalon into the telencephalon and diencephalon normally occurs in early gestation. Failure of cleavage at different points in division can result in an array of anomalies, ranging from mild midline defects (eg, ocular hypotelorism, incomplete division of the forebrain) to severe defects (eg, single midline eye, primitive nasal structure or proboscis, midfacial clefts).\n\nHoloprosencephaly is an example of a MALFORMATION, an INTRINSIC DEFECT that occurs during embryonic development and results in the abnormal formation of a body structure. Pathogenesis likely involves a combination of genetic (eg, trisomy 13, sonic hedgehog gene mutations) and environmental (eg, maternal alcohol use) factors. Other examples of malformations include spina bifida (failure of neural tube closure) and cleft lip/palate (failure of lip/palate fusion).\n\n(Choice A) Agenesis refers to the COMPLETE ABSENCE of an organ. Renal agenesis, the congenital absence of one or both kidneys, is an example of this type of abnormality.\n\n(Choice B) Association refers to multiple anomalies WITHOUT A KNOWN UNIFYING CAUSE that occur together more frequently than chance alone would predict. Vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb abnormalities (VACTERL) are an example of an association of anomalies without a common etiology.\n\n(Choice C) Deformations are fetal structural anomalies that occur due to EXTRINSIC MECHANICAL FORCES. The pressure applied by the uterus is one of the most common deforming forces. For example, uterine constraint on a fetus (eg, breech position, uterine fibroids) can cause positional talipes equinovarus (clubfoot), a condition in which the foot is plantar flexed and internally rotated.\n\n(Choice D) Dysplasia refers to ABNORMAL CELLULAR ARCHITECTURE within a tissue. Osteogenesis imperfecta, a skeletal disorder characterized by brittle bones that fracture easily, occurs with dysplasia of connective tissue due to absent or abnormal type I collagen.\n\nEducational objective:\nA malformation refers to an abnormal body structure due to an intrinsic defect in development. Holoprosencephaly is a malformation characterized by a spectrum of fetal facial and cerebral anomalies due to incomplete division of the forebrain (prosencephalon).",
    "zh": "该死产儿的体征与全前脑无裂畸形一致，全前脑（前脑）未完全分裂成 2 个半球。前脑分裂成端脑和间脑通常发生在妊娠早期。分裂过程中在不同点的分裂失败会导致一系列异常，从轻度中线缺陷（例如，眼距过近，前脑未完全分裂）到严重缺陷（例如，单中线眼，原始鼻部结构或鼻吻，中面部裂隙）。\n\n全前脑无裂畸形是畸形的一个例子，这是一种在胚胎发育过程中发生的内在缺陷，导致身体结构异常形成。发病机制可能涉及遗传（例如，13三体综合征，刺猬基因突变）和环境（例如，孕妇饮酒）因素的结合。其他畸形的例子包括脊柱裂（神经管闭合失败）和唇腭裂（唇/腭融合失败）。\n\n（选项 A）无发生是指器官的完全缺失。肾无发生，即先天性缺乏一个或两个肾，是这种类型异常的一个例子。\n\n（选项 B）联合是指在没有已知统一病因的情况下，多种异常同时发生，其频率高于仅靠偶然发生的可能性。椎骨缺陷、肛门闭锁、心脏缺陷、气管食管瘘、肾脏异常和肢体异常（VACTERL）是异常联合的一个例子，没有共同的病因。\n\n（选项 C）畸形是由于外部机械力引起的胎儿结构异常。子宫施加的压力是最常见的变形力之一。例如，子宫对胎儿的限制（例如，臀位、子宫肌瘤）可导致位置性马蹄内翻足（马蹄内翻足），这是一种足部跖屈和内旋的疾病。\n\n（选项 D）发育不良是指组织内的细胞结构异常。成骨不全是一种以骨骼脆弱、容易骨折为特征的骨骼疾病，由于缺乏或异常的 I 型胶原蛋白，会发生结缔组织发育不良。\n\n教育目标：\n畸形是指由于发育过程中存在内在缺陷而导致的身体结构异常。全前脑无裂畸形是一种畸形，其特征是由于前脑（前脑）未完全分裂而导致一系列胎儿面部和大脑异常。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of different categories of congenital anomalies, specifically distinguishing between malformations, deformations, disruptions, dysplasias, and agenesis. It requires applying the definitions of these categories to a clinical scenario involving a stillborn with specific dysmorphic features and autopsy findings indicative of holoprosencephaly.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the key pathological findings described in the case (fused cerebral hemispheres, absent forebrain fissure, single intracranial ventricle) and recognize them as features of holoprosencephaly. Then, recall or deduce the definition of each type of congenital anomaly and determine which category holoprosencephaly best fits, which is a malformation due to an intrinsic developmental defect.",
