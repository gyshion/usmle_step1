    "en": "A 35-year-old man comes to the office due to a painful tongue sore. For the past 2 weeks he has had a fever and has experienced myalgias and arthralgias. He has no known medical problems. The patient works as a driver for a local delivery service. He had unprotected sex with a stranger approximately 1 month ago. Physical examination shows a rash over his trunk and cervical lymphadenopathy. An ulcer is located on the median sulcus of the tongue and is 2 cm anterior to the foramen cecum. Blood is drawn for an HIV test. The pain sensation from his ulcer is most likely carried by which of the following nerves?",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is C. The tongue receives general sensory innervation from the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3) for the anterior two-thirds and from the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) for the posterior one-third. The vagus nerve (CN X) innervates the posterior area of the tongue root. Gustatory innervation (taste) is provided by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve (CN VII) for the anterior two-thirds and by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) for the posterior one-third. The ulcer is located on the median sulcus of the tongue, 2 cm anterior to the foramen cecum. This location is within the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Therefore, pain sensation from this ulcer is carried by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3). The patient's symptoms of fever, myalgias, arthralgias, rash, and lymphadenopathy, along with the oral ulcer and unprotected sexual contact, are highly suggestive of ACUTE HIV INFECTION. The oral ulcer is a common manifestation of this condition. (Choices A, B, and E) The chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve (CN VII) transmits gustatory sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue but not painful stimuli. The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) transmits taste, pain, temperature, and touch stimuli from the posterior one-third of the tongue. The vagus nerve (CN X) innervates the far posterior area of the tongue root, transmitting both gustatory and general sensory stimuli. Since the ulcer is in the anterior two-thirds, these nerves are not the primary carriers of pain sensation. (Choice D) The maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V2) does not participate in tongue innervation. It primarily provides sensory innervation to the midface, including the upper teeth, palate, and nasal cavity. Educational objective: General sensation from the anterior 2/3 of the tongue is carried by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. Gustatory innervation of the anterior 2/3 of the tongue is provided by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve.",
    "zh": "正确答案是C。舌头接收来自三叉神经下颌支 (CN V3) 的一般感觉神经支配，用于前三分之二，以及来自舌咽神经 (CN IX) 的后三分之一。迷走神经 (CN X) 支配舌根的后部区域。味觉神经支配由面神经 (CN VII) 的鼓索分支提供，用于前三分之二，以及舌咽神经 (CN IX) 用于后三分之一。溃疡位于舌正中沟上，距盲孔前2厘米处。这个位置位于舌头的前三分之二内。因此，来自该溃疡的疼痛感觉由三叉神经下颌支 (CN V3) 传导。患者的发烧、肌痛、关节痛、皮疹和淋巴结肿大，以及口腔溃疡和无保护的性接触，高度提示急性HIV感染。口腔溃疡是这种病症的常见表现。（选项A、B和E）面神经（CN VII）的鼓索分支传递舌头前三分之二的味觉感觉，但不传递疼痛刺激。舌咽神经（CN IX）传递来自舌头后三分之一的味觉、疼痛、温度和触觉刺激。迷走神经（CN X）支配舌根的后部区域，传递味觉和一般感觉刺激。由于溃疡位于前三分之二，因此这些神经不是疼痛感觉的主要传导者。（选项D）三叉神经上颌支 (CN V2) 不参与舌头的神经支配。它主要为面中部提供感觉神经支配，包括上牙、上颚和鼻腔。教育目标：舌头前2/3的一般感觉由三叉神经下颌支传导。舌头前2/3的味觉神经支配由面神经的鼓索分支提供。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the sensory innervation of the tongue, specifically differentiating between general sensation and taste, and the anatomical locations served by different cranial nerves. It also integrates this knowledge with a clinical scenario suggestive of acute HIV infection.\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the location of the ulcer on the tongue and recall the specific cranial nerves responsible for general sensation in that region. Then, by correlating the location with the provided options, the correct nerve responsible for pain transmission can be identified.",
    "zh": "本题测试对舌头感觉神经支配的理解，特别是区分一般感觉和味觉，以及不同脑神经所服务的解剖位置。它还将此知识与提示急性HIV感染的临床情况相结合。\n要解决这个问题，首先必须确定舌头上溃疡的位置，并回忆起负责该区域一般感觉的特定脑神经。然后，通过将位置与提供的选项相关联，可以确定负责疼痛传递的正确神经。"
