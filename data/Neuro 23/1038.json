    "en": "A 2-month-old boy is brought to the clinic for irritability, poor feeding, and frequent vomiting. Weight is at the 15th percentile, and head circumference is at the 96th percentile. Lung sounds are clear throughout, and heart auscultation reveals no murmurs. The abdomen is soft and nondistended. There is hepatosplenomegaly. Diffusely reduced muscle tone is present in all extremities. Funduscopy reveals white-yellow chorioretinal lesions in both eyes. MRI of the brain shows enlarged ventricles and scattered intracranial calcifications. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",

    "en": "This patient with hydrocephalus, intracranial calcifications, and chorioretinitis has the classic triad of findings for **congenital toxoplasmosis**. Congenital infections (eg, TORCH infections [Toxoplasmosis, Other infections, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex]) are acquired **in utero** due to **transplacental transmission** from an infected mother. Maternal infection may be asymptomatic or mild but can severely affect the fetus, particularly when contracted early in pregnancy.\n\n**Prolonged inflammation** of the CNS during fetal development can lead to chronic inflammatory findings such as **intracranial calcifications**. Obstructive **hydrocephalus** can also occur, as seen in this patient with ventriculomegaly, enlarged head circumference, and signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, vomiting, hypotonia). Chronic chorioretinal inflammation (ie, **chorioretinitis**) produces white-yellow **retinal scars** that are visible on funduscopy.\n\nOther nonspecific findings that may raise suspicion for in utero infection include growth restriction, hepatosplenomegaly (due to fetal reticuloendothelial activation), and rash.\n\n(Choices A and E) Although chromosomal abnormalities and single gene defects can lead to congenital disorders associated with neurologic abnormalities, chorioretinitis is highly associated with infection, particularly when presenting with the classic triad of features for toxoplasmosis.\n\n(Choice B) Intrapartum transmission of certain bacteria (eg, group B *Streptococcus*) or viruses (eg, herpes simplex virus) can cause meningitis or encephalitis beyond the neonatal period, and presentation can include irritability, poor feeding, vomiting, and hypotonia. However, fever would be expected, and chorioretinal lesions would not be seen.\n\n(Choice D) Postpartum infection with pathogens such as *Toxoplasma* and cytomegalovirus is often asymptomatic or can cause mild, self-limited fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy. Late findings of prolonged infection and inflammation (eg, intracranial calcifications, chorioretinitis) typically occur only with intrauterine infection.\n\nEducational objective:\nCongenital toxoplasmosis is an infection acquired in utero that can present with hydrocephalus, intracranial calcifications, and chorioretinitis due to prolonged CNS inflammation.",
    "zh": "这位患有脑积水、颅内钙化和脉络视网膜炎的患者具有**先天性弓形虫病**的经典三联征。先天性感染（例如，TORCH感染 [弓形虫病、其他感染、风疹、巨细胞病毒和单纯疱疹病毒]）是在**宫内**获得的，原因是受感染母亲的**经胎盘传播**。母亲的感染可能无症状或轻微，但会严重影响胎儿，尤其是在妊娠早期感染时。\n\n胎儿发育过程中**中枢神经系统的长期炎症**可导致慢性炎症表现，如**颅内钙化**。阻塞性**脑积水**也可能发生，如该患者所见，表现为脑室增大、头围增大和颅内压升高征象（例如，呕吐、肌张力低下）。慢性脉络视网膜炎症（即**脉络视网膜炎**）会产生黄白色**视网膜瘢痕**，可通过眼底镜检查观察到。\n\n其他可能提示宫内感染的非特异性发现包括生长受限、肝脾肿大（由于胎儿网状内皮激活）和皮疹。\n\n（选项 A 和 E）虽然染色体异常和单基因缺陷可导致与神经系统异常相关的先天性疾病，但脉络视网膜炎与感染高度相关，尤其是在出现弓形虫病经典三联征时。\n\n（选项 B）某些细菌（例如，B 群*链球菌*）或病毒（例如，单纯疱疹病毒）的分娩期传播可导致新生儿期后的脑膜炎或脑炎，表现可包括易怒、喂养不良、呕吐和肌张力低下。然而，预计会出现发热，并且不会看到脉络视网膜病变。\n\n（选项 D）产后感染病原体，如*弓形虫*和巨细胞病毒，通常无症状，或可引起轻度、自限性发热、皮疹和淋巴结病。长期感染和炎症的晚期发现（例如，颅内钙化、脉络视网膜炎）通常仅发生在宫内感染时。\n\n教育目标：\n先天性弓形虫病是一种在宫内获得的感染，可因中枢神经系统长期炎症而表现为脑积水、颅内钙化和脉络视网膜炎。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of congenital infections, specifically the classic triad of findings associated with congenital toxoplasmosis: hydrocephalus, intracranial calcifications, and chorioretinitis. It also tests the understanding of how these infections are acquired and their effects on fetal development.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic triad of congenital toxoplasmosis. Consider the timing of infection (in utero vs. intrapartum vs. postpartum) and the typical presentations of other congenital infections.
