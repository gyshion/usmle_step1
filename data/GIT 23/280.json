    "en": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office due to intermittent dysphagia for solids and liquids. He has no significant past medical history and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. His father has a history of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Physical examination is unremarkable. The patient undergoes an esophageal manometric study that demonstrates periodic, simultaneous, and non-peristaltic contractions of large amplitude and long duration. Which of the following is the most likely pathogenesis of this patient's esophageal condition?",

    "en": "This patient's presentation is consistent with diffuse esophageal spasm (DES). Esophageal contractions are normally stimulated by esophageal distension from a food bolus. The contractions originate above the site of distension and propel the bolus downward in a coordinated fashion. In DES, several segments of the esophagus contract inappropriately at the same time, which appears as disorganized non-peristaltic contractions on esophageal manometry and \"corkscrew\" esophagus on barium esophagogram. Because the food bolus is inefficiently propelled toward the stomach, patients typically present with intermittent solid/liquid dysphagia, chest pain, heartburn, and food regurgitation. The pathogenesis of DES likely involves impaired inhibitory neurotransmission within the esophageal myenteric plexus.\n\n(Choice A) Patients with sliding hiatal hernia often develop symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (eg, heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia) due to anatomic disruption of the gastroesophageal junction and impaired esophageal acid clearance. However, esophageal manometry is typically normal.\n\n(Choice B) Eosinophilic esophagitis typically presents in atopic patients with solid food dysphagia and/or food impaction. Findings on esophageal manometry are nonspecific.\n\n(Choice D) Zenker's diverticulum is a mucosal outpouching through an area of muscle weakness located in the wall of the hypopharynx (Killian triangle). The condition typically presents in elderly men with dysphagia, foul breath (halitosis), and food regurgitation.\n\n(Choice E) Esophageal cancer typically presents with progressive solid food dysphagia and unintentional weight loss. Risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma include alcohol and tobacco use, whereas risk factors for adenocarcinoma include Barrett's esophagus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, smoking, and obesity.\n\n(Choice F) Systemic sclerosis may involve the lower two-thirds of the esophagus, resulting in smooth muscle atrophy and gut wall fibrosis. Patients can develop dysphagia with acid reflux; however, manometry typically shows absent peristaltic waves with decreased lower esophageal sphincter tone.\n\nEducational objective:\nDiffuse esophageal spasm is characterized by periodic, simultaneous, and non-peristaltic contractions of the esophagus due to impaired inhibitory innervation within the esophageal myenteric plexus. Patients typically present with liquid/solid dysphagia and chest pain due to inefficient propulsion of food into the stomach. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现与弥漫性食管痉挛(DES)一致。食管收缩通常由食物团引起的食管扩张刺激。收缩起始于扩张部位上方，并以协调的方式将食团向下推进。在DES中，食管的几个节段同时发生不适当的收缩，这在食管测压中表现为无序的非蠕动收缩，在钡餐食管造影中表现为“螺旋钻”状食管。由于食物团不能有效地推进到胃里，患者通常表现为间歇性固体/液体吞咽困难、胸痛、烧心和食物反流。DES的发病机制可能涉及食管肌间神经丛内抑制性神经传递受损。\n\n(选项A) 患有滑动性食管裂孔疝的患者经常因胃食管连接处的解剖结构破坏和食管酸清除功能受损而出现胃食管反流的症状（如烧心、反流、吞咽困难）。然而，食管测压通常是正常的。\n\n(选项B) 嗜酸性粒细胞性食管炎通常表现为特应性患者出现固体食物吞咽困难和/或食物嵌塞。食管测压结果无特异性。\n\n(选项D) Zenker憩室是黏膜通过位于下咽壁（Killian三角）的肌肉薄弱区域向外突出。该病症通常表现为老年男性出现吞咽困难、口臭（口臭）和食物反流。\n\n(选项E) 食管癌通常表现为进行性固体食物吞咽困难和非意向性体重减轻。鳞状细胞癌的危险因素包括饮酒和吸烟，而腺癌的危险因素包括 Barrett食管、胃食管反流病、吸烟和肥胖。\n\n(选项F) 系统性硬化症可能累及食管下三分之二，导致平滑肌萎缩和肠壁纤维化。患者可能会出现伴有酸反流的吞咽困难；然而，测压通常显示无蠕动波，食管下括约肌张力降低。\n\n教育目标：\n弥漫性食管痉挛的特征是由于食管肌间神经丛内抑制性神经支配受损而导致食管周期性、同时性和非蠕动性收缩。患者通常表现为液体/固体吞咽困难和胸痛，原因是食物不能有效地推进到胃中。{{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of diffuse esophageal spasm (DES), including its characteristic manometric findings and clinical presentation. It also requires differentiating DES from other esophageal disorders based on their clinical features and manometry results.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of DES: intermittent dysphagia for both solids and liquids, chest pain, and abnormal esophageal manometry showing simultaneous, non-peristaltic contractions. Understanding the underlying mechanism of impaired neural inhibition helps identify the correct answer.",
