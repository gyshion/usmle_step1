    "en": "A 49-year-old man comes to the office due to dysuria and hematuria. Vital signs are within normal limits and physical examination is unremarkable; urinalysis shows gross hematuria but is otherwise normal. The physician discusses potential causes and the need for a cystoscopy. The patient is told what to expect during the procedure and is given written information and a referral list with instructions on how to schedule an appointment with a urologist. He anxiously glances over the papers, saying he will make an appointment soon. Office staff had informed the physician that the patient was unable to follow the directions on the sign-in sheet and declined to fill out paperwork. Which of the following physician responses is the most appropriate at this time?",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's difficulty following written directions and reluctance to fill out paperwork are clues that suggest low health literacy, a common and underrecognized barrier to health care. Low health literacy (ie, difficulty with accessing, understanding, or using medical information to make decisions) contributes to poor health care access and outcomes, including medication errors, missed appointments, and failure to follow up with tests and referrals.\n\nAlthough formal literacy tests have been used in research, they are not recommended in clinical settings because they can be stigmatizing. Effective communication requires a patient-centered approach that avoids causing shame and embarrassment. Using an open-ended question that encourages discussion of any concerns about making the appointment is the best way to address the issue without shaming the patient. If this patient expressed difficulty, he could be assisted in scheduling the appointment while in the office.\n\n(Choice A) How far someone went in school does not necessarily indicate literacy level. In addition, this may be perceived as judgmental and condescending.\n\n(Choice B) Many patients with low literacy levels are embarrassed and attempt to conceal their difficulty. This confrontational approach assumes the patient has difficulty reading and writing, which may make him increasingly anxious and uncomfortable.\n\n(Choice C) This response inappropriately puts the patient on the spot to assess his literacy level.\n\n(Choice D) This response ignores the clues that suggest possible low health literacy. Failing to address this increases the risk that the patient will not schedule the cystoscopy and be lost to follow-up.\n\nEducational objective:\nLow health literacy is a common and underrecognized barrier to health care. It is important to assess patients' understanding of provided information without shaming or causing embarrassment.",
    "zh": "该患者难以按照书面指示操作，并且不愿意填写文件，这些是提示健康素养低的线索，而健康素养低是获得医疗保健的常见且未被充分认识的障碍。低健康素养（即，难以获取、理解或使用医疗信息来做出决策）导致不良的医疗保健获取和结局，包括用药错误、错过预约以及未能进行检查和转诊。\n\n尽管在研究中使用了正式的识字测试，但临床环境中不推荐使用这些测试，因为它们可能会造成污名化。有效的沟通需要以患者为中心的方法，避免引起羞耻感和尴尬。使用开放式问题鼓励讨论任何关于预约的担忧是解决此问题的最佳方法，而不会羞辱患者。如果该患者表达了困难，可以在诊所内协助他预约。\n\n(选项A) 某人上了几年学并不一定表明其识字水平。此外，这可能被认为是带有评判性和居高临下的态度。\n\n(选项B) 许多低识字水平的患者会感到尴尬，并试图掩盖他们的困难。这种对峙的方法假设患者难以阅读和书写，这可能会让他越来越焦虑和不舒服。\n\n(选项C) 这种回应不适当地让患者当场评估其识字水平。\n\n(选项D) 这种回应忽略了提示可能存在低健康素养的线索。未能解决此问题会增加患者不会预约膀胱镜检查并失访的风险。\n\n教育目标：\n低健康素养是医疗保健的常见且未被充分认识的障碍。重要的是评估患者对所提供信息的理解，而不会羞辱或引起尴尬。"
