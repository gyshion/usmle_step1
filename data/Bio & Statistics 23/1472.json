    "en": "Researchers studying molecular biology observe a eukaryotic cell via electron microscopy. During interphase of the cell cycle, they notice 10-nm thick chromatin fibers with a \"beads on a string\" appearance. These chromatin fibers are extracted and treated with an endonuclease, which preferentially cleaves the \"string\" portions of the chromatin. Further evaluation reveals that the \"beads\" are composed of DNA wrapped around a core of proteins.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Histone H1, in contrast to the other histone proteins, is located OUTSIDE the nucleosome core. Histone H1 binds to both the nucleosome and adjacent LINKER DNA, which facilitates packaging of chromatin into a thicker (30-nm), more COMPACT structure (heterochromatin) that limits transcriptional access to the DNA.",
    "zh": "与其他组蛋白相比，组蛋白H1位于核小体核心之外。组蛋白H1与核小体和相邻的连接DNA结合，这有助于将染色质包装成更厚（30纳米）、更紧密的结构（异染色质），从而限制转录对DNA的访问。"
