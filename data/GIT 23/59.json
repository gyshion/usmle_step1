    "en": "The patient's contrast-enhanced CT scan shows multiple hypodense masses in the liver (arrows) consistent with metastatic liver disease {{exhibit_2}}. Metastases are the most common malignant neoplasms of the adult liver and are 20 times more common than hepatocellular carcinoma. The liver is the second most common site of metastatic spread (after the lymph nodes) because of its large size, dual blood supply, high perfusion rate, and the filtration function of Kupffer cells.\n\nPatients with liver metastases typically have multiple nodules throughout the liver that may replace more than 80% of the hepatic parenchyma, often resulting in marked hepatomegaly. The nodules frequently outgrow their vascular supply and become centrally necrotic and umbilicated. Even with significant metastatic involvement, patients may have no clinical or laboratory signs suggestive of hepatic insufficiency. However, once the majority of the liver parenchyma is destroyed or the major bile ducts become obstructed with tumor, patients tend to present with jaundice or abnormal hepatic enzymes (eg, elevated aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase).\n\n(Choice A) Hepatic adenomas are uncommon, benign epithelial tumors of the liver that usually arise as a solitary mass in the right hepatic lobe. They are strongly associated with the use of oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids and are usually diagnosed in patients with upper abdominal pain or detected incidentally on imaging studies. They may rupture and cause intraabdominal hemorrhage.\n\n(Choice B) Hepatic angiosarcomas are associated with recent or remote exposure to vinyl chloride, arsenic, or Thorotrast. This tumor is extremely aggressive and is associated with a poor prognosis, as most patients die within a year.\n\n(Choice C) Hepatoblastoma is the most common liver neoplasm of children and is associated with familial adenomatous polyposis and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes. This neoplasm is usually fatal within a few years if not surgically resected.\n\n(Choice D) Hepatocellular carcinoma can present unifocally, multifocally, or as a diffusely infiltrative cancer. It is more common in older patients with a history of cirrhosis or infection with hepatitis B or C.\n\n(Choice E) Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare malignancy that arises from the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma appears grossly as a treelike mass that grows along the biliary system, typically resulting in extensive intrahepatic metastasis. Risk factors include primary sclerosing cholangitis, fibropolycystic liver disease, and infection with liver flukes in endemic areas. The prognosis is very poor.\n\nEducational objective:\nMalignant hepatic lesions most often represent metastasis from another primary site (eg, breast, lung, colon); primary liver neoplasms (eg, hepatocellular carcinoma) are much less common.",
    "zh": "患者的增强CT扫描显示肝脏内有多个低密度肿块（箭头），与转移性肝病一致 {{exhibit_2}}。转移瘤是成人肝脏中最常见的恶性肿瘤，其发生率是肝细胞癌的20倍。肝脏是继淋巴结之后第二常见的转移部位，这与其体积大、双重血供、高灌注率和Kupffer细胞的过滤功能有关。\n\n肝转移患者通常肝内有多个结节，这些结节可以取代超过80%的肝实质，常导致明显的肝肿大。结节的生长常超过其血管供应，并变得中心坏死和脐状。即使有明显的转移，患者也可能没有任何提示肝功能不全的临床或实验室体征。然而，一旦大部分肝实质被破坏或主要胆管被肿瘤阻塞，患者往往会出现黄疸或肝酶异常（如转氨酶、碱性磷酸酶升高）。\n\n（选项A）肝腺瘤是肝脏中不常见的良性上皮肿瘤，通常在肝右叶形成单个肿块。它与口服避孕药和合成代谢类固醇的使用密切相关，通常在有上腹部疼痛的患者中诊断，或在影像学检查中偶然发现。它们可能破裂并引起腹腔内出血。\n\n（选项B）肝血管肉瘤与近期或远期接触氯乙烯、砷或Thorotrast有关。这种肿瘤的侵袭性极强，预后不良，大多数患者在一年内死亡。\n\n（选项C）肝母细胞瘤是儿童中最常见的肝脏肿瘤，与家族性腺瘤性息肉病和Beckwith-Wiedemann综合征有关。如果不进行手术切除，这种肿瘤通常在几年内会致命。\n\n（选项D）肝细胞癌可表现为单发、多发或弥漫浸润性癌。在有肝硬化病史或乙型或丙型肝炎感染史的年长患者中更为常见。\n\n（选项E）胆管细胞癌是一种罕见的恶性肿瘤，起源于肝内和肝外胆管。肝内胆管细胞癌在肉眼下表现为沿胆道系统生长的树状肿块，通常导致广泛的肝内转移。危险因素包括原发性硬化性胆管炎、纤维性多囊性肝病和在流行地区感染肝吸虫。预后非常差。\n\n教育目标：\n恶性肝病变最常代表来自另一个原发部位（如乳腺、肺、结肠）的转移；原发性肝脏肿瘤（如肝细胞癌）则不常见。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize metastatic liver disease based on clinical presentation and imaging findings. It requires knowledge of the common causes of liver masses and their typical characteristics.\n\nThe best approach is to analyze the CT scan for multiple lesions, consider the patient's age and risk factors, and rule out other liver tumors based on their specific associations and presentations. Remember that metastatic disease is far more common than primary liver cancers.",
