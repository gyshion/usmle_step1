    "en": "The appearance of vacuoles and phospholipid-containing amorphous densities within mitochondria generally signifies irreversible injury, and implies a permanent inability to generate further ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. When the mitochondria are injured irreversibly, the cell cannot recover. Simple mitochondrial swelling may be associated with reversible cellular injury, however.\n\n(Choice A) Myofibril relaxation is an early sign of reversible injury in cardiac myocytes, which occurs within the first 30 minutes of severe ischemia. Myofibril relaxation corresponds with intracellular ATP depletion and lactate accumulation due to anaerobic glycolysis during this period.\n\n(Choice B) Disaggregation of polysomes denotes the dissociation of rRNA from mRNA in reversible ischemic/hypoxic injury. Depletion of intracellular ATP is thought to promote the dissolution of polysomes into monosomes as well as the detachment of ribosomes from the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Disaggregation of polysomes results in impaired protein synthesis.\n\n(Choice D) Disaggregation of granular and fibrillar elements of the nucleus is associated with reversible cell injury. Another common nuclear change associated with reversible cell injury is clumping of nuclear chromatin, perhaps secondary to a decrease in intracellular pH.\n\n(Choice E) Triglyceride droplet accumulation is characteristic of reversible cell injury, especially in hepatocytes, and also in striated muscle cells and renal cells. This fatty change may result from the decreased synthesis of intracellular proteins that occurs with cell injury. In the hepatocyte, decreased production of lipid acceptor proteins prevents the normal incorporation of triglycerides into lipoproteins. Since triglycerides cannot be rapidly exported from the cell in the form of lipoproteins, they accumulate intracellularly.\n\n(Choice F) Glycogen loss is another early and reversible cellular response to injury. As a result of lowered mitochondrial ATP production, ATP must be supplied to the cell via anaerobic glycolysis of glucose derived from the cell's glycogen stores. Myocardial glycogen stores may be completely depleted within 30 minutes of the onset of severe ischemia.\n\nEducational Objective:\nMitochondrial vacuolization is typically a sign of irreversible cell injury, signifying that the involved mitochondria are permanently unable to generate ATP.",
    "zh": "线粒体中出现空泡和含磷脂的无定形密度通常表示不可逆损伤，并意味着永久丧失通过氧化磷酸化产生更多ATP的能力。当线粒体受到不可逆损伤时，细胞无法恢复。然而，单纯的线粒体肿胀可能与可逆的细胞损伤有关。\n\n(选项 A) 肌原纤维松弛是心肌细胞可逆性损伤的早期征象，发生在严重缺血的最初30分钟内。肌原纤维松弛与细胞内ATP耗竭和由于该期间无氧糖酵解引起的乳酸蓄积相对应。\n\n(选项 B) 多聚核糖体解聚表示可逆性缺血/缺氧损伤中rRNA与mRNA的分离。细胞内ATP的耗竭被认为会促进多聚核糖体分解成单体核糖体以及核糖体从粗面内质网的脱离。多聚核糖体解聚导致蛋白质合成受损。\n\n(选项 D) 核的颗粒和纤维成分的解聚与可逆性细胞损伤有关。与可逆性细胞损伤相关的另一种常见的核变化是核染色质的凝集，这可能是由于细胞内pH值降低所致。\n\n(选项 E) 甘油三酯滴积聚是可逆性细胞损伤的特征，尤其是在肝细胞中，也见于横纹肌细胞和肾细胞中。这种脂肪变性可能是由于细胞损伤时细胞内蛋白质合成减少所致。在肝细胞中，脂质受体蛋白的产生减少阻止了甘油三酯正常地掺入脂蛋白中。由于甘油三酯不能以脂蛋白的形式迅速从细胞中输出，它们会在细胞内积聚。\n\n(选项 F) 糖原减少是另一种早期和可逆的细胞对损伤的反应。由于线粒体ATP产生降低，必须通过细胞的糖原储存库中提取的葡萄糖的无氧糖酵解向细胞提供ATP。心肌糖原储存库可能在严重缺血发作后30分钟内完全耗尽。\n\n教学目标：\n线粒体空泡变性通常是不可逆细胞损伤的征象，表明受累的线粒体永久无法产生ATP。"
