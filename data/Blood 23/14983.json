    "en": "A 26-year-old woman comes to the office for a follow-up appointment. She has a history of immune thrombocytopenia that failed to improve with glucocorticoid therapy. The patient underwent splenectomy 6 months ago, which resulted in improved platelet counts. She received the recommended vaccinations after her surgery and currently feels well. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A peripheral blood smear reveals many red blood cells of a specific morphology as indicated by the arrow below {{exhibit_1}}.",

    "en": "Target cells are red blood cells with a dark center, a surrounding halo of pallor, and a dark peripheral ring. They form in erythrocytes with an EXCESSIVE surface area-to-volume ratio, which results in redundant erythrocyte cell membrane folding upon itself (thereby creating the appearance of a target). Target cells occur in the following conditions:\n\n*   Reduced erythrocyte cell volume from deficient hemoglobin synthesis (eg, thalassemia, iron deficiency) or structural mutations to hemoglobin (eg, sickle cell)\n*   Excessive erythrocyte cellular membrane due to greater cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratios (eg, obstructive liver disease) or splenectomy\n\nMacrophages in the red pulp of the spleen remove excess membrane from red cells, a process called \"splenic conditioning.\" Patients who undergo splenectomy are unable to prune erythrocytes and generally develop target cells a few weeks following the procedure. However, over time, macrophages in nonsplenic tissue (eg, liver) take up the task of pruning erythrocytes, which typically eliminates (or diminishes) the presence of target cells in the circulation.\n\n(Choice A) Pappenheimer bodies are aggregated iron deposits in erythrocytes that are often seen in patients with sideroblastic anemia. They appear as dark blue inclusions {{exhibit_2}}.\n\n(Choice B) Howell-Jolly bodies are clusters of DNA remnants in erythrocytes due to hyposplenism or asplenism (the spleen usually removes the DNA remnants). They appear as peripheral, round, dark purple, blue, or red inclusions {{exhibit_3}}.\n\n(Choice C) Heinz bodies are aggregates of denatured hemoglobin that may be present in erythrocytes when patients have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or thalassemia. They cannot be seen on routine staining {{exhibit_4}}.\n\n(Choice D) Spherocytes have low surface area-to-volume ratios and are more susceptible to osmotic stress. They are seen most commonly in hemolytic anemia and hereditary spherocytosis and appear as dense, round red blood cells. Target cells are less susceptible to osmotic stress than normal red blood cells or spherocytes due to their excess membrane {{exhibit_5}}.\n\n(Choice E) Basophilic stippling is blue granules dispersed within the cytosol of erythrocytes due to precipitated ribosomes. It is seen most commonly in thalassemias, alcohol use disorder, and lead/heavy metal poisoning {{exhibit_6}}.\n\nEducational objective:\nTarget cells form when erythrocytes have reduced cell volume (eg, thalassemia, iron deficiency) or excessive membrane (eg, obstructive liver disease, postsplenectomy). Patients who undergo splenectomy usually develop target cells because the spleen is the primary organ that prunes excessive red cell membrane.",
    "zh": "靶形细胞是具有深色中心、周围苍白晕和深色外周环的红细胞。它们形成于具有过高表面积/体积比的红细胞中，这会导致多余的红细胞细胞膜自身折叠（从而产生靶形外观）。靶形细胞出现在以下情况：\n\n*   由于血红蛋白合成不足（例如，地中海贫血、缺铁）或血红蛋白结构突变（例如，镰状细胞病），导致红细胞体积减少\n*   由于胆固醇与磷脂比率较高（例如，阻塞性肝病）或脾切除术，导致红细胞细胞膜过多\n\n脾脏红髓中的巨噬细胞从红细胞中去除多余的膜，这一过程称为“脾脏调节”。接受脾切除术的患者无法修剪红细胞，通常在手术后几周内出现靶形细胞。然而，随着时间的推移，非脾脏组织（例如，肝脏）中的巨噬细胞承担起修剪红细胞的任务，这通常会消除（或减少）循环中靶形细胞的存在。\n\n（选项A）Pappenheimer小体是红细胞中聚集的铁沉积，常在患有铁粒幼细胞性贫血的患者中可见。它们表现为深蓝色包涵体 {{exhibit_2}}。\n\n（选项B）Howell-Jolly小体是红细胞中残留DNA的簇，由于脾功能减退或无脾症（脾脏通常会清除残留的DNA）。它们表现为外周、圆形、深紫色、蓝色或红色包涵体 {{exhibit_3}}。\n\n（选项C）Heinz小体是变性血红蛋白的聚集体，当患者患有葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶缺乏症或地中海贫血时，红细胞中可能存在。它们不能通过常规染色观察到 {{exhibit_4}}。\n\n（选项D）球形红细胞具有较低的表面积/体积比，并且更容易受到渗透压的影响。它们最常见于溶血性贫血和遗传性球形红细胞增多症中，表现为致密的圆形红细胞。由于其多余的膜，靶形细胞对渗透压的敏感性低于正常红细胞或球形红细胞 {{exhibit_5}}。\n\n（选项E）嗜碱性点彩是由于核糖体沉淀导致的红细胞胞质中散布的蓝色颗粒。它最常见于地中海贫血、酒精使用障碍和铅/重金属中毒 {{exhibit_6}}。\n\n教育目标：\n当红细胞体积减少（例如，地中海贫血、缺铁）或膜过多（例如，阻塞性肝病、脾切除术后）时，会形成靶形细胞。接受脾切除术的患者通常会发展为靶形细胞，因为脾脏是修剪多余红细胞膜的主要器官。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of peripheral blood smear findings following splenectomy, specifically the presence of target cells due to an increased surface area-to-volume ratio. It also tests understanding of the spleen's role in removing excess red cell membrane.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the morphology of target cells on the peripheral smear. Recall that splenectomy impairs the removal of excess red cell membrane, leading to an increased surface area-to-volume ratio and the formation of target cells.",
