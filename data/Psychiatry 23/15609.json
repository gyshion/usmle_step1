    "en": "A 6-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother due to behavioral difficulties at school. His teacher has said, \"He interrupts the class, doesn't listen, and cannot sit still for more than a few minutes.\" He has been sent home on a few occasions for hitting other children and taking their toys. The patient was adopted at age 6 months and his birth history is unknown. He runs around the office playing with various toys and is easily distracted. Vital signs are within normal limits. Weight and height are tracking on the 10th percentile, and head circumference is below the 5th percentile for age and sex. Physical examination reveals short palpebral fissures, a smooth philtrum, thin upper lip, and difficulty with both gross and fine motor coordination. Which of the following is the likely cause of this patient's condition?",

    "en": "This patient's behavioral difficulties, developmental delays, and characteristic facial features (short palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum, thin upper lip) are highly suggestive of FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME (FAS). Alcohol is a potent teratogen that can cause a spectrum of abnormalities, collectively known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). The most severe form, FAS, is characterized by facial dysmorphism, GROWTH RETARDATION, and CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) abnormalities, including neurodevelopmental and behavioral deficits. The patient's short palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum, and thin upper lip are classic facial features of FAS. His growth parameters (10th percentile for weight and height, below 5th percentile for head circumference) indicate growth retardation. His behavioral issues (interrupting, not listening, hyperactivity, difficulty with motor coordination) are consistent with CNS dysfunction. Intrauterine alcohol exposure can cause reduction in the volume of the caudate, striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum, resulting in abnormal reflexes, tone, and coordination. A decrease in the volume of the frontal lobe and dysfunction of the amygdala contribute to deficits in executive functioning, impulse control, and emotion regulation. Other NEUROBEHAVIORAL MANIFESTATIONS include cognitive impairment, learning disabilities, and social skill deficits.\n\n(Choice A) Fragile X syndrome is caused by an unstable CGG (cytosine-guanine-guanine) trinucleotide repeat on the X chromosome. Features include intellectual disability; a long, narrow face; large, protruding ears; macrocephaly; and macroorchidism. While intellectual disability and behavioral issues can be present, the facial features are distinct from those seen in this patient.\n\n(Choice C) Cocaine exposure in utero is associated with hypertonia and tremors in neonates and impairments in attention, language development, and behavioral regulation in school-aged children. It would not typically cause the specific facial anomalies seen in this patient.\n\n(Choice D) Rubella exposure in utero is associated with congenital heart defects, hearing impairment, and ocular abnormalities (eg, glaucoma, cataracts, retinopathy). While developmental delay can occur, the constellation of symptoms and facial features is not typical of congenital rubella syndrome.\n\n(Choice E) Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) is associated with a small mouth and prominent forehead; pointy ears; and flexed, overlapping fingers. Horseshoe kidney and congenital heart defects may be present. Survival beyond one year of age is uncommon and associated with severe intellectual disability. The facial features are different from those described.\n\n(Choice F) Facial features in trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) include epicanthal folds, upslanting palpebral fissures, brachycephaly (back of the head symmetrically flattened), flat nasal bridge, and protruding tongue. It is associated with varying degrees of intellectual disability. While intellectual disability and some motor delays can be seen, the specific facial features described in the vignette are not characteristic of Down syndrome.\n\nEducational objective: Typical features of fetal alcohol syndrome include facial dysmorphism (short palpebral fissures, thin upper lip, smooth philtrum), growth retardation, neurological abnormalities, and behavioral difficulties.",
    "zh": "该患者的行为困难、发育迟缓和特征性面部特征（睑裂短小、人中平滑、上唇薄）高度提示胎儿酒精综合征 (FAS)。酒精是一种有效的致畸剂，可引起一系列异常，统称为胎儿酒精谱系障碍 (FASD)。最严重的类型，即 FAS，以面部畸形、生长迟缓和中枢神经系统 (CNS) 异常为特征，包括神经发育和行为缺陷。该患者的睑裂短小、人中平滑和上唇薄是 FAS 的典型面部特征。他的生长参数（体重和身高第 10 百分位数，头围低于第 5 百分位数）表明生长迟缓。他的行为问题（打断、不听、多动、运动协调困难）与 CNS 功能障碍一致。宫内酒精暴露可导致尾状核、纹状体、丘脑和小脑的体积减少，导致反射、肌张力和协调性异常。额叶体积的减少和杏仁核的功能障碍导致执行功能、冲动控制和情绪调节的缺陷。其他神经行为表现包括认知障碍、学习障碍和社会技能缺陷。\n\n（选项 A）脆性 X 综合征是由 X 染色体上的不稳定的 CGG（胞嘧啶-鸟嘌呤-鸟嘌呤）三核苷酸重复序列引起的。特征包括智力障碍；长而窄的脸；大而突出的耳朵；巨头畸形；和睾丸过大。虽然可能存在智力障碍和行为问题，但面部特征与该患者所见的有所不同。\n\n（选项 C）宫内可卡因暴露与新生儿高张力和震颤以及学龄儿童的注意力、语言发育和行为调节障碍有关。它通常不会引起该患者所见的特定面部异常。\n\n（选项 D）宫内风疹暴露与先天性心脏缺陷、听力障碍和眼部异常（如青光眼、白内障、视网膜病变）有关。虽然可能发生发育迟缓，但症状和面部特征的组合不是先天性风疹综合征的典型表现。\n\n（选项 E）18 三体综合征（爱德华兹综合征）与小嘴和突出的前额有关；尖耳朵；以及弯曲、重叠的手指。可能存在马蹄形肾和先天性心脏缺陷。超过一岁生存的情况很少见，并且与严重的智力障碍有关。面部特征与所描述的不同。\n\n（选项 F）21 三体综合征（唐氏综合征）的面部特征包括内眦赘皮、上斜睑裂、短头畸形（头部后部对称扁平）、鼻梁扁平、舌头突出。它与不同程度的智力障碍有关。虽然可以看到智力障碍和一些运动迟缓，但短文中所述的特定面部特征并非唐氏综合征的特征。\n\n教育目标：胎儿酒精综合征的典型特征包括面部畸形（睑裂短小、上唇薄、人中平滑）、生长迟缓、神经系统异常和行为困难。"

    "en": "This question tests the recognition of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) based on a child's behavioral, developmental, and physical examination findings, particularly characteristic facial dysmorphisms and growth retardation. It requires differentiating FAS from other genetic and environmental causes of developmental delay and behavioral issues.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully evaluate the patient's presenting symptoms, including behavioral observations, growth parameters, and specific physical examination findings. Correlate these findings with the known features of the differential diagnoses provided in the options, paying close attention to the pathognomonic facial features of FAS.",
