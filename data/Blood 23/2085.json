    "en": "The patient is admitted to the hospital and receives opioid analgesics and intravenous fluids. He has no evidence of active infection. His hemoglobin electrophoresis results are consistent with sickle cell disease (hemoglobin SS). Further laboratory evaluation shows a mean corpuscular volume of 113 µm³ and a reticulocyte index of 1.5, which is low given the patient's severe anemia.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has macrocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] >100 µm³). Severe macrocytosis (MCV >110 µm³) is usually due to megaloblastic anemia, a subtype of macrocytic anemia caused by impaired DNA synthesis. Cytoplasmic components then accumulate within the slowly dividing erythrocytes, producing cells that are larger than normal (macrocytes).\n\nPatients with sickle cell disease (SCD) or other hemolytic anemias have increased folic acid requirements due to increased erythrocyte turnover. As such, they are prone to developing relative folic acid deficiency and megaloblastic anemia.\n\n(Choice A) Extramedullary erythropoiesis can occur in SCD and lead to an elevated reticulocyte count and MCV, as the reticulocytes produced are larger than those released by the bone marrow. However, this patient's low reticulocyte index (representing the reticulocyte percentage corrected for the degree of anemia) suggests an inadequate response to anemia and a lack of erythropoiesis.\n\n(Choice C) Patients with SCD may receive multiple transfusions for treatment of severe or symptomatic anemia. Transfusion related iron overload can cause severe liver disease, but would be unlikely to produce an MCV >110 µm³.\n\n(Choice D) Macrocytosis can occur in liver failure due to an increase in circulating phospholipids and cholesterol that adsorb onto erythrocytes, resulting in membrane expansion. However, liver-associated macrocytosis is generally mild (<110 µm³) and this patient does not have any findings to suggest advanced liver disease (eg, ascites/edema, bleeding).\n\n(Choice E) A disease of the elderly, myelodysplastic syndrome can cause macrocytic anemia. In the setting of a young patient with SCD and hemolytic anemia, however, folic deficiency is much more likely.\n\nEducational objective:\nAn MCV >110 µm³ is highly suggestive of megaloblastic anemia, such as that caused by folic acid or vitamin B₁₂ deficiency. Patients with chronic hemolytic anemia have increased folic acid requirements due to increased erythrocyte turnover and are predisposed to developing macrocytosis.",
    "zh": "该患者患有巨红细胞性贫血（平均红细胞体积[MCV] >100 µm³）。严重的巨红细胞增多症（MCV >110 µm³）通常是由于巨幼细胞性贫血，这是一种巨红细胞性贫血的亚型，由DNA合成受损引起。细胞质成分随后会在缓慢分裂的红细胞内积聚，产生比正常大的细胞（巨红细胞）。\n\n镰状细胞病（SCD）或其他溶血性贫血患者由于红细胞更新增加而对叶酸的需求增加。因此，他们容易发生相对叶酸缺乏和巨幼细胞性贫血。\n\n（选项A）髓外红细胞生成可能发生在SCD中，并导致网织红细胞计数和MCV升高，因为产生的网织红细胞比骨髓释放的网织红细胞大。然而，该患者的网织红细胞指数较低（代表针对贫血程度校正后的网织红细胞百分比）表明对贫血的反应不足以及缺乏红细胞生成。\n\n（选项C）SCD患者可能接受多次输血以治疗严重或有症状的贫血。输血相关的铁过载可导致严重的肝病，但不太可能产生MCV >110 µm³。\n\n（选项D）肝衰竭可因循环磷脂和胆固醇增加而发生巨红细胞增多，这些物质吸附在红细胞上，导致细胞膜膨胀。然而，肝脏相关的巨红细胞增多症通常较轻（<110 µm³），并且该患者没有任何提示晚期肝病（如腹水/水肿、出血）的发现。\n\n（选项E）老年病，骨髓增生异常综合征可导致巨红细胞性贫血。然而，在患有SCD和溶血性贫血的年轻患者中，叶酸缺乏的可能性更大。\n\n教育目标：\nMCV >110 µm³高度提示巨幼细胞性贫血，例如由叶酸或维生素B₁₂缺乏引起的。患有慢性溶血性贫血的患者由于红细胞更新增加而对叶酸的需求增加，并且易患巨红细胞增多症。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of macrocytic anemia in the context of sickle cell disease, specifically the increased folic acid requirements and potential for deficiency. It also assesses understanding of other causes of macrocytosis and their likelihood in this clinical scenario.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the patient's underlying sickle cell disease and its impact on folic acid needs. Rule out other causes of macrocytosis based on the clinical presentation and lab findings, focusing on the most common and relevant complications of SCD.",
