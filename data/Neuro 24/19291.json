    "en": "A 62-year-old woman comes to the office for follow-up a month after undergoing left mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection for invasive ductal carcinoma. Today, the patient feels well overall but reports continued burning and aching in her left upper arm, despite physical therapy. Examination of the left chest wall shows a healing incision without erythema and mild but appropriate edema of the left chest wall and axillary soft tissues. Sensation is diminished in the medial upper arm, near the axilla. Shoulder range of motion is normal, and the rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient underwent axillary lymph node dissection and now presents with persistent sensory dysfunction (eg, burning, numbness) in her medial upper arm, findings consistent with INTERCOSTOBRACHIAL NERVE injury. The intercostobrachial nerve is a purely sensory nerve that typically originates from the second intercostal nerve's lateral cutaneous branch and is then traverses the axilla to innervate the skin of the axilla and medial upper arm.\n\nThe intercostobrachial nerve is the most frequently injured nerve (whether by stretching or transection) during axillary lymph node dissection. However, injuries to OTHER AT-RISK NERVES are often more feared due to the resultant motor deficits:\n\n• Long thoracic nerve (serratus anterior): Damage results in scapular winging and weakness of arm abduction above the horizontal level.\n\n• Thoracodorsal nerve (latissimus dorsi): Damage results in loss of powerful adduction of the arm and weakness while extending and medially rotating the arm. (Choice D)\n\n• Medial pectoral (pectoralis minor and major) and lateral pectoral (pectoralis major) nerves: Damage results in weakness while adducting and medially rotating the arm. In addition, there may be weakness flexing (clavicular head) or extending (sternocostal head) the humerus. (Choice B)\n\nThis patient has normal shoulder range of motion and an otherwise unremarkable examination (ie, no MOTOR WEAKNESS), making injury to these nerves less likely. In addition, because the long thoracic, thoracodorsal, and medial and lateral pectoral nerves are primarily motor nerves and not responsible for any cutaneous sensation, their injury would not explain this patient's sensory deficits.\n\n(Choice C) The suprascapular nerve provides sensation to the shoulder joint (glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints) and motor innervation to the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. It branches off the upper trunk of the brachial plexus and travels posteriorly towards the suprascapular notch of the scapula, where it is prone to injury; it does not travel through the axilla and is not at risk during axillary dissection.\n\nEducational objective:\nMultiple nerves are at risk for injury during axillary lymph node dissection. Intercostobrachial nerve injury results in sensory dysfunction (eg, burning, numbness) to the skin of the axilla and medial upper arm. Injury to the long thoracic (serratus anterior), thoracodorsal (latissimus dorsi), medial pectoral (pectoralis minor and major), or lateral pectoral (pectoralis major) nerves results in motor deficits to corresponding muscles.",
    "zh": "该患者接受了腋窝淋巴结清扫术，现在出现持续性感觉功能障碍（例如，烧灼感、麻木），位于其内上臂，这些发现与肋间臂神经损伤一致。肋间臂神经是一根纯感觉神经，通常起源于第二肋间神经的外侧皮支，然后穿过腋窝，支配腋窝和内上臂的皮肤。\n\n肋间臂神经是腋窝淋巴结清扫术中最常受损的神经（无论是牵拉还是切断）。然而，由于由此产生的运动功能障碍，其他有风险神经的损伤往往更令人担忧：\n\n• 长胸神经（前锯肌）：损伤导致肩胛骨翼状和手臂外展超过水平面时的无力。\n\n• 胸背神经（背阔肌）：损伤导致手臂强力内收功能丧失，以及伸展和内旋手臂时的无力。(选项D)\n\n• 内侧胸神经（胸小肌和胸大肌）和外侧胸神经（胸大肌）：损伤导致手臂内收和内旋时的无力。此外，可能存在屈曲（锁骨头）或伸展（胸骨头）肱骨的无力。(选项B)\n\n该患者肩关节活动范围正常，且体格检查无其他异常（即，无运动无力），这使得这些神经损伤的可能性降低。此外，由于长胸神经、胸背神经以及内侧和外侧胸神经主要是运动神经，而不是负责任何皮肤感觉，因此它们的损伤并不能解释该患者的感觉功能障碍。\n\n(选项C) 肩胛上神经为肩关节（肩肱关节和肩锁关节）提供感觉，并为冈上肌和冈下肌提供运动支配。它从臂丛神经的上干分出，向后行进至肩胛骨的肩胛上切迹，此处易于受伤；它不穿过腋窝，在腋窝清扫术中无风险。\n\n教育目标：\n在腋窝淋巴结清扫术中，多条神经有损伤风险。肋间臂神经损伤导致腋窝和内上臂皮肤的感觉功能障碍（例如，烧灼感、麻木）。长胸神经（前锯肌）、胸背神经（背阔肌）、内侧胸神经（胸小肌和胸大肌）或外侧胸神经（胸大肌）的损伤会导致相应肌肉的运动功能障碍。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of potential nerve injuries following axillary lymph node dissection, specifically differentiating between sensory and motor deficits and identifying the nerve responsible for medial arm paresthesias.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves correlating the patient's symptoms (sensory deficits in the medial upper arm) with the anatomical locations and functions of nerves at risk during axillary dissection, while also considering the absence of motor deficits.",
