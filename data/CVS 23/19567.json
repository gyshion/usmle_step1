    "en": "During moderate to heavy exercise, several cardiovascular changes occur to facilitate adequate oxygen delivery to skeletal muscle. These changes and their effects on the left ventricular (LV) pressure-volume loop are as follows:\n\n*   Vasoconstriction of capacitance veins mobilizes blood from the legs and increases venous return (ie, INCREASED PRELOAD), which shifts LV end-diastolic volume to the right. There is also vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation and a higher degree of vasodilation in skeletal muscle, which shunts blood away from the gastrointestinal tract toward skeletal muscle and causes overall REDUCED SYSTEMIC VASCULAR RESISTANCE (SVR). The reduced SVR also contributes to increased preload by allowing cardiac output to return to the right atrium more quickly and easily.\n*   Myocardial CONTRACTILITY is markedly INCREASED, shifting point 3 up and to the left. Both the increased contractility and the increased preload contribute to INCREASED STROKE VOLUME (ie, the horizontal distance between points 1 and 3 is increased).\n*   Although reduced SVR typically leads to a slight decrease in diastolic pressure during exercise, the increase in myocardial contractility and stroke volume causes systolic pressure to rise. This results in an overall INCREASE IN AFTERLOAD due to increased peak LV and aortic pressure during LV contraction.\n\nThe increase in stroke volume, combined with an increase in heart rate, INCREASES CARDIAC OUTPUT to meet the metabolic demands of exercise.\n\n(Choice B) This graph shows an increase in contractility that leads to increased stroke volume and a slight increase in afterload. Such changes are expected with a positive inotropic agent such as digoxin.\n\n(Choice C) This graph shows an increase in afterload with a consequent reduction in stroke volume (end-systolic volume is increased). Such changes are expected with the obstruction to LV outflow that occurs with aortic stenosis.\n\n(Choice D) This graph shows an increase in preload (end-diastolic volume) with a consequent increase in stroke volume and slight increase in afterload. Such changes are expected with the increase in intravascular volume that occurs with the infusion of normal saline.\n\n(Choice E) This graph shows decreased preload with a consequent decrease in stroke volume and slight reduction in afterload. Such changes are expected with the selective venous vasodilation that occurs with nitroglycerin.\n\nEducational objective:\nWith moderate to heavy exercise, the changes to the left ventricular pressure-volume loop include increased preload and increased contractility that both contribute to increased stroke volume. Although reduced systemic vascular resistance decreases afterload, the increase in systolic pressure caused by increased preload and contractility override the decrease, resulting in overall increased afterload.",
    "zh": "在中度至剧烈运动期间，会发生几种心血管变化以促进向骨骼肌充分输送氧气。这些变化及其对左心室 (LV) 压力-容积环的影响如下：\n\n*   容量静脉的血管收缩从腿部动员血液并增加静脉回流（即，增加前负荷），这使左心室舒张末期容积向右移动。内脏循环也有血管收缩，骨骼肌有较高程度的血管舒张，这使血液从胃肠道分流至骨骼肌，导致总体系统血管阻力 (SVR) 降低。降低的 SVR 也有助于增加前负荷，因为它可以使心输出量更快、更容易地返回右心房。\n*   心肌收缩力显着增加，将点 3 向上移动并向左移动。收缩力的增加和前负荷的增加都有助于增加每搏输出量（即，点 1 和 3 之间的水平距离增加）。\n*   尽管 SVR 降低通常会导致运动期间舒张压略有下降，但心肌收缩力和每搏输出量的增加会导致收缩压升高。这导致总的后负荷增加，这是由于左心室收缩期间左心室和主动脉峰值压力升高所致。\n\n每搏输出量的增加，加上心率的增加，增加了心输出量，以满足运动的代谢需求。\n\n（选项 B）该图显示收缩力的增加导致每搏输出量增加和后负荷略有增加。这种变化预计会伴随正性肌力药物，如地高辛。\n\n（选项 C）该图显示后负荷增加，导致每搏输出量减少（舒张末期容积增加）。这种变化预计会伴随主动脉瓣狭窄发生的左心室流出道梗阻。\n\n（选项 D）该图显示前负荷增加（舒张末期容积），导致每搏输出量增加和后负荷略有增加。这种变化预计会伴随静脉输注生理盐水发生的血管内容积增加。\n\n（选项 E）该图显示前负荷降低，导致每搏输出量减少和后负荷略有降低。这种变化预计会伴随使用硝酸甘油发生的选择性静脉血管舒张。\n\n教育目标：\n在中度至剧烈运动中，左心室压力-容积环的变化包括前负荷增加和收缩力增加，两者都有助于增加每搏输出量。尽管降低的系统血管阻力会降低后负荷，但由前负荷和收缩力增加引起的收缩压升高会抵消这种降低，导致总体后负荷增加。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of how exercise affects the left ventricular pressure-volume loop, specifically focusing on changes in preload, afterload, contractility, and stroke volume. It requires knowledge of cardiovascular physiology and the hemodynamic responses to exercise. \n\nThe best approach is to recall the physiological changes during exercise: increased venous return (preload), increased contractility, decreased systemic vascular resistance (afterload), and increased stroke volume. Then, select the pressure-volume loop that best represents these changes compared to the resting state.",
