    "en": "A 26-year-old man comes to the office due to severe headaches that are increasing in frequency. The patient describes episodic, right-sided hemicranial throbbing or pulsating headaches accompanied by nausea and photophobia. The headaches began when he was in high school, but lately they have become more frequent and are affecting his work. The patient takes nonsteroidal analgesics and sumatriptan for the pain and metoclopramide for nausea. He has no other medical conditions and no drug allergies. Vital signs are within normal limits, and physical examination shows no abnormalities. A recent brain imaging study was normal.",

    "en": "This patient has recurrent MIGRAINE, a disorder characterized by severe, unilateral headaches, frequently associated with nausea and sensitivity to light and sound. Migraine therapy is divided into abortive therapy for acute pain control and preventive therapy to reduce the frequency and severity of the headaches. Commonly used abortive medications include mild analgesics (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen), triptans (eg, sumatriptan), antiemetics (eg, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine), and ergotamines. These medications reduce symptoms at headache onset but do not prevent further headaches.\n\nPatients with frequent migraines or significant impairment due to the symptoms warrant preventive therapy. Topiramate is an anticonvulsant that reduces the frequency of migraines. Other preventive medications include beta blockers (eg, metoprolol, propranolol), tricyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline), and other anticonvulsants (eg, valproate).\n\n(Choice A) Capsaicin is derived from chili peppers and is useful as a topical therapy for neuropathic or musculoskeletal pain; it is not useful for treatment of migraine.\n\n(Choice B) Ergotamine has both agonist and antagonist activities on multiple neurotransmitters (eg, dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine) and acts as a vasoconstrictor. It is used for migraine abortion, not prevention.\n\n(Choice C) Hydrochlorothiazide is an antihypertensive that reduces sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule. Although beta blockers (another type of antihypertensive) are useful for migraine prevention, hydrochlorothiazide is not indicated for treatment of migraines.\n\n(Choice D) Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used for depression and anxiety. Although tricyclic antidepressants are used for migraine prevention, SSRIs have not been shown to prevent migraines.",
    "zh": "该患者患有复发性偏头痛，这是一种以严重的单侧头痛为特征的疾病，常伴有恶心和对光线和声音的敏感。偏头痛治疗分为急性疼痛控制的缓解治疗和降低头痛频率和严重程度的预防治疗。常用的缓解药物包括轻度镇痛药（如非甾体类抗炎药、对乙酰氨基酚）、曲坦类药物（如舒马曲坦）、止吐药（如甲氧氯普胺、氯丙嗪）和麦角胺。这些药物可减轻头痛发作时的症状，但不能预防进一步的头痛。\n\n由于症状导致频繁偏头痛或明显受损的患者需要预防性治疗。托吡酯是一种抗惊厥药，可降低偏头痛的频率。其他预防性药物包括β受体阻滞剂（如美托洛尔、普萘洛尔）、三环类抗抑郁药（如阿米替林）和其他抗惊厥药（如丙戊酸钠）。\n\n（选项A）辣椒素来源于辣椒，可用作神经性或肌肉骨骼疼痛的局部治疗；它对治疗偏头痛无效。\n\n（选项B）麦角胺对多种神经递质（如多巴胺、血清素、肾上腺素）具有激动剂和拮抗剂活性，并具有血管收缩作用。它用于偏头痛的缓解，而不是预防。\n\n（选项C）氢氯噻嗪是一种降压药，可减少远曲小管对钠的重吸收。尽管β受体阻滞剂（另一种降压药）可用于偏头痛的预防，但氢氯噻嗪不适用于偏头痛的治疗。\n\n（选项D）舍曲林是一种用于抑郁症和焦虑症的选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（SSRI）。尽管三环类抗抑郁药用于偏头痛的预防，但尚未证明SSRI可以预防偏头痛。"
