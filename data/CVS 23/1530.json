    "en": "This young, asymptomatic patient with a soft systolic ejection murmur at the right second intercostal space most likely has a bicuspid aortic valve. \n\nThe graph above depicts the normal left ventricular (LV) pressure and volume curves during the cardiac cycle. Ventricular pressure and volume curves allow one to identify the phases of the cardiac cycle and to determine the exact time of opening and closure of the cardiac valves. Aortic valve opening occurs when the LV pressure exceeds the central aortic pressure at the end of isovolumetric contraction. Subsequently, LV pressure continues to rise with forward blood flow into the aorta, until the pressure in the left ventricle falls below the aortic pressure leading to aortic valve closure.\n\n(Choice A) The initial part of the LV pressure and volume curves corresponds to atrial systole, which results in a slight increase in LV volume and pressure. This is immediately followed by mitral valve closure and the beginning of isovolumetric contraction, where the LV pressure remains constant.\n\n(Choice C) This point corresponds to aortic valve closure, where LV pressure falls below the central aortic pressure. This also marks the beginning of isovolumetric relaxation, where the LV pressure rapidly falls while LV volume remains relatively constant.\n\n(Choice D) Left atrial pressure gradually increases from passive filling from the pulmonary veins and exceeds LV pressure at the end of isovolumetric relaxation, leading to the opening of the mitral valves.\n\n(Choice E) This point corresponds to passive LV filling with blood flow from the left atrium, which results in a gradual rise in LV volume and pressure. {{exhibit_2}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cardiac physiology, specifically the relationship between left ventricular pressure and volume during the cardiac cycle, and how these relate to valve opening and closing. It also tests the ability to correlate auscultation findings with potential valve abnormalities.\n\nTo solve this question, analyze the provided pressure-volume loop to identify the point corresponding to aortic valve opening. Relate the patient's murmur characteristics (ejection click, systolic murmur radiating to the neck) to the most likely underlying valve abnormality (bicuspid aortic valve).",
