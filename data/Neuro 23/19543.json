    "en": "A 44-year-old man comes to the office due to hand tremors. The patient first noticed the tremor 2 years ago, and it has gradually worsened. He feels well most of the time, but his hands shake uncontrollably with activities such as pouring drinks or writing notes. The symptoms are most pronounced during stressful situations such as office meetings, and he keeps his hands tightly squeezed together or hidden below the table. He has had no arm stiffness, leg symptoms, or difficulty walking, but his wife has noticed that the patient occasionally keeps nodding his head while talking. Physical examination shows obvious tremors of outstretched hands that worsen during finger-nose testing.",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a worsening tremor of his distal upper extremities that becomes more pronounced with extension of his arms and at the end of an intended action (finger-to-nose test). In association with a head tremor (eg, repetitive nodding) and absence of other neurologic manifestations, this is most consistent with ESSENTIAL TREMOR (ET). ET is often hereditary and can be passed in an autosomal dominant fashion, so a FAMILY HISTORY of tremor supports the diagnosis.\n\nAlthough features of ET are highly variable, it most often affects the WRISTS and HANDS, especially when the arms are extended. It worsens with movement (ie, ACTION TREMOR) and improves, but may not completely abate, at rest. Although ET is not typically unilateral, it may be asymmetric. It can also affect the HEAD and voice, but it generally spares the trunk and legs and is not associated with other neurologic manifestations. Although ET does not shorten life, it is slowly PROGRESSIVE and may cause patients significant social embarrassment and impair activities of daily living.\n\n(Choice A) ET classically improves with, rather than is exacerbated by, alcohol use.\n\n(Choices B and E) Secondary parkinsonism can be induced by MPTP (a toxic substance that destroys dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra) or by the use of dopamine D2 receptor blocking drugs (eg, antipsychotics, antiemetics). Patients can have tremor, but it is typically most prominent at rest and improves with action. The tremor is also accompanied by other parkinsonian features such as rigidity, postural instability, and gait disturbances.\n\n(Choice D) Previous head trauma can predispose to a wide range of neurologic sequelae, particularly headaches, seizures, and dementia. However, the development of isolated ET due to head trauma would be rare.\n\nEducational objective:\nEssential tremor most often presents as a tremor of the hands that is suppressed at rest, exacerbated by outstretched arms, and more pronounced during goal-directed movements. It is often hereditary (autosomal dominant) and can be associated with a head tremor, but it is not associated with other neurologic symptoms.",
    "zh": "该患者出现远端上肢震颤加重，当伸展手臂和完成预期动作（指鼻测试）时更为明显。结合头部震颤（例如，重复点头）和无其他神经系统表现，这与原发性震颤（ET）最为一致。ET常具有遗传性，可呈常染色体显性遗传，因此震颤的家族史支持该诊断。\n\n尽管ET的特征差异很大，但它最常影响腕部和手部，尤其是在手臂伸展时。它会随着运动而加重（即，动作性震颤），而在休息时改善，但可能不会完全消失。虽然ET通常不是单侧性的，但可能是不对称的。它也可能影响头部和声音，但通常不累及躯干和腿部，并且与其它神经系统表现无关。尽管ET不会缩短寿命，但它会缓慢进展，并可能导致患者明显的社交尴尬，并损害日常生活活动。\n\n(选项A) ET通常会随着饮酒而改善，而不是加重。\n\n(选项B和E)继发性帕金森病可由MPTP（一种破坏黑质多巴胺能神经元的有毒物质）或使用多巴胺D2受体阻滞剂（例如，抗精神病药、止吐药）引起。患者可能会出现震颤，但震颤通常在静止时最为明显，并在活动时改善。震颤也伴有其他帕金森病特征，如僵硬、姿势不稳和步态障碍。\n\n(选项D) 既往头部外伤可能易患多种神经系统后遗症，尤其是头痛、癫痫发作和痴呆。然而，因头部外伤而发生孤立性ET的情况很少见。\n\n教育目标：\n原发性震颤最常表现为手部震颤，在静止时被抑制，在手臂伸展时加重，并且在有目标导向的运动中更为明显。它通常具有遗传性（常染色体显性遗传），并可能与头部震颤相关，但与其它神经系统症状无关。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of essential tremor (ET), including its clinical presentation, inheritance pattern, and differentiating features from other tremor disorders. Key aspects include action tremor, head nodding, and family history.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the features of essential tremor (action tremor, head nodding, lack of other neurological signs) and associate it with a family history.
