    "en": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the office due to excessive facial hair growth that has worsened over the past several years. The patient is very concerned and says it makes her feel self-conscious in public. She has tried several cosmetic measures, including laser removal and waxing, but the results have been unsatisfactory. Her past medical history is insignificant, and she takes no medications. The patient's last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago, but she regularly has long cycles and otherwise feels well. She is sexually active with her boyfriend and uses condoms for contraception. Examination shows moderate obesity with mild hirsutism on the face and chest. The patient is initiated on a combination oral contraceptive.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Excessive male-pattern hair growth in a woman is called hirsutism. Hirsutism can be due to increased androgen production (eg, polycystic ovary syndrome, Cushing syndrome, ovarian and adrenal tumors), increased local conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), or higher sensitivity of hair follicles to DHT (eg, idiopathic hirsutism). With excessive androgen exposure, soft, non-pigmented villous hair changes to coarse pigmented terminal hair in androgen-dependent areas of the body (eg, face, chest, back). VIRILIZATION occurs with very high androgen levels and is characterized by clitoromegaly, increased muscularity, and voice deepening in addition to hirsutism.\n\nThe most common cause of hirsutism is POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME (PCOS), which is often associated with elevated androgen levels. Combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are usually the first choice for treating hirsutism in PCOS. OCPs work by suppressing LH secretion from the pituitary, thereby decreasing ovarian androgen production. They also increase sex hormone-binding globulin synthesis by the liver, decreasing free testosterone levels.\n\n(Choice A) Ornithine decarboxylase is involved in DNA stabilization and repair. Inhibition leads to decreased cell growth and increased apoptosis. Eflornithine is a topical ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor used to decrease the rate of facial hair growth.\n\n(Choice C) Patients with PCOS who develop diabetes mellitus are usually treated with metformin, which increases insulin sensitivity. Metformin can also help normalize menses but would not improve hirsutism.\n\n(Choices D and E) Testosterone receptor antagonists (eg, spironolactone) are effective in suppressing androgen-dependent hair growth. 5-α-reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride) decrease peripheral conversion of testosterone to DHT but are less effective than testosterone receptor antagonists in treating hirsutism. Both are strongly teratogenic.\n\nEducational objective:\nMale-pattern hair growth in a woman is called hirsutism; the most common cause is polycystic ovary syndrome. Combination oral contraceptive pills can treat hirsutism by suppressing pituitary LH secretion and subsequently decreasing ovarian androgen production.",
    "zh": "女性出现男性型毛发生长过度被称为多毛症。多毛症可由雄激素产生增加（例如，多囊卵巢综合征、库欣综合征、卵巢和肾上腺肿瘤）、睾酮局部转化为双氢睾酮 (DHT) 增加，或毛囊对DHT的敏感性增加（例如，特发性多毛症）引起。过度暴露于雄激素后，身体的雄激素依赖区域（如面部、胸部、背部）的柔软、无色素的绒毛会变成粗糙的有色素的终毛。男性化发生在雄激素水平非常高的情况下，其特征除了多毛症外，还包括阴蒂肥大、肌肉增加和声音变低。\n\n多毛症最常见的原因是多囊卵巢综合征（PCOS），通常与雄激素水平升高相关。复方口服避孕药（OCPs）通常是治疗PCOS患者多毛症的首选。OCPs通过抑制垂体分泌LH发挥作用，从而减少卵巢雄激素的产生。它们还通过肝脏增加性激素结合球蛋白的合成，从而降低游离睾酮水平。\n\n(选项 A) 鸟氨酸脱羧酶参与DNA的稳定和修复。抑制导致细胞生长减少和细胞凋亡增加。依氟鸟氨酸是一种局部鸟氨酸脱羧酶抑制剂，用于降低面部毛发的生长速度。\n\n(选项 C) 患有PCOS且发生糖尿病的患者通常使用二甲双胍治疗，二甲双胍可增加胰岛素敏感性。二甲双胍也有助于月经正常化，但不能改善多毛症。\n\n(选项 D 和 E) 睾酮受体拮抗剂（如螺内酯）可有效抑制雄激素依赖性毛发生长。5-α-还原酶抑制剂（如非那雄胺）可减少睾酮向DHT的周围转化，但在治疗多毛症方面不如睾酮受体拮抗剂有效。两者均具有强致畸性。\n\n教育目标：\n女性出现男性型毛发生长被称为多毛症；最常见的原因是多囊卵巢综合征。复方口服避孕药可以通过抑制垂体LH分泌，进而减少卵巢雄激素的产生来治疗多毛症。"
