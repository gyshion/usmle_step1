    "en": "A 25-year-old man fractures his right tibia in a motor vehicle collision. His right leg is fixed in a cast, and he requires underarm crutches to ambulate. Two weeks later, the patient comes to the clinic with right upper extremity weakness and numbness. He has no neck or arm pain. The patient is concerned because he is right handed and cannot perform his duties as an electrician. On neurologic examination, there is diminished strength on extension of the right wrist with an absent triceps reflex. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "The radial nerve is derived from the C5-T1 spinal nerves and is 1 of the 2 final branches of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. The nerve initially courses medial to the surgical neck of the humerus inferior to the teres major muscle within the axilla before entering the posterior arm to course between the long head of the triceps brachii and the posterior humerus. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nProximal radial nerve injury can occur at the nerve's superficial location within the axilla by repetitive pressure/trauma caused by an ill-fitting crutch (crutch palsy) or if an individual sleeps with the arm over a chair (Saturday night palsy). Injury at this location may cause weakness or paralysis of the forearm, hand, and finger extensor muscles (eg, wrist drop, absent triceps reflex). Sensory loss may also be observed over the radial nerve distribution.\n\nInjuries to the radial nerve as it crosses the posterior humerus (eg, midshaft humeral fractures) spare the triceps brachii, as the fibers innervating this muscle leave the nerve before entering the radial groove.\n\n(Choice A) The accessory nerve (CN XI) exits the skull through the jugular foramen and courses over the levator scapulae muscle to innervate the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. Injury to CN XI can occur during cervical lymph node dissection.\n\n(Choice B) Fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus and anterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint can cause injury to the axillary nerve. The resultant paralysis of the deltoid and teres minor muscles causes weakness on arm abduction. Sensory loss over the deltoid may also be evident.\n\n(Choice C) Damage to the long thoracic nerve causes paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle and winging of the scapula. This nerve is often injured during axillary lymph node dissection in patients undergoing radical mastectomy.\n\n(Choice D) Proximal median nerve injury often occurs with supracondylar humerus fractures. This results in sensory loss over the palmar aspect of the first 3 digits and impairment of thumb flexion/opposition, flexion of the second/third digits, and wrist flexion/abduction.\n\n(Choice F) The suprascapular nerve provides sensation to the shoulder joint and innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. Suprascapular nerve entrapment results in shoulder pain and weakness of arm abduction and external rotation.\n\nEducational objective:\nRadial nerve injury can occur with repetitive pressure/trauma at the axilla (eg, improperly fitted crutches). Findings include weakness of the forearm, hand, and fingers extensors (eg, wrist drop, absent triceps reflex) and sensory loss over the posterior arm and forearm, dorsolateral hand, and dorsal thumb. More distal lesions spare the triceps brachii. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}",
    "zh": "桡神经源自C5-T1脊神经，是臂丛神经后束的两个终末分支之一。该神经最初在腋下，在肱骨外科颈的内侧，在冈下肌下方走行，然后进入后臂，在肱三头肌长头和肱骨后侧之间走行。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n近端桡神经损伤可发生在腋下神经的浅表位置，由不合适的拐杖（拐杖麻痹）引起的反复压力/创伤或个人手臂搭在椅子上睡觉（周六夜麻痹）引起。该部位的损伤可导致前臂、手和手指伸肌无力或麻痹（例如，腕下垂，肱三头肌反射消失）。也可能观察到桡神经分布区域的感觉丧失。\n\n当桡神经穿过后肱骨时（例如，肱骨中段骨折）的损伤会保留肱三头肌，因为支配该肌肉的纤维在进入桡神经沟之前就离开了神经。\n\n（选项 A）副神经 (CN XI) 通过颈静脉孔离开颅骨，并沿着肩胛提肌走行，支配胸锁乳突肌和斜方肌。颈淋巴结清扫术中可能发生CN XI损伤。\n\n（选项 B）肱骨外科颈骨折和肩肱关节前脱位可导致腋神经损伤。由此引起的三角肌和冈下肌麻痹会导致手臂外展无力。三角肌的感觉丧失也可能很明显。\n\n（选项 C）胸长神经损伤导致前锯肌麻痹和肩胛骨翼状改变。该神经常在接受根治性乳房切除术的患者的腋窝淋巴结清扫术中受损。\n\n（选项 D）近端正中神经损伤常发生在肱骨髁上骨折。这会导致前3个手指的掌侧感觉丧失，拇指屈曲/对掌、第2/3个手指屈曲以及腕屈曲/外展受损。\n\n（选项 F）冈上神经为肩关节提供感觉，并支配冈上肌和冈下肌。冈上神经卡压导致肩部疼痛，手臂外展和外旋无力。\n\n教育目标：\n桡神经损伤可发生在腋窝的反复压力/创伤（例如，不合适的拐杖）。表现包括前臂、手和手指伸肌无力（例如，腕下垂，肱三头肌反射消失），以及后臂和前臂、手背外侧和拇指背侧的感觉丧失。更远端的病变会保留肱三头肌。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of radial nerve anatomy and the clinical presentation of radial nerve injury, specifically crutch palsy. It requires recognizing the association between crutch use, axillary compression of the radial nerve, and the resulting motor and sensory deficits. \n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's history of crutch use, which suggests potential compression of the radial nerve in the axilla. Recall the muscles innervated by the radial nerve and the sensory distribution to correlate with the patient's symptoms of wrist extension weakness and sensory loss.",
