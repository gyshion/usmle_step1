    "en": "A 63-year-old woman comes to the office due to shortness of breath and cough productive of thick, green sputum for the past 2 days. The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mild dyspnea on exertion at baseline. The dyspnea has worsened over the past several days, and she is now also short of breath at rest. Other medical conditions include hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux, and seasonal allergies. She has been using her albuterol rescue inhaler more frequently than usual. The patient says she has cut down to 4 or 5 cigarettes per day and is trying to quit. Pulse oximetry shows 91% on room air. She appears to be in mild respiratory distress. Lung examination demonstrates diffuse bilateral wheezes. Chest x-ray reveals hyperinflation and increased bronchial markings. There is no evidence of alveolar infiltrates in either lung.",

    "en": "This patient with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has increasing dyspnea and purulent (thick, green) sputum production consistent with an acute exacerbation (AECOPD). Precipitants of AECOPD are categorized into infectious and noninfectious etiologies. Respiratory tract infections are the most common cause of AECOPD.\n\n*   The 3 most common viral precipitants are rhinovirus, influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. Other important viruses include adenovirus, parainfluenza, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus.\n*   The 3 bacteria most commonly recovered from respiratory cultures during AECOPD are nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nInfection promotes worsening of underlying lower respiratory tract inflammation (eg, increased bronchial markings) and airflow obstruction (eg, hyperinflation) in COPD. Purulent green sputum results from the release of myeloperoxidase from activated neutrophils, which are recruited to the airways as part of the general innate inflammatory response. Therefore, green sputum coloration is a nonspecific indicator of infection and does not reliably distinguish between viral and bacterial pathogens.\n\n(Choices A and C) AECOPD can also be triggered by sterile inflammation (noninfectious causes) in a minority of cases. Environmental air pollution and pulmonary embolism are implicated in noninfectious exacerbations. However, this patient's purulent green sputum supports an infectious rather than sterile etiology. Moreover, pulmonary embolism typically presents more acutely (within minutes to hours) with chest pain and dyspnea but without significant sputum production.\n\n(Choice B) Gastroesophageal reflux disease appears to be a weak risk factor for AECOPD, and uncontrolled reflux may be solely responsible for some cases of noninfectious exacerbations. However, this patient's green sputum makes an infectious etiology more likely.\n\n(Choice E) Staphylococcus aureus is a very uncommon cause of AECOPD. It typically follows viral respiratory infection (eg, postinfluenza) and presents as a severe lobar pneumonia with alveolar consolidation and cavitations (elaboration on cytotoxic toxins) on chest imaging.\n\nEducational objective:\nViral and bacterial respiratory infections are the leading cause of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The most common viral pathogens are rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus.",
