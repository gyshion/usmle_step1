    "en": "A 55-year-old woman comes to the office due to increasing fatigability and a 4.54-kg (10-lb) weight gain over the last few months. The patient used to swim daily but now does so only once or twice a week due to fatigue. She takes a daily multivitamin and an over-the-counter medication for constipation. Blood pressure is 140/96 mm Hg and pulse is 55/min. Physical examination shows hair loss involving the lateral third of the eyebrows. There is delayed relaxation of the deep tendon reflexes of the knee and ankle. Which of the following laboratory tests is the most appropriate next step in evaluation of this patient's symptoms?",

    "en": "This patient's symptoms (eg, fatigue, weight gain, constipation) and examination findings suggest HYPOTHYROIDISM. Vital signs typically show bradycardia and hypertension (due to increased vascular resistance). Hypothyroidism can also cause slowed hair growth and alterations in hair growth cycles, leading to thinning of the scalp hair and lateral eyebrows. Slowed reuptake of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum manifests as a delayed relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes.\n\nMost patients with hypothyroidism have PRIMARY HYPOTHYROIDISM (ie, dysfunction within the thyroid gland). The thyroid releases thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine [T3] and thyroxine [T4]) in response to TSH from the pituitary. In turn, TSH secretion is regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. Thyroid hormone suppresses TSH and TRH via negative feedback, and small changes in thyroid hormone levels lead to large changes in TSH levels. As thyroid hormone production slows, TSH secretion increases rapidly to restore thyroid activity, often before T4 levels fall below standard laboratory reference ranges. Therefore, serum TSH is the most sensitive marker for primary hypothyroidism. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices A and B) The 24-hour urinary cortisol assay and the dexamethasone suppression test are used to screen for Cushing syndrome. Although this patient is hypertensive, she does not have other Cushingoid features (eg, central obesity, skin striae, proximal muscle weakness).\n\n(Choice C) Initial tests for diabetes mellitus include fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and oral glucose tolerance tests. Diabetes can cause peripheral neuropathy (eg, paresthesias, loss of distal sensation, decreased ankle reflexes), but bradycardia, diastolic hypertension, and delayed relaxation of reflexes are more suggestive of hypothyroidism.\n\n(Choice D) The initial evaluation of hereditary hemochromatosis includes serum iron studies (eg, serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation). Although pituitary dysfunction with secondary (central) hypothyroidism can occur, patients commonly also have arthritis, diabetes mellitus, abnormal skin pigmentation, and hepatomegaly.\n\n(Choice E) TSH is more sensitive than either T3 or T4 for diagnosing primary hypothyroidism. TSH is not elevated in pituitary or hypothalamic disease (ie, secondary hypothyroidism), but this is a much less common cause of hypothyroidism (<5% of cases). In addition, patients with secondary hypothyroidism usually have other clinical features of hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction.",
    "zh": "该患者的症状（例如，疲劳、体重增加、便秘）和体格检查结果提示甲状腺功能减退。生命体征通常显示心动过缓和高血压（由于血管阻力增加）。甲状腺功能减退症也可能导致头发生长减慢和头发生长周期的改变，导致头皮头发变薄和眉毛外侧变薄。肌浆网对钙的重吸收减慢表现为深腱反射的松弛延迟。\n\n大多数甲状腺功能减退症患者患有原发性甲状腺功能减退症（即，甲状腺内功能障碍）。甲状腺释放甲状腺激素（三碘甲状腺素[T3]和甲状腺素[T4]）以响应垂体产生的促甲状腺激素（TSH）。反过来，TSH的分泌受来自下丘脑的促甲状腺激素释放激素（TRH）的调节。甲状腺激素通过负反馈抑制TSH和TRH，甲状腺激素水平的微小变化会导致TSH水平的巨大变化。随着甲状腺激素的产生减慢，TSH分泌迅速增加以恢复甲状腺活动，通常在T4水平降至标准实验室参考范围以下之前。因此，血清TSH是原发性甲状腺功能减退症最敏感的标志物。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项A和B）24小时尿皮质醇测定和地塞米松抑制试验用于筛查库欣综合征。尽管该患者患有高血压，但她没有其他库欣样特征（例如，中心性肥胖、皮肤纹、近端肌肉无力）。\n\n（选项C）糖尿病的初步检查包括空腹血糖、血红蛋白A1c和口服葡萄糖耐量试验。糖尿病可引起周围神经病变（例如，感觉异常、远端感觉丧失、踝反射减弱），但心动过缓、舒张期高血压和反射延迟更提示甲状腺功能减退症。\n\n（选项D）遗传性血色素沉着症的初步评估包括血清铁检查（例如，血清铁、铁蛋白、转铁蛋白饱和度）。尽管可发生继发性（中枢性）甲状腺功能减退症的垂体功能障碍，但患者通常也患有关节炎、糖尿病、皮肤色素异常和肝肿大。\n\n（选项E）TSH比T3或T4对诊断原发性甲状腺功能减退症更敏感。TSH在垂体或下丘脑疾病（即，继发性甲状腺功能减退症）中不升高，但这是甲状腺功能减退症的一个不太常见的原因（<5％的病例）。此外，继发性甲状腺功能减退症患者通常具有下丘脑或垂体功能障碍的其他临床特征。"

The key is to identify the constellation of symptoms (fatigue, weight gain, constipation, hair loss, bradycardia, hypertension, delayed reflexes) that point towards hypothyroidism.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the most common cause of hypothyroidism (primary thyroid gland dysfunction) and the most sensitive initial test for detecting it (serum TSH).
