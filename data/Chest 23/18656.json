    "en": "A 68-year-old man is evaluated in the hospital due to a pleural effusion. He has a history of base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma with involvement of multiple left anterior cervical lymph nodes. Two days ago, the patient underwent surgery to remove the tumor and the anterior cervical lymph nodes. Today, he has increasing shortness of breath, and chest x-ray reveals a large left pleural effusion. Which of the following was most likely injured during this patient's surgical procedure?",

    "en": "With a pleural effusion 2 days after cervical lymph node removal most likely has a chylothorax due to intraoperative injury of the thoracic duct.\n\nThe thoracic duct is the largest lymphatic vessel. It originates at about the level of T12 in the abdomen where the lumbar and intestinal lymph trunks converge. It travels superiorly through the mediastinum (posterior to the esophagus) and drains into the junction between the left subclavian and jugular veins in the lower neck. It is most commonly injured during thoracic procedures (eg, esophagectomy) but can be injured in neck procedures as well (eg, cervical lymph node removal). Injury can result in leakage of lymph into either the neck or the thorax because a transected duct may retract into the chest.\n\nThe thoracic duct collects lymph from most of the body, including the abdominal viscera, the viscera of the left hemithorax, all tissue inferior to the umbilicus, and all left-sided tissues superior to the umbilicus (the right head, arm, and thorax drain into the much smaller right lymphatic duct).\n\n(Choices A and F) The trachea and esophagus are deeper structures in the central neck that are covered by strap muscles; they are unlikely to be injured during removal of cervical lymph nodes in the lateral neck. In addition, although injury to the esophagus or trachea can cause pleural effusion, such injury is typically accompanied by air accumulation (eg, crepitus in the neck and/or pneumomediastinum).\n\n(Choice B) The innominate artery is the first branch of the aortic arch, and it crosses the midtrachea from left to right (in the thorax). It does not travel through the left neck. In addition, injury to the innominate artery would cause massive blood loss, resulting in immediate hemodynamic instability.\n\n(Choice C) The apex of the lung can project into the neck and be injured in some neck surgical procedures. However, injury would cause an acute pneumothorax rather than a slowly accumulating pleural effusion.\n\n(Choice D) The phrenic nerve, which originates from C3-C5 and travels with the internal jugular vein, can be injured during neck procedures. However, such an injury would present with elevation of the hemidiaphragm.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe thoracic duct carries lymph from most of the body and drains into the junction between the left subclavian and jugular veins. Although most commonly injured in thoracic procedures, it can also be injured in neck procedures where it travels through the neck. Injury may result in a chylothorax. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "颈部淋巴结清除术后2天出现胸腔积液，最有可能由于手术中损伤了胸导管而导致乳糜胸。\n\n胸导管是最大的淋巴管。它起源于腹部T12水平附近，此处腰淋巴干和肠淋巴干汇合。它向上通过纵隔（食管后方），并引流入颈部下方的左锁骨下静脉和颈内静脉的交界处。它最常在胸部手术（例如，食管切除术）中受伤，但也可能在颈部手术中受伤（例如，颈部淋巴结清除术）。损伤可导致淋巴液渗漏到颈部或胸部，因为被切断的导管可能会缩回胸腔。\n\n胸导管收集来自身体的大部分淋巴液，包括腹腔脏器、左侧半胸腔脏器、脐部以下的所有组织以及脐部以上的所有左侧组织（右侧头、臂和胸部引流入小得多的右淋巴管）。\n\n（选项A和F）气管和食管是颈部中央较深层的结构，被带状肌覆盖；在颈外侧的颈部淋巴结清除术中，它们不太可能受伤。此外，尽管食管或气管损伤可引起胸腔积液，但这种损伤通常伴有空气积聚（例如，颈部出现捻发音和/或纵隔气肿）。\n\n（选项B）无名动脉是主动脉弓的第一分支，它从左向右穿过气管中段（在胸腔内）。它不穿过左侧颈部。此外，无名动脉损伤会导致大量失血，从而导致即刻的血流动力学不稳定。\n\n（选项C）肺尖可以突入颈部，并在某些颈部手术中受伤。然而，损伤会引起急性气胸，而不是逐渐积累的胸腔积液。\n\n（选项D）膈神经起源于C3-C5，与颈内静脉一同走行，在颈部手术中可受伤。然而，这种损伤会表现为半膈抬高。\n\n教育目标：\n胸导管携带来自身体大部分的淋巴液，并引流入左锁骨下静脉和颈内静脉的交界处。虽然最常在胸部手术中受伤，但它也可能在颈部手术中受伤，因为它通过颈部走行。损伤可导致乳糜胸。{{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the anatomy of the thoracic duct and its vulnerability to injury during surgical procedures, specifically cervical lymph node dissection. It also assesses the ability to correlate clinical findings (pleural effusion) with potential surgical complications.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the anatomical location of the thoracic duct in relation to the surgical field. Rule out options that are less likely to be injured based on their location or the expected clinical presentation of their injury.",
