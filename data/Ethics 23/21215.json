    "en": "A 29-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to abdominal pain and fever. This morning, while crossing a street, she was struck in the stomach by a motorcyclist. On arrival, the patient tells the triage nurse that she does not have medical insurance. She has no chronic medical conditions. Temperature is 38 C (100.4 F), blood pressure is 109/82 mm Hg, and pulse is 88/min. The abdomen is distended with bruising, rebound tenderness, and guarding. The patient is told she needs exploratory surgery to treat her condition. She refuses and states angrily, \"I'm suffering and I'm not going to be a guinea pig for this system. If I had insurance, you'd give me something that would actually cure me.\" In addition to clarifying the details of the surgical procedure with the patient, which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Trust (ie, belief in the physician's recommendations and intentions) is central to the physician-patient therapeutic alliance and necessary for optimal outcomes. Distrust may arise from prior negative health care experiences, such as adverse events (eg, diagnostic error, treatment failure) or overt or perceived physician bias (eg, against uninsured patients).\n\nThis patient with signs of posttraumatic peritonitis (eg, rebound tenderness, guarding) expresses reluctance to undergo surgery in a way that signals distrust (ie, concern that she is being treated as a guinea pig). To ensure that the patient receives appropriate treatment and an optimal outcome, the physician should apply the following principles to build trust and promote treatment acceptability:\n\n*   Acknowledge trust as a central therapeutic goal.\n*   Find common ground (eg, identify a shared goal of feeling better).\n*   Seek patient perspectives and prioritize patient-centered care (ie, treatment aligned with patient values).\n\n(Choice A) This statement unnecessarily focuses the discussion on the physician's perspective (eg, compensation) without addressing the patient's concern about being a guinea pig or exploring her underlying reasons for refusing surgery.\n\n(Choice B) This statement reflects empathy for the patient's suffering but is fear based (ie, focuses on negative consequences). It is unlikely to promote acceptance in a patient whose reason for refusing surgery is low trust; in fact, the patient could perceive this statement as coercive or threatening.\n\n(Choice C) This question assumes that the patient's refusal is based on financial concerns; her statement is more indicative of distrust.\n\n(Choice E) Attributing this patient's response to pain ignores her central concern of trust and may be viewed as condescending.\n\nEducational objective:\nTrust is central to the physician-patient relationship, and distrust may arise from prior negative experiences (eg. adverse events, bias). Physicians can build trust by identifying shared goals, seeking patient perspectives, and prioritizing patient-centered care.",
    "zh": "信任（即，相信医生的建议和意图）是医患治疗联盟的核心，对于获得最佳结果至关重要。不信任可能源于之前的负面医疗保健经历，例如不良事件（如，诊断错误、治疗失败）或明显的或感知的医生偏见（如，针对无保险患者）。\n\n这位有外伤性腹膜炎体征（如，反跳痛、腹肌紧张）的患者以一种表明不信任的方式表达了对接受手术的犹豫（即，担心她被当作试验品）。为了确保患者得到适当的治疗和最佳结果，医生应应用以下原则来建立信任并促进治疗的可接受性：\n\n*   承认信任是核心的治疗目标。\n*   找到共同点（例如，确定一个共同的目标，即感觉更好）。\n*   寻求患者的观点并优先考虑以患者为中心的护理（即，与患者价值观一致的治疗）。\n\n（选项A）该声明不必要地将讨论集中在医生的观点（例如，报酬）上，而没有解决患者对被当作试验品的担忧或探讨她拒绝手术的根本原因。\n\n（选项B）该声明反映了对患者痛苦的同情，但基于恐惧（即，侧重于负面后果）。对于一个拒绝手术的原因是信任度低的患者，这不太可能促进接受；事实上，患者可能会将此声明视为胁迫或威胁。\n\n（选项C）这个问题假设患者的拒绝是基于经济上的担忧；她的声明更表明了不信任。\n\n（选项E）将这位患者的反应归因于疼痛，忽略了她对信任的核心关注，并且可能被视为居高临下。\n\n教育目标：\n信任是医患关系的核心，不信任可能源于之前的负面经历（例如，不良事件、偏见）。医生可以通过确定共同目标、寻求患者的观点和优先考虑以患者为中心的护理来建立信任。"

    "en": "This question tests the examinee's ability to recognize and address patient distrust in a medical setting, particularly when the patient expresses concerns about being treated unfairly due to their lack of insurance. It emphasizes the importance of building trust through shared goals, patient-centered care, and acknowledging the patient's perspective.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the underlying cause of the patient's refusal (distrust) and select the response that directly addresses this concern by focusing on the patient's well-being and establishing a therapeutic alliance.",
