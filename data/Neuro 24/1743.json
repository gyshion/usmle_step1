    "en": "A 53-year-old man is evaluated for right hand discomfort. A month ago, the patient started to experience an intermittent pins-and-needles sensation in his right hand that is worse at night. He has no neck pain or history of trauma. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years and has worked as an accountant for the past 30 years. On physical examination, there is loss of sensation over the right fifth digit. There is no swelling, redness, or warmth of the hand. The patient is most likely to have weakness of which of the following movements?",

    "en": "The patient's symptoms of intermittent pins-and-needles sensation in the right hand, worse at night, and loss of sensation over the right fifth digit are highly suggestive of ULNAR NERVE compression. The ulnar nerve originates from the medial cord of the brachial plexus, courses with the brachial artery in the upper arm, and enters the forearm after passing posterior to the medial epicondyle of the humerus (cubital tunnel). {{exhibit_1}} It innervates the flexor carpi ulnaris (wrist flexion and adduction) and the medial portion of the flexor digitorum profundus before entering the wrist through Guyon canal (between the hook of the hamate and pisiform). In the hand, the superficial branch of the ulnar nerve provides cutaneous innervation to the fifth digit, medial half of the fourth digit, and the hypothenar eminence. The deep motor branch supplies most of the intrinsic muscles of the hand. The ulnar nerve is most commonly injured at the elbow due to CHRONIC COMPRESSION (eg, working for prolonged periods at a desk) or trauma (eg, medial epicondyle fracture). Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow usually presents with discomfort and loss of sensation and/or paresthesia in the ulnar distribution. Severe injury can also result in IMPAIRED FLEXION AND ADDUCTION of the wrist along with finger WEAKNESS OR CLUMSINESS. The nerve can also be injured more distally at the wrist as it runs through Guyon canal; injury at this level results in more pronounced clawing of the fourth and fifth digits (ulnar claw) due to sparing of the flexor digitorum profundus. The patient's occupation as an accountant, involving repetitive wrist movements, and the symptoms of paresthesia worse at night are classic for cubital tunnel syndrome. Weakness in wrist adduction is a direct consequence of ulnar nerve motor deficit affecting the flexor carpi ulnaris. (Choices A and E) Radial nerve injury (eg, crutch palsy, midshaft humerus fracture) can result in hand, and dorsal thumb. (Choice B) Axillary nerve injury (eg, anterior shoulder dislocation, surgical neck of humerus fracture) can present with loss of sensation over the lateral upper arm and weakness in shoulder abduction (eg, deltoid weakness). (Choice C) Proximal median nerve injury (eg, subcondylar humerus fracture) can result in impaired flexion and abduction of the wrist, flexion of the second and/or third digit, and flexion or opposition of the thumb along with palmar sensory loss involving the first 3 digits. Educational objective: Ulnar nerve injury most commonly occurs at the elbow (eg, compression due to resting arm on a hard surface for prolonged periods) and usually presents with discomfort and sensory loss and/or paresthesia in the fifth digit, medial half of the fourth digit, and the hypothenar eminence. In severe injury, patients can have impaired wrist flexion and adduction along with finger weakness or clumsiness.",
    "zh": "患者右手的间歇性针刺感，夜间加重，以及右侧第五指感觉丧失的症状，高度提示尺神经受压。尺神经起源于臂丛神经的内侧束，与上臂的肱动脉并行，在经过肱骨内上髁（肘管）后进入前臂。{{exhibit_1}} 它支配尺侧腕屈肌（腕屈曲和内收）和指深屈肌的内侧部分，然后通过 Guyon 管（钩骨钩和豌豆骨之间）进入腕部。在手部，尺神经的浅支为第五指、第四指的内半部和鱼际提供皮肤神经支配。深部运动支支配手部的大部分固有肌。尺神经最常因慢性压迫（例如，长时间伏案工作）或外伤（例如，内上髁骨折）而损伤。肘部的尺神经病变通常表现为不适和尺神经分布区域的感觉丧失和/或感觉异常。严重损伤还可导致腕部屈曲和内收受损，以及手指无力或笨拙。该神经也可能在腕部远端通过 Guyon 管损伤；该水平的损伤导致第四和第五指的爪形改变更明显（尺爪），因为指深屈肌得以保留。患者作为会计的职业，涉及重复的腕部运动，以及夜间加重的感觉异常症状，是肘管综合征的典型表现。腕部内收无力是尺神经运动功能障碍直接导致的影响尺侧腕屈肌的后果。(选项 A 和 E) 桡神经损伤（例如，拐杖麻痹，肱骨中段骨折）可导致手和拇指背侧。 (选项 B) 腋神经损伤（例如，肩关节前脱位，肱骨外科颈骨折）可表现为上臂外侧感觉丧失和肩外展无力（例如，三角肌无力）。 (选项 C) 近端正中神经损伤（例如，髁下肱骨骨折）可导致腕部屈曲和外展受损、第二和/或第三指屈曲以及拇指屈曲或对掌，同时伴有涉及前 3 个指头的掌侧感觉丧失。教育目标：尺神经损伤最常发生在肘部（例如，由于长时间将手臂放在坚硬的表面上而引起的压迫），并且通常表现为第五指、第四指内半部和鱼际的不适和感觉丧失和/或感觉异常。在严重损伤中，患者可能出现腕屈曲和内收受损，以及手指无力或笨拙。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of ulnar nerve neuropathy, specifically cubital tunnel syndrome, including its typical presentation, anatomical course, and the motor deficits associated with injury. It requires correlating sensory and motor findings with the specific nerve involved and its innervations.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the classic symptoms of ulnar nerve involvement (paresthesias in the 4th and 5th digits, worse at night). Consider the patient's occupation and risk factors for nerve compression. Recall the motor functions innervated by the ulnar nerve, particularly in the forearm and hand, to determine which movement would be most affected by weakness.",
