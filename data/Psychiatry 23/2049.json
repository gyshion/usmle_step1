    "en": "A 48-year-old man comes to the office due to concern that his skin is excessively dry, red, and cracked. The patient explains that he washes his hands each time he touches something due to fear of contamination. He spends 3-4 hours a day washing his hands and showers multiple times daily. He was recently fired from his job after refusing to touch keyboards shared by coworkers and is worried that he will be unable to find employment. On physical examination, the palms are erythematous with peeling skin. Treatment of this patient's disorder is most likely to involve a medication affecting which of the following neurotransmitters?",

    "en": "This patient's fear of contamination leading to compulsive washing rituals is consistent with OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD). OCD is characterized by obsessions or compulsions, with most patients experiencing both. Common themes include contamination obsessions with cleaning compulsions; obsession with symmetry and compulsions involving ordering and counting; and fear of harm with checking compulsions (eg, stove off, doors locked). Patients with OCD typically engage in time-consuming rituals (>1 hr/day) that cause significant distress and/or functional impairment. Patients with washing compulsions may present with skin conditions.\n\nSELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITOR (SSRI) antidepressants are considered first-line treatment for OCD. SSRIs block the reuptake of serotonin into the presynaptic neuron, leading to an immediate increase in availability of synaptic serotonin and a subsequent cascade of downstream neurobiological effects.\n\n(Choice A) In the central nervous system, acetylcholine is involved primarily in arousal, memory, and learning. Degeneration of cholinergic neurons is associated with Alzheimer dementia.\n\n(Choices B and D) There is evidence for dysfunction of the dopamine and glutamate (primary excitatory neurotransmitter) systems in the pathogenesis of OCD; however, neither neurotransmitter is a significant target of first-line medications.\n\n(Choices C and E) Gamma-aminobutyric acid is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and is involved in the anti-anxiety effects of benzodiazepines. Glycine is also an inhibitory neurotransmitter.\n\n(Choice F) Histamine is a neurotransmitter involved in maintaining wakefulness and, as a result, drugs with antihistamine properties may be sedating.\n\n(Choice G) Norepinephrine is a catecholamine involved in mood, anxiety, alertness, learning, and memory.\n\nEducational objective:\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by persistent, intrusive thoughts leading to repetitive, ritualistic behaviors. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are considered first-line treatment for OCD and exert their effects by inhibiting serotonin reuptake.",
    "zh": "该患者对污染的恐惧导致强迫性洗涤仪式，这与强迫症（OCD）一致。强迫症的特征是强迫观念或强迫行为，大多数患者同时经历两者。常见主题包括污染强迫观念伴有清洁强迫行为；对称性强迫观念伴有涉及排序和计数的强迫行为；以及对伤害的恐惧伴有核查强迫行为（例如，炉子关闭，门锁上）。强迫症患者通常会进行耗时的仪式（>1小时/天），这会导致严重的痛苦和/或功能障碍。洗涤强迫症患者可能出现皮肤病。\n\n选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（SSRI）抗抑郁药被认为是治疗强迫症的一线药物。SSRI阻断5-羟色胺进入突触前神经元的再摄取，导致突触5-羟色胺的可用性立即增加，以及随后的下游神经生物学效应级联。\n\n（选项A）在中枢神经系统中，乙酰胆碱主要参与唤醒、记忆和学习。胆碱能神经元的变性与阿尔茨海默病有关。\n\n（选项B和D）有证据表明，多巴胺和谷氨酸（主要的兴奋性神经递质）系统在强迫症的发病机制中存在功能障碍；然而，这两种神经递质都不是一线药物的重要靶点。\n\n（选项C和E）γ-氨基丁酸是中枢神经系统中主要的抑制性神经递质，参与苯二氮卓类药物的抗焦虑作用。甘氨酸也是一种抑制性神经递质。\n\n（选项F）组胺是一种参与维持清醒状态的神经递质，因此具有抗组胺特性的药物可能会产生镇静作用。\n\n（选项G）去甲肾上腺素是一种儿茶酚胺，参与情绪、焦虑、警觉性、学习和记忆。\n\n教育目标：\n强迫症（OCD）的特征是持续、侵入性的想法导致重复的、仪式性的行为。选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂被认为是治疗强迫症的一线药物，它们通过抑制5-羟色胺的再摄取来发挥作用。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), its clinical presentation, and the pharmacological treatment targeting specific neurotransmitters. It assesses the ability to link patient symptoms to a diagnosis and identify the most appropriate class of medication based on its mechanism of action.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the classic symptoms of OCD, such as obsessions and compulsions related to contamination and excessive cleaning. Subsequently, recalling that Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line pharmacotherapy for OCD is crucial, and understanding that SSRIs primarily affect serotonin levels allows for the correct identification of the target neurotransmitter.",
