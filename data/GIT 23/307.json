He says, \"My pants are fitting a lot looser than usual.\" The patient also has epigastric discomfort after meals with occasional nausea. He reports that food is not as appetizing as it used to be. He has no known medical conditions and takes no medications. The patient's father has a history of peptic ulcer disease.

    "en": "This image shows typical features of diffuse-type adenocarcinoma, 1 of 2 major types of gastric adenocarcinoma. Diffuse-type adenocarcinomas often consist of signet ring cells that do not form glands. Signet ring cells contain abundant mucin droplets that push the nucleus to one side and lead to the characteristic appearance of a signet ring. On gross examination, diffuse-type adenocarcinomas are characterized by diffuse involvement of the stomach wall (due to loss of the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin). They have a plaque-like appearance, are ill defined, and often infiltrate large areas of the stomach wall, causing a \"leather-bottle\" stomach (linitis plastica).\n\nIn contrast, intestinal-type adenocarcinomas of the stomach resemble colon cancers, showing well-formed glands that consist of columnar or cuboidal cells. They tend to grow as nodular, polypoid, and well-demarcated masses that rapidly expand within the gastric lumen (Choice D). These lesions often ulcerate/bleed and must be differentiated from peptic gastric ulcers by biopsy (Choice A).\n\n(Choice C) Chronic gastritis is most commonly associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. Long-standing inflammation of the gastric mucosa can lead to diffuse gland atrophy and intestinal metaplasia. Chronic gastric inflammation increases the risk of gastric carcinomas.\n\n(Choice E) Rugal thickening with acid hypersecretion is a characteristic finding in the stomach of a patient with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\n\nEducational objective:\nThere are 2 morphological variants of gastric adenocarcinoma. The intestinal type forms a solid mass that projects into the stomach lumen and is composed of gland-forming cuboidal or columnar cells. In contrast, diffuse-type adenocarcinoma infiltrates the stomach wall (linitis plastica) and displays signet ring cells on light microscopy. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "该图像显示了弥漫型腺癌的典型特征，这是胃腺癌的 2 种主要类型之一。弥漫型腺癌通常由印戒细胞组成，不形成腺体。印戒细胞含有丰富的粘蛋白小滴，将细胞核推向一侧，导致印戒的特征性外观。在大体检查中，弥漫型腺癌的特征在于胃壁的弥漫性受累（由于细胞粘附蛋白 E-钙粘蛋白的缺失）。它们呈斑块状外观，界限不清，并且经常浸润胃壁的大面积区域，导致“革囊胃”（塑料性胃炎）。\n\n相比之下，胃的肠型腺癌类似于结肠癌，显示由柱状或立方形细胞组成的发育良好的腺体。它们往往以结节状、息肉样和界限分明的肿块形式生长，并在胃腔内迅速扩张（选项 D）。这些病变常发生溃疡/出血，必须通过活检与消化性胃溃疡区分（选项 A）。\n\n（选项 C）慢性胃炎最常见于幽门螺杆菌感染。胃黏膜的长期炎症可导致弥漫性腺体萎缩和肠化生。慢性胃部炎症会增加患胃癌的风险。\n\n（选项 E）胃皱襞增厚伴高酸分泌是卓-艾综合征患者胃中的特征性发现。\n\n教育目标：\n胃腺癌有 2 种形态学变异。肠型形成一个突入胃腔的实体肿块，由形成腺体的立方形或柱状细胞组成。相比之下，弥漫型腺癌浸润胃壁（塑料性胃炎），并在光学显微镜下显示印戒细胞。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the histological features and gross morphology of diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma, also known as linitis plastica. It requires recognizing signet ring cells on histology and understanding the infiltrative growth pattern within the stomach wall.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key histological finding of signet ring cells, which are characteristic of diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma.
