    "en": "A newborn boy who was born at 39 weeks gestation by normal vaginal delivery has a serum TSH above the normal range and serum thyroxine (T4) below the normal range for his age. His mother has no medical conditions. On examination, the patient's length and weight are normal, and he has no apparent congenital malformations. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",

    "en": "This patient has primary hypothyroidism, a congenital condition most commonly caused by thyroid dysgenesis. Thyroid dysgenesis refers to an underdeveloped thyroid (ie, hypoplasia, aplasia) or an ectopic thyroid, which can lie anywhere along the normal path of embryologic descent from the base of the tongue to its normal location anterior to the thyroid cartilage. Most cases are sporadic and isolated without other congenital abnormalities.\n\nNewborns are usually asymptomatic due to the transplacental transfer of maternal thyroxine (T4), although levels are decreased compared to those of healthy patients. Because of insufficient feedback inhibition from low T4 levels, TSH is elevated. Newborn screening allows for early identification and treatment with levothyroxine, which prevents the development of neurocognitive dysfunction.\n\n(Choice A) Hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction can lead to central hypothyroidism due to deficient TSH production. TSH and T4 levels would both be low.\n\n(Choice B) Congenital hypothyroidism can also be caused by thyroid hormone resistance (eg, thyroid hormone receptor mutations). However, TSH and T4 levels would be elevated due to impaired thyroid hormone feedback.\n\n(Choice C) Thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) is a transport protein that binds T4. TBG deficiency results in a euthyroid state characterized by a low level of total T4 but normal TSH and free T4 levels.\n\n(Choice E) Neonatal Graves disease is characterized by the transplacental transfer of maternal TSH receptor–stimulating antibodies due to maternal Graves disease. This condition causes transient hyperthyroidism with elevated T4 and decreased TSH.\n\nEducational objective:\nThyroid dysgenesis (ie, hypoplasia, aplasia, ectopy) is the most common cause of primary congenital hypothyroidism. In this condition, TSH is elevated and thyroxine (T4) is low. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有原发性甲状腺功能减退症，这是一种先天性疾病，最常见的原因是甲状腺发育异常。甲状腺发育异常是指甲状腺发育不全（即发育不良、发育不全）或异位甲状腺，其可位于从舌根到其正常位置（甲状软骨前）的胚胎下降的正常路径中的任何位置。大多数病例是散发性的，孤立的，没有其他先天性异常。\n\n新生儿通常无症状，因为母亲的甲状腺素 (T4) 会通过胎盘转移，尽管其水平与健康患者相比有所降低。由于低 T4 水平的反馈抑制不足，TSH 升高。新生儿筛查可及早识别并用左甲状腺素治疗，从而防止神经认知功能障碍的发展。\n\n(选项 A) 下丘脑或垂体功能障碍可导致中枢性甲状腺功能减退症，原因是 TSH 产生不足。TSH 和 T4 水平都会降低。\n\n(选项 B) 先天性甲状腺功能减退症也可能由甲状腺激素抵抗引起（例如，甲状腺激素受体突变）。然而，由于甲状腺激素反馈受损，TSH 和 T4 水平会升高。\n\n(选项 C) 甲状腺结合球蛋白 (TBG) 是一种结合 T4 的转运蛋白。TBG 缺乏导致甲状腺功能正常状态，其特征是总 T4 水平低，但 TSH 和游离 T4 水平正常。\n\n(选项 E) 新生儿 Graves 病的特征是由于母亲患有 Graves 病，母亲的促甲状腺激素受体刺激性抗体通过胎盘转移。这种情况会导致一过性甲状腺功能亢进，T4 升高，TSH 降低。\n\n教育目标：\n甲状腺发育异常（即发育不良、发育不全、异位）是原发性先天性甲状腺功能减退症的最常见病因。在这种情况下，TSH 升高，甲状腺素 (T4) 降低。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of congenital hypothyroidism, specifically the most common cause and the expected laboratory findings. The question also requires differentiating between primary and central hypothyroidism, as well as understanding the effects of thyroid hormone resistance and TBG deficiency.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that primary congenital hypothyroidism is most often caused by thyroid dysgenesis. Remember that in primary hypothyroidism, TSH is elevated and T4 is low. Consider the pathophysiology of each answer choice to determine which best fits the clinical scenario and lab results.",
