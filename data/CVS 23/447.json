    "en": "A 44-year-old man is evaluated in the clinic for occasional chest discomfort that is not consistently related to exertion. The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His grandfather experienced a myocardial infarction at age 50. Coronary CT angiography reveals several nonobstructive atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries. One plaque in the proximal left anterior descending artery appears extensive, has a large hypodense core, and occupies 40% of the lumen. No intervention is performed. One year later, the patient comes to the emergency department with acute severe chest pain and is found to have thrombotic occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery. High intraplaque activity of which of the following enzymes most likely resulted in this patient's myocardial infarction?",

    "en": "This patient with coronary atherosclerosis has likely developed plaque rupture with thrombotic occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, resulting in acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina, myocardial infarction). {{exhibit_1}}\n\nPatients with coronary atherosclerosis can be asymptomatic but typically develop symptoms of stable angina (exertional chest pain relieved with rest/nitroglycerin) if progressive enlargement of the atherosclerotic plaque causes >70% luminal stenosis. ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME usually occurs due to plaque rupture, which leads to superimposed thrombosis and vessel occlusion. The likelihood of plaque rupture is typically related to plaque stability rather than plaque size or degree of luminal narrowing. Plaque stability largely depends on the mechanical strength of the fibrous cap: Thin-cap fibroatheromas are generally unstable and more vulnerable to rupture.\n\nDuring the chronic inflammatory progression of an atheroma, the fibrous cap is continually being remodeled. The balance of collagen synthesis and degradation determines the mechanical strength of the cap. Thin-cap fibroatheromas are characterized by a large necrotic core covered by a thin fibrous cap. Activated macrophages infiltrating the atheroma contribute to the breakdown of extracellular matrix proteins (eg, collagen) by secreting metalloproteinases. Ongoing intimal inflammation can destabilize the mechanical integrity of the plaque through release of these metalloproteinases, resulting in plaque rupture and consequent acute coronary syndrome.\n\n(Choice A) Hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis and is mostly expressed in the liver, intestine, adrenal cortex, and reproductive tissues. Patients with hyperlipidemia are typically treated with statins (eg, atorvastatin), which competitively inhibit HMG CoA reductase.\n\n(Choice B) Lysyl oxidase strengthens extracellular collagen fibers by mediating cross-link formation between lysine and hydroxylysine residues (requires copper). Therefore, a high activity of lysyl oxidase would favor atheroma stabilization by strengthening collagen in the fibrous cap.\n\n(Choice D) Procollagen peptidase cleaves the terminal regions of procollagen molecules exocytosed by fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells, transforming procollagen into insoluble tropocollagen. Tropocollagen then aggregates to form collagen fibrils.\n\n(Choice E) Prolyl hydroxylase is responsible for the hydroxylation of proline on procollagen chains (requires vitamin C), which is a necessary step in the formation of a stable collagen triple helix.",
    "zh": "这名患有冠状动脉粥样硬化的患者很可能发生了斑块破裂，导致前降支血栓闭塞，从而导致急性冠状动脉综合征（不稳定型心绞痛、心肌梗死）。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n患有冠状动脉粥样硬化的患者可能没有症状，但如果动脉粥样硬化斑块进行性增大导致管腔狭窄>70%，通常会发展为稳定型心绞痛的症状（劳累性胸痛，休息/硝酸甘油可缓解）。急性冠状动脉综合征通常是由于斑块破裂引起的，这会导致叠加血栓形成和血管闭塞。斑块破裂的可能性通常与斑块稳定性有关，而不是斑块大小或管腔狭窄程度。斑块稳定性主要取决于纤维帽的机械强度：薄帽纤维粥样斑块通常不稳定，更容易破裂。\n\n在动脉粥样硬化的慢性炎症进展过程中，纤维帽不断被重塑。胶原蛋白合成和降解的平衡决定了帽的机械强度。薄帽纤维粥样斑块的特征是有一个大的坏死核心，被一个薄的纤维帽覆盖。浸润到动脉粥样硬化斑块中的活化巨噬细胞通过分泌金属蛋白酶，有助于细胞外基质蛋白（如胶原蛋白）的分解。持续的内膜炎症会通过释放这些金属蛋白酶来破坏斑块的机械完整性，导致斑块破裂，进而导致急性冠状动脉综合征。\n\n（选项A）羟甲基戊二酰（HMG）CoA还原酶是胆固醇合成的限速酶，主要在肝脏、肠道、肾上腺皮质和生殖组织中表达。高脂血症患者通常接受他汀类药物（如阿托伐他汀）治疗，他汀类药物可竞争性抑制HMG CoA还原酶。\n\n（选项B）赖氨酰氧化酶通过介导赖氨酸和羟赖氨酸残基之间的交联形成（需要铜）来加强细胞外胶原纤维。因此，赖氨酰氧化酶的高活性将有利于通过加强纤维帽中的胶原蛋白来稳定动脉粥样硬化斑块。\n\n（选项D）原胶原肽酶切割由成纤维细胞或平滑肌细胞胞吐的原胶原分子末端区域，将原胶原转化为不溶性原胶原。然后原胶原聚集形成胶原纤维。\n\n（选项E）脯氨酰羟化酶负责脯氨酸在原胶原链上的羟化（需要维生素C），这是形成稳定胶原三螺旋的必要步骤。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndrome, specifically the role of metalloproteinases in plaque rupture. The question requires understanding the mechanisms that contribute to plaque instability and subsequent thrombotic occlusion of coronary arteries.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the clinical scenario of acute severe chest pain and thrombotic occlusion. Consider the factors that destabilize atherosclerotic plaques, leading to rupture and thrombosis. Recognize the role of metalloproteinases in degrading the fibrous cap, making it prone to rupture.",
