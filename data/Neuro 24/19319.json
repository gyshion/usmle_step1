    "en": "A 58-year-old man comes to the office due to worsening right upper extremity weakness over the past 4 weeks. The patient frequently travels for work and has had difficulty carrying heavy bags and getting luggage into or out of the overhead bins. He also has had neck and shoulder pain for the past several months, which he attributes to stress. The patient reports no trauma, and medical history is significant for hypertension. Physical examination shows weakness of shoulder abduction and loss of the biceps reflex on the right side. Pinprick sensation is decreased over the right lateral arm and forearm.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's sensory (eg, lateral arm/forearm sensation loss) and motor deficits (eg, impaired shoulder abduction, biceps reflex) are not isolated to the distribution of a single peripheral nerve (eg, median, ulnar), but rather follow the C5 dermatomal and myotomal distribution, indicating CERVICAL RADICULOPATHY.\n\nThe manifestations of cervical radiculopathies vary depending on the affected nerve root but typically present with NECK OR ARM PAIN associated with motor and/or sensory deficits. Radiculopathies occur due to COMPRESSION of spinal nerve roots, which is most commonly due to either:\n\n*   SPINAL SPONDYLOSIS: Aging leads to DEGENERATION of the vertebral bodies, discs, and joints. Disc space decreases, and joint stress results in osteophyte (eg, bone spur) formation, which slowly narrows the neural foramina and leads to a SUBCUTE ONSET of symptoms (as seen in this patient).\n*   VERTEBRAL DISC HERNIATION: Degeneration of ligamentous fibers can lead to a tear in the intervertebral disc annulus, resulting in herniation of the nucleus pulposus with potential nerve root compression. Disc rupture typically occurs acutely (eg, during weight lifting).\n\n(Choice A) Axonal loss in the corticospinal tracts occurs in AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, a neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper and lower motor neurons. Although it can result in weakness and atrophy, it would also result in upper motor neuron signs (eg, hyperreflexia), and sensory disturbances would be atypical.\n\n(Choice B) SYRINGOMYELIA results from cystic expansion of the central canal in the spinal cord. This can result in upper extremity weakness and sensory deficits, but because it expands from the central portion of the spinal cord, both upper extremities are typically affected, most often in a \"cape\" distribution.\n\n(Choice D) Microinjury and tear of the rotator cuff tendons can result in weakness of shoulder abduction. However, sensory deficits are unexpected.\n\n(Choice E) Rupture of the long head of the biceps tendon could result in shoulder pain that is aggravated by repetitive overhead activities; a loss of the biceps reflex may be observed if the rupture is complete. However, it would not cause weakness of shoulder abduction (biceps flexes and supinates the forearm) and sensory deficits would not be present.\n\nEducational objective:\nCervical radiculopathy typically results in neck and/or arm pain associated with neurologic deficits that follow a dermatomal/myotomal pattern. Osteophytes that form due to degenerative changes in the vertebral joints can progressively narrow the neural foramina leading to nerve root compression.",
    "zh": "该患者的感觉（例如，上臂外侧/前臂感觉丧失）和运动功能障碍（例如，肩外展受损、肱二头肌反射减弱）并非局限于单个周围神经（例如，正中神经、尺神经）的分布，而是遵循C5皮节和肌节分布，表明患有颈椎根病。\n\n颈椎根病的表现取决于受影响的神经根，但通常表现为颈部或手臂疼痛，伴有运动和/或感觉功能障碍。根病是由于脊神经根受压所致，最常见的原因是：\n\n*   脊椎 spondylosis：衰老导致椎体、椎间盘和关节的退变。椎间隙减小，关节应力导致骨赘（例如，骨刺）形成，逐渐使神经孔变窄，并导致亚急性起病的症状（如该患者所示）。\n*   椎间盘突出：韧带纤维退变可导致椎间盘环撕裂，导致髓核突出，可能压迫神经根。椎间盘破裂通常急性发生（例如，举重时）。\n\n（选项 A）皮质脊髓束的轴突丢失发生在肌萎缩侧索硬化症中，这是一种影响上下运动神经元的神经退行性疾病。虽然它会导致无力和萎缩，但也会导致上运动神经元体征（例如，反射亢进），并且感觉障碍是不典型的。\n\n（选项 B）脊髓空洞症是脊髓中央管囊性扩张引起的。这可能导致上肢无力和感觉障碍，但由于它从脊髓的中央部分扩张，通常会影响双上肢，最常见的是“披肩”分布。\n\n（选项 D）肩袖肌腱的微损伤和撕裂可导致肩外展无力。然而，感觉功能障碍是意想不到的。\n\n（选项 E）肱二头肌长头肌腱断裂可导致肩部疼痛，这种疼痛会因重复性头顶活动而加重；如果断裂完全，可能会观察到肱二头肌反射消失。然而，它不会引起肩外展无力（肱二头肌屈曲和旋后前臂），并且不会出现感觉功能障碍。\n\n教学目标：\n颈椎根病通常会导致颈部和/或手臂疼痛，并伴有遵循皮节/肌节模式的神经功能障碍。由于椎间关节退行性变形成的骨赘可逐渐使神经孔变窄，导致神经根受压。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of cervical radiculopathy, its common causes, and the differentiation from other neurological conditions affecting the upper extremity. It specifically assesses the ability to correlate clinical signs and symptoms with underlying pathophysiological processes, particularly degenerative changes in the cervical spine.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the pattern of neurological deficits (motor and sensory) to localize the lesion. Recognizing that the findings follow a dermatomal/myotomal distribution points towards a radiculopathy. Differentiating between acute (herniation) and subacute (degenerative changes) onset, and considering the patient's age and history, helps narrow down the most likely cause.",
