    "en": "A 46-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for atypical chest pain. His medical history is significant for hypertension controlled with amlodipine and hypercholesterolemia treated with atorvastatin; he has a family history of depression and heart disease. During review of his substance use history, the patient says that he has been a \"regular drinker\" for the last 5 years. He drinks a 6-pack of beer every night and has 2 more beers in the morning to help him \"get through the day.\" He also admits to smoking marijuana occasionally but does not use tobacco or other illicit drugs.",

    "en": "Ethanol use leads to a number of biochemical changes in the CNS. It acutely potentiates the effects of GABA (the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS) at GABA-A receptors, leading to sedation. CHRONIC ethanol use causes downregulation of GABA receptors. Alcohol also weakly inhibits excitatory NMDA receptors in the brain, and chronic exposure leads to upregulation of these receptors. These adaptive changes result in tolerance (ie, the need to increase the dose to achieve the desirable effect) and symptoms of withdrawal on abrupt alcohol cessation, a common occurrence during hospital admission. Both tolerance and withdrawal are signs of substance dependence.\n\nWithdrawal symptoms can begin as early as 6 hours after the patient's last drink, typically reach maximal intensity in 2-3 days, and subside in 4-5 days if the withdrawal is not severe. TREMOR, or \"the shakes,\" is the most common INITIAL FINDING. Patients also typically have signs of mild autonomic dysfunction (eg, increased heart rate and respirations), gastrointestinal distress (eg, nausea, vomiting), and anxiety.\n\n(Choice A) Fluctuating arousal levels are characteristic of DELIRIUM TREMENS, a potentially fatal manifestation of alcohol withdrawal that typically begins 48-96 hours after the last drink. Other findings include sympathetic hyperactivity (eg, hyperthermia, hypertension), hallucinations (eg, visual, auditory, or tactile), and confusion.\n\n(Choices B and C) Hypersomnolence and nystagmus can occur in ACUTE INTOXICATION but are not common during alcohol withdrawal. Most patients have insomnia attributable to increased CNS excitability during the withdrawal period.\n\n(Choice D) Tonic-clonic seizures can occur 12-48 hours after the last drink and affect <5% of patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal.\n\n(Choice F) Alcoholic hallucinations (ie, visual hallucinations) can develop within 12-48 hours after the last drink. These early hallucinations are distinct from delirium tremens.\n\nEducational objective:\nTremulousness is typically one of the earliest symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Other common symptoms include gastrointestinal distress, agitation, anxiety, and autonomic dysfunction. Delirium tremens is the most severe manifestation of alcohol withdrawal and typically begins 48-96 hours after the last drink.",
    "zh": "乙醇的使用会导致中枢神经系统（CNS）中许多生化变化。它可在急性期增强GABA-A受体对GABA（中枢神经系统中主要的抑制性神经递质）的作用，导致镇静。长期乙醇使用会导致GABA受体下调。酒精还会轻度抑制大脑中兴奋性NMDA受体，长期接触会导致这些受体上调。这些适应性改变会导致耐受性（即需要增加剂量以达到期望的效果）和突然停止饮酒后的戒断症状，这在住院期间很常见。耐受性和戒断都是物质依赖的迹象。\n\n戒断症状最早可在患者最后一次饮酒后6小时开始出现，通常在2-3天内达到最大强度，如果戒断不严重，则在4-5天内消退。震颤，或“颤抖”，是最常见的初始表现。患者通常还会有轻微的自主神经功能障碍（例如，心率和呼吸加快）、胃肠道不适（例如，恶心、呕吐）和焦虑。\n\n（选项A）觉醒水平波动是震颤谵妄的特征，震颤谵妄是酒精戒断的一种潜在致命表现，通常在最后一次饮酒后的48-96小时开始。其他发现包括交感神经兴奋（例如，高热、高血压）、幻觉（例如，视觉、听觉或触觉）和意识模糊。\n\n（选项B和C）嗜睡和眼球震颤可发生在急性中毒中，但在酒精戒断期间并不常见。大多数患者由于戒断期间中枢神经系统兴奋性增加而出现失眠。\n\n（选项D）强直-阵挛性癫痫发作可在最后一次饮酒后12-48小时内发生，影响<5%的酒精戒断患者。\n\n（选项F）酒精性幻觉（即，视觉幻觉）可在最后一次饮酒后12-48小时内出现。这些早期幻觉与震颤谵妄不同。\n\n教育目标：\n震颤通常是酒精戒断的最早症状之一。其他常见症状包括胃肠道不适、激动、焦虑和自主神经功能障碍。震颤谵妄是酒精戒断最严重的表现，通常在最后一次饮酒后48-96小时开始。"
