    "en": "A 4-day-old infant is brought to the emergency department due to abnormal movements. The patient has had intermittent episodes of tonic posturing over the past 3 hours as well as vomiting, poor feeding, and irritability for the past 2 days. The mother also reports that the infant's diapers smell like caramelizing sugar. There are no known medical conditions in the family, but the mother's sister died \"sometime in the first year\" of life from unknown causes. On examination, the patient is lethargic and demonstrates intermittent posturing and increased generalized muscle tone. Laboratory evaluation of plasma and urine samples confirms the suspected diagnosis. This patient is most likely deficient in an enzyme that requires which of the following substances?",

    "en": "This infant has symptoms typical of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), an autosomal recessive disorder. MSUD is characterized by mutations in branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), an enzyme necessary for breaking down the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Defective BCKDC leads to accumulation of BCAAs in serum and peripheral tissues, resulting in neurotoxicity (eg, seizures, irritability, lethargy, and poor feeding) that can be life-threatening if untreated. A metabolite of isoleucine also gives the urine a distinctive odor described as sweet. Treatment for MSUD involves restricting BCAAs in the diet. BCKDC (in addition to pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) requires 5 cofactors: thiamine, lipoate, and coenzymes A, FAD, and NAD. Because MSUD has a spectrum of phenotypes, patients who have only a mild reduction in BCKDC activity may improve with high-dose thiamine treatment; however, most patients still require lifelong dietary restriction.\n\n(Choice A) Treatment of most urea cycle disorders involves supplemental arginine. Arginine administration increases production of downstream water-soluble intermediate metabolites (eg, ornithine, citrulline), facilitating nitrogen disposal and decreasing plasma ammonia levels.\n\n(Choice B) Cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia, neurologic changes including peripheral neuropathy, and elevated plasma levels of homocysteine (a prothrombotic substance). Supplementation of cobalamin is recommended to lower homocysteine levels in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia.\n\n(Choice C) Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is involved in the transamination and decarboxylation steps in amino acid metabolism as well as heme and neurotransmitter synthesis. Supplemental pyridoxine is typically prescribed in conjunction with drugs known to interfere with vitamin B6 metabolism (eg, isoniazid, penicillamine).\n\n(Choice D) Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency results in phenylketonuria because tetrahydrobiopterin is a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase. Phenylalanine levels can be reduced by tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation in patients with tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency.\n\nEducational objective:\nMaple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is caused by a deficiency of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase, an enzyme that requires several coenzymes (thiamine; lipoate; coenzymes A, FAD, NAD) to metabolize branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Some patients with milder forms of MSUD improve with high-dose thiamine treatment. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该婴儿的症状是枫糖尿症 (MSUD) 的典型症状，这是一种常染色体隐性遗传病。MSUD 的特征是支链α-酮酸脱氢酶复合物 (BCKDC) 发生突变，该酶是分解支链氨基酸 (BCAA) 亮氨酸、异亮氨酸和缬氨酸所必需的。BCKDC 缺陷导致血清和外周组织中 BCAA 蓄积，导致神经毒性（例如，癫痫发作、易怒、嗜睡和喂养不良），如果不及时治疗，可能会危及生命。异亮氨酸的一种代谢物也使尿液具有独特的甜味。MSUD 的治疗包括限制饮食中的 BCAA。BCKDC（除了丙酮酸脱氢酶和 α-酮戊二酸脱氢酶）需要 5 种辅因子：硫胺素、硫辛酸和辅酶 A、FAD 和 NAD。由于 MSUD 具有一系列表型，只有轻度 BCKDC 活性降低的患者可能会通过大剂量硫胺素治疗而改善；然而，大多数患者仍然需要终身饮食限制。\n\n（选项 A）大多数尿素循环障碍的治疗涉及补充精氨酸。精氨酸的施用增加了下游水溶性中间代谢物（例如，鸟氨酸、瓜氨酸）的产生，从而促进氮的排出并降低血浆氨水平。\n\n（选项 B）钴胺素（维生素 B12）缺乏会导致巨幼细胞性贫血、神经系统改变，包括周围神经病变，以及高半胱氨酸水平升高（一种促血栓形成物质）。建议补充钴胺素以降低高半胱氨酸血症患者的同型半胱氨酸水平。\n\n（选项 C）吡哆醇（维生素 B6）参与氨基酸代谢中的转氨和脱羧步骤以及血红素和神经递质的合成。通常开具补充吡哆醇，并与已知会干扰维生素 B6 代谢的药物（例如，异烟肼、青霉胺）一起使用。\n\n（选项 D）四氢生物蝶呤缺乏会导致苯丙酮尿症，因为四氢生物蝶呤是苯丙氨酸羟化酶的辅因子。对于四氢生物蝶呤缺乏的患者，可以通过补充四氢生物蝶呤来降低苯丙氨酸水平。\n\n教育目标：\n枫糖尿症 (MSUD) 是由支链α-酮酸脱氢酶缺乏引起的，该酶需要几种辅酶（硫胺素；硫辛酸；辅酶 A、FAD、NAD）来代谢支链氨基酸 (BCAA)。一些患有较轻型 MSUD 的患者可以通过大剂量硫胺素治疗而改善。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}"

It also tests the ability to differentiate MSUD from other metabolic disorders based on clinical and laboratory findings.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic presentation of MSUD (tonic posturing, poor feeding, sweet-smelling urine). Recall that BCKDC requires thiamine as a cofactor. Rule out other metabolic disorders based on their distinct clinical features and associated vitamin deficiencies.",
