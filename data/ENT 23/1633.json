    "en": "A 56-year-old previously healthy man comes to the office due to decreased hearing in both ears. He reports difficulty understanding conversations in crowded rooms. His wife adds that they often argue about the volume of the television set. The patient cannot remember precisely when he first noticed hearing loss but says it has been present at least 6 months and is getting worse. For the past 12 years, he has worked in a factory where he has to shout to communicate with coworkers and has seldom worn hearing protection. An audiogram is obtained as shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has high-frequency hearing loss due to chronic noise exposure. Transduction of mechanical sound waves into nerve impulses occurs in the organ of Corti through the following steps:\n\n1.  Sound reaches the middle ear by vibrating the tympanic membrane.\n2.  The vibration is transferred to the oval window by the ossicles.\n3.  Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the basilar membrane, which in turn causes bending of the hair cell cilia against the tectorial membrane.\n4.  Hair cell bending causes oscillating hyperpolarization and depolarization of the auditory nerve, thereby creating nerve impulses from sound.\n\nNoise-induced hearing loss results from trauma to the stereociliated hair cells of the organ of Corti. The acoustic reflex normally dampens the effects of loud noise by causing the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles to contract, which lessens the responsiveness of the ossicles to sound. However, prolonged noise exposure can cause distortion or fracture of the stereocilia due to shearing forces against the tectorial membrane. High-frequency hearing is lost first, regardless of the frequency of the sound causing the damage.\n\n(Choice A) Hearing loss originating in the auditory nerve is most commonly due to a vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma). Patients develop high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, but symptoms are usually unilateral.\n\n(Choice B) The cochlear cupula is the apex of the cochlea and is distant from the oval window. The distal cochlea primarily registers low-frequency sound.\n\n(Choice C) Defects of the middle ear ossicles (eg, otosclerosis) can cause hearing loss that generally affects air conduction across all frequencies. This patient's hearing loss affects both air and bone conduction.\n\n(Choice E) The round window lies between the middle and inner ear and moves outward when the stapes causes the oval window to move inward. Malformation of the round window can cause congenital hearing impairment, but acquired disorders are rare.\n\n(Choice F) Perforation or rupture of the tympanic membrane can occur with infection, trauma, pressure changes, or sudden and very loud noises. Rupture of the tympanic membrane causes unilateral conductive hearing loss. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者由于长期暴露于噪声中而出现高频听力损失。机械声波转换为神经冲动发生在Corti 器官中，通过以下步骤：\n\n1. 声音通过振动鼓膜到达中耳。\n2. 振动通过听小骨传递到卵圆窗。\n3. 卵圆窗的振动引起基底膜的振动，进而导致毛细胞纤毛弯曲以对抗盖膜。\n4. 毛细胞弯曲引起听神经的振荡超极化和去极化，从而产生来自声音的神经冲动。\n\n噪声引起的听力损失是由于Corti 器官的立体纤毛毛细胞受到损伤。声反射通常通过引起镫骨肌和鼓膜张肌收缩来减弱大噪声的影响，这会降低听小骨对声音的反应。然而，长期暴露于噪声中会由于剪切力作用于盖膜而导致立体纤毛的变形或断裂。高频听力首先丧失，而与引起损伤的声音的频率无关。\n\n(选项 A) 听神经起源的听力损失最常见的原因是前庭神经鞘瘤（听神经瘤）。患者会发生高频感音神经性听力损失，但症状通常是单侧的。\n\n(选项 B) 耳蜗杯是耳蜗的顶点，远离卵圆窗。远端耳蜗主要记录低频声音。\n\n(选项 C) 中耳听小骨的缺陷（例如，耳硬化症）可导致听力损失，这通常会影响所有频率的空气传导。该患者的听力损失影响空气传导和骨传导。\n\n(选项 E) 圆窗位于中耳和内耳之间，当镫骨导致卵圆窗向内移动时，圆窗向外移动。圆窗畸形可引起先天性听力障碍，但获得性疾病很少见。\n\n(选项 F) 鼓膜穿孔或破裂可发生于感染、外伤、压力变化或突然且非常大的噪声。鼓膜破裂会导致单侧传导性听力损失。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests the etiology and pathophysiology of noise-induced hearing loss, specifically the damage to stereociliated hair cells in the organ of Corti.
