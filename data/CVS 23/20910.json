    "en": "This cyanotic newborn has severe hypoxemia that does not improve with oxygen administration. This finding suggests a congenital heart defect in which deoxygenated blood bypasses the pulmonary circulation and is delivered directly to the systemic circulation (ie, right-to-left shunt). In this case, the most likely etiology is TRANSPOSITION OF THE GREAT ARTERIES (TGA), in which the aorta originates from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle; the abnormal position of the aorta atop the pulmonary artery creates a narrow-appearing mediastinum {{exhibit_2}}.\n\nThe anatomy of TGA results in DISCONNECTED AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS with delivery of deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the systemic circulation via the aorta (effectively a right-to-left shunt). Cyanosis occurs shortly after birth but does not improve with oxygen administration (ie, HYPEROXIA TEST) because the oxygenated blood cannot reach the systemic circulation; instead, it is cycled from the lungs to the left side of the heart and back to the lungs.\n\nA mixing shunt (eg, patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect) that can deliver some oxygenated blood to the systemic circulation must be present for viability in TGA; an associated murmur can sometimes be present based on the size and type of mixing lesion, but many patients with TGA have no murmur.\n\n(Choices A and D) Preterm newborns are at risk for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) causing hypoxemia due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch and a modest reduction in diffusion capacity. However, hypoxemia due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch and/or diffusion impairment is expected to at least somewhat improve with oxygen administration. Furthermore, RDS is unlikely in a neonate born at term and affected patients have diffuse, ground-glass opacities on lung imaging.\n\n(Choice B) Impaired left ventricular contractility (ie, heart failure) does not cause hypoxemia directly but can cause hypoxemia if it leads to pulmonary edema. This patient's clear lungs on auscultation and chest x-ray rule out significant pulmonary edema.\n\n(Choice C) Congenital methemoglobinemia, or the inability to reduce methemoglobin back to hemoglobin, is a rare cause of neonatal cyanosis. Oxygen saturation fails to improve with oxygen administration, but methemoglobinemia does not explain a narrowed mediastinum on chest x-ray.\n\nEducational objective:\nCyanotic congenital heart disease is characterized by hypoxemia that does not improve with oxygen administration. In transposition of the great arteries, deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle is delivered to the systemic circulation while oxygenated blood cycles through the pulmonary circulation (ie, parallel circuits).",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of congenital heart defects presenting with cyanosis in newborns, specifically transposition of the great arteries (TGA). It assesses the understanding of the pathophysiology of TGA, where parallel pulmonary and systemic circuits lead to hypoxemia that does not improve with oxygen administration. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the cyanosis unresponsive to oxygen, the absence of heart murmurs, and the narrowed mediastinum on chest radiograph. These findings are highly suggestive of TGA. Understanding the parallel circulation in TGA helps eliminate other causes of neonatal cyanosis.",
