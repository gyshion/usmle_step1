    "en": "A 66-year-old man comes to the office after his employer urged him to undergo medical evaluation for repeated mistakes at work. The patient was a highly successful accountant until 6 months ago when he started making uncharacteristic errors and turning in projects late. He says, \"I don't know why, but it's suddenly really hard for me to organize and plan for these projects.\" His wife has had to take over managing their finances at home. The patient is also having difficulty shopping for groceries and preparing meals. He has not seen a physician in many years and takes no medications. Blood pressure is 159/96 mm Hg and pulse is 72/min. Physical examination shows impaired executive neurocognitive function. Reflexes are 2+ in the right lower extremity and 3+ in the left. Strength is 5/5 on the right side and 4/5 in the left lower extremity. He has an unsteady gait.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's relatively abrupt cognitive decline with prominent executive dysfunction (eg, difficulty planning and organizing) and localizing neurologic findings (eg, asymmetric reflexes, asymmetric muscle weakness, gait disturbances) is strongly suggestive of VASCULAR DEMENTIA (VaD) due to unrecognized stroke(s) 6 months ago. VaD is often caused by 2 (potentially overlapping) mechanisms:\n\n*   Large artery infarction (often causing an overt stroke) produces a cortical-type VaD, in which accompanying neurologic signs/symptoms reflect the specific cortical region involved (eg, middle cerebral artery infarction causing contralateral weakness and sensory impairment).\n*   Small artery (ie, arteriole) infarcts can cause enough cumulative damage to the brain, resulting in noticeable cognitive deficits. Although the clinical picture is varied, a subcortical-type VaD is common because there is less arteriole collateralization in the subcortical regions compared to the cerebral cortex. As in this patient, subcortical-type VaD is often accompanied by focal motor deficits (eg, reflex asymmetry, strength differences), abnormal gait, urinary symptoms, and psychiatric symptoms (eg, depressive syndromes).\n\nSubcortical VaD is due to either cerebral amyloid angiopathy or, more commonly, SMALL VESSEL ARTERIOSCLEROSIS. Arteriosclerosis is common in older patients, especially those with a history of hypertension.\n\n(Choice B) Degeneration of the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain is seen in ALZHEIMER DISEASE, which presents with progressive memory loss and functional impairments. However, Alzheimer disease typically progresses gradually with early, prominent short-term memory loss, and it would not cause focal neurologic findings (eg, strength deficits, reflex asymmetry).\n\n(Choice C) Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is characteristic of PARKINSON DISEASE, which can cause executive and visuospatial dysfunction with relatively mild memory impairment. However, Parkinsonian features (eg, rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia) occur at least a year before the onset of dementia.\n\n(Choice D) Sudden acceleration-deceleration or rotational forces during blunt head injury can cause diffuse shearing of the long white matter tracts (diffuse axonal injury). Patients have a history of acute trauma and neurologic impairment out of proportion to neuroimaging findings.\n\n(Choice E) Neuronal loss and atrophy of hypothalamic mamillary bodies characteristically occurs in WERNICKE ENCEPHALOPATHY, a complication of THIAMINE DEFICIENCY. Although it can cause ataxia and confusion, it also typically presents with oculomotor dysfunction (nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia), and patients typically have a history of either chronic alcohol use or malnutrition.\n\nEducational objective:\nSmall artery arteriosclerosis can lead to ISCHEMIA that predominantly affects the subcortical areas. This can lead to vascular dementia associated with focal motor deficits, abnormal gait, urinary symptoms, and psychiatric symptoms.",
    "zh": "该患者的认知能力相对突然下降，伴有明显的执行功能障碍（例如，难以计划和组织）和定位神经学发现（例如，不对称反射，不对称肌无力，步态障碍），强烈提示6个月前由于未被发现的卒中而导致的血管性痴呆（VaD）。 VaD通常由以下2种（可能重叠）机制引起：\n\n*   大动脉梗死（通常导致明显的卒中）产生皮质型VaD，其中伴随的神经系统体征/症状反映了所涉及的特定皮质区域（例如，大脑中动脉梗死导致对侧肢体无力和感觉障碍）。\n*   小动脉（即，小动脉）梗死可对大脑造成足够的累积性损伤，从而导致明显的认知缺陷。尽管临床表现各异，但皮质下型VaD很常见，因为与大脑皮质相比，皮质下区域的小动脉侧支循环较少。正如该患者一样，皮质下型VaD通常伴有局灶性运动缺陷（例如，反射不对称，肌力差异）、步态异常、泌尿系统症状和精神症状（例如，抑郁综合征）。\n\n皮质下VaD是由于脑淀粉样血管病或更常见的小血管动脉硬化引起的。动脉硬化在老年患者中很常见，尤其是有高血压病史的患者。\n\n（选项B） 基底前脑胆碱能神经元的退化见于阿尔茨海默病，其表现为进行性记忆力减退和功能障碍。然而，阿尔茨海默病通常逐渐进展，早期表现为突出的短期记忆丧失，并且不会引起局灶性神经学发现（例如，肌力缺陷，反射不对称）。\n\n（选项C） 黑质多巴胺能神经元的退化是帕金森病的特征，可导致执行和视觉空间功能障碍，伴有相对轻度的记忆力减退。然而，帕金森病表现（例如，僵硬，静止性震颤，运动迟缓）在痴呆发病前至少一年发生。\n\n（选项D）钝性头部损伤期间的突然加速-减速或旋转力可导致长白质束（弥漫性轴突损伤）的弥漫性剪切。患者有急性外伤史，其神经系统损伤与神经影像学发现不成比例。\n\n（选项E） 下丘脑乳头体的神经元损失和萎缩通常发生在韦尼克脑病中，这是硫胺素缺乏症的并发症。虽然它会导致共济失调和意识模糊，但通常也会表现为眼动神经功能障碍（眼球震颤，眼肌麻痹），并且患者通常有慢性酒精使用或营养不良史。\n\n教育目标：\n小动脉动脉硬化可导致主要影响皮质下区域的缺血。这可导致与局灶性运动缺陷、步态异常、泌尿系统症状和精神症状相关的血管性痴呆。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology of vascular dementia, specifically differentiating it from other causes of cognitive decline based on clinical presentation and neurologic findings. It requires recognizing the signs of cerebrovascular disease contributing to cognitive impairment.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying key clinical features such as abrupt onset, executive dysfunction, focal neurologic deficits, and gait disturbances, which are highly suggestive of vascular dementia. The patient's age and hypertension are also important risk factors for small vessel disease. Ruling out other etiologies like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Wernicke's encephalopathy based on their characteristic presentations is crucial.",
