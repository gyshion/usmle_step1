    "en": "A 41-year-old woman comes to the office after a positive home urine pregnancy test. Her last menstrual period was 12 weeks ago. For the past month, the patient has had increasing nausea. She vomits several times a day and has difficulty keeping any food down. The patient has 3 children, all born at term via cesarean section. On this visit, ultrasound demonstrates echogenic intrauterine tissue without an amniotic sac and multiple bilateral ovarian cysts. Hydrophic villi are evacuated from the uterus during dilation and curettage. Which of the following should be closely monitored in this patient after the procedure?",
    "zh": "一名41岁的女性在家庭尿妊娠试验呈阳性后前来就诊。她的末次月经是12周前。在过去的一个月里，患者的恶心感逐渐加重。她每天呕吐数次，并且难以摄入任何食物。患者有3个孩子，都是足月经剖腹产分娩。在这次就诊中，超声检查显示宫内回声组织，无羊膜囊，并有多个双侧卵巢囊肿。在扩张和刮宫术中，从子宫中清除了水肿样绒毛。在该手术后，应对该患者密切监测以下哪一项？"

    "en": "The patient's presentation of a positive pregnancy test, amenorrhea of 12 weeks, hyperemesis gravidarum, and ultrasound findings of echogenic intrauterine tissue without an amniotic sac, along with bilateral ovarian cysts, is highly suggestive of a HYDATIDIFORM MOLE. Dilation and curettage is the appropriate management for evacuation of the molar tissue. Following evacuation, it is crucial to monitor the patient's β-hCG levels. Persistently elevated or rising β-hCG levels are a significant RED FLAG for neoplastic conversion, such as an INVASIVE MOLE or CHORIOCARCINOMA. Serial β-hCG measurements are essential to detect these complications early. The table {{exhibit_1}} and {{exhibit_2}} further details the characteristics of hydatidiform moles, including clinical features like vaginal bleeding, enlarged uterus, and extremely high β-hCG levels, which can lead to hyperemesis gravidarum, preeclampsia, hyperthyroidism, and theca lutein cysts. Pathologic features include edematous villi with trophoblastic proliferation. The risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia is higher in complete moles.\n\n(Choice A) An elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level in a pregnant woman may suggest a fetal neural tube defect, or it can be a marker for yolk sac tumors of the ovaries and testes. It is not the primary marker for monitoring post-molarGTD. The ultrasound findings do not suggest a fetal neural tube defect, and the pathology is trophoblastic tissue, not a yolk sac tumor.\n\n(Choice C) Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a tumor marker primarily used in the management of COLORECTAL CARCINOMA and other adenocarcinomas. It is not typically elevated in gestational trophoblastic disease.\n\n(Choice D) CA-125 is an ovarian tumor marker, often elevated in OVARIAN CANCER. While the patient has bilateral ovarian cysts (likely theca lutein cysts secondary to high β-hCG), CA-125 is not the appropriate marker for monitoring GTD. The theca lutein cysts are a reactive phenomenon to high levels of β-hCG and typically resolve as β-hCG levels fall.\n\n(Choice E) Vaginal cytology is used to detect cervical cancer or other abnormalities of the vaginal epithelium. It is not used for the diagnosis or monitoring of gestational trophoblastic disease. Sarcoma botryoides is a rare form of rhabdomyosarcoma that can occur in the vagina, but it is a distinct entity from GTD and has a different presentation and management.\n\nKey clinical pearls: Monitor β-hCG levels after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole. Persistently rising or plateauing levels indicate neoplastic transformation. Theca lutein cysts are common with hydatidiform moles due to high β-hCG stimulation.",
    "zh": "患者的临床表现，如妊娠试验阳性、闭经12周、妊娠剧吐以及超声检查发现宫内回声组织，无羊膜囊，并伴有双侧卵巢囊肿，高度提示为葡萄胎。扩张和刮宫术是清除葡萄胎组织的合适方法。清宫后，监测患者的β-hCG水平至关重要。持续升高的或升高的β-hCG水平是肿瘤转化的一个重要危险信号，如侵袭性葡萄胎或绒毛膜癌。连续的β-hCG测量对于早期检测这些并发症至关重要。表格{{exhibit_1}}和{{exhibit_2}}进一步详细介绍了葡萄胎的特征，包括阴道出血、子宫增大和极高的β-hCG水平等临床特征，这些特征可导致妊娠剧吐、先兆子痫、甲状腺功能亢进和黄素囊肿。病理特征包括伴有滋养细胞增生的水肿样绒毛。完全性葡萄胎发生妊娠滋养细胞肿瘤的风险较高。\n\n（选项 A）孕妇的甲胎蛋白 (AFP) 水平升高可能提示胎儿神经管缺陷，或者它可以是卵巢和睾丸的卵黄囊肿瘤的标志物。它不是监测清宫后 GTD 的主要标志物。超声检查结果并未提示胎儿神经管缺陷，病理是滋养细胞组织，而不是卵黄囊肿瘤。\n\n（选项 C）癌胚抗原 (CEA) 是一种肿瘤标志物，主要用于治疗结直肠癌和其他腺癌。它通常在妊娠滋养细胞疾病中不升高。\n\n（选项 D）CA-125 是一种卵巢肿瘤标志物，通常在卵巢癌中升高。虽然患者有双侧卵巢囊肿（可能是继发于高 β-hCG 的黄素囊肿），但 CA-125 并不是监测 GTD 的合适标志物。黄素囊肿是对高水平 β-hCG 的一种反应现象，通常会随着 β-hCG 水平下降而消退。\n\n（选项 E）阴道细胞学检查用于检测宫颈癌或阴道上皮的其他异常情况。它不用于妊娠滋养细胞疾病的诊断或监测。葡萄状肉瘤是一种罕见的横纹肌肉瘤，可发生在阴道中，但它与 GTD 截然不同，具有不同的表现和治疗方法。\n\n关键临床要点：清空葡萄胎后监测 β-hCG 水平。持续升高或停滞的水平表明肿瘤转化。由于高水平的 β-hCG 刺激，黄素囊肿在葡萄胎中很常见。"
