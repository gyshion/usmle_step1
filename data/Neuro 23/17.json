    "en": "A 65-year-old woman is evaluated for worsening urinary urgency and incontinence. The patient has had no abdominal pain, dysuria, or changes in urinary frequency. On several occasions, she has urinated involuntarily, which she attributes to an inability to walk quickly to the bathroom. The patient feels unsteady while ambulating and walks slowly with small steps. Her family also reports that she has become forgetful and has difficulty planning and executing various activities that she used to perform regularly. Medical history is notable for hypertension. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary, abdominal, and genitourinary examinations show no abnormalities. Neurological examination shows impaired attention and short-term memory. MRI of the brain reveals chronic white matter changes with no infarction, hemorrhage, or mass lesions. There is diffuse ventriculomegaly with no sulcal enlargement {{exhibit_1}}. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's urinary incontinence?",
    "zh": "一位65岁女性因尿频和尿失禁加重就诊。患者无腹痛、排尿困难或尿频变化。她曾多次不由自主地排尿，认为这与无法快速走到厕所有关。患者行走时感觉不稳，步态缓慢，步幅小。她的家人还报告说她变得健忘，难以计划和执行她过去经常做的各种活动。病史值得关注高血压。患者不吸烟、不饮酒，也不使用违禁药物。生命体征在正常范围内。心肺、腹部和泌尿生殖系统检查未见异常。神经系统检查显示注意力不集中和短期记忆受损。脑部MRI显示慢性白质改变，无梗死、出血或占位性病变。有弥漫性脑室扩大，无脑沟增宽 {{exhibit_1}}。以下哪项最可能是该患者尿失禁的根本原因？"

    "en": "This patient with impaired memory and cognition, unsteady gait, and urinary incontinence has ventriculomegaly without sulcal enlargement on MRI, which is characteristic of NORMAL PRESSURE HYDROCEPHALUS (NPH). NPH can occur due to decreased absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by the arachnoid granulations (eg, fibrosis from previous cerebral inflammation or bleeding) with gradual accumulation of CSF in the ventricular system. The lateral ventricles expand, resulting in normal intracranial pressure and stretching the descending cortical fibers (corona radiata) {{exhibit_2}}. Interruption of these pathways, along with impairment of cortical and subcortical function, leads to the classic triad of NPH symptoms (dementia, gait disturbance, urinary incontinence). \n\nThe cerebral cortex (through the pontine micturition center) regulates the micturition reflex, which is an autonomic spinal reflex mediated by the neurons in the sacral spinal cord. In NPH, the lack of cortical inhibition results in DETRUSOR MUSCLE HYPERACTIVITY. This leads to urinary urgency, which can be worsened by gait abnormalities that limit a patient's ability to quickly get to a bathroom (urge incontinence). Progressive frontal lobe impairment leads to the inability to recognize urinary urge, uncontrolled urination, and a lack of concern as the disease progresses.\n\n(Choice A) Cerebellar dysfunction can cause an ataxic gait, dysarthria, and intention tremors. Memory dysfunction and urinary incontinence are more indicative of cerebral impairment. NPH typically spares cerebellar function.\n\n(Choice B) Compression of the reticular formation can occur with brainstem herniation, leading to loss of consciousness and coma.\n\n(Choice C) Impaired basal ganglia signaling is characteristic of Parkinson disease, which can result in ataxia with a slow gait. However, cogwheel rigidity and resting tremor would be prominent and dementia and urinary incontinence would not be expected until later in the disease course.\n\n(Choice D) Spinal cord damage is a common cause of incontinence with gait impairment. However, spinal cord injury also frequently causes lower extremity weakness and is not associated with cognitive impairment. {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者记忆力和认知功能受损，步态不稳，且出现尿失禁，MRI显示脑室扩大，但无脑沟增宽，这是正常压力脑积水 (NPH) 的特征。NPH 可能是由于蛛网膜颗粒对脑脊液 (CSF) 的吸收减少（例如，既往脑部炎症或出血引起的纤维化），导致脑室系统中 CSF 逐渐积聚。侧脑室扩张，导致颅内压正常，并牵拉下行皮质纤维 (放射冠) {{exhibit_2}}。这些通路的中断，以及皮质和皮质下功能的损害，导致NPH的典型三联征症状（痴呆、步态障碍、尿失禁）。\n\n大脑皮质（通过桥脑排尿中枢）调节排尿反射，排尿反射是由骶髓神经元介导的自主性脊髓反射。在NPH中，缺乏皮质抑制导致逼尿肌过度活动。这导致尿急，而步态异常会限制患者快速到达厕所的能力（急迫性尿失禁），这会加重尿急。进行性额叶损伤导致无法识别尿意、尿失禁以及疾病进展过程中缺乏关注。\n\n(选项A) 小脑功能障碍可引起共济失调性步态、构音障碍和意向性震颤。记忆功能障碍和尿失禁更表明存在脑部损伤。NPH通常不影响小脑功能。\n\n(选项B) 网状结构受压可发生在脑干疝形成时，导致意识丧失和昏迷。\n\n(选项C) 基底节信号传导受损是帕金森病的特征，可导致步态缓慢的共济失调。然而，齿轮状强直和静止性震颤会很突出，而痴呆和尿失禁预计不会在疾病的后期出现。\n\n(选项D) 脊髓损伤是导致步态障碍性尿失禁的常见原因。然而，脊髓损伤也常引起下肢无力，且与认知障碍无关。{{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), its classic triad of symptoms (dementia, gait disturbance, urinary incontinence), and the underlying pathophysiology related to decreased CSF absorption and stretching of cortical fibers. It also tests the ability to differentiate NPH from other neurological conditions presenting with gait abnormalities, cognitive impairment, or urinary incontinence.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic triad of NPH. Rule out other causes of gait and cognitive impairment by considering the specific neurological findings.
