    "en": "A 47-year-old woman comes to the office due to progressive exertional dyspnea and fatigue. She also reports painful episodes of bluish discoloration of the fingers and toes that are triggered by cold exposure and improve with rewarming. Medical history is significant for severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. Physical examination shows skin tightening over the fingers. The oral aperture is small, and scattered telangiectasias are present over the lips. Cardiac examination demonstrates an increased intensity of S2 over the upper left sternal border. Lungs are clear to auscultation with normal air movement and no crackles. The abdomen is soft with mild hepatomegaly. There is bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Chest x-ray {{exhibit_1}} reveals no abnormalities. Results of office spirometry are as follows:\n\nForced vital capacity (FVC) Normal\nForced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) Normal\nFEV₁/FVC ratio (%) Normal",

    "en": "This patient displays Raynaud phenomenon (cold-induced painful digital vasospasm), sclerodactyly (skin tightening of the hands/ feet), telangiectasias, gastroesophageal dysfunction. These findings suggest systemic sclerosis (i.e. scleroderma), specifically the limited cutaneous variant, or CREST (Calcinosis cutis, Raynaud phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, Telangiectasia) syndrome.\n\nSystemic sclerosis frequently involves multisystem vasculopathy affecting several vessel beds, including distal extremities (digital ischemia), kidneys (renal crisis), and pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a leading cause of mortality in patients with systemic sclerosis, is driven by abnormal inflammatory and fibroproliferative signaling (eg, transforming growth factor beta), leading to neointimal/medial thickening and luminal narrowing. Histologically, vessels have a concentric onion-skin, sclerotic appearance.\n\nPulmonary vascular remodeling is progressive and relentless. Over time, the right ventricle cannot pump against the increased afterload, leading to right ventricular failure. In this patient, PAH is suggested by a prominent pulmonic component of S2 (ie, loud P2, reflecting high pressure in pulmonary artery) with signs of right-sided venous congestion (eg, hepatomegaly, lower extremity edema).\n\n(Choice A) Systemic sclerosis can induce extrapulmonary restriction via chest wall skin tightening that limits thoracic expansion. Clear lungs are expected on auscultation and imaging; however, pulmonary function testing would show a restrictive pattern (ie, low FVC).\n\n(Choice B) Fibrotic interstitial lung disease is another pulmonary complication of systemic sclerosis (particularly the diffuse cutaneous variant), characterized by lung parenchymal inflammation and collagen deposition. However, inspiratory crackles, reticular interstitial thickening on chest x-ray {{exhibit_2}}, and a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing are expected.\n\n(Choice C) Pericardial fibrosis, occasionally a complication of systemic sclerosis, typically manifests as right-sided heart failure due to impaired diastolic filling of the right ventricle. However, this impaired filling prevents elevation of pulmonary artery pressure; therefore, a loud P2 is not expected.\n\n(Choice E) Pulmonic stenosis can lead to right-sided heart failure. However, right ventricular outflow obstruction leads to low pulmonary artery pressures, resulting in a soft P2. In addition, pulmonic stenosis (almost always a congenital lesion) does not explain the additional findings of CREST syndrome. {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者表现出雷诺现象（寒冷诱发的疼痛性手指血管痉挛）、硬皮病（手/脚皮肤紧绷）、毛细血管扩张、胃食管功能障碍。这些发现提示系统性硬化症（即硬皮病），特别是局限性皮肤变异型，或CREST（皮肤钙化、雷诺现象、食管动力障碍、硬皮病、毛细血管扩张）综合征。\n\n系统性硬化症常累及多系统血管病变，影响多个血管床，包括远端肢体（手指缺血）、肾脏（肾危象）和肺动脉。肺动脉高压 (PAH) 是系统性硬化症患者死亡的主要原因，由异常炎症和纤维增生信号（例如，转化生长因子β）驱动，导致内膜/中膜增厚和管腔狭窄。组织学上，血管呈同心洋葱皮样、硬化外观。\n\n肺血管重塑是进行性和无情的。随着时间的推移，右心室无法对抗增加的后负荷，导致右心衰竭。在该患者中，PAH 由S2的肺动脉瓣成分突出（即，响亮的P2，反映肺动脉高压）以及右侧静脉充血的体征（例如，肝肿大、下肢水肿）提示。\n\n(选项A) 系统性硬化症可通过胸壁皮肤紧绷来诱发肺外限制，从而限制胸廓扩张。听诊和影像学检查预计肺部清晰；然而，肺功能检查将显示限制性模式（即，低FVC）。\n\n(选项B) 纤维化间质性肺病是系统性硬化症的另一种肺部并发症（特别是弥漫性皮肤变异型），其特征是肺实质炎症和胶原沉积。然而，预计吸气性爆裂音、胸部X线{{exhibit_2}}上的网状间质增厚以及肺功能检查上的限制性模式。\n\n(选项C) 心包纤维化，偶尔是系统性硬化症的并发症，通常表现为右心衰竭，原因是右心室舒张充盈受损。然而，这种充盈受损会阻止肺动脉压力的升高；因此，预计不会出现响亮的P2。\n\n(选项E) 肺动脉瓣狭窄可导致右心衰竭。然而，右心室流出道梗阻导致肺动脉压力低，导致P2音弱。此外，肺动脉瓣狭窄（几乎总是先天性病变）不能解释 CREST 综合征的其他发现。{{exhibit_3}}"
