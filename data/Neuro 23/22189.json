    "en": "A 10-year-old boy is brought to the clinic due to stiffness and weakness in his hands. A few weeks ago, the parents first noticed that the child was having trouble letting go of his toothbrush after brushing his teeth. The patient's teacher has also mentioned that the boy seems to have difficulty maintaining a firm grip on his pencil when doing schoolwork. He has a history of intellectual disability and takes no medications. Examination shows bilateral cataracts. Laboratory evaluation shows unstable cytosine-thymine-guanine trinucleotide repeats, resulting in the transcription and accumulation of untranslatable mutant mRNAs, which negatively affect cellular function.",

    "en": "This patient has MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY TYPE 1 (DM1), an autosomal dominant muscular dystrophy characterized by unstable expansion of cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) trinucleotide repeats in the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene. This disorder particularly affects the brain, skeletal muscles, and myocardium, and the pathophysiology is likely due to toxic effects of mutant mRNAs with expanded CTG repeats. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nFollowing transcription, the mutant mRNAs are not translated. Rather, they form hairpin structures and accumulate in the nucleus. The mutant mRNAs bind and sequester RNA-binding proteins such as muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins. These proteins normally play a role in mRNA splicing, and as more MBNL proteins are sequestered in the nucleus, aberrant splicing occurs, resulting in dysfunctional protein products.\n\nPatients with DM1 demonstrate somatic mosaicism. The CTG expansion is notably unstable in nondividing cells, including skeletal muscle, the brain, and myocardium (repeat lengths are several-fold longer in these cells). In addition, cellular mRNA content typically decreases with mitosis and increases when the cell is not dividing; therefore, cells that remain senescent (eg, myocardial cells) tend to accumulate more mutant mRNAs over time. These processes help explain why patients with DM1 are more likely to develop symptoms as they age, such as cardiac conduction disturbances.\n\n(Choices A, B, C, and E) CTG trinucleotide repeats are present in other cells in DM1 patients. However, these proliferating cells (ie, airway basal cells, erythroblasts, intestinal epithelial cells, osteogenic cells) are not typically affected in DM1. This may be due to having more stable and shorter CTG repeats, along with having less accumulation of mutant mRNAs compared to nondividing cells.\n\nEducational objective:\nMyotonic dystrophy type 1 is due to a cytosine-thymine-guanine trinucleotide repeat expansion in the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene, resulting in untranslatable mutant mRNAs. The mutant mRNAs form hairpin structures and accumulate in the nucleus, sequestering certain RNA-binding proteins and leading to aberrant splicing. Nondividing cells of the brain, skeletal muscles, and myocardium are particularly affected.",
