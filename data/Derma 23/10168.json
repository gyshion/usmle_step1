    "en": "A 60-year-old woman comes to the office due to 10 days of diffuse itching. A rash began on her hands and quickly spread to involve her wrists, arms, and axillae. The patient has difficulty sleeping and complains of intense itching in these areas. She works in a day care center and primarily cares for children age 2-5. The patient has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. Vital signs are normal. BMI is 24 kg/m². Skin examination shows small, erythematous papules on the palms with excoriations, scattered vesicles, and pustules on the finger webs, palms, and wrist creases, as seen in the image below {{exhibit_1}}. She has similar lesions in the axillary skin folds bilaterally. The remainder of the examination is within normal limits.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's rapidly spreading pruritic rash with erythematous papules and excoriations is suggestive of scabies, or infestation by the *Sarcoptes scabiei* mite. The mite spreads through direct person-to-person contact and burrows into the skin. A history of working in a setting with close interpersonal contact (eg, day care center) is common.\n\nThe manifestations of scabies are due to a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction to the mite, mite feces, and mite eggs. Patients have an INTENSELY PRURITIC RASH that is often WORSE AT NIGHT. The characteristic distribution includes the flexor surfaces of the wrist, lateral surfaces of the fingers and finger webs; it also commonly involves the axillae and extensor elbow surfaces. Skin examination usually shows excoriations with small, crusted, red papules scattered around the affected areas; vesicles, pustules, or wheals may also be present. LINEAR BURROWS are the most specific finding but are often obscured by excoriations.\n\nDiagnosis is usually clinical but can be confirmed by skin scrapings showing mites, ova, and feces under light microscopy {{exhibit_2}}{{exhibit_3}}{{exhibit_4}}{{exhibit_5}}{{exhibit_6}}{{exhibit_7}}{{exhibit_8}}{{exhibit_9}}{{exhibit_10}}.\n\n(Choice A) Budding yeast is characteristic of *Candida* infection, which usually presents with erythematous plaques and erosions with satellite papules/pustules in areas with increased moisture and friction, such as skin folds (eg, axillae, genital areas). This patient's palmar involvement makes this diagnosis unlikely.\n\n(Choice B) Molluscum bodies are seen with molluscum contagiosum, which is caused by a DNA poxvirus. Lesions may be pruritic but appear as small, firm, pearly papules with central umbilication. Moreover, molluscum contagiosum does not involve the palms and soles.\n\n(Choice C) Epidermal multinucleated giant cells are seen with herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections. In contrast to this case, HSV causes vesicular eruptions involving the perioral or genital regions, while VZV causes a vesicular rash that is diffuse (primary infection) or of limited dermatomal involvement (shingles).\n\n(Choice D) Necrotic keratinocytes in the epidermis suggest Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a severe reaction that occurs 1-3 weeks after an infection (eg, cytomegalovirus, *Mycoplasma*) or drug exposure. Unlike this case, patients usually develop high fever, mucosal erosions, and skin detachment.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nScabies is a highly contagious disease that presents with an intensely pruritic, erythematous, papular rash (usually worse at night) involving the flexor surfaces of the wrist, sides and webs of the fingers, and axillae. Diagnosis can be confirmed by skin scrapings from excoriated lesions that show mites, ova, and feces under light microscopy.",
    "zh": "该患者的迅速蔓延、瘙痒性皮疹伴有红斑丘疹和抓痕，提示为疥疮，即被疥螨*Sarcoptes scabiei*感染。疥螨通过直接人际接触传播并钻入皮肤。在密切人际接触的环境（如日托中心）工作病史很常见。\n\n疥疮的临床表现是由于对疥螨、疥螨粪便和疥螨卵的迟发型 IV 型超敏反应。患者有剧烈瘙痒的皮疹，通常在夜间加重。特征性分布包括腕部的屈侧面、手指和指蹼的侧面；通常也涉及腋窝和伸肘表面。皮肤检查通常显示抓痕，受影响区域周围散布着小的、结痂的红色丘疹；也可能出现水疱、脓疱或风团。线性隧道是最具特征性的发现，但常常被抓痕所掩盖。\n\n诊断通常是临床性的，但可以通过皮肤刮屑镜检显示疥螨、卵和粪便来确诊 {{exhibit_2}}{{exhibit_3}}{{exhibit_4}}{{exhibit_5}}{{exhibit_6}}{{exhibit_7}}{{exhibit_8}}{{exhibit_9}}{{exhibit_10}}。\n\n（选项 A）出芽酵母是*念珠菌*感染的特征，通常表现为红斑斑块和糜烂，并在潮湿和摩擦增加的区域（如皮肤褶皱，例如腋窝、生殖器区域）出现卫星状丘疹/脓疱。该患者的手掌受累使这种诊断不太可能。\n\n（选项 B）软疣小体见于传染性软疣，由 DNA 痘病毒引起。病变可能瘙痒，但表现为小的、坚硬的、珍珠状丘疹，伴有中央脐凹。此外，传染性软疣不累及手掌和足底。\n\n（选项 C）表皮多核巨细胞见于单纯疱疹病毒（HSV）和水痘-带状疱疹病毒（VZV）感染。与本病例相反，HSV 引起累及口周或生殖器区域的水疱性皮疹，而 VZV 引起弥漫性水疱疹（原发性感染）或受累皮节有限（带状疱疹）。\n\n（选项 D）表皮坏死角质形成细胞提示史蒂文斯-约翰逊综合征，这是一种严重的反应，发生在感染（例如巨细胞病毒、*支原体*）或药物暴露后 1-3 周。与本病例不同的是，患者通常会发高烧、黏膜糜烂和皮肤脱落。\n\n教育目标：\n\n疥疮是一种高度传染性疾病，表现为剧烈瘙痒的红斑性丘疹性皮疹（通常在夜间加重），累及腕部屈侧面、手指侧面和指蹼以及腋窝。可以通过从抓伤病变中提取的皮肤刮屑镜检，显示疥螨、卵和粪便来确诊。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of scabies presentation, risk factors, and diagnostic methods. Key features include intense pruritus worse at night, involvement of interdigital spaces and wrists, and potential for outbreaks in close-contact settings like daycare centers.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic scabies presentation and risk factors. Consider the microscopic findings that confirm the diagnosis, specifically the presence of mites, eggs, or feces in skin scrapings. Rule out other conditions based on their distinct clinical features and microscopic findings.",
