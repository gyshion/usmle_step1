  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Physicians have an ethical responsibility to protect patient confidentiality, including during interactions with other healthcare team members in public places and non-medical settings. In situations where discussion of patient's healthcare information may be overheard, it is prudent to avoid discussing any information regarding potential patients. Physicians should maintain strict standards of confidentiality in any public setting, including in the presence of other health care professionals not involved in the patient's care.\n\nIn this case, although the medical student has not used the patient's name, the room number can easily be connected to the patient by anyone who may overhear, thereby violating the patient's privacy under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The most advisable course of action is to defer the conversation to a more appropriate and private setting outside the elevator.\n\n(Choice A) Although this statement is correct, publicly admonishing the student is not the best approach.\n\n(Choices B, C, E, and F) These responses violate patient privacy as they acknowledge that the patient received a CT scan. Disclosing information about a patient's hospital course in a public setting, even if the patient's name is not discussed, is inappropriate.\n\nEducational objective:\nPhysicians must be cautious about discussing protected patient health information in public places, including public settings within the hospital, even with other medical personnel. Conversations regarding patients should be deferred to a later time when a more private setting can be arranged.",
    "zh": "医生有保护患者机密信息的伦理责任，包括在公共场所和非医疗环境中与其他医疗团队成员互动时。在可能被他人听到患者医疗信息讨论的情况下，谨慎的做法是避免讨论任何有关潜在患者的信息。医生应在任何公共场合保持严格的保密标准，包括在没有参与患者护理的其他医疗保健专业人员在场时。\n\n在这种情况下，尽管医学生没有使用患者的姓名，但房间号很容易被任何可能听到的人与患者联系起来，从而违反了《健康保险流通与责任法案》(HIPAA)下的患者隐私。最明智的做法是将谈话推迟到电梯外的更合适和更私密的环境中。\n\n（选项 A）虽然此陈述是正确的，但在公共场合训斥学生不是最好的方法。\n\n（选项 B、C、E 和 F）这些回应违反了患者隐私，因为它们承认患者接受了 CT 扫描。在公共场合披露有关患者住院过程的信息，即使没有讨论患者的姓名，也是不合适的。\n\n教育目标：\n医生必须谨慎讨论公共场所（包括医院内的公共场所）中受保护的患者健康信息，即使与其他医务人员也是如此。有关患者的对话应推迟到稍后安排更私密的环境时进行。"
