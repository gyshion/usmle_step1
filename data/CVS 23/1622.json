    "en": "A 48-year-old man with diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus is being evaluated for occasional retrosternal chest pain. He has no history of hypertension, and his blood pressure measurements during office visits were always within normal limits. There is no family history of cardiovascular disease. The patient undergoes exercise treadmill stress testing. He walks for 7 minutes on the treadmill and stops due to fatigue but does not experience chest pain. His ECG does not show any abnormal changes. Heart rate ranges from 70/min at rest to 132/min at peak and mean blood pressure ranges from 95 mm Hg at rest to 112 mm Hg at peak. Which of the following parameters was most likely decreased during peak stress compared to the resting state in this patient?",

    "en": "Exercise is associated with several hemodynamic and vasoregulatory adjustments to provide maximal blood flow to the active muscles. Stimulation of mechano- and chemoreceptors in the exercising muscle causes sympathetic activation and withdrawal of vagal tone, resulting in increased heart rate (HR), stroke volume, and overall cardiac output {{exhibit_1}}. At higher levels of exercise, HR is predominantly responsible for most of the increase in CO. Sympathetic discharge causes contraction of the arterioles in all tissues except the actively working muscles, effectively shunting blood toward the exercising muscle. This also results in an increase in systemic systolic blood pressure. However, the rise in the mean arterial pressure is much lower due to an overall decrease in systemic vascular resistance. This occurs due to the substantial arteriolar vasodilation in active skeletal muscles, which is mediated by local release of adenosine, potassium ions, ATP, CO₂, and lactate.\n\n(Choice B) Left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume and pressure both rise during exercise due to an increase in LV filling (increased venous return) by peripheral vasoconstriction and the pumping actions of actively contracting muscles.\n\n(Choice C) Pulmonary artery systolic pressure typically rises during exercise; however, similar to systemic circulation, the rise in pulmonary pressure is much smaller than the increase in blood flow across the pulmonary circulation due to a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance.\n\nEducational objective:\nExercising muscles can receive up to 85% of the total cardiac output during periods of strenuous activity. Although sympathetic discharge during exercise causes increased cardiac output and splanchnic vasoconstriction, there is only a modest increase in mean blood pressure as vasodilation within active skeletal muscles significantly decreases the total systemic vascular resistance.",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cardiovascular physiology during exercise, specifically the changes in cardiac output, blood pressure, and systemic vascular resistance. It requires understanding the balance between sympathetic activation and local vasodilation in exercising muscles.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that while cardiac output and blood pressure increase during exercise, the vasodilation in active muscles leads to a significant decrease in total systemic vascular resistance, which offsets the vasoconstriction in other areas.",
