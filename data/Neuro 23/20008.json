    "en": "A 64-year-old woman is evaluated for episodic urinary incontinence. Urodynamic studies reveal an overactive bladder. Symptoms persist after behavioral interventions, and the patient is unable to tolerate medical treatment. Low-amplitude electrical stimulation therapy that helps modulate neural control of the urinary bladder muscle, urethral sphincter, and pelvic muscles is planned. A stimulating electrode is most likely to be placed close to which of the following structures during this procedure?",

    "en": "This patient has urge incontinence due to an overactive bladder. In patients unresponsive to behavioral therapy and unable to take medications, a bladder stimulator is sometimes used. Neural stimulation is used to augment neural signals to the pelvic floor muscles and urinary sphincter, which are innervated from nerves derived from the S2-S4 nerve roots {{exhibit_1}}:\n\n*   **Somatic innervation of the pelvic floor muscles** helps to maintain continence because these muscles stabilize the urethra against the anterior vaginal wall. This contraction decreases the angle between the bladder neck and the urethra (ie, urethrovesical angle), thereby compressing the urethra, stopping urine flow, and maintaining continence. Therefore, increasing the strength of the pelvic floor muscles (either through physical therapy or neuromodulatory stimulation) promotes continence.\n*   The **external urethral sphincter (EUS)** is also under somatic control via the **pudendal nerve** (S2-S4); therefore, stimulation of these nerve roots will also increase EUS tone to help improve urinary continence.\n\nAlthough the pelvic splanchnic nerves, derived from S2-S4, are classically described as providing parasympathetic input to the bladder and urethral sphincter (which promotes bladder contraction and may worsen incontinence), they are also involved in the bladder stretch-contraction reflex. Neural stimulation seems to inhibit this reflex to improve continence.\n\n(Choice A) The nucleus accumbens is part of the basal ganglia that mediates reward and pleasure. Transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting this area has been used to treat addiction, but it plays no role in urinary continence.\n\n(Choice B) Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus has been used to treat the rigidity of Parkinson disease, but it is not involved in urinary continence.\n\n(Choice C) The vagus nerve (CN X) is involved in regulating the gastrointestinal system (eg, parasympathetic innervation stimulates gastric muscle contraction and intestinal motility); stimulation is occasionally used to improve gastric motility. However, the vagus nerve does not play a role in micturition or urinary continence.\n\n(Choice D) The T6 nerve root contributes to the greater splanchnic nerve (T5-T10), which provides sympathetic innervation to the foregut to slow peristalsis. However, sympathetic stimulation of the bladder, which inhibits detrusor contraction, originates lower, from about T10-L2.\n\n(Choice E) The L5 nerve root contributes somatic innervation to many muscles of the lower limb (eg, gluteal muscles, tibialis muscles, extensor hallucis longus) but does not innervate the pelvic floor, bladder, or urethral sphincters.\n\nEducational objective:\nUrge incontinence can be treated with neuromodulation toward the S2-S4 nerve roots, which improves pelvic floor muscle strength and contraction of the external urethral sphincter; it may also impact the bladder stretch-contraction reflex.",
    "zh": "该患者由于膀胱过度活动而出现急迫性尿失禁。对于对行为疗法无反应且无法服用药物的患者，有时会使用膀胱刺激器。神经刺激用于增强盆底肌肉和尿道括约肌的神经信号，这些肌肉由源自S2-S4神经根的神经支配 {{exhibit_1}}：\n\n*   **盆底肌肉的躯体神经支配**有助于维持尿失禁，因为这些肌肉稳定了尿道对抗阴道前壁。这种收缩减少了膀胱颈和尿道之间的角度（即，膀胱尿道角），从而压迫尿道，阻止尿液流动，并维持尿禁。因此，增加盆底肌肉的力量（通过物理治疗或神经调节刺激）可促进尿禁。\n*   **尿道外括约肌（EUS）**也受**阴部神经**（S2-S4）的躯体控制；因此，刺激这些神经根也会增加EUS张力，以帮助改善尿禁。\n\n尽管源自S2-S4的盆腔内脏神经，传统上被描述为向膀胱和尿道括约肌提供副交感神经输入（促进膀胱收缩并可能加重尿失禁），但它们也参与膀胱伸展-收缩反射。神经刺激似乎可以抑制这种反射，从而改善尿禁。\n\n（选项A）伏隔核是调节奖赏和愉悦的基底神经节的一部分。靶向该区域的经颅磁刺激已用于治疗成瘾，但它在尿禁中不起作用。\n\n（选项B）丘脑底核的脑深部刺激已用于治疗帕金森病的僵硬，但它与尿禁无关。\n\n（选项C）迷走神经（CN X）参与调节胃肠系统（例如，副交感神经支配刺激胃肌肉收缩和肠蠕动）；刺激偶尔用于改善胃动力。然而，迷走神经在排尿或尿禁中不起作用。\n\n（选项D）T6神经根有助于构成大的内脏神经（T5-T10），该神经为前肠提供交感神经支配，以减缓蠕动。然而，膀胱的交感神经刺激，抑制逼尿肌收缩，起源于更低的位置，大约T10-L2。\n\n（选项E）L5神经根为下肢的许多肌肉提供躯体神经支配（例如，臀肌、胫骨前肌、拇长伸肌），但没有支配盆底、膀胱或尿道括约肌。\n\n教学目标：\n急迫性尿失禁可以通过针对S2-S4神经根的神经调节来治疗，这可以改善盆底肌肉的力量和尿道外括约肌的收缩；它也可能影响膀胱伸展-收缩反射。"

It also assesses understanding of neuromodulation techniques for treating urge incontinence.\n\nThe best approach is to recall the innervation of the pelvic floor and urinary sphincter. The S2-S4 nerve roots provide somatic innervation to these structures, making them the target for electrical stimulation to improve continence.
