    "en": "This patient with respiratory distress, wheezing, and erythematous skin rash following food exposure likely has anaphylaxis; her severe hypotension and tachycardia indicate anaphylactic shock. The primary disturbance in distributive shock (eg, septic shock, anaphylactic shock) is profound peripheral vasodilation which, in anaphylactic shock, results from widespread IgE-mediated release of inflammatory mediators (eg, histamine). This has the following effects:\n\n-Arteriolar vasodilation causes decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and consequent hypotension.\n-Venular vasodilation causes decreased central venous pressure (CVP) and reduces venous return to the right atrium (Choice D).\n-The vasculature becomes leaky, resulting in loss of intravascular volume that further contributes to both hypotension and decreased CVP.\n\nWith reduced venous return to the right atrium, there is reduced right ventricular output and reduced blood delivery to the left atrium and left ventricle. This leads to decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), a reflection of left atrial pressure. Despite the reduced left ventricular preload, cardiac output is commonly normal or increased in early distributive shock due to both the large decrease in SVR and a baroreceptor reflex-mediated increase in heart rate (ie, tachycardia). The increased cardiac output leads to increased mixed venous oxygen saturation due to rapid blood transit through the peripheral capillaries and incomplete oxygen uptake by the tissues.\n\n(Choice B) Hypovolemic shock involves massive intravascular volume depletion, leading to decreased CVP and PCWP. SVR is reflexively increased in response to reduced cardiac output and hypotension.\n\n(Choice C) Obstructive shock most commonly involves an obstruction to blood flow between the right atrium and the pulmonary capillaries (eg, pulmonary embolism). CVP is increased, PCWP is decreased, and there is a reflexive increase in SVR.\n\n(Choice E) Cardiogenic shock results from left ventricular failure. PCWP and CVP are increased due to backward transmission of increased pressure, and there is a reflexive increase in SVR.\n\nEducational objective:\nAnaphylaxis can cause distributive shock due to widespread release of inflammatory mediators (eg, histamine) that leads to massive peripheral vasodilation. Arteriolar vasodilation decreases systemic vascular resistance to cause hypotension, and venular vasodilation decreases central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Cardiac output is often increased in early distributive shock due to reduced SVR and a baroreceptor reflex-mediated increase in heart rate. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者在进食后出现呼吸窘迫、喘息和红斑性皮疹，可能患有过敏反应；她的严重低血压和心动过速表明发生过敏性休克。分布性休克（例如，感染性休克、过敏性休克）的主要障碍是严重的周围血管舒张，在过敏性休克中，这是由 IgE 介导的炎症介质（例如，组胺）的广泛释放引起的。这具有以下影响：\n\n- 小动脉血管舒张导致全身血管阻力 (SVR) 降低，进而导致低血压。\n- 静脉血管舒张导致中心静脉压 (CVP) 降低，并减少静脉回流至右心房（选项 D）。\n- 脉管系统变得渗漏，导致血管内容量减少，这进一步导致低血压和 CVP 降低。\n\n由于回流到右心房的静脉血减少，右心室输出量减少，输送到左心房和左心室的血量减少。这导致肺毛细血管楔压 (PCWP) 降低，反映左心房压力。尽管左心室前负荷降低，但在早期分布性休克中，由于 SVR 大幅降低以及压力感受器反射介导的心率增加（即，心动过速），心输出量通常是正常或增加的。心输出量增加导致混合静脉血氧饱和度增加，这是由于血液通过周围毛细血管的快速转运以及组织对氧气的摄取不完全。\n\n（选项 B）低血容量性休克涉及大量的血管内容量减少，导致 CVP 和 PCWP 降低。SVR 响应心输出量减少和低血压而反射性增加。\n\n（选项 C）阻塞性休克最常见的情况是右心房和肺毛细血管之间的血流受阻（例如，肺栓塞）。CVP 升高，PCWP 降低，并且 SVR 出现反射性升高。\n\n（选项 E）心源性休克是由左心室衰竭引起的。由于压力的逆向传递，PCWP 和 CVP 升高，并且 SVR 出现反射性升高。\n\n教育目标：\n过敏反应可因炎症介质（例如，组胺）的广泛释放而引起分布性休克，导致大规模的周围血管舒张。小动脉血管舒张降低全身血管阻力，从而引起低血压，静脉血管舒张降低中心静脉压和肺毛细血管楔压。由于 SVR 降低以及压力感受器反射介导的心率增加，心输出量在早期分布性休克中通常会增加。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hemodynamic changes in different types of shock, specifically distributive shock (anaphylactic shock). It requires understanding the effects of vasodilation on central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and systemic vascular resistance.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the signs of anaphylaxis (respiratory distress, wheezing, rash, hypotension, tachycardia). Recall that anaphylaxis causes peripheral vasodilation, leading to decreased systemic vascular resistance, decreased central venous pressure, and decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.",
