    "en": "A 54-year-old man comes to the office due to daytime sleepiness and lack of energy. The symptoms began 6 months ago and have progressively worsened so that he feels \"completely drained\" by the end of the day. The patient's wife mentions that he snores loudly. His past medical history is unremarkable, although he has not seen a physician in over 10 years. The patient does not use tobacco or alcohol, and he works in the warehouse of an agricultural supply company. BMI is 34 kg/m². Physical examination shows a narrow oropharynx and a large neck circumference. The patient is at increased risk of developing which of the following?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient (eg, thick neck, narrow airway) most likely has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is characterized by recurrent obstruction of the upper airway during sleep; each nocturnal episode of reduced ventilation causes transient hypercapnia and hypoxemia. These blood gas derangements result in reflexive systemic and pulmonary vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, abnormal venous return and cardiac output, and sympathetic cardiac stimulation. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nProlonged, untreated OSA can cause pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. Most patients with OSA will develop systemic hypertension due to chronic sympathetic stimulation and elevated plasma norepinephrine levels. Patients also lose the normal diurnal variation in blood pressure. Other cardiovascular complications of OSA include atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, and increased risk of sudden cardiac death.\n\n(Choice A) Acquired bronchiectasis may be seen in patients with recurrent infection, impaired drainage (eg, cystic fibrosis), airway obstruction (eg, foreign body aspiration), or inadequate host defense (eg, hypogammaglobulinemia).\n\n(Choice B) Systemic hypertension, as seen in OSA, can lead to mild-to-moderate left ventricular hypertrophy and impaired systolic and diastolic function. In contrast, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an autosomal dominant disease of the cardiac sarcomere characterized by severe myocardial hypertrophy. It is not associated with hypertension or OSA.\n\n(Choice C) Laryngeal carcinoma is associated with cigarette smoking and heavy alcohol use.\n\n(Choice D) Like OSA, narcolepsy can also cause daytime drowsiness. However, narcolepsy is also associated with cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone), sleep attacks, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. OSA is not a risk factor for narcolepsy.\n\nEducational objective:\nObstructive sleep apnea presents in obese individuals with excessive daytime sleepiness and signs of nocturnal upper airway obstruction (eg, snoring, gasping). The condition is associated with systemic hypertension. Prolonged, untreated obstructive sleep apnea can also cause pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure.",
    "zh": "该患者（如颈部粗短，气道狭窄）最有可能患有阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停（OSA）。OSA的特征是在睡眠期间反复出现上气道阻塞；每次夜间通气减少发作均可引起短暂的高碳酸血症和低氧血症。这些血气紊乱导致反射性全身性和肺血管收缩、内皮功能障碍、静脉回流和心输出量异常以及交感神经心脏刺激。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n长期未经治疗的OSA可引起肺动脉高压和右心衰竭。大多数OSA患者会因慢性交感神经刺激和血浆去甲肾上腺素水平升高而发生全身性高血压。患者也会失去血压的正常昼夜变化。OSA的其他心血管并发症包括房颤和其他心律失常、冠心病和心脏性猝死的风险增加。\n\n（选项A）获得性支气管扩张可能见于反复感染、引流受损（如囊性纤维化）、气道阻塞（如异物吸入）或宿主防御功能不全（如低丙种球蛋白血症）的患者。\n\n（选项B）OSA中所见的全身性高血压可导致轻至中度左心室肥大以及收缩和舒张功能受损。相反，肥厚型心肌病是一种心脏肌节的常染色体显性遗传病，其特征是严重的心肌肥厚。它与高血压或OSA无关。\n\n（选项C）喉癌与吸烟和大量饮酒有关。\n\n（选项D）与OSA一样，发作性睡病也会引起白天嗜睡。然而，发作性睡病也与猝倒（肌张力突然丧失）、睡眠发作、睡眠麻痹和幻觉有关。OSA不是发作性睡病的危险因素。\n\n教育目标：\n阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停在肥胖个体中表现为白天过度嗜睡和夜间上气道阻塞的迹象（如打鼾、喘息）。这种情况与全身性高血压有关。长期未经治疗的阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停也可引起肺动脉高压和右心衰竭。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the complications of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), specifically pulmonary hypertension. OSA leads to chronic hypoxemia and hypercapnia, resulting in pulmonary vasoconstriction and, over time, pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the risk factors for OSA (obesity, snoring, daytime sleepiness, large neck circumference, narrow oropharynx) and then recall the long-term complications of untreated OSA.",
