    "en": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents after he develops acute abdominal pain and vomiting. Examination shows diffuse tenderness to palpation, and abdominal imaging reveals a foreign body lodged within the intestine, causing a small bowel obstruction. Laparotomy is performed to remove the foreign body; during the procedure, an incidental cyst is discovered. The cyst is connected by a fibrous band to the ileum and the umbilicus. The embryologic defect underlying the formation of this patient's cyst is also associated with which of the following?",

    "en": "{{exhibit_1}}\nThis patient has an abnormal fibrous connection between the ileum and the umbilicus, a finding that represents the incomplete obliteration of the vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct. Normally, the vitelline duct connects the midgut lumen with the yolk sac cavity in early fetal development and obliterates in the first trimester. In this case, the incidental cyst within this embryologic remnant is consistent with a vitelline duct cyst.\n\nIncomplete obliteration can result in a spectrum of anomalies:\n\n*   Persistent vitelline duct is due to the complete failure of duct closure and results in a patent connection between the intestinal lumen and the umbilicus. This causes meconium discharge from the umbilicus after birth.\n*   Meckel diverticulum, the most common vitelline duct anomaly, results from partial closure of the vitelline duct, with the patent portion attached to the ileum. A fibrous band may connect the tip of the diverticulum with the umbilicus. Patients classically have painless hematochezia due to intestinal ulceration from heterotopic gastric mucosa contained within the diverticulum.\n*   Vitelline sinus results from partial closure of the vitelline duct, with the patent portion at the umbilicus; serous umbilical drainage may occur.\n*   Vitelline duct cyst, as seen in this patient, forms when peripheral portions of the duct obliterate but the central part remains. Patients are usually asymptomatic.\n\n(Choices A, D, and F) Gastroschisis and omphalocele are characterized by the incomplete closure of the abdominal wall, leading to protrusion of abdominal organs. Whereas gastroschisis occurs lateral to the umbilicus and eviscerated bowel is exposed, omphalocele is a midline defect covered within a peritoneal sac. An umbilical hernia, a common midline protrusion, is due to abdominal wall weakness. These defects are not associated with a vitelline cyst.\n\n(Choice B) Malrotation results from failure of the midgut to rotate normally while it returns to the abdominal cavity during early fetal development. Patients have abnormal positioning of the intestine in the abdominal cavity and sometimes twisting of an intestinal loop (volvulus).\n\n(Choice E) A patent urachus results from failure of the allantois (urachus) to obliterate and presents with urine drainage through the umbilicus. This anomaly is associated with a urachal cyst, which is connected by a fibrous band to the bladder (not the ileum) and umbilicus.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct normally obliterates during early embryologic development. Incomplete obliteration can result in a spectrum of anomalies, including vitelline duct cyst (ie, cyst connected by fibrous bands to the ileum and umbilicus) and Meckel diverticulum.",
    "zh": "{{exhibit_1}}\n该患者的回肠和脐部之间存在异常纤维连接，这一发现代表卵黄（脐肠）管的未完全闭锁。正常情况下，卵黄管在胚胎早期发育中连接中肠腔与卵黄囊腔，并在妊娠早期闭锁。在本例中，该胚胎残余中的偶然囊肿与卵黄管囊肿一致。\n\n未完全闭锁可导致一系列异常：\n\n*   持续性卵黄管是由于导管完全闭锁失败，导致肠腔和脐部之间的开放连接。这会导致出生后脐部排出胎便。\n*   Meckel憩室是最常见的卵黄管异常，是由于卵黄管部分闭锁，开放部分附着在回肠上。纤维带可以将憩室尖端与脐部连接。患者通常会出现无痛性便血，原因是憩室内异位胃粘膜引起的肠道溃疡。\n*   卵黄窦是由于卵黄管部分闭锁，脐部开放部分；可能会出现浆液性脐液引流。\n*   如该患者所见，卵黄管囊肿形成于导管外周部分闭锁而中心部分保留时。患者通常无症状。\n\n（选项 A、D 和 F）腹裂和脐膨出的特点是腹壁闭合不全，导致腹部器官突出。腹裂发生在脐部的侧面，肠管外露，而脐膨出是位于腹中线的缺陷，被包裹在腹膜囊中。脐疝是一种常见的中线突出，是由于腹壁薄弱所致。这些缺陷与卵黄囊肿无关。\n\n（选项 B）肠旋转不良是由于中肠在早期胚胎发育过程中返回腹腔时未能正常旋转所致。患者的肠道在腹腔内位置异常，有时肠袢会发生扭转（肠扭转）。\n\n（选项 E）脐尿管未闭是由于尿囊（脐尿管）未能闭锁所致，表现为尿液通过脐部排出。这种异常与脐尿管囊肿有关，该囊肿通过纤维带连接到膀胱（而非回肠）和脐部。\n\n教育目标：\n卵黄（脐肠）管通常在早期胚胎发育过程中闭锁。不完全闭锁可导致一系列异常，包括卵黄管囊肿（即，通过纤维带连接到回肠和脐部的囊肿）和Meckel憩室。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of vitelline duct anomalies, specifically the embryologic origin and clinical presentation of a vitelline duct cyst. It also requires differentiating this condition from other congenital abdominal wall defects and malrotation.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the connection between the ileum, umbilicus, and the cyst, which points to a vitelline duct remnant. Understanding the embryologic development and potential complications of the vitelline duct is crucial for selecting the correct answer.",
