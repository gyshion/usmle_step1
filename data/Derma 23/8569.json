    "en": "This patient has psoriasis, a common skin disorder characterized by activation of T helper cells and proliferation of keratinocytes. Epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis) produces erythematous plaques, and hyperkeratosis and confluent parakeratosis of the stratum corneum produce the characteristic scaling. The epidermal cell layer superficial to the dermal papillae may be thinned and contain dilated blood vessels, which can lead to pinpoint bleeding when the scale is removed (Auspitz sign).\n\nFirst-line treatment options for localized psoriasis include topical corticosteroids (eg, diflorasone) and vitamin D analogs (eg, calcipotriene, calcitriol). Vitamin D analogs activate the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear transcription factor, resulting in inhibition of T-cell and keratinocyte proliferation and stimulation of keratinocyte differentiation. Corticosteroids also have anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties; their mechanism of action is complementary to vitamin D analogs, and the 2 agents work well in combination.\n\n(Choice A) Tyrosinase is the primary enzyme responsible for oxidation of tyrosine, which serves as the rate-limiting step in synthesis of melanin. Tyrosinase inhibitors (eg, hydroquinone) decrease synthesis of melanin and can be used in treatment of hyperpigmentation disorders (eg, melasma).\n\n(Choice B) Acne vulgaris is promoted by proinflammatory fatty acid production by Cutibacterium (Propionibacterium) acnes. Benzoyl peroxide has bacteriostatic properties against C acnes and reduces production of these inflammatory fatty acids.\n\n(Choice C) Cutaneous warts are the most common manifestation of human papillomavirus infection. Imiquimod is a topical immunomodulator that likely induces local cytokine (eg, interferon-alpha, interleukin-6) production against the virus.\n\n(Choice D) Prostaglandin E₂, which is produced by cyclooxygenase-2) is involved in mediating the tumorigenic effects of ultraviolet light in the skin, promoting the formation of actinic keratosis (AK) and squamous cell carcinoma. Topical diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits cyclooxygenase, can be used to treat AK.",
    "zh": "这位患者患有银屑病，这是一种常见的皮肤病，其特征是T辅助细胞活化和角质形成细胞增殖。表皮增生（棘层增生）产生红斑性斑块，角化过度和角质层融合性角化不全产生特征性的鳞屑。真皮乳头表面的表皮细胞层可能变薄并包含扩张的血管，当去除鳞屑时会导致针尖状出血（Auspitz征）。\n\n局部银屑病的一线治疗选择包括局部皮质类固醇（如双氟拉松）和维生素D类似物（如卡泊三醇、骨化三醇）。维生素D类似物激活维生素D受体，这是一种核转录因子，导致抑制T细胞和角质形成细胞增殖，并刺激角质形成细胞分化。皮质类固醇也具有抗炎和抗增殖特性；它们的作用机制是对维生素D类似物的补充，这两种药物联合使用效果很好。\n\n（选项A）酪氨酸酶是负责酪氨酸氧化的主要酶，它作为黑色素合成的限速步骤。酪氨酸酶抑制剂（如氢醌）减少黑色素的合成，可用于治疗色素沉着过度疾病（如黄褐斑）。\n\n（选项B）寻常痤疮是由痤疮丙酸杆菌产生的促炎性脂肪酸引起的。过氧化苯甲酰对痤疮丙酸杆菌具有抑菌特性，可减少这些炎症性脂肪酸的产生。\n\n（选项C）皮肤疣是人乳头瘤病毒感染最常见的表现。咪喹莫特是一种局部免疫调节剂，可能诱导针对该病毒的局部细胞因子（如干扰素-α、白细胞介素-6）的产生。\n\n（选项D）前列腺素E₂，由环氧合酶-2产生，参与介导紫外线在皮肤中的致瘤作用，促进光化性角化病（AK）和鳞状细胞癌的形成。局部双氯芬酸，一种抑制环氧合酶的非甾体类抗炎药，可用于治疗AK。"
