    "en": "A 21-year-old man comes to the office due to recurrent ear drainage. He is accompanied by his girlfriend. He speaks in English. On examination, the patient has purulent otorrhea, a tympanic membrane perforation, and a pearly white mass behind the tympanic membrane consistent with a large cholesteatoma. He is told that he will need an operation on his ear to remove the mass. After listening to an explanation of the procedure and why it should be done, the patient nods briefly but does not ask questions. He is also given information sheets with a written description of the procedure and instructions on how to schedule surgery that he immediately hands to his girlfriend, who begins to read them. Review of the medical records shows he has been to the emergency department several times in the last year with this same concern and has not had a flu shot in the past 5 years.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's cholesteatoma requires surgical intervention; lack of definitive treatment has led to multiple emergency department visits for the same condition. During today's office visit, although the patient seeks medical care, he does not appear to engage with the physician (eg, nods briefly but asks no questions) and does not read the written health information sheets but instead hands them to his companion. This presentation raises suspicion for low literacy, a diminished ability to read and write.\n\nLow Literacy has been shown to correlate with many adverse health outcomes, including increased hospitalizations and emergency care use, decreased adult vaccinations (eg, influenza), poorer self-reported health status, and increased mortality. Low literacy may be difficult to detect because known risk factors (eg, low level of completed education, history of incarceration) may not be present. In addition, adults are often ashamed and may try to conceal low literacy, sometimes with apparent noncompliance or refusal to cooperate.\n\nScreening reading tests (eg, asking the patient to read the information sheet aloud) are typically discouraged because they may induce anxiety and/or shame (Choice C). However, questions such as \"How often do you have other people help you interpret medical documents?\" or \"How confident are you in filling out medical forms?\" may reveal low literacy in a supportive fashion. If a physician suspects that low literacy is contributing to poor patient outcomes, alternative forms of communication such as visual resources (eg, illustrations, videos) should be used.\n\n(Choice A) Although adults with low literacy may require additional educational strategies (eg, visual aids) to gain appropriate understanding before making health care decisions, it should not be assumed that they lack decision-making capacity. This patient is likely a capable adult; therefore, further communication should be directed toward him rather than a family member.\n\n(Choices B and E) Explaining the condition again or verbally reviewing instructions for scheduling the procedure is unlikely to improve the outcome because many individuals with low literacy experience challenges in both written and spoken communication. Using an alternative mode of education that includes visual learning is more likely to improve comprehension.\n\nEducational objective:\nLow literacy can be a significant barrier to appropriate treatment and may be difficult to identify. For patients with suspected low literacy, alternative methods of communication (eg, visual resources) should be used to improve understanding.",
    "zh": "该患者的胆脂瘤需要手术干预；缺乏明确的治疗导致了多次因相同疾病去急诊就诊。在今天的就诊中，尽管患者寻求医疗护理，但他似乎没有与医生互动（例如，简短地点头，但没有提问），也没有阅读书面的健康信息单，而是将其递给了他的同伴。这种表现让人怀疑患者有读写能力低下的问题，即阅读和写作能力下降。\n\n研究表明，低读写能力与许多不良健康结果相关，包括住院和急诊护理的使用增加、成人疫苗接种减少（例如，流感）、自我报告的健康状况较差以及死亡率增加。低读写能力可能难以检测，因为已知的风险因素（例如，完成教育的程度低、监禁史）可能不存在。此外，成年人常常感到羞耻，并可能试图掩盖低读写能力，有时表现为明显的不依从或拒绝合作。\n\n筛选阅读测试（例如，要求患者大声朗读信息单）通常不推荐，因为它们可能会引起焦虑和/或羞耻感（选项C）。然而，诸如“您多久让其他人帮助您解读医疗文件？”或“您对填写医疗表格有多大信心？”之类的问题可能会以支持性的方式揭示低读写能力。如果医生怀疑低读写能力导致患者预后不良，则应使用替代的沟通方式，例如视觉资源（例如，插图、视频）。\n\n（选项A）尽管低读写能力的成年人可能需要额外的教育策略（例如，视觉辅助工具）才能在做出医疗保健决策之前获得适当的理解，但不应假设他们缺乏决策能力。该患者很可能是一名有能力的成年人；因此，进一步的沟通应直接面向他，而不是家庭成员。\n\n（选项B和E）再次解释病情或口头复习预约手术的说明不太可能改善结果，因为许多低读写能力的人在书面和口头交流方面都面临挑战。使用包括视觉学习在内的替代教育模式更有可能提高理解力。\n\n教育目标：\n低读写能力可能是适当治疗的重大障碍，并且可能难以识别。对于怀疑有低读写能力的患者，应使用替代的沟通方法（例如，视觉资源）来提高理解力。"
