    "en": "A 21-year-old man comes to the office due to recent weight loss and fatigue. The patient is a college athlete and states, \"My coach wants me to put on more weight, but I can't seem to do it. It doesn't matter how much I eat, I keep losing weight. I've been really thirsty and drinking lots of water lately too, and it's causing me to use the bathroom frequently during practice. I'm worried that I'm going to get dropped from the team if I don't get myself together.\" He is sexually active and has 1 lifetime partner. The patient's father was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 64.",

    "en": "This patient's polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, and weight loss despite increased food intake are suggestive of TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS. Patients often develop these characteristic symptoms over an acute to subacute time frame and may occasionally present with diabetic ketoacidosis (nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, decreased mental status, fruity odor to breath). Although most patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus are diagnosed before age 10, onset in adolescence and adulthood is not uncommon.\n\nAppropriate initial tests and related diagnostic criteria for diabetes include:\n\n*   Fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL\n*   Hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%\n*   Random (nonfasting) glucose ≥200 mg/dL in a patient with symptoms of hyperglycemia (eg, polyuria, polydipsia)\n*   Oral glucose tolerance test with plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL 2 hours after glucose ingestion (preferred for diagnosis of gestational diabetes)\n\n(Choice A) Colon cancer in a first-degree relative increases an individual's risk for this disease. However, because this patient's father was at an advanced age at diagnosis, the patient's risk is not significantly elevated.\n\n(Choice C) Acute HIV presents as an acute viral syndrome with nonspecific symptoms and signs (eg, weight loss, fatigue). However, polyuria and polydipsia suggest diabetes rather than acute HIV.\n\n(Choice D) It is possible that weight loss and polyuria are due to thyrotoxicosis, but the absence of other symptoms of thyroid disease (eg, palpitations, heat intolerance, excessive sweating) makes this less likely.\n\n(Choice E) Acute cystitis can cause frequent urination but the total urine volume is not increased, and polydipsia and weight loss are more suggestive of diabetes mellitus. Although urinalysis can detect glucosuria, it has low sensitivity for diabetes and should not be used to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n(Choice F) Although surreptitious drug abuse can be considered in patients with weight loss or other unexplained symptoms, a hemoglobin A1c test is more likely to be diagnostic in light of this patient's polyuria and polydipsia.\n\nEducational objective:\nType 1 diabetes mellitus typically presents subacutely with polyuria and polydipsia accompanied by fatigue and weight loss. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a fasting blood glucose or hemoglobin A1c measurement.",
    "zh": "该患者的多尿、烦渴、疲劳和体重减轻，尽管食物摄入增加，提示为1型糖尿病。患者通常会在急性和亚急性时间范围内出现这些特征性症状，有时可能出现糖尿病酮症酸中毒（恶心/呕吐、腹痛、精神状态下降、呼吸有果味气味）。尽管大多数1型糖尿病患者在10岁之前被诊断出来，但在青春期和成年期发病并不少见。\n\n糖尿病的适当初始检查和相关诊断标准包括：\n\n*   空腹血糖≥126 mg/dL\n*   糖化血红蛋白≥6.5%\n*   伴有高血糖症状（例如，多尿、烦渴）的患者的随机（非空腹）血糖≥200 mg/dL\n*   口服葡萄糖耐量试验，葡萄糖摄入后2小时血浆葡萄糖≥200 mg/dL（适用于妊娠糖尿病的诊断）\n\n(选项A) 一级亲属患有结肠癌会增加个体患该疾病的风险。 然而，由于该患者的父亲在诊断时已是高龄，患者的风险并未显着升高。\n\n(选项C) 急性HIV表现为具有非特异性症状和体征的急性病毒综合征（例如，体重减轻、疲劳）。 然而，多尿和烦渴提示糖尿病而非急性HIV。\n\n(选项D) 体重减轻和多尿可能由甲状腺毒症引起，但缺乏其他甲状腺疾病的症状（例如，心悸、不耐热、过度出汗）使得这种可能性降低。\n\n(选项E) 急性膀胱炎可引起尿频，但总尿量并未增加，而烦渴和体重减轻更提示糖尿病。 尽管尿液分析可以检测到糖尿，但它对糖尿病的敏感性较低，不应用于确认诊断。\n\n(选项F) 虽然在体重减轻或其他不明原因症状的患者中可以考虑秘密药物滥用，但考虑到该患者的多尿和烦渴，糖化血红蛋白检测更有可能具有诊断意义。\n\n教育目标：\n1型糖尿病通常以亚急性形式表现，伴有多尿和烦渴，并伴有疲劳和体重减轻。可以通过空腹血糖或糖化血红蛋白测量来确诊。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize the classic symptoms of type 1 diabetes mellitus and select the appropriate diagnostic test. The patient presents with polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, and weight loss, which are highly suggestive of hyperglycemia. \n\nThe best approach is to recognize the constellation of symptoms pointing towards diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c is a reliable test for diagnosing diabetes and assessing long-term glycemic control. Other tests like fasting glucose or random glucose can also be used.",
