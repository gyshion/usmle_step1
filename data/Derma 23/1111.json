    "en": "A 36-year-old man comes to the office due to a 2-month history of a pruritic rash over the elbows and knees. The patient has been using skin emollients, but the lesions have not improved. He also has a prolonged history of episodic abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and voluminous greasy stools. Cardiopulmonary examination is normal. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Skin examination shows a papulovesicular skin rash in groups with erosion and excoriations.",

    "en": "Dermatitis herpetiformis {{exhibit_1}} (DH) is characterized by erythematous pruritic papules, vesicles, and bullae that appear symmetrically on the extensor surfaces (eg, elbows, knees), upper back, and buttocks. Herpetiformis refers to the resemblance of the clustered vesicles to those of herpes simplex. DH is characterized histologically by microabscesses containing fibrin and neutrophils at the dermal papillae tips. The overlying basal cells become vacuolated, and coalescing blisters form at the tips of the involved papillae. Immunofluorescent imaging shows deposition of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}} {{exhibit_10}} {{exhibit_11}}\n\nThe pathogenesis of DH is associated with that of celiac disease. Following absorption of dietary gluten, DH is deaminated by tissue transglutaminase in a process involving formation of covalent crosslinks between the two. Because of this, the subsequent immune response against gliadin also targets tissue transglutaminase, leading to the production of IgA and IgG tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies. In the skin, the IgA antibodies cross-react with epidermal transglutaminase, and the resulting inflammation leads to the characteristic manifestations of DH.\n\nThe majority of patients with DH exhibit the small-bowel histologic findings of celiac disease, which include:\n\n*   Small bowel intraepithelial lymphocytosis\n*   Crypt hyperplasia (elongation)\n*   Progressive villous atrophy (height shrinkage)\n\n(Choice A) Ulcerative colitis is characterized by mucosal inflammation, crypt abscesses (neutrophils in glandular lumen), and ulcerations. Common dermal associations include erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, and psoriasis. The papulovesicular rash seen in this patient is not consistent with any of these entities.\n\n(Choice B) IgG-mediated skin disruption occurs in pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid. These conditions are characterized by large bullae and ulcerations that are not confined to the extensor surfaces. Pemphigus vulgaris may involve the pharynx and esophagus, but neither condition is associated with steatorrhea.\n\n(Choice D) Elevated urinary porphyrin levels (ie, uroporphyrin, heptacarboxyl porphyrin) are seen in porphyria cutanea tarda. This condition is characterized by skin fragility and blistering lesions in sun-exposed areas. Steatorrhea would be unexpected.\n\n(Choice E) Insulin resistance occurs in type 2 diabetes mellitus, which can be associated with acanthosis nigricans and necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. Although celiac disease and DH are associated with other autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes, there is no association with type 2 diabetes.\n\nEducational objective:\nDermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by erythematous pruritic papules, vesicles, and bullae that appear symmetrically on extensor surfaces. It is strongly associated with celiac disease, a disorder characterized histologically by small intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytosis, crypt hyperplasia, and villous atrophy.",
    "zh": "疱疹样皮炎 {{exhibit_1}} (DH) 的特征是红斑性瘙痒性丘疹、水疱和大疱，它们对称地出现在伸展部位（例如，肘部、膝盖）、上背部和臀部。Herpetiformis（疱疹样）指的是簇状水疱类似于单纯疱疹。DH的组织学特征是在真皮乳头尖端有含有纤维蛋白和中性粒细胞的微脓肿。覆盖的基底细胞发生空泡变性，融合的水疱在受累乳头的尖端形成。免疫荧光成像显示IgA在真皮-表皮交界处沉积。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}} {{exhibit_10}} {{exhibit_11}}\n\nDH的发病机制与乳糜泻相关。在摄入膳食麸质后，DH通过组织转谷氨酰胺酶脱氨，该过程涉及两者之间共价交联的形成。因此，随后针对麦醇溶蛋白的免疫反应也会靶向组织转谷氨酰胺酶，从而导致IgA和IgG组织转谷氨酰胺酶自身抗体的产生。在皮肤中，IgA抗体与表皮转谷氨酰胺酶发生交叉反应，由此产生的炎症导致DH的特征性表现。\n\n大多数DH患者表现出乳糜泻的小肠组织学发现，其中包括：\n\n*   小肠上皮内淋巴细胞增多\n*   隐窝增生（延长）\n*   进行性绒毛萎缩（高度收缩）\n\n(选项 A) 溃疡性结肠炎的特征是黏膜炎症、隐窝脓肿（腺腔中的中性粒细胞）和溃疡。常见的皮肤相关疾病包括结节性红斑、坏疽性脓皮病和银屑病。该患者出现的丘疹水疱性皮疹与上述任何一种疾病不符。\n\n(选项 B) IgG介导的皮肤破坏发生在寻常型天疱疮和大疱性类天疱疮中。这些疾病的特征是大疱和溃疡，且不局限于伸展表面。寻常型天疱疮可能涉及咽部和食道，但这两种疾病均与脂肪泻无关。\n\n(选项 D) 尿卟啉水平升高（即，尿卟啉、七羧基卟啉）可见于迟发性皮肤卟啉症。这种情况的特征是皮肤脆弱，并在暴露于阳光的区域出现起泡性病变。脂肪泻是不常见的。\n\n(选项 E) 胰岛素抵抗发生在2型糖尿病中，这可能与黑棘皮病和糖尿病性坏死性脂膜炎有关。虽然乳糜泻和DH与其他自身免疫性疾病（包括1型糖尿病）相关，但与2型糖尿病无关。\n\n教育目的：疱疹样皮炎的特征是红斑性瘙痒性丘疹、水疱和大疱，对称地出现在伸展部位。它与乳糜泻密切相关，乳糜泻是一种组织学特征为小肠上皮内淋巴细胞增多、隐窝增生和绒毛萎缩的疾病。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and its association with celiac disease. It requires recognizing the characteristic skin findings of DH and understanding the underlying pathophysiology related to gluten sensitivity and IgA deposition. \n\nThe best approach is to correlate the patient's skin rash (pruritic papules and vesicles on extensor surfaces) with the gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal discomfort, flatulence, greasy stools). This should lead to considering celiac disease and its cutaneous manifestation, DH, which is associated with increased intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes.",
