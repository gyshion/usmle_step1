  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with dyspnea and dry cough has pulmonary infiltrates and hilar adenopathy; this presentation suggests pulmonary sarcoidosis. The biopsy specimen with multiple, noncaseating granulomas—characterized by a central collection of tightly clustered epithelioid macrophages with abundant pink cytoplasm surrounded by a rim of mononuclear cells—confirms the diagnosis. Multinucleated giant cells, formed by macrophage fusion, are discernable at higher magnification.\n\nSarcoidosis is thought to result from a dysregulated cell-mediated immune response to an unidentified antigen, which causes the formation of granulomas. Cell-mediated immunity is stimulated by production of IL-12 from activated antigen-presenting cells. IL-12 stimulates CD4+ helper T cells to differentiate into the Th1 subtype. Th1 cells then secrete IL-2 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). IL-2 stimulates the autocrine proliferation of Th1 cells and furthers Th1 recruitment. IFN-γ activates macrophages and promotes granuloma formation. Activated macrophages and T cells also produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha, further assisting in leukocyte recruitment and granuloma maintenance.\n\n(Choice B) Th1 cells are central to cell-mediated immunity. However, IL-5 is a product of Th2 cells. Moreover, IL-10 is a cytokine involved in the downregulation of immune responses.\n\n(Choices C, D, and E) Th2 cells are involved in humoral immunity and defense against extracellular parasites. Asthma, a Th2-driven disease, causes dyspnea and cough but is not associated with granuloma formation. Cytokines involved with asthma include IL-4 and IL-5, which are secreted by Th2 cells. IL-4 promotes B-cell class switching to form IgE antibodies; and IL-5 promotes eosinophil production and activation. IL-3 is also involved in asthma (as it promotes survival of mast cells) but mainly supports the growth and differentiation of bone marrow stem cells.\n\nEducational objective:\nSarcoidosis is characterized by noncaseating granulomas due to dysregulated cell-mediated immunity. Activated antigen-presenting cells produce IL-12, which stimulates the differentiation of Th1-type CD4+ cells. Th1 cells produce IL-2 and interferon-γ, which stimulate Th1 cell proliferation and macrophage activation, respectively. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis, specifically the role of Th1 cells and associated cytokines (IL-2, IFN-γ) in granuloma formation. It requires understanding the difference between Th1 and Th2 immune responses.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation suggestive of sarcoidosis (dyspnea, dry cough, pulmonary infiltrates, hilar adenopathy) and the presence of noncaseating granulomas on biopsy. Recall that sarcoidosis is driven by a Th1-mediated immune response, leading to the secretion of IL-2 and IFN-γ, which promote granuloma formation.",
