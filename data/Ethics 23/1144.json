  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with diabetes has suboptimal control of her blood glucose levels as evidenced by her elevated glycosylated hemoglobin level (HbA1c). She may also have limited understanding of her disease and the potential complications of poor glycemic control (believing that she can skip medication when she feels good). Medication nonadherence is more likely to occur when detrimental effects of missed doses are not immediately apparent, as in this situation.\n\nThe best initial approach to medication nonadherence is to acknowledge the difficulty of taking a medication daily. Validating this patient's experience, rather than immediately judging her behavior, is more likely to facilitate an open discussion of her understanding of the illness and the factors contributing to nonadherence. Addressing possible misunderstandings about treatment in a nonjudgmental manner is crucial to promote medication adherence and strengthen the therapeutic alliance.\n\n(Choices A and E) These statements are condescending and judgmental in tone. Physicians should avoid criticizing the patient's behavior or assuming a lack of knowledge.\n\n(Choice B) This statement gives the patient a directive without first exploring her perspective and understanding of the illness. The best initial approach is to engage the patient with a statement that validates her experience and encourages open discussion of her challenges with medication adherence.\n\n(Choice D) It would be inappropriate to initiate a discussion on nonadherence by warning the patient about dangerous complications. Education about the illness and the importance of adherence should be done in a supportive and nonthreatening manner.",
    "zh": "这位糖尿病患者的血糖控制不佳，这从她升高的糖化血红蛋白水平 (HbA1c) 可以看出。她可能对自己的疾病以及血糖控制不佳的潜在并发症的理解也有限（认为当她感觉良好时可以不服药）。当漏服药物的有害影响没有立即显现时，更容易发生未按医嘱服药，就像在这种情况下一样。\n\n处理未按医嘱服药的最佳初始方法是承认每天服药的困难。验证这位患者的经历，而不是立即评判她的行为，更有可能促进对她对疾病的理解以及导致未按医嘱服药的因素的开放讨论。以不带评判的方式解决可能对治疗的误解，对于促进依从性和加强治疗联盟至关重要。\n\n（选项 A 和 E）这些陈述带有居高临下和评判的语气。医生应避免批评患者的行为或假设其缺乏知识。\n\n（选项 B）该陈述在没有首先探讨她的观点和对疾病的理解的情况下，就向患者给出了指示。最佳的初始方法是使用一个陈述来吸引患者，该陈述验证了她的经历，并鼓励就她未按医嘱服药所面临的挑战进行公开讨论。\n\n（选项 D）通过警告患者危险的并发症来开始关于未按医嘱服药的讨论是不合适的。关于疾病和依从性的重要性的教育应该以支持性和非威胁性的方式进行。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to communicate effectively with patients regarding medication adherence, using a patient-centered approach. It emphasizes the importance of empathy and understanding the patient's perspective.\n\nThe best approach is to acknowledge the difficulty of taking medication daily and validate the patient's experience.
