    "en": "A 26-year-old woman is evaluated for increasing discomfort in the right posterior mandible. The patient has no prior medical conditions and takes no medications. Physical examination is unremarkable with the exception of a partially erupted right mandibular third molar tooth. Radiographs reveal impaction of the molar tooth. Surgical tooth extraction under general anesthesia is performed. During the surgery, the inferior alveolar nerve that is close to the tooth is inadvertently injured.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The inferior alveolar nerve is a branch of the mandibular nerve (CN V3). After branching from CN V3, it enters the mandibular foramen to travel within the mandibular canal where it can be vulnerable to iatrogenic injury during dental procedures. From inside the mandibular canal, it gives off small branches to provide sensory innervation to each of the lower teeth.\n\nThe inferior alveolar nerve also gives off the mental nerve, which exits the mandibular canal through the mental foramen. The mental nerve conveys sensory information from the chin and lower lip (both skin and mucosal surfaces). Therefore, iatrogenic injury to the inferior alveolar nerve often results in unilateral numbness of the lower teeth, chin, and lower lip.\n\n(Choice A) General sensation in the anterior tongue is carried by the lingual nerve. It is also a branch of CN V3, but it arises proximal to the inferior alveolar nerve branch. It passes between the medial pterygoid muscle and the ramus of the mandible (not into it), then through the floor of mouth where it crosses (and can be injured in procedures involving) the submandibular gland duct.\n\n(Choices B and E) Both general and taste sensation in the posterior tongue are carried by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX).\n\n(Choice D) Taste sensation in the anterior tongue is mediated by the chorda tympani nerve, a branch of the facial nerve (CN VII) that travels with the lingual nerve.\n\n(Choice F) The masseter muscle is innervated by the masseteric branch of the anterior division of the mandibular nerve (CN V3). This arises from CN V3 proximal to the branching of the inferior alveolar nerve.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe inferior alveolar nerve travels within the mandibular canal to provide sensation to the lower teeth and can be injured during dental procedures. It gives off the mental nerve, which exits through the mental foramen to provide sensation to the chin and lower lip.",
    "zh": "下牙槽神经是下颌神经（CN V3）的分支。下牙槽神经从CN V3分支后，进入下颌孔，在下颌管内走行，在牙科手术中可能易受到医源性损伤。从下颌管内部，它发出小分支，为每个下牙提供感觉神经支配。\n\n下牙槽神经还发出颏神经，颏神经通过颏孔离开下颌管。颏神经传递来自下颌和下唇（皮肤和粘膜表面）的感觉信息。因此，下牙槽神经的医源性损伤通常会导致下牙、下颌和下唇的单侧麻木。\n\n（选项A）舌前部的一般感觉由舌神经传递。它也是CN V3的一个分支，但它起源于下牙槽神经分支的近端。它穿过内侧翼肌和下颌支之间（而不是进入其中），然后穿过口腔底部，在那里穿过（并且可能在涉及）下颌下腺导管的手术中受到损伤。\n\n（选项B和E）舌后部的一般感觉和味觉都由舌咽神经（CN IX）传递。\n\n（选项D）舌前部的味觉由鼓索神经介导，鼓索神经是面神经（CN VII）的一个分支，与舌神经一起走行。\n\n（选项F）咬肌由下颌神经（CN V3）前支的咬肌支支配。这起源于CN V3，靠近下牙槽神经的分支处。\n\n教育目标：\n下牙槽神经在下颌管内走行，为下牙提供感觉，在牙科手术中可能受到损伤。它发出颏神经，颏神经通过颏孔离开，为下颌和下唇提供感觉。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the anatomy and innervation of the face and oral cavity, specifically focusing on the branches of the trigeminal nerve and their sensory distribution. It assesses the ability to correlate iatrogenic injury during dental procedures with specific neurological deficits.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the anatomical course of the inferior alveolar nerve and its branches, particularly the mental nerve. Understanding which structures are innervated by these branches is crucial for predicting the sensory deficits that would result from injury to the inferior alveolar nerve during a surgical procedure.",
