    "en": "A 22-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with fevers and arthralgias. She recently had unprotected sexual intercourse with a new male partner. Her temperature is 38.4 C (101.1 F), blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 16/min. Examination shows several pustules on the dorsal aspects of her forearms. Her right wrist and ankle are tender on palpation. Gram-negative bacteria isolated from this patient's blood produce an enzyme that splits the IgA molecule at the hinge region.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient likely has disseminated gonorrheal infection (triad of arthritis, dermatitis, and tenosynovitis in a sexually active woman) due to _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_. In mucosal regions as well as in secretions, IgA exists in its secretory form, composed of an IgA dimer (joined by a peptide J chain) and a peptide secretory component. IgA antibodies usually bind to pili or other membrane proteins involved in bacterial adherence to mucosa, thus inhibiting mucosal colonization by the microorganism.\n\nCertain bacteria (eg, _N gonorrhoeae_, _N meningitidis_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _Haemophilus influenzae_) produce IgA proteases that cleave IgA at its hinge region (yielding Fab and compromised Fc fragments), thus decreasing its effectiveness. This facilitates bacterial adherence to mucosa (possibly due to easier bacterial access to mucosal surface or immune disguise by binding to released Fab fragments, among others).\n\n(Choice B) IgA is a weak activator of the classic complement pathway. Impairment of complement-mediated cell lysis can be accomplished by staphylococcal protein A, which binds the Fc portion of IgG, preventing complement fixation.\n\n(Choice C) Although IgA Fc-mediated functions such as opsonization are compromised by IgA protease, secretory IgA is a poor opsonin. Impairment of opsonization and phagocytosis is most frequently accomplished by encapsulated bacteria such as _S pneumoniae_, _N meningitidis_, and _H influenzae_.\n\n(Choice D) IgA does not play a role in the induction of memory lymphocytes necessary for mounting a secondary immune response (which requires the formation of memory B and T lymphocytes after initial antigen exposure).\n\n(Choice E) Promotion of intracellular survival is accomplished by inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion or resistance to lysosomal enzymes. These properties are expressed by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, _M leprae_, _Legionella_, and _Ehrlichia_.\n\nEducational objective:\nIgA protease is produced by _Neisseria meningitidis_, _N gonorrhoeae_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and _Haemophilus influenzae_. This enzyme cleaves secretory IgA at its hinge region, rendering it ineffective. Secretory IgA exists on mucosal surfaces and in secretions and acts to bind and inhibit the action of pili as well as other cell surface antigens that normally mediate mucosal adherence and subsequent penetration.",
    "zh": "该患者可能患有播散性淋病奈瑟菌感染（在有性生活的女性中出现关节炎、皮炎和腱鞘炎的三联征），病原体为_淋病奈瑟菌_。在粘膜区域以及分泌物中，IgA以其分泌形式存在，由IgA二聚体（通过肽J链连接）和肽分泌组分组成。IgA抗体通常与参与细菌粘附于粘膜的菌毛或其他膜蛋白结合，从而抑制微生物的粘膜定植。\n\n某些细菌（例如，_淋病奈瑟菌_、_脑膜炎奈瑟菌_、_肺炎链球菌_、_流感嗜血杆菌_）产生IgA蛋白酶，该酶在铰链区裂解IgA（产生Fab片段和受损的Fc片段），从而降低其有效性。这促进了细菌粘附于粘膜（可能由于细菌更容易进入粘膜表面或通过与释放的Fab片段结合而进行免疫伪装等）。\n\n（选项B）IgA是经典补体途径的弱激活剂。补体介导的细胞溶解的损害可以通过葡萄球菌蛋白A来实现，该蛋白A与IgG的Fc部分结合，阻止补体固定。\n\n（选项C）尽管IgA Fc介导的功能（如调理作用）受到IgA蛋白酶的损害，但分泌型IgA是一种较差的调理素。调理作用和吞噬作用的损害最常由荚膜细菌引起，例如_肺炎链球菌_、_脑膜炎奈瑟菌_和_流感嗜血杆菌_。\n\n（选项D）IgA在诱导记忆淋巴细胞（对产生继发免疫反应至关重要，需要在最初的抗原暴露后形成记忆B细胞和T细胞）方面不起作用。\n\n（选项E）促进细胞内存活是通过抑制吞噬体-溶酶体融合或对溶酶体酶的抵抗来实现的。这些特性由_结核分枝杆菌_、_麻风分枝杆菌_、_军团菌_和_埃立克体_表达。\n\n教育目标：\nIgA蛋白酶由_脑膜炎奈瑟菌_、_淋病奈瑟菌_、_肺炎链球菌_和_流感嗜血杆菌_产生。这种酶在其铰链区裂解分泌型IgA，使其无效。分泌型IgA存在于粘膜表面和分泌物中，其作用是结合并抑制菌毛以及其他通常介导粘膜粘附和随后穿透的细胞表面抗原的作用。"

Understanding how bacteria evade the host's immune defenses, such as IgA, is crucial for comprehending infectious disease mechanisms.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of disseminated gonococcal infection and the function of IgA in mucosal immunity.
