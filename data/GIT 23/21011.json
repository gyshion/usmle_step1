    "en": "An 80-year-old man participates in a study designed to evaluate the effects of aging on the liver. He has undergone a liver biopsy every 10 years since age 40 so that researchers can identify age-related histologic changes. The subject is healthy and has no relevant family history. He does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. BMI is 21.5 kg/m². Physical examination is unremarkable; laboratory studies, including complete blood count, liver function tests, cholesterol levels, and hemoglobin A1c, are within normal limits. Which of the following histologic changes has most likely developed over time in this individual?",

    "en": "Several important age-related changes develop in the liver over time. The size of the liver shrinks, associated with a decrease in perfusion. In addition, the regenerative capabilities of the liver slow, increasing susceptibility to toxic and ischemic injury. At the cellular level, the overall number of hepatocytes decreases, and the remaining hepatocytes usually increase in size, associated with polyploidy and enlarged mitochondria. Their ability to clear intracellular debris decreases, allowing a lysosomal degradation product called lipofuscin to accumulate over time; the presence of these yellowish-brown inclusions within hepatocytes is sometimes referred to as brown atrophy. Other cellular changes of aging include a decrease in size and number of fenestrations within endothelial cells, formation of lipid droplets within stellate cells, and decreased phagocytic activity of Kupffer cells. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Senile (eg, age-related) systemic amyloidosis is characterized by transthyretin deposition in the extracellular space. Although amyloidosis can involve the liver, affected patients frequently have hepatomegaly and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels.\n\n(Choice B) Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive iron absorption and hemosiderin deposition in hepatocytes and other tissues. This patient has no family history of hemochromatosis, and abnormalities in liver transaminases (eg, AST, ALT) would be expected.\n\n(Choice C) Mallory-Denk bodies are intracytoplasmic hyaline inclusions found within damaged hepatocytes in the setting of alcoholic hepatitis and other liver diseases (eg, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis). This patient has no medical conditions that predispose to their formation.\n\n(Choice E) Chronic hepatic injury activates stellate cells, leading to collagen production and ultimately cirrhosis. This would not occur in a healthy individual.\n\nEducational objective:\nNormal age-related changes in the liver include decreased size, decreased perfusion, slower regenerative capability, and the development of yellowish-brown lipofuscin inclusions within hepatocytes. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "随着时间的推移，肝脏会发生一些重要的与年龄相关的变化。肝脏体积缩小，伴随着灌注减少。此外，肝脏的再生能力减慢，增加了对毒性和缺血性损伤的易感性。在细胞水平上，肝细胞的总数减少，剩余肝细胞通常会增大，与多倍体和线粒体增大有关。它们清除细胞内碎屑的能力下降，导致称为脂褐素的溶酶体降解产物随着时间的推移而积累；这些黄棕色包涵体在肝细胞内的存在有时被称为棕色萎缩。其他衰老的细胞变化包括内皮细胞内窗孔的大小和数量减少，星形细胞内脂滴的形成以及库普弗细胞的吞噬活性降低。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项A) 老年性（例如，与年龄相关的）全身性淀粉样变性的特征是转甲状腺素在细胞外空间的沉积。虽然淀粉样变性可累及肝脏，但受影响的患者通常有肝肿大和碱性磷酸酶水平升高。\n\n(选项B) 遗传性血色素沉着病是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是铁吸收过多以及肝细胞和其他组织中的含铁血黄素沉积。该患者无血色素沉着病家族史，并且肝转氨酶（例如，AST、ALT）的异常是预期的。\n\n(选项C) Mallory-Denk小体是在酒精性肝炎和其他肝脏疾病（例如，非酒精性脂肪性肝炎）的背景下，在受损肝细胞内发现的胞质内透明变性小体。该患者没有任何容易导致其形成的医学状况。\n\n(选项E) 慢性肝损伤激活星形细胞，导致胶原产生，最终导致肝硬化。这不会发生在健康个体中。\n\n教育目标：\n肝脏的正常年龄相关变化包括体积减小、灌注减少、再生能力减慢以及肝细胞内黄棕色脂褐素包涵体的形成。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of age-related histologic changes in the liver, specifically the accumulation of lipofuscin within hepatocytes, also known as brown atrophy. It also requires differentiating this normal aging process from other pathological conditions affecting the liver. \n\nThe best approach is to recall the common age-related changes in the liver, including decreased size and perfusion, slower regeneration, and lipofuscin accumulation. Eliminate options that represent specific disease states or conditions not typically associated with normal aging.",
