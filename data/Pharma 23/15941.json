    "en": "A clinical trial is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel therapy to treat refractory Crohn disease. The medication is a monoclonal antibody against the α4β7 integrin, which inhibits migration of T-lymphocytes into the intestinal parenchyma and produces a gut-selective anti-inflammatory effect. Patients who have active, moderate to severe Crohn disease and have failed conventional therapy are enrolled in the study. Many of these patients have renal or hepatic dysfunction, and some take other medications that affect cytochrome P450 enzymes. Which of the following is the most appropriate dose adjustment in this patient population to decrease drug toxicity?",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used to treat a growing variety of malignant (eg, leukemia/lymphoma, melanoma) and autoimmune diseases (eg, Crohn disease, rheumatoid arthritis). The therapeutic effect of mAbs is achieved by binding to their target antigen in the plasma or on the cell surface and blocking deleterious receptor interactions or triggering a cytotoxic immune response against abnormal cells.\n\nBecause of their large molecular size, mAbs cannot be administered orally and must be given via intravenous or subcutaneous/intramuscular routes. Unlike most other drugs, mAbs are not eliminated by hepatic or renal clearance, but are instead removed from the body in 2 primary ways:\n\n*   Target-mediated drug clearance: mAbs directed against cell surface antigens undergo internalization (receptor-mediated endocytosis) upon binding to their targets, removing them from the circulation\n*   Nonspecific clearance: Immunoglobulins are constitutively taken up by reticuloendothelial macrophages (via binding to Fc receptors) and vascular endothelial cells (via pinocytosis).\n\nOnce internalized, immunoglobulins are catabolized into amino acids within lysosomes.\n\n(Choices A and C) Many drugs undergo modifications by the cytochrome P450 system and subsequent conjugation reactions within hepatocytes that help facilitate the excretion of the drug into the urine or bile. In contrast, immunoglobulins are not metabolized by these systems, but rather broken down by proteolytic enzymes.\n\n(Choices B and D) Immunoglobulins are too large to undergo substantial filtration at the glomerular basement membrane and are not secreted by the renal tubules. Therefore, renal dysfunction does not significantly affect monoclonal antibody clearance.\n\nEducational objective:\nMonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are not eliminated by hepatic or renal clearance. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary with impaired hepatic/renal function or use of cytochrome P450 inducers or inhibitors.",
    "zh": "单克隆抗体（mAbs）用于治疗多种恶性肿瘤（如白血病/淋巴瘤、黑色素瘤）和自身免疫性疾病（如克罗恩病、类风湿性关节炎）。单克隆抗体的治疗效果是通过结合血浆或细胞表面的靶抗原，阻断有害的受体相互作用或触发针对异常细胞的细胞毒性免疫反应来实现的。\n\n由于其分子量大，单克隆抗体不能口服给药，必须通过静脉或皮下/肌肉注射途径给药。与大多数其他药物不同，单克隆抗体不通过肝或肾清除，而是通过以下两种主要方式从体内清除：\n\n*   靶向介导的药物清除：针对细胞表面抗原的单克隆抗体与靶标结合后，发生内化（受体介导的内吞作用），从而将其从循环中清除\n*   非特异性清除：免疫球蛋白被单核吞噬细胞系统巨噬细胞（通过与Fc受体结合）和血管内皮细胞（通过胞饮作用）持续摄取。\n\n内化后，免疫球蛋白在溶酶体中被分解为氨基酸。\n\n（选项A和C）许多药物通过细胞色素P450系统进行修饰，随后在肝细胞内发生结合反应，这有助于促进药物排泄到尿液或胆汁中。相比之下，免疫球蛋白不被这些系统代谢，而是被蛋白水解酶分解。\n\n（选项B和D）免疫球蛋白太大，无法通过肾小球基底膜进行大量滤过，也不会被肾小管分泌。因此，肾功能障碍不会显著影响单克隆抗体的清除。\n\n教育目标：\n单克隆抗体（mAbs）不通过肝或肾清除。因此，对于肝/肾功能受损或使用细胞色素P450诱导剂或抑制剂的患者，无需调整剂量。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pharmacokinetic properties of monoclonal antibodies, specifically their routes of elimination and the implications for dose adjustments in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction, or those taking interacting medications.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that monoclonal antibodies are large molecules cleared via non-renal and non-hepatic pathways, primarily through target-mediated or non-specific cellular uptake and catabolism, rather than metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes or filtration by the kidneys.",
    "zh": "本题测试对单克隆抗体药代动力学特性的理解，特别是其清除途径，以及对肝功能或肾功能障碍患者或服用相互作用药物的患者的剂量调整的影响。\n\n解决此问题的关键是认识到单克隆抗体是大分子，通过非肾脏和非肝脏途径清除，主要通过靶向介导或非特异性细胞摄取和分解代谢，而不是通过细胞色素P450酶代谢或通过肾脏滤过。"
