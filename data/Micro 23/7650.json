    "en": "A 6-year-old boy is brought to the office due to persistent cough. His symptoms began with a mild, upper respiratory illness 2 weeks ago, but the cough has progressively worsened, and now spells of dry cough are often followed by vomiting. The patient has no chronic medical conditions but has not received childhood vaccinations due to parental beliefs. He recently returned from a summer camp. On physical examination, the patient is afebrile, and lungs are clear to auscultation. Testing of respiratory secretions shows gram-negative coccobacilli.",

    "en": "Pertussis\n\nPathophysiology\n\nBordetella pertussis (gram-negative coccobacilli)\nMajor virulence factors: pertussis toxin (AB toxin), adenylate cyclase toxin, tracheal cytotoxin\nClinical phases\n\nCatarrhal (1-2 weeks): mild cough, rhinitis\nParoxysmal (2-6 weeks): severe coughing spells with inspiratory whoop, posttussive emesis; ± apnea/cyanosis (infants)\nConvalescent (weeks to months): gradual resolution\nTreatment\n\nMacrolides (eg, azithromycin)\nPrevention\n\nAcellular pertussis vaccine\nBordetella pertussis, a small, gram-negative coccobacillus, spreads rapidly via airborne droplets through communities with low rates of tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccination. Infants and children are most susceptible and typically develop a mild cough and rhinorrhea followed by several weeks of severe, paroxysmal cough, often with an inspiratory whoop and posttussive vomiting.\n\nAlthough the bacterium is largely noninvasive, B. pertussis has several virulence factors (eg, pili, filamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin) that allow it to strongly attach to respiratory epithelium. After binding, it then releases inflammatory exotoxins, including:\n\ntracheal cytotoxin, which directly damages and destroys ciliated epithelial cells, leading to a loss of airway clearance, subsequent microaspiration, and the development of the characteristic paroxysmal cough.\npertussis toxin, which is an AB toxin that enters cells and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to alterations in cellular signaling that inhibit phagocyte activity and can cause lymphocytosis.\n(Choice A) Acute bacterial pneumonia (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae) presents with fever and productive cough; it is associated with massive migration of neutrophils from the bloodstream into the alveoli. In contrast, pertussis is associated with reduced neutrophil influx due to elaboration of pertussis toxin and adenylate cyclase toxin.\n\n(Choice B) Endotoxins are found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and can cause septic shock (eg, hypotension, fever) when released into the bloodstream. Pertussis is noninvasive; disease manifestations are mediated by exotoxins, not endotoxins.\n\n(Choice C) Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is marked by interferon-gamma–mediated macrophage activation, which leads to the formation of protective granulomas and the killing of the bacteria. M tuberculosis is an acid-fast bacterium; it is not gram negative.\n\n(Choice D) Measles infection begins in the respiratory epithelium and spreads via the bloodstream to reticuloendothelial cells. Although this unvaccinated patient is at increased risk of infection, the cough in measles is associated with high fever and conjunctivitis and followed by a characteristic erythematous, maculopapular rash.\n\nEducational objective:\nBordetella pertussis, a gram-negative coccobacillus, most commonly infects unvaccinated/undervaccinated infants and children. The bacterium is largely noninvasive and secretes several exotoxins that damage ciliated respiratory epithelium. Symptoms include a mild cough and rhinorrhea followed by severe, paroxysmal cough that may be associated with an inspiratory whoop and vomiting.",
