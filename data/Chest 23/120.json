  "explanation": {
    "en": "Blastomyces dermatitidis, a fungus endemic in the southeastern United States (states east of the Mississippi River), is present in soil and rotten organic matter. Blastomyces is a dimorphic fungus, meaning it assumes different forms at different temperatures. In the human body (37-40 C), it assumes the yeast form (single cells). The image {{exhibit_2}} shows a typical large yeast with a single, broad-based bud. The mold form (branching hyphae) predominates in the environment, at average temperatures of 25-30 C.\n\nInfection occurs by inhalation of aerosolized fungus from the environment. In about half of immunocompetent individuals, blastomycosis may present as a lung infection or cause a flu-like illness (fever, chills, myalgia, headache, nonproductive cough) or pneumonia (fever, cough, pleuritic chest pain). Pulmonary blastomycosis is diagnosed by finding the typical yeast forms. In immunocompromised patients, blastomycosis can cause disseminated disease. Patients experience systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats), lung involvement (cough, dyspnea), skin lesions (papules, pustules, ulcers, verrucous lesions), and bone pain (caused by lytic lesions).\n\n(Choice A) Aspergillus fumigatus can cause lung disease in immunocompromised patients. It has only a mold form; in tissue samples it is seen as septate hyphae that branch at 45-degree angles.\n\n(Choice C) Candida albicans is characterized by small oval yeast with narrow-based budding. Candida pneumonia is a very rare disease.\n\n(Choice D) Coccidioides immitis is also a dimorphic fungus. It is seen as spherules (round encapsulated structures containing many endospores) in tissue samples.\n\n(Choice E) Cryptococcus neoformans causes lung disease and meningitis in immunocompromised patients. In contrast to blastomycosis, it forms round yeast with variable sizes and narrow-based buds. Cryptococcus has a thick polysaccharide capsule that appears clear with India ink staining and stains red with mucicarmine.\n\n(Choice F) Histoplasma capsulatum can cause lung disease. Like Blastomyces, it is a dimorphic fungus. Unlike Blastomyces, the yeast form of Histoplasma is smaller and is often found intracellularly within macrophages. H capsulatum is endemic in parts of the central and eastern United States along the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys.\n\n(Choice G) Rhizopus species can cause lung disease in immunocompromised patients. Rhizopus is the most common genus causing mucormycosis. It has only a mold form, with broad ribbon-like hyphae with rare septations.\n\nEducational objective:\nBlastomyces dermatitidis is a dimorphic fungus seen in tissue as round or oval yeasts with thick walls and broad-based budding. It is endemic in the southeastern United States (states east of the Mississippi River). The lungs are the primary site of involvement, and the skin and bone are the major sites of dissemination. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}",
    "zh": "皮炎芽生菌是一种在美国东南部（密西西比河以东的州）流行的真菌，存在于土壤和腐烂的有机物中。芽生菌是一种二态性真菌，这意味着它在不同的温度下呈现不同的形态。在人体内（37-40°C），它呈现酵母形态（单细胞）。图片 {{exhibit_2}} 显示了一个典型的大的酵母，带有一个单一的、宽基的芽。霉菌形态（分支菌丝）在环境中占主导地位，平均温度为25-30°C。\n\n感染是通过吸入环境中气溶胶化的真菌发生的。在大约一半的免疫功能正常的个体中，芽生菌病可能表现为肺部感染或引起流感样疾病（发烧、寒战、肌痛、头痛、无痰咳嗽）或肺炎（发烧、咳嗽、胸膜炎性胸痛）。肺芽生菌病的诊断是通过找到典型的酵母形态。在免疫功能低下的患者中，芽生菌病可引起播散性疾病。患者会出现全身症状（发烧、体重减轻、盗汗）、肺部受累（咳嗽、呼吸困难）、皮肤损伤（丘疹、脓疱、溃疡、疣状病变）和骨痛（由溶骨性病变引起）。\n\n（选项 A）烟曲霉可引起免疫功能低下患者的肺部疾病。它只有霉菌形态；在组织样本中，它表现为以45度角分支的、有分隔的菌丝。\n\n（选项 C）白色念珠菌的特征是具有窄基出芽的小型卵圆形酵母。念珠菌肺炎是一种非常罕见的疾病。\n\n（选项 D）粗球孢子菌也是一种二态性真菌。在组织样本中，它表现为球形体（含有许多内生孢子的圆形包膜结构）。\n\n（选项 E）新型隐球菌可引起免疫功能低下患者的肺部疾病和脑膜炎。与芽生菌病相比，它形成圆形酵母，大小不一，具有窄基芽。隐球菌具有厚的多糖荚膜，用墨汁染色时呈透明状，用粘液胭脂红染色时呈红色。\n\n（选项 F）荚膜组织胞浆菌可引起肺部疾病。与芽生菌一样，它也是一种二态性真菌。与芽生菌不同的是，组织胞浆菌的酵母形态较小，通常在巨噬细胞内发现。荚膜组织胞浆菌在美国中部和东部的部分地区，沿着俄亥俄河和密西西比河流域流行。\n\n（选项 G）根霉属可引起免疫功能低下患者的肺部疾病。根霉属是引起毛霉病的常见属。它只有霉菌形态，具有宽的带状菌丝，很少有分隔。\n\n教育目标：\n皮炎芽生菌是一种二态性真菌，在组织中表现为具有厚壁和宽基出芽的圆形或卵圆形酵母。它在美国东南部（密西西比河以东的州）流行。肺是主要受累部位，皮肤和骨是主要的播散部位。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of endemic fungal infections, specifically Blastomycosis, including its clinical presentation, diagnostic findings, and geographic distribution. It also requires differentiating Blastomycosis from other fungal infections based on microscopic morphology and patient characteristics.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's symptoms (cough, fatigue, weight loss, lung infiltrate), geographic location (implied by the description), and the microscopic appearance of the sputum sample. Match these findings to the characteristics of common endemic fungi to arrive at the most likely diagnosis.",
