    "en": "A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his mother after she found him violently shaking on the kitchen floor of her home. The patient urinated on himself and bit his tongue during the incident. He has a past medical history of posttraumatic epilepsy and is noncompliant with his antiseizure medications. In the hospital, he has several brief, back-to-back generalized tonic-clonic seizures and never fully regains consciousness between episodes. Intravenous lorazepam 2 mg is administered, and the seizures stop. Intravenous infusion of another drug is started simultaneously to prevent seizure recurrence. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of action of the second drug infused in this patient?",
    "zh": "一名21岁的男子被母亲带到急诊科，此前母亲在家里的厨房地板上发现他剧烈抽搐。患者在事发时尿失禁并咬伤了自己的舌头。他有外伤后癫痫病史，并且不遵守抗癫痫药物治疗。在医院里，他出现了几次短暂的、连续的全身性强直-阵挛性发作，并且在发作之间从未完全恢复意识。静脉注射劳拉西泮2毫克，癫痫停止。同时开始静脉输注另一种药物以防止癫痫复发。以下哪项是该患者输注的第二种药物最可能的作用机制？"

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient presents with status epilepticus, defined as a single seizure lasting >5 minutes or multiple discrete seizures with incomplete recovery of consciousness between episodes. Intravenous lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, is administered first, which potentiates the effects of GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The second drug infused is likely phenytoin (or fosphenytoin), a long-acting anticonvulsant that is administered concurrently to prevent seizure recurrence. Phenytoin's primary mechanism of action is to inhibit neuronal high-frequency firing in the cortex by reducing the ability of SODIUM CHANNELS to recover from INACTIVATION. This action stabilizes neuronal membranes and prevents the spread of seizure activity.\n\n(Choice A) Ethosuximide blocks T-type calcium channels in thalamic neurons and is a first-line treatment for absence seizures, not generalized tonic-clonic seizures or status epilepticus.\n\n(Choices C and D) Benzodiazepines and barbiturates bind to the ligand-gated chloride channel of the GABAₐ receptor, enhancing the inhibitory effect of GABA by increasing postsynaptic chloride influx. While lorazepam acts via this mechanism, the second drug, phenytoin, does not primarily act on GABA receptors.\n\n(Choice E) Vigabatrin is an irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase, the enzyme responsible for GABA catabolism. It is used for treatment-resistant epilepsy but is not typically the second-line agent for status epilepticus after lorazepam.\n\nKey clinical pearls:\n\nSTATUS EPILEPTICUS is a medical emergency requiring prompt treatment.\n\nInitial treatment often involves a benzodiazepine (e.g., lorazepam) followed by a longer-acting anticonvulsant (e.g., phenytoin, fosphenytoin, valproic acid, levetiracetam).\n\nPhenytoin's mechanism involves blocking SODIUM CHANNELS.",
    "zh": "该患者表现为癫痫持续状态，定义为持续时间超过5分钟的单次发作或多次离散发作，且发作之间意识恢复不完全。首先静脉注射劳拉西泮，这是一种苯二氮卓类药物，它增强了GABA的作用，GABA是中枢神经系统中主要的抑制性神经递质。输注的第二种药物很可能是苯妥英钠（或磷苯妥英钠），这是一种长效抗惊厥药，与劳拉西泮同时给药以防止癫痫复发。苯妥英钠的主要作用机制是通过降低钠离子通道从失活状态恢复的能力，来抑制皮质神经元的高频放电。这种作用稳定了神经元膜并阻止了癫痫活动的扩散。\n\n（选项A）乙琥胺阻断丘脑神经元中的T型钙通道，是失神发作的一线治疗药物，而不是全身性强直-阵挛性发作或癫痫持续状态。\n\n（选项C和D）苯二氮卓类药物和巴比妥类药物与GABAₐ受体的配体门控氯离子通道结合，通过增加突触后氯离子内流来增强GABA的抑制作用。虽然劳拉西泮通过这种机制起作用，但第二种药物苯妥英钠主要不作用于GABA受体。\n\n（选项E）氨己烯酸是一种不可逆的GABA转氨酶抑制剂，GABA转氨酶是负责GABA分解代谢的酶。它用于治疗难治性癫痫，但通常不是劳拉西泮后治疗癫痫持续状态的二线药物。\n\n关键临床要点：\n\n癫痫持续状态是一种需要及时治疗的医疗急症。\n\n初始治疗通常包括苯二氮卓类药物（例如，劳拉西泮），随后是长效抗惊厥药（例如，苯妥英钠、磷苯妥英钠、丙戊酸、左乙拉西坦）。\n\n苯妥英钠的作用机制涉及阻断钠离子通道。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of status epilepticus management and the mechanisms of action of common antiepileptic drugs. Specifically, it assesses the knowledge of the second-line treatment for status epilepticus and how it differs from the initial benzodiazepine therapy.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the patient's condition as status epilepticus and recognize that lorazepam is the initial treatment. Then, recall or deduce the likely second drug used in this scenario and its primary mechanism of action, differentiating it from other antiepileptic drug classes.",
    "zh": "此问题考察了对癫痫持续状态的管理以及常见抗癫痫药物的作用机制的理解。具体来说，它评估了对癫痫持续状态的二线治疗的认识，以及它与初始苯二氮卓类药物治疗有何不同。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要确定患者的病情为癫痫持续状态，并认识到劳拉西泮是初始治疗。然后，回想或推断出在这种情况下可能使用的第二种药物及其主要作用机制，将其与其他抗癫痫药物类别区分开来。"
