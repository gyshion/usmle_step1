    "en": "Testosterone stimulates increased protein synthesis by skeletal myocytes. Some competitive athletes and body builders abuse testosterone and other exogenous androgens to increase muscle mass and improve athletic performance. However, excessive androgenic activity can cause significant adverse effects, including acne (increased dermal sebum production) and neuropsychiatric changes (irritability, aggression, and anxiety). \n\nAndrogen abuse can also result in profound endocrine and reproductive effects. Spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules is driven by FSH and requires a high local concentration of testosterone, which is produced by nearby Leydig cells and retained by androgen-binding protein. Exogenous androgens suppress GnRH, LH, and FSH secretion, leading to reduced endogenous testosterone secretion. Impaired spermatogenesis (Choice D) and testicular atrophy.\n\nIn addition, excess testosterone is converted by aromatase to yield high levels of estradiol (Choice F), which can lead to gynecomastia. In adolescent users, high circulating estrogen levels can also cause premature epiphyseal closure and short stature.\n\n(Choices A, B, and C) Excess circulating exogenous androgens (eg. testosterone) suppress pituitary LH release. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nEducational objective:\nAndrogen abuse suppresses GnRH, LH, and FSH secretion, leading to reduced endogenous testosterone secretion, impaired spermatogenesis, and testicular atrophy. In addition, excess testosterone is converted by aromatase to estradiol, which can lead to gynecomastia.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the effects of exogenous androgen use on the endocrine system, specifically the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. It also assesses understanding of the aromatization of testosterone to estrogen and its subsequent effects.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that exogenous testosterone suppresses GnRH, LH, and FSH, leading to decreased endogenous testosterone production and spermatogenesis. Also, understand that excess testosterone can be converted to estrogen, leading to gynecomastia and premature epiphyseal closure.",
