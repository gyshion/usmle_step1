    "en": "This karyotype shows trisomy 21 (47, XY, +21), which is diagnostic for Down syndrome. This condition usually results from meiotic nondisjunction in the ovum, with advanced maternal age (age ≥35) as a risk factor. Prenatal diagnosis is often suspected based on associated ultrasound findings, including a thickened nuchal fold, cardiac septal defects, and/or gastrointestinal abnormalities (eg, duodenal atresia).\n\nDown syndrome is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability. In addition, Down syndrome significantly increases the risk of childhood hematologic malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. The pathogenesis of the increased leukemia risk is uncertain, but may involve increased chromosome 21 gene expression promoting overall genomic instability. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice B) Patients with Fanconi anemia, not Down syndrome, develop bone marrow failure (aplastic anemia) due to an inherited mutation that causes defective DNA repair. Karyotype analysis would be normal in this condition.\n\n(Choice C) Chronic myelogenous leukemia is commonly associated with a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 (ie, Philadelphia chromosome). This translocation fuses the BCR gene on chromosome 22 to the ABL gene on chromosome 9, resulting in formation of the oncogenic BCR-ABL fusion gene. Unlike this case, karyotype analysis would show elongation of chromosome 9 and shortening of chromosome 22.\n\n(Choice D) Turner syndrome (45, XO) and Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) increase the risk of ovarian germ cell tumors and extragonadal germ cell tumors, respectively. This patient's karyotype is inconsistent with these diagnoses, and germ cell tumors are not increased in patients with Down syndrome.\n\n(Choices E and F) Incidence of retinoblastoma, which is associated with a retinoblastoma (RB1) gene mutation, and rhabdomyosarcoma is not increased in patients with Down syndrome.\n\nEducational objective:\nTrisomy 21 (which is diagnostic for Down syndrome) is detectable by cytogenetic karyotype analysis. Patients are at increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
