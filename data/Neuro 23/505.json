    "en": "A 23-year-old, previously healthy man was involved in a motor vehicle collision. He lost consciousness at the scene but recovered by the time emergency medical services arrived. The patient was alert and awake in the ambulance but lost consciousness again soon after arriving at the emergency department. His breath smells of alcohol. Blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, pulse is 68/min, and respirations are 12/min. A bruise is noted over the left temple area. The left pupil is mildly dilated. Brain imaging would most likely reveal blood accumulating between which of the following tissues?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Epidural hematoma is an accumulation of blood between the skull bone and dura mater. Most cases are due to fracture of the pterion region of the skull (often involving the temporal bone with associated scalp contusion) and a subsequent rupture or tear of the middle meningeal artery.\n\nEpidural hematoma characteristically results in TRANSIENT LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS at the time of impact followed by a LUCID PERIOD in which the patient regains consciousness. However, the eventual expansion of the hematoma results in elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and can lead to brain herniation, coma, and death. Signs of ELEVATED ICP include altered mental status, nausea/vomiting, and Cushing reflex (ie, bradycardia, irregular breathing, hypertension). An IPSILATERAL DILATED PUPIL can also occur due to uncal herniation and oculomotor nerve compression.\n\nThe diagnosis is confirmed with a noncontrast CT scan demonstrating a hyperdense, biconvex (lens-shaped) mass between the brain and skull. Epidural hematomas do not cross suture lines due to the tight adherence of the dura to the calvarium at these points. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) The epicranial aponeurosis (galea aponeurotica) and outer periosteum cover the exterior surface of cranial bones. Intracranial hemorrhages are located inside the cranial vault.\n\n(Choice B) Subarachnoid hemorrhage results in blood accumulation between the arachnoid mater and pia mater. It most often occurs due to rupture of berry aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations of the anterior communicating, posterior communicating, or middle cerebral arteries. Patients typically have severe headache and nuchal rigidity.\n\n(Choice D) Subdural hematoma (SDH) is located between the dura mater and arachnoid mater and results from tearing of the bridging cortical veins. It typically presents in older patients with profoundly depressed mental status at onset (acute SDH) or an insidious onset of headache and confusion (chronic SDH)\n\n(Choice E) The pia mater is closely adherent to the brain surface and does not form a space for accumulation of blood.\n\nEducational objective:\nEpidural hematoma is an accumulation of blood between the bone and dura mater. It typically occurs due to a tear of the middle meningeal artery associated with fracture of the pterion region of the skull (often involving the temporal bone). Patients characteristically have transient loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval before increasing intracranial pressure leads to neurologic deterioration.",
    "zh": "硬膜外血肿是颅骨和硬脑膜之间血液的积聚。大多数病例是由于颅骨蝶骨区域骨折（通常涉及颞骨并伴有头皮挫伤）以及随后的脑膜中动脉破裂或撕裂所致。\n\n硬膜外血肿的特征是在撞击时导致短暂的意识丧失，然后是一个清醒期，在此期间患者恢复意识。然而，血肿的最终扩张导致颅内压 (ICP) 升高，并可能导致脑疝、昏迷和死亡。ICP 升高的体征包括精神状态改变、恶心/呕吐和库欣反射（即心动过缓、呼吸不规则、高血压）。由于钩回疝和动眼神经受压，也可能出现同侧瞳孔扩大。\n\n诊断通过非增强 CT 扫描证实，该扫描显示大脑和颅骨之间存在高密度、双凸（透镜状）肿块。由于硬脑膜在此处与颅骨的紧密粘附，硬膜外血肿不会穿过缝合线。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项 A) 颅腱膜（帽状腱膜）和外骨膜覆盖颅骨的外表面。颅内出血位于颅腔内。\n\n(选项 B) 蛛网膜下腔出血导致血液积聚在蛛网膜和软脑膜之间。它最常发生于前交通动脉、后交通动脉或大脑中动脉的浆果动脉瘤或动静脉畸形的破裂。患者通常有严重的头痛和颈项强直。\n\n(选项 D) 硬膜下血肿 (SDH) 位于硬脑膜和蛛网膜之间，由桥静脉撕裂引起。它通常表现为老年患者在发病时精神状态严重抑郁（急性 SDH）或隐匿性头痛和意识模糊（慢性 SDH）\n\n(选项 E) 软脑膜与脑表面紧密粘附，不会形成血液积聚的空间。\n\n教育目标：\n硬膜外血肿是骨骼和硬脑膜之间血液的积聚。它通常是由于与颅骨蝶骨区域骨折（通常涉及颞骨）相关的脑膜中动脉撕裂所致。患者的特征是短暂的意识丧失，然后是清醒期，然后颅内压升高导致神经功能恶化。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of epidural hematoma, including its typical presentation (transient loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval), location (between bone and dura mater), and common cause (middle meningeal artery tear secondary to skull fracture). It also tests the ability to differentiate epidural hematoma from other types of intracranial hemorrhages. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic presentation of epidural hematoma. The lucid interval after initial loss of consciousness is a key clue. Also, consider the location of the hematoma in relation to the meningeal layers and skull.",
