    "en": "A 25-year-old woman with newly diagnosed seizures comes to the emergency department with fever and skin rash. She had her first seizure 6 weeks ago, and an MRI of the brain revealed no structural lesions. She was started on phenytoin 4 weeks ago. Her temperature is 38.9 C (102 F). There is a diffuse confluent erythema involving 60% of the body, palpable generalized lymphadenopathy, and symmetrical facial swelling. The oral mucosa appears normal.",

    "en": "This patient's cutaneous and systemic findings after starting a new medication are suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction, in particular, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. DRESS is a rare and potentially life-threatening drug reaction typically occurring 2-8 weeks after drug exposure. Commonly associated drugs include anticonvulsants (eg, phenytoin, carbamazepine), allopurinol, sulfonamides (eg, sulfasalazine), and antibiotics (eg, minocycline, vancomycin). Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it likely involves impaired drug detoxification along with drug-induced herpesvirus (eg, HHV-6) reactivation followed by T cell-mediated tissue injury.\n\nPatients typically develop fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, facial edema, and diffuse morbilliform skin rash that can progress to a confluent erythema; mucosal involvement is often limited (in contrast with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis). Internal organ involvement is characteristic and can include the liver (elevated transaminases), kidney (acute interstitial nephritis), and lung (cough, dyspnea). Laboratory studies usually show eosinophilia. Clinical findings improve over several weeks following withdrawal of the drug.\n\n(Choice A) Drug-induced antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-associated vasculitis is most commonly linked to medications for hyperthyroidism (eg, propylthiouracil, methimazole) and hydralazine. Patients can develop constitutional symptoms, arthralgias/arthritis, and cutaneous vasculitis.\n\n(Choice B) Blast cells with Auer rods indicate acute myeloid leukemia. Patients typically develop complications of pancytopenia, including fatigue (anemia), fever due to infection (neutropenia), and ecchymosis or epistaxis (thrombocytopenia).\n\n(Choice C) Mixed cryoglobulinemia is a small- to medium-vessel vasculitis caused by circulating immunoglobulin-complexes that precipitate on refrigeration. It is typically associated with chronic inflammatory states (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, hepatitis C) and can present with systemic findings (eg, fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias) and palpable purpura in the lower extremities due to cutaneous vasculitis.\n\n(Choice E) Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia usually presents with anemia and fragmented red blood cells (schistocytes) on the peripheral smear. It has been associated with cancer chemotherapy drugs (eg, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide).",
    "zh": "该患者在开始新药治疗后出现的皮肤和全身表现提示超敏反应，特别是伴嗜酸性粒细胞增多和全身症状的药物反应（DRESS）综合征。DRESS是一种罕见且可能危及生命的药物反应，通常在药物暴露后2-8周发生。常见相关药物包括抗癫痫药（如苯妥英钠、卡马西平）、别嘌呤醇、磺胺类药物（如柳氮磺胺）和抗生素（如米诺环素、万古霉素）。尽管确切机制尚不清楚，但可能涉及药物解毒受损以及药物诱导的疱疹病毒（如HHV-6）再激活，随后是T细胞介导的组织损伤。\n\n患者通常会出现发热、全身淋巴结肿大、面部水肿和弥漫性麻疹样皮疹，可发展为融合性红斑；黏膜受累通常有限（与Stevens-Johnson综合征/中毒性表皮坏死松解症形成对比）。内脏受累具有特征性，可包括肝脏（转氨酶升高）、肾脏（急性间质性肾炎）和肺部（咳嗽、呼吸困难）。实验室检查通常显示嗜酸性粒细胞增多。停药后数周，临床表现有所改善。\n\n（选项A）药物诱导的抗中性粒细胞胞质抗体相关性血管炎最常与甲状腺功能亢进的药物（如丙硫氧嘧啶、甲巯咪唑）和肼屈嗪有关。患者可出现全身症状、关节痛/关节炎和皮肤血管炎。\n\n（选项B）伴Auer小体的原始细胞提示急性髓系白血病。患者通常会发生全血细胞减少的并发症，包括疲劳（贫血）、因感染引起的发热（中性粒细胞减少）以及瘀斑或鼻衄（血小板减少）。\n\n（选项C）混合型冷球蛋白血症是由在冷藏时沉淀的循环免疫球蛋白复合物引起的，是一种中小型血管炎。它通常与慢性炎症状态（如系统性红斑狼疮、丙型肝炎）相关，可表现为全身表现（如疲劳、关节痛、肌痛）和由于皮肤血管炎引起的下肢可触及的紫癜。\n\n（选项E）微血管病性溶血性贫血通常表现为贫血，外周血涂片中出现红细胞碎片（裂红细胞）。它与癌症化疗药物（如顺铂、环磷酰胺）有关。"
