    "en": "This patient has lichen planus (LP), an immune-mediated condition that typically presents with pruritic, pink papules and plaques. LP lesions often have lacy, scaly, white markings (Wickham striae) and can form at sites of minor trauma (Köbner phenomenon). The skin lesions typically occur symmetrically on the flexural surfaces of the wrists and ankles but can also involve the nails, oral mucous membranes, and genitalia.\n\nThe pathologic process in LP is characterized by a (CD8+) T cell-mediated response against cells along the dermal-epidermal junction. Although the etiology is unknown, the risk may be increased in patients with hepatitis C and those taking certain medications (eg, ACE inhibitors, thiazide diuretics). LP typically follows a chronic course with gradual, spontaneous remission within 2 years.\n\n(Choice A) Actinic keratosis presents with small, hyperkeratotic plaques in sun-exposed areas (eg, forehead, cheeks). It is most common in patients age >60, and itching is atypical.\n\n(Choice B) Atopic dermatitis typically occurs in large patches at the flexural surfaces of the extremities, especially the elbows; it usually presents in childhood, and most patients have a history of other atopic disorders (eg, allergic rhinitis, asthma).\n\n(Choice C) Irritant contact dermatitis is due to repeated exposure to irritants (eg, detergents, solvents, oxidizing agents). It presents as hyperkeratotic patches with fissuring and scaling, most commonly on the hands.\n\n(Choice E) Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease that usually presents with thick, erythematous plaques with silvery scales on the extensor surfaces of the knees and elbows, scalp, or neck.\n\nEducational objective:\nLichen planus is an immune-mediated condition that presents with pruritic, pink papules and plaques, often with lacy, scaly, white markings (Wickham striae). The lesions typically occur on the flexural surfaces of the wrists and ankles but can also involve the nails, oral mucous membranes, and genitalia. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有扁平苔藓 (LP)，这是一种免疫介导的疾病，通常表现为瘙痒性、粉红色丘疹和斑块。 LP病变通常具有网状、鳞屑状的白色纹路（Wickham纹）并可在轻微外伤部位形成（Köbner现象）。皮肤损伤通常对称地发生在手腕和脚踝的屈侧表面，但也可能涉及指甲、口腔黏膜和生殖器。\n\nLP的病理过程的特征是（CD8+）T细胞介导的针对真皮-表皮交界处细胞的反应。尽管病因不明，但丙型肝炎患者和服用某些药物（如ACE抑制剂、噻嗪类利尿剂）的患者的风险可能增加。LP通常遵循慢性病程，在2年内逐渐自发缓解。\n\n（选项A）日光性角化病表现为在暴露于阳光的区域（如额头、脸颊）出现小的、角化过度斑块。这在60岁以上的患者中最常见，瘙痒不典型。\n\n（选项B）特应性皮炎通常发生在四肢屈侧表面的大片区域，尤其是肘部；它通常在儿童时期出现，并且大多数患者有其他特应性疾病的病史（例如，过敏性鼻炎、哮喘）。\n\n（选项C）刺激性接触性皮炎是由于反复接触刺激物（例如，洗涤剂、溶剂、氧化剂）引起的。它表现为角化过度斑片，伴有皲裂和脱屑，最常见于手部。\n\n（选项E）银屑病是一种免疫介导的炎症性疾病，通常表现为膝盖和肘部、头皮或颈部的伸侧表面出现厚的、红斑性斑块，带有银色鳞屑。\n\n教育目标：\n扁平苔藓是一种免疫介导的疾病，表现为瘙痒性、粉红色丘疹和斑块，通常具有网状、鳞屑状的白色纹路（Wickham纹）。病变通常发生在手腕和脚踝的屈侧表面，但也可能涉及指甲、口腔黏膜和生殖器。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the clinical presentation and diagnosis of lichen planus, focusing on its characteristic skin findings and distribution. It also requires differentiating lichen planus from other common dermatological conditions with similar presentations.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key features of the rash: pruritic, pink papules and plaques, location on wrists and ankles, and the potential presence of Wickham striae. Rule out other conditions based on their typical presentations and locations.",
