  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's severely depressed mood, low energy, sleep and appetite disturbances, weight loss, SUICIDAL ideation, and auditory hallucinations are consistent with major depressive disorder with psychotic features. First-line treatment of PSYCHOTIC DEPRESSION consists of either the combination of an antidepressant and antipsychotic or ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY (ECT).\n\nECT uses a small electric current to produce a generalized tonic-clonic seizure under anesthesia. Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, ECT is a safe and effective treatment that achieves a more RAPID RESPONSE than pharmacotherapy in severely depressed patients who are suicidal or psychotic.\n\n(Choice A) Antipsychotic therapy is used in the treatment of psychotic disorders and bipolar disorder. Antipsychotics can also be used in combination with antidepressants to treat major depressive disorder with psychotic features, but the response is generally slower compared with ECT.\n\n(Choice C) Lithium is a mood stabilizer used primarily in bipolar disorder.\n\n(Choices D, F, and G) Antidepressants do not work as fast as ECT and may take up to 6 weeks for response. They also must be combined with an antipsychotic medication to effectively treat major depression with psychotic features.\n\n(Choice E) Psychotherapy alone is indicated for milder forms of depression, and this severely depressed patient would have difficulty engaging in conversation. It would not be sufficient due to the severity of depression, presence of psychotic features, and need for rapid response.\n\nEducational objective:\nElectroconvulsive therapy is a first-line treatment for major depressive disorder with psychotic features. It is appropriate for severely depressed patients who require rapid intervention (eg, suicidal).",
    "zh": "该患者的严重抑郁情绪、低能量、睡眠和食欲紊乱、体重减轻、自杀意念和幻听与伴有精神病特征的重度抑郁症相符。精神病性抑郁症的一线治疗包括抗抑郁药和抗精神病药的联合使用或电抽搐疗法（ECT）。\n\nECT使用小的电流在麻醉下产生全身性强直-阵挛性癫痫发作。虽然其确切的作用机制尚不清楚，但ECT是一种安全有效的治疗方法，在有自杀倾向或精神病患者的重度抑郁症患者中，比药物治疗更能实现更快速的反应。\n\n（选项A）抗精神病药物治疗用于治疗精神病性疾病和双相情感障碍。抗精神病药也可与抗抑郁药联合使用治疗伴有精神病特征的重度抑郁症，但与ECT相比，反应通常较慢。\n\n（选项C）锂盐是一种主要用于双相情感障碍的情绪稳定剂。\n\n（选项D、F和G）抗抑郁药的作用不如ECT快，可能需要长达6周的时间才能起效。它们也必须与抗精神病药物联合使用，才能有效治疗伴有精神病特征的重度抑郁症。\n\n（选项E）心理治疗仅适用于轻度抑郁症，而这种重度抑郁症患者将难以参与对话。由于抑郁症的严重程度、精神病特征的存在以及需要快速反应，它是不够的。\n\n教育目标：\n电抽搐疗法是伴有精神病特征的重度抑郁症的一线治疗方法。它适用于需要快速干预的重度抑郁症患者（例如，有自杀倾向）。"
