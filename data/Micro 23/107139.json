    "en": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to a mass under her right arm. She first noticed the mass 3 days ago and it has become progressively more swollen and painful. The patient has also had 5 days of high fever, chills, generalized muscle aches, and severe fatigue. She works for the city sanitation department and mentions there has been a recent surge in the rat population due to reduced frequency of trash removal. Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. Physical examination reveals an enlarged, tender right axillary lymph node that is spontaneously draining purulent fluid. Several lymph nodes in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions are enlarged bilaterally. There are no other wounds or rashes. Blood cultures and an aspirate from a swollen axillary lymph node grow gram-negative bacilli. {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with rapidly progressive systemic symptoms, generalized lymphadenopathy, and an enlarged, painful lymph node likely has bubonic plague, an infection caused by the gram-negative bacillus/coccobacillus Yersinia pestis. This highly virulent pathogen is endemic to areas of North and South America, Asia, Africa, and Russia. It is primarily transmitted by rodent fleas.\n\nManifestations begin with rapidly progressive fever, chills, weakness, and headache. Painful regional lymphadenopathy develops concurrently or within a few days; lymph nodes swell, develop overlying erythema, and often drain purulent fluid (buboes). When left untreated, plague progresses to sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); the disease is sometimes called \"black death\" due to tissue necrosis from DIC.\n\nThe most common first-line treatment for plague is an aminoglycoside. This class of antibiotic prevents bacterial protein synthesis by binding with high affinity to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Aminoglycosides have particular potency against the Enterobacteriaceae family, Francisella tularensis, and Y pestis.\n\n(Choice A) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole blocks bacterial dihydrofolate formation and reduction, which inhibits the generation of purine nucleic acids for DNA synthesis and repair. Although trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be used for plague, it is not a first-line therapy due to overall low efficacy (mortality rate 20-30%).\n\n(Choice C) Penicillin agents inhibit the bacterial enzyme transpeptidase, which catalyzes the final cross-linking step in peptidoglycan elongation. Although penicillin antibiotics are often administered with gentamicin to treat infection with gram-positive organisms (penicillin disrupts the cell wall so gentamicin can enter the cytoplasm), Y pestis is a gram-negative pathogen; therefore, penicillins are not helpful.\n\n(Choice D) Azole antibiotics inhibit the fungal enzyme 14 alpha-demethylase, which helps generate ergosterol. Ergosterol is a crucial component of the cell membrane of yeasts. Bacteria would be unaffected by inhibition of this fungal enzyme.\n\n(Choice E) Vancomycin binds to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of peptidoglycan, which blocks transpeptidase from elongating the peptidoglycan chain. Although vancomycin is sometimes used for streptococcal or staphylococcal adenitis, it has no efficacy against gram-negative pathogens.\n\nEducational objective:\nYersinia pestis, the cause of bubonic plague, is transmitted primarily by rodent fleas. Manifestations include rapid-onset systemic symptoms (eg, high fever, chills, weakness, headache) and painful, purulent regional lymphadenitis. First-line treatment is with aminoglycosides, which block bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit.",
    "zh": "该患者具有快速进展的全身症状、全身淋巴结肿大以及肿大、疼痛的淋巴结，很可能患有腺鼠疫，这是一种由革兰氏阴性杆菌/球杆菌鼠疫耶尔森菌引起的感染。这种高毒力病原体在北美和南美洲、亚洲、非洲和俄罗斯等地区流行。它主要通过啮齿动物的跳蚤传播。\n\n表现始于快速进展的发热、寒战、乏力和头痛。疼痛的局部淋巴结肿大同时发生或在几天内发生；淋巴结肿胀，出现覆盖性红斑，并经常引流脓性液体（疖）。如果不及时治疗，鼠疫会进展为伴有弥散性血管内凝血（DIC）的败血症；由于DIC引起的组织坏死，这种疾病有时被称为“黑死病”。\n\n鼠疫最常见的一线治疗是氨基糖苷类药物。这类抗生素通过与30S核糖体亚基高亲和力结合来阻止细菌蛋白质的合成。氨基糖苷类药物对肠杆菌科、土拉弗朗西斯菌和鼠疫耶尔森菌特别有效。\n\n(选项 A) 甲氧苄啶-磺胺甲恶唑阻断细菌二氢叶酸的形成和还原，从而抑制用于DNA合成和修复的嘌呤核酸的产生。虽然甲氧苄啶-磺胺甲恶唑可用于治疗鼠疫，但由于总体疗效较低（死亡率20-30%），它不是一线治疗。\n\n(选项 C) 青霉素类药物抑制细菌酶转肽酶，该酶催化肽聚糖延长的最终交联步骤。虽然青霉素类抗生素经常与庆大霉素一起使用以治疗革兰氏阳性生物的感染（青霉素破坏细胞壁，使庆大霉素可以进入细胞质），但鼠疫耶尔森菌是一种革兰氏阴性病原体；因此，青霉素无济于事。\n\n(选项 D) 唑类抗生素抑制真菌酶14 α-去甲基化酶，该酶有助于产生麦角固醇。麦角固醇是酵母细胞膜的关键组成部分。细菌不会受到这种真菌酶抑制的影响。\n\n(选项 E) 万古霉素与肽聚糖的D-丙氨酰-D-丙氨酸末端结合，从而阻止转肽酶延长肽聚糖链。虽然万古霉素有时用于链球菌或葡萄球菌性腺炎，但它对革兰氏阴性病原体无效。\n\n教育目标：\n鼠疫耶尔森菌是腺鼠疫的病原体，主要通过啮齿动物的跳蚤传播。表现包括快速发作的全身症状（例如，高烧、寒战、乏力、头痛）和疼痛、脓性局部淋巴结炎。一线治疗是氨基糖苷类药物，它通过与30S核糖体亚基结合来阻断细菌蛋白质的合成。"
