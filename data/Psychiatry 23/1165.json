    "en": "A 27-year-old man leaves the men's room of a bar after smoking an unknown substance. He soon becomes disoriented and belligerent. The man displays uncoordinated, jerky movements of his extremities and assaults a bouncer who tries to calm him. When police and emergency medical services personnel arrive, he fights off 4 officers before being restrained and appears immune to pain. In the emergency department, the patient has visual hallucinations, cannot cooperate with the interview, and alternates between agitation and sedation. He is hypertensive and tachycardic, and examination shows vertical nystagmus. The patient does not cooperate with urine toxicology testing. Several hours later, during questioning by the emergency physician, he does not remember most of the preceding events.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This man likely experienced substance-induced psychosis from phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication. PCP is a hallucinogen that works primarily as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it is theorized that NMDA receptor hypofunction increases the risk of psychosis partially by causing dopamine dysregulation. Other NMDA receptor antagonists include ketamine and dextromethorphan. PCP can also inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin and affect neuronal sigma receptors.\n\nModerate amounts of PCP cause dissociative symptoms. Agitation, hallucinations, and violent behavior can occur with higher doses. Fatalities are often associated not with direct PCP intoxication but with related trauma due to combative behavior. In addition to belligerence, PCP is known to cause loss of coordination, horizontal and vertical nystagmus, and a constellation of cognitive symptoms that includes disorientation, poor judgment, and memory loss.\n\n(Choice A) PCP is not a dopamine receptor antagonist. Dopamine receptor antagonism is the mechanism of action of most antipsychotics.\n\n(Choice B) GABA-A receptor modulation is the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines, a drug class with sedative, antianxiety, and anticonvulsant properties. PCP may have some effect on GABA receptors, but this is not its primary mechanism of action.\n\n(Choice C) Mu-opioid receptors are the primary site for the analgesic effects of opioids.\n\n(Choice E) Serotonin receptor agonism is the mechanism of action of triptans, buspirone (an anxiolytic), and many psychedelic drugs (eg, LSD, psilocybin).\n\nEducational objective:\nPhencyclidine (PCP) is primarily an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, with lesser effects on the reuptake inhibition of biogenic amines and other receptors. It can have dissociative and anesthetic effects but may also cause psychosis and severe agitation, leading to violent trauma. Ataxia, horizontal and vertical nystagmus, and memory loss can also be present.",
    "zh": "该男子可能经历了由苯环利定（PCP）中毒引起的物质诱发的精神病。PCP 是一种主要作为 N-甲基-D-天冬氨酸 (NMDA) 谷氨酸受体拮抗剂的致幻剂。尽管确切的机制尚不清楚，但理论认为 NMDA 受体功能减退部分通过引起多巴胺失调来增加精神病的风险。其他 NMDA 受体拮抗剂包括氯胺酮和右美沙芬。PCP 还可以抑制去甲肾上腺素、多巴胺和血清素的再摄取，并影响神经元 sigma 受体。\n\n中等剂量的 PCP 会引起分离症状。较高剂量可引起激动、幻觉和暴力行为。死亡通常与 PCP 直接中毒无关，而是与由于对抗行为相关的创伤有关。除了好斗之外，已知 PCP 会导致协调能力丧失、水平和垂直眼球震颤以及一系列认知症状，包括定向力障碍、判断力差和记忆力减退。\n\n(选项 A) PCP 不是多巴胺受体拮抗剂。多巴胺受体拮抗是大多数抗精神病药物的作用机制。\n\n(选项 B) GABA-A 受体调节是苯二氮卓类药物的作用机制，该类药物具有镇静、抗焦虑和抗惊厥特性。PCP 可能对 GABA 受体有一定影响，但这不是其主要作用机制。\n\n(选项 C) μ-阿片受体是阿片类药物镇痛作用的主要部位。\n\n(选项 E) 血清素受体激动是曲坦类药物、丁螺环酮（一种抗焦虑药）和许多迷幻药（例如，LSD、裸盖菇素）的作用机制。\n\n教育目标：\n苯环利定 (PCP) 主要是一种 N-甲基-D-天冬氨酸受体拮抗剂，对生物胺和其他受体的再摄取抑制作用较小。它可能具有分离和麻醉作用，但也可能引起精神病和严重激动，导致暴力创伤。也可出现共济失调、水平和垂直眼球震颤以及记忆力减退。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation and primary mechanism of action of phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication. It requires correlating the patient's symptoms, including agitation, hallucinations, uncoordinated movements, and apparent insensitivity to pain, with the known pharmacologic effects of PCP.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key clinical features suggestive of PCP intoxication, such as dissociative symptoms, agitation, hallucinations, and nystagmus. Recall or deduce the primary receptor target of PCP, which is the NMDA receptor, and select the option that reflects this mechanism of action.",
