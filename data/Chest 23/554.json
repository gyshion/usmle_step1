    "en": "A 55-year-old woman comes to the office due to a persistent cough, exertional dyspnea, and recent, unintentional weight loss. She has no chronic medical problems and takes no medication regularly. She has never smoked and has no history of exposure to industrial pollutants. She works as an accountant at a large accounting firm. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion at the left lung base. Imaging studies show an irregular mass in the lower lobe of the left lung and a left pleural effusion. A diagnostic thoracocentesis is performed and the aspirated fluid is sent for cytological evaluation.",

    "en": "This nonsmoking woman with cough and weight loss has a peripheral lung mass with an associated pleural effusion. This presentation is concerning for adenocarcinoma of the lung, the most common lung cancer in the general population, women, and nonsmokers. Although tobacco is the most significant risk factor, the etiology in nonsmokers is thought to be multifactorial. Risk factors include environmental exposures (eg, radon, second-hand smoke) and underlying lung disease. In addition, certain molecular alterations are seen more commonly in nonsmokers; these \"driver mutations\" are thought to be responsible for the development of the malignancy and include epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and ALK gene rearrangements. KRAS mutations, another driver in the formation of adenocarcinoma, are seen more commonly in smokers.\n\nAdenocarcinoma typically presents with cough, weight loss, and hemoptysis. Changes to the distal extremities, including clubbing (increased curvature of the nail plate) and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (proliferation of the bones, skin, and nails of the fingers), may occur and are thought to be due to tumor-derived growth factors. The tumor tends to be located peripherally (as in this patient) and may present as a nodule, mass, or obstructive pneumonia. Like all malignancies, metastatic disease to the pleura can cause pleural effusions. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice B) Bronchial carcinoid is a rare malignancy that tends to be located centrally, within or adjacent to large bronchi. It typically presents with wheezing due to bronchial obstruction and occasionally also causes carcinoid syndrome (ie, episodic diarrhea, flushing, bronchospasm).\n\n(Choice C) Mesothelioma most commonly arises from the mesothelium lining the pleural cavity; tumors are pleural based (ie, pleural mass with associated pleural effusion, pleural thickening), rather than intraparenchymal. In addition, it is extremely rare in nonsmokers with no history of asbestos exposure.\n\n(Choice D) Small cell carcinoma is strongly associated with smoking; only 1% of cases occur in nonsmokers. It arises from the basal cells of the bronchial epithelium and displays some neuroendocrine features. Small cell carcinoma usually occurs in major bronchi.\n\n(Choice E) Squamous cell carcinoma is also strongly associated with smoking. It usually affects larger bronchi (centrally located) and arises from areas of squamous bronchial metaplasia.\n\nEducational objective:\nAdenocarcinoma is the most common primary lung cancer in the general population, women, and nonsmokers. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and ALK gene rearrangements are seen more commonly in nonsmokers and thought to contribute to disease formation in this subgroup. Adenocarcinoma is typically located peripherally and may be associated with clubbing or hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.",
    "zh": "这位不吸烟的女性出现咳嗽和体重减轻，伴有外周肺部肿块和相关胸腔积液。这种表现提示肺腺癌，是普通人群、女性和不吸烟者中最常见的肺癌。虽然烟草是最重要的危险因素，但在不吸烟者中，其病因被认为是多因素的。危险因素包括环境暴露（例如，氡、二手烟）和潜在的肺部疾病。此外，在不吸烟者中，某些分子改变更为常见；这些“驱动突变”被认为是导致恶性肿瘤发生的原因，包括表皮生长因子受体（EGFR）突变和ALK基因重排。KRAS突变是腺癌形成的另一个驱动因素，在吸烟者中更为常见。\n\n腺癌通常表现为咳嗽、体重减轻和咯血。远端肢体发生改变，包括杵状指（指甲板曲率增加）和肥大性骨关节病（手指的骨骼、皮肤和指甲增生），这可能发生并被认为是由肿瘤衍生的生长因子引起的。肿瘤往往位于外周（如本患者），可能表现为结节、肿块或阻塞性肺炎。与所有恶性肿瘤一样，转移到胸膜的疾病可引起胸腔积液。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项B) 支气管类癌是一种罕见的恶性肿瘤，倾向于位于中央，位于或邻近大支气管。它通常表现为由于支气管阻塞引起的喘息，偶尔也会引起类癌综合征（即，阵发性腹泻、潮红、支气管痉挛）。\n\n(选项C) 间皮瘤最常见于胸膜腔内衬的间皮细胞；肿瘤起源于胸膜（即，伴有胸腔积液、胸膜增厚的胸膜肿块），而不是实质内。此外，在不吸烟且无石棉暴露史的人群中极为罕见。\n\n(选项D) 小细胞癌与吸烟密切相关；仅有1%的病例发生在不吸烟者中。它起源于支气管上皮的基底细胞，并显示一些神经内分泌特征。小细胞癌通常发生在主要支气管中。\n\n(选项E) 鳞状细胞癌也与吸烟密切相关。它通常影响较大的支气管（中央位置）并起源于鳞状支气管化生的区域。\n\n教育目标：\n腺癌是普通人群、女性和不吸烟者中最常见的主要肺癌。在不吸烟者中，表皮生长因子受体（EGFR）突变和ALK基因重排更为常见，并且被认为有助于该亚组的疾病形成。腺癌通常位于外周，可能与杵状指或肥大性骨关节病有关。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of lung cancer types, specifically adenocarcinoma, and its prevalence in nonsmoking women. It also assesses understanding of clinical presentation and risk factors associated with different lung cancer types.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's demographics (nonsmoker, female), presenting symptoms (cough, weight loss, dyspnea), and imaging findings (peripheral lung mass with pleural effusion). This clinical picture is most consistent with adenocarcinoma, which is the most common lung cancer in this population.",
