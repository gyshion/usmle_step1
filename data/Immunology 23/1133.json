    "en": "This patient's pruritic skin rash following wilderness exposure is consistent with poison ivy dermatitis, a form of contact dermatitis. Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac all produce urushiol, a small allergenic substance that causes an immune response when attached to proteins (i.e. a hapten). Following contact with these plants, patients develop a highly pruritic, erythematous rash consisting of papules, vesicles, and bullae that may show signs of excoriation. The rash most frequently affects exposed skin (eg, legs, forearms) and often forms linear streaks as the patient walks past the plant, dragging it along the skin.\n\nContact dermatitis is a type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in 2 distinct phases:\n\n1. The sensitization phase leads to the creation of hapten-specific T cells and takes 10-14 days. Cutaneous dendritic cells take up the haptens and express them on MHC-I and MHC-II molecules as hapten-conjugated peptides. These dendritic cells travel to the draining lymph nodes and interact with hapten-sensitive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, causing activation and clonal expansion.\n\n2. The elicitation phase occurs within 2-3 days following re-exposure to the same antigen (or following sensitization after first exposure to a highly antigenic antigen such as urushiol). In this phase, the hapten is taken up by skin cells and causes activation of hapten-sensitized T cells in the dermis and epidermis. This results in an inflammatory response and the clinical manifestations of contact dermatitis.\n\nDepending on the etiologic agent, contact dermatitis can be mediated primarily by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells or CD4+ T-1 cells (that cause indirect damage by activating macrophages). In urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, CD8+ T cells are the primary effector cells and directly destroy keratinocytes expressing haptenated proteins.\n\n(Choices A and C) Mast cells and basophils, along with IgE, are primarily responsible for type I hypersensitivity allergic reactions. Mast cells play a role in modulating the response in contact dermatitis by affecting antigen presentation and T-cell recruitment and activation, but they are not the main effector cells in type IV hypersensitivity.\n\n(Choice B) Eosinophils are cells that play a role in the defense against parasitic organisms and allergic reactions.\n\n(Choice D) Neutrophils are the primary phagocytic killers of the innate immune system and do not play a significant role in type IV hypersensitivity reactions. They are more important in type III hypersensitivity reactions, in which deposited immune complexes activate complement and cause neutrophil-mediated tissue damage.\n\n(Choice E) Plasma cells are the principal cells responsible for the synthesis of immunoglobulins, which are directly responsible for type II and III hypersensitivity reactions.",
    "zh": "该患者在野外接触后出现的瘙痒性皮疹与漆树皮炎（一种接触性皮炎）一致。常春藤、橡树和漆树都产生漆酚，这是一种小的致敏物质，当附着在蛋白质上时（即半抗原）会引起免疫反应。在接触这些植物后，患者会出现高度瘙痒的红斑疹，由丘疹、水疱和大疱组成，可能出现抓痕。皮疹最常影响暴露的皮肤（例如腿、前臂），并且经常形成线状条纹，因为患者走过植物时会将其拖到皮肤上。\n\n接触性皮炎是一种IV型（迟发型）超敏反应，分为两个不同的阶段：\n\n1. 致敏阶段导致产生半抗原特异性T细胞，需要10-14天。皮肤树突状细胞摄取半抗原，并在MHC-I和MHC-II分子上将其作为半抗原结合肽表达。这些树突状细胞迁移到引流淋巴结，并与半抗原敏感的CD4+和CD8+ T细胞相互作用，引起活化和克隆扩增。\n\n2. 激发阶段发生在再次暴露于相同抗原后2-3天内（或在首次暴露于高度抗原性抗原（如漆酚）后致敏后）。在此阶段，皮肤细胞摄取半抗原，并导致真皮和表皮中半抗原敏感的T细胞活化。这导致炎症反应和接触性皮炎的临床表现。\n\n根据病原体，接触性皮炎可主要由细胞毒性CD8+ T细胞或CD4+ T-1细胞介导（通过激活巨噬细胞引起间接损伤）。在漆酚引起的接触性皮炎中，CD8+ T细胞是主要的效应细胞，并直接破坏表达半抗原化蛋白质的角质形成细胞。\n\n（选项A和C）肥大细胞和嗜碱性粒细胞与IgE一起主要负责I型超敏反应。肥大细胞通过影响抗原呈递和T细胞募集和激活，在调节接触性皮炎的反应中发挥作用，但它们不是IV型超敏反应的主要效应细胞。\n\n（选项B）嗜酸性粒细胞是参与防御寄生生物和过敏反应的细胞。\n\n（选项D）中性粒细胞是先天免疫系统的主要吞噬杀伤细胞，在IV型超敏反应中没有显着作用。它们在III型超敏反应中更为重要，其中沉积的免疫复合物激活补体并导致中性粒细胞介导的组织损伤。\n\n（选项E）浆细胞是负责合成免疫球蛋白的主要细胞，免疫球蛋白直接负责II型和III型超敏反应。"
