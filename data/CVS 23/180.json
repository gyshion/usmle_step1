  "explanation": {
    "en": "The morphologic changes described are consistent with normal aging of the heart. Aging is associated with decreased left ventricular chamber size, particularly in the apex-to-base dimension. This decrease in chamber length causes the ventricular septum to acquire a sigmoid shape, with the basilar portion bulging into the left ventricular outflow tract. Atrophy of the myocardium results in increased interstitial connective tissue, often with concomitant extracellular amyloid deposition. Within the cardiomyocytes, there is a progressive accumulation of cytoplasmic granules containing brownish lipofuscin pigment (the result of indigestible byproducts of subcellular membrane lipid oxidation).\n\n(Choice A) Dilated cardiomyopathy causes an increase in the left ventricular chamber size. There is an increased risk of mural thrombi with this condition due to contractile dysfunction.\n\n(Choice B) Chronic hemolytic anemia may result in the formation of hemosiderin granules containing excess iron inside cardiac myocytes (hemosiderosis), which can be visualized with Prussian-blue stain. Excessive deposition of iron within the myocytes usually leads to dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy.\n\n(Choice C) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) causes asymmetric septal hypertrophy with disproportionate thickening of the ventricular septum compared to the left ventricular free wall. Microscopic examination shows extreme myocyte hypertrophy, disorganized myocyte bundles, and myofiber disarray.\n\n(Choice D) Chronic ischemic heart disease tends to result in progressive congestive heart failure and ventricular dilation. Histologically, the major findings are diffuse subendocardial vacuolization and fibrosis.\n\n(Choice E) Long-standing hypertension results in hypertensive heart disease. Although left ventricular chamber size may be reduced in this condition, the major morphologic change is concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.",
    "zh": "所描述的形态学改变与心脏的正常衰老相符。衰老与左心室腔大小减小有关，尤其是在心尖到基底的尺寸上。这种腔长度的减小导致室间隔呈现乙状形，基底部膨胀到左心室流出道。心肌萎缩导致间质结缔组织增加，通常伴有细胞外淀粉样蛋白沉积。在心肌细胞内，存在进行性积累的细胞质颗粒，其中包含棕褐色的脂褐素色素（细胞内膜脂质氧化的不可消化副产物）。\n\n（选项 A）扩张型心肌病导致左心室腔增大。由于收缩功能障碍，这种情况下的壁栓形成的风险增加。\n\n（选项 B）慢性溶血性贫血可能导致心肌细胞内形成含铁血黄素颗粒（血铁沉积症），可以用普鲁士蓝染色可视化。心肌细胞内铁的过度沉积通常导致扩张型或限制型心肌病。\n\n（选项 C）肥厚型心肌病（特发性肥厚性主动脉下狭窄）引起不对称性室间隔肥厚，与左心室游离壁相比，室间隔不成比例地增厚。显微镜检查显示极度的心肌细胞肥大、心肌束紊乱和肌纤维排列紊乱。\n\n（选项 D）慢性缺血性心脏病往往导致进行性充血性心力衰竭和心室扩张。组织学上，主要发现是弥漫性心内膜下空泡变性和纤维化。\n\n（选项 E）长期高血压导致高血压性心脏病。尽管在这种情况下左心室腔大小可能会减小，但主要的形态学改变是同心性左心室肥大。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the normal aging process of the heart, including changes in size, shape, and cellular composition. It requires differentiating these normal changes from pathological conditions affecting the heart.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key findings: decreased left ventricular cavity size, sigmoid-shaped septum, increased collagen, and lipofuscin pigment.
