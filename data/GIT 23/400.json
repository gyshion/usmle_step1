    "en": "A 43-year-old man comes to the office due to yellowing of the skin over the past few weeks. He has had no fever or abdominal pain and has not traveled recently or received blood transfusions. The patient has also experienced increased shortness of breath with exercise over the last several months. He has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. The patient drinks 1 or 2 glasses of wine on social occasions and does not use tobacco or illicit drugs. His father died of liver cirrhosis attributed to heavy alcohol use. On physical examination, expiration is prolonged and there are scattered wheezes bilaterally. Laboratory results show total bilirubin of 4.1 mg/dL and alanine aminotransferase of 90 U/L. Viral hepatitis serology is negative. Chest x-ray shows hyperlucency of the lungs and flattening of the diaphragm {{exhibit_1}}. Abdominal ultrasound reveals increased liver span and echogenicity of the liver parenchyma but no masses. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "zh": "一名43岁的男性因过去几周皮肤发黄就诊。他没有发烧或腹痛，并且最近没有旅行或接受输血。患者在过去几个月里还经历了运动时呼吸急促加重的情况。他没有其他疾病，也没有服用药物。患者在社交场合喝1到2杯葡萄酒，不吸烟也不使用非法药物。他的父亲死于肝硬化，这归因于大量饮酒。体格检查显示呼气延长，双侧有散在的哮鸣音。实验室结果显示总胆红素为4.1 mg/dL，丙氨酸氨基转移酶为90 U/L。病毒性肝炎血清学检测呈阴性。胸部X光片显示肺部透亮度增加和膈肌变平 {{exhibit_1}}。腹部超声显示肝脏大小增加，肝实质回声增强，但无肿块。以下哪项最可能是该患者症状的根本原因？"

    "en": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency\n\nThis patient with signs of liver dysfunction (ie, jaundice, transaminitis) and evidence of emphysema on chest x-ray {{exhibit_2}} (eg, hyperlucency, diaphragmatic flattening) likely has alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a serine protease inhibitor that regulates the activity of a number of tissue-destructive proteases, most importantly neutrophil elastase. Deficiency is inherited in an autosomal codominant fashion.\n\nAATD leads to unchecked elastase activity in the lungs, resulting in alveolar destruction and lung hyperinflation; the panacinar emphysema tends to favor the basilar lung regions and typically develops prior to age 50. In addition, some patients are at risk for developing liver disease due to accumulation of improperly folded alpha-1 antitrypsin proteins in hepatocytes. Liver disease is of greatest concern in the first 2 decades of life, but it can present at any age. Patients can experience hepatomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated transaminases, and eventual cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. Hepatocellular carcinoma may also develop.\n\n(Choice A) Autoimmune injury of intrahepatic bile ducts occurs in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). PBC predominantly affects women and is characterized by positive antimitochondrial antibodies. It is not associated with emphysema.\n\n(Choice B) UDP-glucuronosyltransferase is an enzyme that converts unconjugated bilirubin to its conjugated form, and inherited deficiency can exist in varying degrees. Mild deficiency results in benign elevations in unconjugated bilirubin during periods of stress (ie, Gilbert syndrome), while severe deficiency can be fatal during infancy (ie, Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I).\n\n(Choice C) Defective epithelial chloride transport occurs in cystic fibrosis. Patients typically develop obstructive lung disease in the form of bronchiectasis and can have pancreatic insufficiency leading to malabsorption. Cirrhosis can sometimes occur due to chronic obstruction of the biliary ducts, but almost always develops during childhood.\n\n(Choice D) Defective copper transport resulting in accumulation of intracellular copper occurs in Wilson disease. Patients can develop cirrhosis as well as brain degeneration leading to neurologic (eg, dysarthria, gait abnormalities) and psychiatric (eg, impulsivity) manifestations.\n\n(Choice F) Unregulated gastrointestinal iron absorption occurs in hemochromatosis. Patients can develop cirrhosis due to iron overload. The joints (arthritis), pancreas (diabetes mellitus), and heart (cardiomyopathy) are also commonly affected, but lung involvement is not typical.\n\nEducational objective:\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a serine protease inhibitor that regulates the activity of elastase in the lung. Inherited deficiency of AAT leads to alveolar destruction and panacinar emphysema; in addition, accumulation of improperly folded AAT proteins in hepatocytes can lead to liver dysfunction and cirrhosis in some patients. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), including its presentation with both liver and lung disease, and the underlying pathophysiology of AATD. It also tests the ability to differentiate AATD from other causes of liver and lung disease.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the combination of liver dysfunction (jaundice, elevated transaminases) and lung disease (emphysema) in a relatively young patient. Consider the family history of liver cirrhosis and the chest x-ray findings. This should lead to consideration of AATD as the most likely diagnosis.",
