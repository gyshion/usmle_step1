    "en": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the office due to skin lesions that appeared on his chin 2 days ago. Temperature is 36.1 C (97 F). The patient appears well. Mildly tender perioral papules and pustules are noted on examination, some of which have broken down and are covered with amber-colored crusting. A specimen is collected from the wound. Gram stain shows gram-positive cocci in chains. Cultures are pending. Which of the following symptoms would be most likely to develop as a potential complication of this patient's infection?",

    "en": "This child has impetigo, a superficial bacterial infection that most commonly develops on the face or extremities in children. Patients usually have mildly itchy or painful erythematous papules and pustules that later erupt, forming a honey-colored crusting. The most common pathogen is *Staphylococcus aureus* followed by group A *Streptococcus* (GAS), specifically, *Streptococcus pyogenes*. In this case, microscopy of the patient's exudate shows gram-positive cocci in chains, indicative of streptococcal infection. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nLocalized impetigo is treated with topical antibiotics and most patients have no long-term sequelae. However, a small number of patients with impetigo due to GAS develop poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) several weeks after the initial infection. Kidney damage is caused by immune complex deposition and subsequent complement activation, precipitating an inflammatory response that damages the glomerular basement membrane. Presentations of PSGN range from asymptomatic, microscopic hematuria to overt nephritic syndrome: pyuria and nephritic-range (<3.5 g/day) proteinuria are common. In addition to tea- or cola-colored urine, symptomatic patients can develop periorbital/facial swelling, generalized edema, and hypertension. Laboratory evaluation typically reveals elevated creatinine and decreased C3 levels.\n\n(Choice A) Ascending weakness is a classic feature of Guillain-Barré syndrome, which may be preceded by an upper respiratory or gastrointestinal (eg, *Campylobacter jejuni*) tract infection. GAS infection is not associated with this condition.\n\n(Choice C) Fatigue and a new heart murmur due to carditis can be manifestations of acute rheumatic fever (ARF), a potential poststreptococcal sequela classically associated with GAS pharyngitis. However, ARF is not associated with impetigo in most regions of the world.\n\n(Choice D) Eye redness (due to conjunctivitis or anterior uveitis) and joint pain may be seen in reactive arthritis, which typically occurs following a diarrheal (eg, *Salmonella*) or genitourinary tract (eg, *Chlamydia*) infection, not impetigo.\n\n(Choice E) Unilateral facial drooping due to a peripheral facial nerve palsy is most commonly idiopathic (ie, Bell palsy) or associated with neuroborreliosis or herpes simplex virus infection.",
    "zh": "这个孩子患有脓疱病，这是一种浅表性细菌感染，最常发生在儿童的面部或四肢。患者通常有轻微瘙痒或疼痛的红斑丘疹和脓疱，后来破裂，形成蜜糖色结痂。最常见的病原体是金黄色葡萄球菌，其次是A组链球菌（GAS），特别是化脓性链球菌。在这种情况下，患者渗出物的显微镜检查显示链状革兰阳性球菌，表明链球菌感染。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n局部脓疱病用局部抗生素治疗，大多数患者没有长期的后遗症。然而，少数由GAS引起的脓疱病患者在最初感染几周后会发生链球菌感染后肾小球肾炎（PSGN）。肾脏损伤是由免疫复合物沉积和随后的补体激活引起的，从而引发炎症反应，损害肾小球基底膜。PSGN的临床表现范围从无症状、镜下血尿到明显的肾炎综合征：脓尿和肾病范围（<3.5 g/天）的蛋白尿很常见。除了茶色或可乐色尿液外，有症状的患者还会出现眶周/面部肿胀、全身水肿和高血压。实验室评估通常显示肌酐升高和C3水平降低。\n\n（选项A）进行性无力是格林-巴利综合征的典型特征，该综合征可能发生在呼吸道或胃肠道感染（例如，空肠弯曲菌）之前。GAS感染与这种情况无关。\n\n（选项C）疲劳和由于心肌炎引起的新心脏杂音可能是急性风湿热（ARF）的表现，急性风湿热是一种潜在的链球菌感染后遗症，通常与GAS咽炎有关。然而，在世界上大多数地区，ARF与脓疱病无关。\n\n（选项D）眼睛发红（由于结膜炎或前葡萄膜炎）和关节疼痛可见于反应性关节炎，反应性关节炎通常发生在腹泻（例如，沙门氏菌）或泌尿生殖道（例如，衣原体）感染之后，而不是脓疱病。\n\n（选项E）由于周围性面神经麻痹引起的单侧面部下垂最常见的原因是特发性的（即贝尔麻痹）或与神经 borreliosis 或单纯疱疹病毒感染有关。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of potential complications of impetigo, specifically poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). It requires recognizing the clinical features of PSGN as a sequela of streptococcal skin infection.\n\nThe key to solving this question is identifying the gram-positive cocci in chains as indicative of streptococcal infection and then recalling that PSGN is a potential complication. Recognizing the symptoms of PSGN, such as facial puffiness and dark urine, is crucial.",
