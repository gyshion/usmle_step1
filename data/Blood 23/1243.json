    "en": "The correct answer is C. The patient presents with transfusion-dependent hemolytic anemia in infancy, characterized by the presence of insoluble hemoglobin aggregates. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of BETA THalassemia MAJOR. In beta thalassemia major, there is a severe deficiency or absence of beta-globin chains, leading to an imbalance in globin chain synthesis. Alpha-globin chains, which are synthesized normally, precipitate within red blood cells, causing ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis, and anemia. The child developed normally in utero because fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which is composed of two alpha and two gamma chains (α2γ2), was the predominant hemoglobin. Gamma chains are produced in high quantities during fetal development and early infancy, compensating for the lack of beta chains and preventing severe anemia until after birth when gamma chain production wanes and beta chain production is essential for adult hemoglobin (HbA, α2β2). Therefore, the high quantities of gamma-globin produced in utero allowed for the formation of HbF, which protected the fetus from the severe effects of beta thalassemia major. \n\n(Choice A) Alpha-globin is a normal component of both HbA and HbF. Alpha-globin synthesis is defective in ALPHA-thalassemia, not beta-thalassemia. In alpha-thalassemia, the absence of alpha chains leads to the formation of tetramers of beta chains (HbH) or gamma chains (Hb Barts), which can also cause anemia, but the presentation described, particularly the insoluble aggregates and transfusion dependence by 6 months, is more characteristic of beta thalassemia major.\n(Choice B) Beta-globin synthesis is defective in patients with beta-thalassemia. The question asks what the child produced in high quantities in utero to remain healthy, not what is deficient. Beta-globin synthesis is insufficient in this condition, leading to the problem.\n(Choice D) Delta-globin is a minor component of adult hemoglobin (HbA2, α2δ2) and is produced in very low quantities. It is not involved in compensating for beta-globin deficiency during fetal development.\n(Choice E) Zeta-globin is a component of embryonic hemoglobin (Hb Gower), which is formed very early in embryogenesis and is quickly replaced by HbF. It is not the primary hemoglobin responsible for normal development in the later stages of gestation and early infancy.\n\nKey Pearls:\n- HbF (fetal hemoglobin) = α2γ2. It is the predominant hemoglobin in the fetus and newborn.\n- HbA (adult hemoglobin) = α2β2. It becomes predominant after 6 months of age.\n- Beta thalassemia major results from severe deficiency of beta-globin chains.\n- In utero, gamma chains compensate for the lack of beta chains, allowing for HbF production and normal fetal development.\n- Postnatally, as gamma chain production decreases and beta chain production is insufficient, severe anemia manifests.",
    "zh": "正确答案是C。 该患者在婴儿期出现输血依赖性溶血性贫血，其特征是存在不可溶性血红蛋白聚集体。 这种临床表现高度提示β地中海贫血重型。 在β地中海贫血重型中，β珠蛋白链严重缺乏或缺失，导致珠蛋白链合成失衡。 正常合成的α珠蛋白链在红细胞内沉淀，导致无效红细胞生成、溶血和贫血。 该儿童在子宫内正常发育，因为胎儿血红蛋白 (HbF) 占主导地位，HbF由两个α链和两个γ链 (α2γ2) 组成。 γ链在胎儿发育和婴儿早期大量产生，以补偿β链的缺乏，并防止严重的贫血，直到出生后γ链的产生减少，β链的产生对成人血红蛋白 (HbA, α2β2) 至关重要。 因此，子宫内产生的大量γ珠蛋白使得HbF得以形成，从而保护胎儿免受β地中海贫血重型的严重影响。\n\n（选项A）α珠蛋白是HbA和HbF的正常组成部分。 α珠蛋白合成在α地中海贫血中存在缺陷，而非β地中海贫血。 在α地中海贫血中，α链的缺失导致β链 (HbH) 或γ链 (Hb Barts) 的四聚体形成，这也可能导致贫血，但所描述的临床表现，尤其是不可溶性聚集体和6个月时的输血依赖性，更具β地中海贫血重型的特征。\n（选项B）β珠蛋白合成在β地中海贫血患者中存在缺陷。 这个问题问的是儿童在子宫内为了保持健康而产生了什么，而不是缺少什么。 在这种情况下，β珠蛋白合成不足，导致问题出现。\n（选项D）δ珠蛋白是成人血红蛋白 (HbA2, α2δ2) 的一个次要组成部分，产量很低。 它不参与补偿胎儿发育期间的β珠蛋白缺乏症。\n（选项E）ζ珠蛋白是胚胎血红蛋白 (Hb Gower) 的一个组成部分，它在胚胎发生早期形成，并很快被HbF取代。 它不是在妊娠晚期和婴儿早期正常发育的主要血红蛋白。\n\n关键要点：\n- HbF (胎儿血红蛋白) = α2γ2。 它是胎儿和新生儿中的主要血红蛋白。\n- HbA (成人血红蛋白) = α2β2。 它在6个月后占主导地位。\n- β地中海贫血重型是由β珠蛋白链严重缺乏引起的。\n- 在子宫内，γ链可以补偿β链的缺乏，从而实现HbF的产生和胎儿的正常发育。\n- 产后，随着γ链产生减少和β链产生不足，就会出现严重的贫血。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of hemoglobin synthesis, the different types of hemoglobin (HbF, HbA), and the pathophysiology of beta thalassemia major. It specifically assesses the knowledge of how fetal hemoglobin compensates for the genetic defect in beta-globin production during fetal development.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recognize the clinical presentation of beta thalassemia major and recall the composition of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Understanding that HbF is composed of gamma chains and is produced in high quantities during fetal life is crucial to identifying why the child was healthy in utero despite having a defect that manifests postnatally.",
