    "en": "A 46-year-old man comes to the office due to intermittent, bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain for the past month. The patient has lost 12 lb (5.4 kg) during this period. He was diagnosed with HIV 5 years ago but has been inconsistent with his antiretroviral medications. Current CD4 count is 50/mm³ and plasma HIV viral load is 650,000 copies/mL. Colonoscopy reveals multiple hemorrhagic, polypoidal lesions. Biopsy of these lesions reveals a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells and small blood vessels.",

    "en": "This patient with advanced HIV and diarrhea has endoscopic and histopathologic findings consistent with Kaposi sarcoma (KS). KS, a vascular neoplasm that often presents in HIV-positive individuals, is caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8).\n\nSkin involvement is characteristic (eg, purple papules on the lower extremities), but visceral involvement (eg, gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, lung) may also occur, particularly in patients with advanced HIV. Gastrointestinal KS is usually asymptomatic, but some patients may experience bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and/or abdominal pain.\n\nKS can often be identified endoscopically from infectious causes of diarrhea. It usually appears as red-violet maculopapular lesions, raised hemorrhagic nodules, or polypoid masses. Histopathology typically shows a proliferation of spindle-shaped endothelial cells with irregular, slit-like vascular spaces and extravasated red blood cells. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Colonic adenocarcinoma may appear polypoid endoscopically, but histopathology typically shows dysplastic epithelial cells with variable gland formation and/or mucin production, depending on the differentiation of the tumor.\n\n(Choice B) Cryptosporidium can cause profuse, watery, nonbloody diarrhea, particularly in patients with AIDS. Endoscopy shows inflammation without ulcers, and microscopy shows basophilic organisms on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells.\n\n(Choice C) Although cytomegalovirus colitis may present with diarrhea and abdominal pain, colonoscopy usually shows multiple ulcers and mucosal erosions. Histopathology shows characteristic cytomegalic cells with inclusion bodies.\n\n(Choice D) Entamoeba histolytica can cause bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. However, colonoscopy shows flask-shaped ulcers, and histopathology often shows trophozoites.\n\n(Choice F) Although ulcerative colitis may present with bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain, colonoscopy typically shows erythematous, friable, granular mucosa and possibly pseudopolyps (isolated areas of regenerative mucosa). Histopathology often shows an inflammatory infiltrate involving the mucosa and submucosa with crypt abscesses.\n\nEducational objective:\nKaposi sarcoma, a vascular neoplasm that often presents in HIV-positive individuals, may involve the gastrointestinal tract, causing bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Endoscopy characteristically reveals red-violet maculopapular lesions, raised hemorrhagic nodules, or polypoid masses.

    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize Kaposi sarcoma (KS) as a cause of bloody diarrhea in an HIV-positive patient with a low CD4 count, based on endoscopic and histopathologic findings. It requires knowledge of the typical presentation of KS in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nThe best approach is to correlate the patient's HIV status, low CD4 count, and the description of hemorrhagic, polypoidal lesions on colonoscopy with the characteristic histopathology of spindle-shaped cells and small blood vessels.
