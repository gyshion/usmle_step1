  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "In this scenario, the physician has an initial encounter with an angry patient who is upset about an aspect of her care that is not under the physician's direct control. Nevertheless, it is the physician's responsibility to be responsive to the patient's immediate concerns, attempt to defuse her anger, and build the physician-patient relationship. The physician should acknowledge the cause of the patient's distress (ie, hunger), remain nondefensive, and offer to obtain further information that could help resolve the issue (eg, confirming correct diet was ordered; checking with the nursing staff).\n\nThe physician should maintain a professional demeanor and avoid responding to the patient's anger with comments that may be interpreted as dismissive, defensive, or sarcastic. Being responsive to the patient's immediate concerns is more likely to build rapport, help the patient feel understood and lay a positive foundation for the physician patient relationship.\n\n(Choice A) This statement acknowledges the patient's distress but makes no attempt to respond to her concern.\n\n(Choice B) This statement offers an apology but inappropriately reassures the patient that the problem has been resolved when this is unknown.\n\n(Choice C) This statement may be interpreted as defensive because it focuses on explaining that the problem is not the physician's responsibility. Quickly addressing the patient's needs is more likely to defuse the situation and build the physician-patient relationship.\n\n(Choice D) Deferring resolution of the issue until after the examination is unlikely to defuse the patient's immediate anger and could, in turn, negatively affect her cooperation with the examination.",
    "zh": "在这种情况下，医生最初遇到的是一位愤怒的患者，她对护理的某个方面感到不满，而这不在医生的直接控制范围内。然而，医生有责任对患者的直接担忧做出回应，试图缓解她的愤怒，并建立医患关系。医生应该承认患者痛苦的原因（即饥饿），保持不辩解的态度，并主动获取更多信息，以帮助解决问题（例如，确认正确的饮食已开具医嘱；与护理人员核实）。\n\n医生应保持专业的举止，避免用可能被解释为轻蔑、辩解或讽刺的言论来回应患者的愤怒。对患者的直接担忧做出回应更有可能建立融洽的关系，帮助患者感到被理解，并为医患关系奠定积极的基础。\n\n（选项 A）此声明承认了患者的痛苦，但没有试图回应她的担忧。\n\n（选项 B）此声明表示道歉，但错误地向患者保证问题已解决，而这是未知的。\n\n（选项 C）此声明可能被解释为辩解，因为它侧重于解释问题不在医生的责任范围内。快速解决患者的需求更有可能缓解局势并建立医患关系。\n\n（选项 D）将问题的解决推迟到检查之后，不太可能化解患者的即时愤怒，进而可能对她配合检查产生负面影响。"
