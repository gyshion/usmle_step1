    "en": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to 2 days of dark, low-volume urine and decreased energy. The parents say that the boy had abdominal pain, fever, and bloody diarrhea for 4 days, which resolved about 3 days ago without treatment. The day before the onset of symptoms, the patient swam in a lake and ate hamburgers at a family picnic. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows pallor but is otherwise normal. He has no peripheral edema or rashes. Laboratory evaluation shows anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient has hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which is most often caused by infection with shiga toxin-producing organisms such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 or Shigella dysenteriae. Shiga toxin (verotoxin) enters the circulation from the bowel and induces capillary endothelial damage, resulting in platelet activation with the formation of microthrombi. Platelet consumption causes thrombocytopenia whereas the microthrombi lead to erythrocyte damage (forming schistocytes) and the resultant hemolytic anemia (eg, pallor, weakness, tachycardia). Damage to glomerular endothelial cells also causes acute kidney injury (eg, oliguria/anuria, increased creatinine) in approximately 50% of cases. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nThe hemolytic anemia in HUS causes decreased hemoglobin and haptoglobin levels as well as increased serum lactate dehydrogenase and unconjugated bilirubin levels (Choice A). The bleeding time may also be increased due to the reduced number of platelets. However, other coagulation studies are normal as there are no clotting factor deficiencies or disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with HUS (Choices C and D).\n\n(Choice E) Coombs test, or direct antiglobulin test, detects autoantibodies against red blood cells if they are present in the serum. The hemolytic anemia of HUS syndrome is mechanical rather than autoimmune; therefore, the Coombs test is negative.\n\n(Choice F) Streptozyme testing detects antibodies against group A Streptococcus and can be used to retrospectively diagnose streptococcal infections (eg, when evaluating for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis [PSGN]). However, children with PSGN have edema and hypertension, but no hemolytic anemia.\n\nEducational objective:\nHemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) manifests with acute kidney injury, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Characteristic laboratory abnormalities include decreased hemoglobin and platelet count and increased bleeding time, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin. blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine.",
    "zh": "该患者患有溶血性尿毒症综合征(HUS)，这通常是由产志贺毒素的生物体(如大肠杆菌O157:H7或痢疾志贺菌)感染引起的。志贺毒素（维罗毒素）从肠道进入循环系统，诱导毛细血管内皮损伤，导致血小板活化并形成微血栓。血小板消耗导致血小板减少症，而微血栓导致红细胞损伤（形成裂红细胞），进而导致溶血性贫血（如苍白、虚弱、心动过速）。肾小球内皮细胞的损伤也会导致急性肾损伤（如少尿/无尿、肌酐升高），约占病例的50%。 {{exhibit_1}}\n\nHUS中的溶血性贫血导致血红蛋白和触珠蛋白水平降低，以及血清乳酸脱氢酶和非结合胆红素水平升高（选项A）。由于血小板数量减少，出血时间也可能延长。然而，其他凝血研究结果正常，因为HUS没有凝血因子缺乏或弥散性血管内凝血（选项C和D）。\n\n（选项E）Coombs试验，或直接抗球蛋白试验，如果血清中存在针对红细胞的自身抗体，则可检测到这些抗体。HUS综合征的溶血性贫血是机械性的而不是自身免疫性的；因此，Coombs试验结果为阴性。\n\n（选项F）链球菌酶检测可检测针对A组链球菌的抗体，可用于回顾性诊断链球菌感染（例如，在评估链球菌感染后肾小球肾炎[PSGN]时）。然而，PSGN患儿有水肿和高血压，但无溶血性贫血。\n\n教育目的：\n溶血性尿毒症综合征(HUS)表现为急性肾损伤、微血管病性溶血性贫血和血小板减少症。特征性实验室异常包括血红蛋白和血小板计数降低，出血时间、乳酸脱氢酶、胆红素、血尿素氮和肌酐升高。"
