    "en": "A 68-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to confusion and lower extremity weakness. Her symptoms began 2 days ago with fever, headache, malaise, and myalgias. Today, the patient became confused and had difficulty ambulating due to left lower extremity weakness. The patient has a history of lymphoma in remission, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She drinks alcohol socially but does not use tobacco or recreational drugs. She is visiting her family in Texas for the summer and has never traveled outside the United States. Temperature is 38.3 C (101 F), blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 96/min. The patient is oriented to place and person only and has a coarse hand tremor. There is flaccid paralysis of the left lower extremity with preserved sensation. CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities. Lumbar puncture is performed, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein. Cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction testing yields viral RNA. The infectious agent responsible for this patient's current condition is most likely transmitted via which of the following mechanisms?",
    "zh": "一名68岁的女性因意识模糊和下肢无力被送往急诊科。她的症状始于2天前，表现为发烧、头痛、不适和肌痛。今天，患者变得意识模糊，并且由于左下肢无力而难以行走。该患者有淋巴瘤缓解期病史、高血压和2型糖尿病。她社交性饮酒，但不吸烟或使用娱乐性药物。她夏季去德克萨斯州探亲，从未离开过美国。体温38.3摄氏度（101华氏度），血压130/70毫米汞柱，脉搏96次/分钟。患者仅能定向于地点和人物，并有粗大手部震颤。左下肢出现弛缓性麻痹，感觉保留。头部CT扫描未见异常。进行腰椎穿刺，脑脊液分析显示淋巴细胞增多和蛋白质升高。脑脊液聚合酶链反应检测产生病毒RNA。导致该患者目前病情的感染原最可能通过以下哪种机制传播？"

    "en": "This patient has acute confusion associated with fever and asymmetric single-strand lower extremity paralysis, consistent with neuroinvasive West Nile virus (WNV) infection. WNV is a positive-sense, single-strand RNA flavivirus transmitted by female mosquitoes (Culex spp), most commonly in the summer in warmer regions (eg, southern United States, Latin America, Africa). Most WNV infections are asymptomatic or present with a flu-like illness (fever, headache, myalgias), often with a maculopapular or morbilliform rash on the back and chest.\n\nNeuroinvasive infection is an uncommon complication of WNV but has a 10% fatality rate. It occurs most commonly in older patients and those with a history of malignancy or organ transplant, and is characterized by meningitis (ie, headache, meningismus) and/or encephalitis (altered mental status). The presence of acute-onset asymmetric flaccid paralysis is highly suggestive of WNV, particularly if the patient demonstrates concurrent parkinsonian features (eg, rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, postural instability).\n\n(Choices A and D) HIV, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus can be transmitted via blood transfusion or sexual contact, whereas herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 are transmitted through sexual or oral contact. Although these viruses can cause aseptic meningitis and encephalitis, asymmetric flaccid paralysis and tremor are more suggestive of WNV.\n\n(Choice C) Varicella, mumps, and adenoviruses are spread via respiratory secretions (eg, droplets, aerosols) and are capable of causing aseptic meningitis or encephalitis, but paralysis is rare. Hemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are associated with Guillaine-Barre syndrome, which can cause ascending paralysis; however, Guillaine-Barre is not typically associated with fever at the time of symptom onset or viral RNA in the CSF.\n\nEducational objective:\nWest Nile virus is a single-strand flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes, most commonly in the summer. Most infections are asymptomatic or may present with a flu-like illness (West Nile fever), often with a maculopapular or morbilliform rash. Neuroinvasive disease manifests as meningitis, encephalitis, or asymmetric flaccid paralysis; patients may have parkinsonian features (eg, tremor).",
    "zh": "该患者出现与发烧相关的急性意识模糊和不对称的单侧下肢麻痹，这与神经侵袭性西尼罗病毒（WNV）感染一致。WNV是一种正链单链RNA黄病毒，由雌性蚊子（库蚊属）传播，最常见于温暖地区的夏季（例如，美国南部、拉丁美洲、非洲）。大多数WNV感染是无症状的，或者表现为流感样疾病（发烧、头痛、肌痛），通常伴有背部和胸部的斑丘疹或麻疹样皮疹。\n\n神经侵袭性感染是WNV的一种罕见并发症，但死亡率达10%。它最常见于老年患者和有恶性肿瘤或器官移植病史的患者，其特征是脑膜炎（即，头痛、脑膜刺激征）和/或脑炎（精神状态改变）。急性起病的非对称性弛缓性麻痹的存在高度提示WNV，特别是如果患者表现出同时存在的帕金森病特征（例如，僵硬、运动迟缓、震颤、姿势不稳）。\n\n（选项A和D）HIV、巨细胞病毒和Epstein-Barr病毒可以通过输血或性接触传播，而单纯疱疹病毒1型和2型通过性接触或口腔接触传播。尽管这些病毒可引起无菌性脑膜炎和脑炎，但非对称性弛缓性麻痹和震颤更提示WNV。\n\n（选项C）水痘、腮腺炎和腺病毒通过呼吸道分泌物（例如，飞沫、气溶胶）传播，并能够引起无菌性脑膜炎或脑炎，但麻痹很少见。流感嗜血杆菌和肺炎支原体与格林-巴利综合征有关，可引起上行性麻痹；然而，格林-巴利综合征通常与症状出现时的发烧或脑脊液中的病毒RNA无关。\n\n教学目标：\n西尼罗病毒是一种单链黄病毒，由蚊子传播，最常见于夏季。大多数感染是无症状的，或者可能表现为流感样疾病（西尼罗热），通常伴有斑丘疹或麻疹样皮疹。神经侵袭性疾病表现为脑膜炎、脑炎或不对称性弛缓性麻痹；患者可能出现帕金森病特征（例如，震颤）。"

It emphasizes the neuroinvasive form of WNV and its characteristic features.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key clinical features (acute confusion, fever, asymmetric flaccid paralysis, tremor) and the patient's location (Texas in summer), which are highly suggestive of WNV.
