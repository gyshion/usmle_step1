    "en": "A 44-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer comes to the office due to persistent back pain. The patient was recently started on radiation treatment for several vertebral metastases. She has taken acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but continues to have severe pain. On physical examination, she has tenderness over several lumbar vertebrae. Neurologic examination is unremarkable. The patient is started on oral morphine therapy. Which of the following is the most likely direct effect of this medication on the spinal cord neurons of this patient?",

    "en": "Morphine is an opiate analgesic that is commonly used to treat severe chronic pain in patients with cancer. There are 3 main opiate receptor subtypes (eg, mu, delta, kappa) that mediate analgesia at the spinal and supraspinal levels. All of these transmembrane receptors are coupled to inhibitory G proteins. Morphine and other commonly used opiates have an especially high affinity for the mu receptor, which exerts the strongest analgesia effects.\n\nIn the spine, opiates bind to mu receptors on the primary afferent neuron, resulting in closure of voltage-gated calcium channels, reduced calcium influx, and decreased excitatory neurotransmitter release (eg, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, glutamate, substance P) from the presynaptic terminal (Choice C). Opiates also bind to mu receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, which opens potassium channels and leads to membrane hyperpolarization due to potassium efflux. Opiate-induced inhibition of synaptic activity in the central nervous system attenuates pain transmission, producing analgesia.\n\n(Choice A) Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that inhibits the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in myocardial cells, resulting in a mild increase in intracellular sodium and indirect inhibition of the sodium-calcium exchanger. This leads to increased intracellular calcium and cardiac contractility, which can help reduce symptoms in patients with advanced systolic heart failure.\n\n(Choice B) Local anesthetics (eg, lidocaine) reduce pain transmission by blocking voltage-dependent sodium channels, which decreases sodium influx and action potential propagation. They are typically used for minor surgical procedures and spinal anesthesia.\n\n(Choice D) Benzodiazepines are sedative-hypnotics that may be indicated for anxiety, panic attacks, or insomnia. They work by increasing chloride influx at GABA-A receptors in the thalamus, limbic structures, and cerebral cortex.\n\nEducational objective:\nOpiate analgesics reduce pain by binding to mu receptors and inhibiting synaptic activity in the central nervous system. Activation of presynaptic mu receptors on the primary afferent neuron leads to closure of voltage-gated calcium channels and reduced excitatory neurotransmitter release. Binding to mu receptors on the postsynaptic membrane causes opening of potassium channels and membrane hyperpolarization.",
    "zh": "吗啡是一种阿片类镇痛药，常用于治疗癌症患者的严重慢性疼痛。有3种主要的阿片受体亚型（如mu、delta、kappa），它们在中枢和脊髓水平介导镇痛。所有这些跨膜受体都与抑制性G蛋白偶联。吗啡和其他常用的阿片类药物对mu受体的亲和力特别高，mu受体发挥最强的镇痛作用。\n\n在脊髓中，阿片类药物与初级传入神经元的mu受体结合，导致电压门控钙离子通道关闭，钙离子内流减少，突触前末端兴奋性神经递质释放减少（如乙酰胆碱、去甲肾上腺素、血清素、谷氨酸、P物质）（选项C）。阿片类药物也与突触后膜上的mu受体结合，这会打开钾离子通道，并由于钾离子外流而导致膜超极化。阿片类药物诱导的中枢神经系统突触活动抑制可减轻疼痛传递，产生镇痛作用。\n\n（选项A）地高辛是一种强心苷，它抑制心肌细胞中的钠-钾ATP酶泵，导致细胞内钠离子轻度增加，并间接抑制钠-钙交换器。这导致细胞内钙离子增加和心脏收缩力增强，这有助于减轻晚期收缩性心力衰竭患者的症状。\n\n（选项B）局部麻醉药（如利多卡因）通过阻断电压依赖性钠离子通道来减少疼痛传递，从而减少钠离子内流和动作电位传导。它们通常用于小型手术和脊髓麻醉。\n\n（选项D）苯二氮卓类药物是镇静催眠药，可能适用于焦虑症、恐慌症或失眠症。它们通过增加丘脑、边缘结构和大脑皮层中GABA-A受体的氯离子内流来发挥作用。\n\n教学目标：\n阿片类镇痛药通过与mu受体结合并抑制中枢神经系统中的突触活动来减轻疼痛。激活初级传入神经元上的突触前mu受体可导致电压门控钙离子通道关闭和兴奋性神经递质释放减少。与突触后膜上的mu受体结合会导致钾离子通道开放和膜超极化。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the mechanism of action of opioid analgesics, specifically morphine, on spinal cord neurons. It requires knowledge of receptor binding, G protein coupling, and the downstream effects on ion channels and neurotransmitter release.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall that opioids bind to mu receptors, leading to presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release (by reducing calcium influx) and postsynaptic hyperpolarization (by increasing potassium efflux). The question specifically asks about the effect on spinal cord neurons, making the understanding of these cellular mechanisms crucial.",
