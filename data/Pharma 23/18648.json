    "en": "Researchers develop a novel glycopeptide antibiotic similar to vancomycin that is bactericidal against many gram-positive bacteria. From animal studies, they determine that the effective drug dosage is 5 mg/kg/day administered intravenously in divided doses. In a clinical trial, the antibiotic is administered to adult and neonatal patients with gram-positive infections. The drug is found to be effective in adults but not in neonates. During further analysis, plasma concentrations of the drug are measured in both groups, with the results shown in the image below: {{exhibit_1}}",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is D. The image {{exhibit_1}} shows that plasma concentrations of the novel glycopeptide antibiotic are lower in neonates compared to adults when administered at the same weight-based dosage. This suggests that the drug is distributed into a larger volume in neonates. Neonates have a higher proportion of total body water and a lower content of body fat compared to adults. This difference in body composition results in water-soluble drugs, such as aminoglycosides and vancomycin, having a larger than expected volume of distribution relative to body mass. This leads to lower plasma concentrations when the drug is administered at the same weight-based dosage as given to adult patients, resulting in decreased effectiveness. Furthermore, neonates have an immature blood-brain barrier that increases the permeability of many substances into the CNS compartment, which, in addition to increasing the distribution volume, can increase the risk of CNS toxicity.\n\n(Choice A) The liver is not fully developed in neonates and has decreased expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes (eg, cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, glucuronidation enzymes). This can lead to decreased clearance of drugs that are hepatically metabolized (eg, acetaminophen, morphine). However, this would result in increased (not decreased) plasma drug levels. The drug in this question is administered intravenously, and its effectiveness is related to plasma concentration, not necessarily its metabolism.\n\n(Choice B) Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are decreased in neonates compared to adults. For drugs that are renally excreted, reduced renal clearance would cause increased serum drug concentrations, potentially leading to toxicity. However, in this study, the serum concentration is lower in neonates than in adults, which is inconsistent with decreased renal excretion being the primary cause of lower plasma concentrations.\n\n(Choice C) Neonates have decreased (not increased) plasma protein concentrations compared to adults, which can increase free levels of highly protein-bound drugs (eg, phenytoin, penicillin). Elevated bilirubin levels in neonates can further compete for albumin binding sites, increasing the concentration of unbound drug. However, this would lead to higher free drug concentrations, not lower overall plasma concentrations, and is unlikely to be the primary cause of the observed difference in effectiveness.\n\nKey clinical pearl: Neonates have a higher proportion of body water compared to adults. This can result in lower plasma concentrations of water-soluble drugs if they are administered at the same weight-based dosage as given to adult patients.",
    "zh": "正确答案是 D。{{exhibit_1}} 的图像显示，与成人相比，以相同的基于体重的剂量给药时，新生儿的新型糖肽类抗生素的血浆浓度较低。这表明该药物在新⽣儿中的分布体积更⼤。与成人相比，新生儿的总体水含量比例更高，⾝体脂肪含量更低。这种⾝体组成的差异导致⽔溶性药物（例如氨基糖苷类和万古霉素）的分布体积⼤于预期，相对于体重而言。当药物以与成人患者相同的基于体重的剂量给药时，这会导致血浆浓度降低，从⽽导致疗效降低。此外，新生儿的⾎脑屏障未成熟，增加了许多物质进⼊ CNS 隔室的通透性，除了增加分布体积外，还会增加 CNS 毒性的⻛险。\n\n（选项 A）新生儿的肝脏未完全发育，并且药物代谢酶（例如，细胞⾊素 P450 同工酶，葡萄糖醛酸化酶）的表达降低。这可能导致肝脏代谢药物（例如，对乙酰氨基酚、吗啡）的清除率降低。但是，这将导致血浆药物⽔平升高（⽽不是降低）。本题中的药物是静脉给药，其疗效与血浆浓度相关，不⼀定与其代谢相关。\n\n（选项 B）与成人相比，新生儿的肾⾎流量和肾⼩球滤过率降低。对于肾脏排泄的药物，肾脏清除率降低会导致⾎清药物浓度升高，可能导致毒性。但是，在本研究中，新生儿的⾎清浓度低于成人，这与肾脏排泄减少是血浆浓度降低的主要原因不符。\n\n（选项 C）与成人相比，新生儿的⾎浆蛋白浓度降低（⽽不是增加），这会增加⾼度蛋白结合药物的游离⽔平（例如，苯妥英钠、青霉素）。新生儿的⾎红素⽔平升高会进⼀步竞争⽩蛋⽩结合位点，从而增加游离药物的浓度。但是，这会导致游离药物浓度升高，⽽不是总体血浆浓度降低，并且不太可能是观察到的疗效差异的主要原因。\n\n关键临床要点：与成人相比，新生儿的体⽔比例更⾼。如果以与成人患者相同的基于体重的剂量给药，这可能导致⽔溶性药物的⾎浆浓度降低。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of pharmacokinetic differences between neonates and adults, specifically focusing on how body composition affects drug distribution and plasma concentrations. It assesses the ability to interpret graphical data representing drug concentration over time and relate it to physiological differences in pediatric populations.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first analyze the provided graph to identify the difference in drug plasma concentrations between neonates and adults. Then, consider the options provided and relate them to known physiological differences in neonates that can impact drug pharmacokinetics, particularly distribution. The option that best explains the lower plasma concentration in neonates, given intravenous administration, is an increased volume of distribution due to higher body water content.",
