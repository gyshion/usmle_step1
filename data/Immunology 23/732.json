    "en": "A 34-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit due to fever, chills, shortness of breath, and altered mental status. His symptoms began 3 days ago and have progressively worsened over the last 24 hours. His past medical history is significant for a motor vehicle accident 2 years ago in which he sustained blunt abdominal trauma and required emergency laparotomy due to internal bleeding. His blood pressure is 81/44 mm Hg and pulse is 122/min. He is started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors. His condition continues to deteriorate and he dies in the hospital several hours later despite extensive resuscitation efforts. Blood cultures obtained on admission grow *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. Impairment of which of the following mechanisms most likely contributed to the severity of this patient's infection? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient likely experienced traumatic splenic rupture 2 years ago with the splenic remnants removed during laparotomy (spleen is the most commonly injured organ with blunt abdominal trauma). He subsequently experienced overwhelming ASPLENIC SEPSIS, a condition that carries a 50% mortality risk.\n\nThe SPLEEN is a part of the systemic lymphoid system and receives roughly 6% of the cardiac output. Many of the splenic capillaries are open-ended and sinusoidal, permitting whole blood to flow into the red pulp cords. These cords form a reticular meshwork that acts as a fine sieve with spaces as small as 1 micron in diameter. Large numbers of macrophages line the red pulp cords and sinusoids and ingest any particulate matter that becomes trapped. The splenic red pulp is important for:\n\n1. Destroying aged and abnormal erythrocytes (eg, spherocytes) and serving as an emergency store of blood cells and platelets that can be delivered into the circulation when needed.\n\n2. Clearance of circulating bacteria that become lodged in the cords. Macrophages then present captured antigens to the B- and T-cells residing in the splenic white pulp to generate an active immune response. \n\nNearly half of the body's total immunoglobulins are produced by splenic B-lymphocytes. Splenic OPSONIZING ANTIBODY is of particular importance in the clearance of ENCAPSULATED SPECIES, as the capsule allows them to resist innate phagocytosis. Vaccination against encapsulated bacteria such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae*, and *Neisseria meningitidis* is recommended for all asplenic patients.\n\n(Choice A) The liver is the primary site for complement production. C3 deficiency predisposes to recurrent infections with encapsulated organisms. Deficiencies of C5-9, the components of the membrane attack complex, can lead to recurrent infections with *N meningitidis* or *N gonorrhoeae*.\n\n(Choice B) Immediate hypersensitivity results from IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation. It is not affected by splenectomy.\n\n(Choice C) Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a condition where catalase-positive organisms such as *Staphylococcus aureus* are phagocytosed but cannot be killed effectively. Patients experience recurrent suppurative infections (eg, abscesses).\n\n(Choice E) Interferons α and β are released from virally-infected cells and cause macrophage and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activation, leading to destruction of infected cells. Defects in type I interferon release lead to increased susceptibility to viral infections.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe spleen acts as both a blood filter capable of removing circulating pathogens and as a major site of opsonizing antibody synthesis. Asplenic patients are prone to infections caused by encapsulated organisms such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae*, and *Neisseria meningitidis*.",
    "zh": "该患者可能在2年前遭受了脾破裂，并在剖腹探查术中切除了脾脏残余物（脾脏是钝性腹部外伤中最常受损的器官）。他随后经历了压倒性的无脾败血症，这种情况的死亡风险为50%。\n\n脾脏是全身淋巴系统的一部分，大约接受心输出量的6%。许多脾毛细血管是开放式和窦状的，允许全血流入红髓索。这些髓索形成一个网状结构，充当细筛，其空间小至1微米。大量的巨噬细胞排列在红髓索和窦状隙中，吞噬任何被捕获的颗粒物质。脾脏红髓对以下方面很重要：\n\n1. 破坏老化和异常的红细胞（例如，球形红细胞），并充当血液细胞和血小板的紧急储存库，可在需要时输送到循环系统。\n\n2. 清除滞留在索中的循环细菌。巨噬细胞随后将捕获的抗原呈递给驻留在脾白髓中的 B 细胞和 T 细胞，从而产生积极的免疫反应。\n\n脾脏 B 淋巴细胞产生了体内总免疫球蛋白的近一半。脾脏调理抗体在清除荚膜菌中特别重要，因为荚膜使它们能够抵抗先天性吞噬作用。建议所有无脾患者接种针对荚膜细菌的疫苗，例如*肺炎链球菌*、流感嗜血杆菌*和*脑膜炎奈瑟菌*。\n\n（选项 A）肝脏是补体产生的主要场所。C3 缺乏症易患荚膜生物体引起的复发性感染。C5-9（膜攻击复合物的组成部分）的缺乏可能导致复发性*脑膜炎奈瑟菌*或*淋病奈瑟菌*感染。\n\n（选项 B）速发型超敏反应是由 IgE 介导的肥大细胞脱颗粒引起的。它不受脾切除术的影响。\n\n（选项 C）慢性肉芽肿病 (CGD) 是一种病症，其中过氧化氢酶阳性生物体（例如，金黄色葡萄球菌）被吞噬，但无法有效杀灭。患者会经历反复的化脓性感染（例如，脓肿）。\n\n（选项 E）干扰素 α 和 β 从病毒感染的细胞中释放出来，并引起巨噬细胞和细胞毒性 T 淋巴细胞激活，从而导致被感染细胞的破坏。I型干扰素释放缺陷导致对病毒感染的易感性增加。\n\n教育目标：\n脾脏既充当能够清除循环病原体的血液过滤器，又是调理抗体合成的主要场所。无脾患者容易感染由荚膜生物体引起的感染，例如*肺炎链球菌*、流感嗜血杆菌*和*脑膜炎奈瑟菌*。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the spleen's role in immunity, particularly its function in clearing encapsulated bacteria from the bloodstream. It also assesses understanding of the consequences of asplenia, such as increased susceptibility to infections with encapsulated organisms. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the patient's history of splenectomy and the subsequent risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI). Knowing that the spleen is crucial for clearing encapsulated bacteria and producing opsonizing antibodies will lead to the correct answer.",
