    "en": "The gross pathology of this fetus is consistent with anencephaly, an OPEN NEURAL TUBE DEFECT (NTD). Open NTDs are caused by a DEFECT IN PRIMARY NEURULATION. This process normally begins with formation of the neural plate, the lateral ends of which elevate to become neural folds during the third week of fetal development. These folds form the neural tube by fusing in the midline, starting in the cervical region and extending rostrally and caudally to the anterior and posterior neuropores, respectively.\n\nFailure of either neuropore to close results in an open NTD, and FAILURE OF ANTERIOR (ROSTRAL) NEUROPORE CLOSURE specifically leads to anencephaly, a fatal condition in which the skull and meninges fail to form. The fetal brain is then exposed to amniotic fluid, resulting in degeneration of the developing forebrain, as seen here. Maternal serum alpha fetoprotein is markedly elevated due to direct leakage from the open neural tube into the amniotic fluid. Prenatal ultrasound shows ABSENCE OF THE BRAIN AND SKULL SUPERIOR TO THE ORBITS. {{exhibit_2}} Many fetuses with anencephaly die in utero; those born with anencephaly may retain spontaneous breathing and brainstem reflexes (eg, suck, Moro) but die soon after birth.\n\n(Choice A) Neural crest cells are the progenitors for the peripheral nervous system and several other cell types (eg, melanocytes). Disorders of neural crest cell migration (eg, Hirschsprung disease) involve the peripheral nervous system rather than the CNS.\n\n(Choice B) The notochord is a major regulator of embryonic patterning and disruption to its development may affect the CNS, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tract. CNS structures related to notochord development include the spinal cord and vertebral column; defects would not affect the scalp and skull.\n\n(Choice C) Failure of prosencephalon division leads to holoprosencephaly, in which the brain does not separate normally into 2 hemispheres. A spectrum of findings may be present, including hypotelorism, a single nostril or proboscis, and/or a single central incisor.\n\n(Choice E) Failure of vertebral column fusion describes spina bifida occulta. Gross visual inspection may be unremarkable or show a deep sacral pit, tuft of hair, or overlying hemangioma.\n\nEducational objective: Open neural tube defects are a result of defects in primary neurulation (development and closure of the neural tube). Defective anterior (rostral) neuropore closure (eg, anencephaly) results in failure of the skull and meninges to form, allowing exposure of the developing brain to the destructive effects of amniotic fluid. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}",
    "zh": "该胎儿的肉眼病理学表现与无脑畸形一致，这是一种开放性神经管缺陷(NTD)。开放性NTD是由原神经胚管形成缺陷引起的。该过程通常始于神经板的形成，神经板的侧端在胎儿发育的第三周隆起，成为神经褶。这些褶在正中线融合形成神经管，从颈部开始，分别向颅端和尾端延伸至前、后神经孔。\n\n任一神经孔未能闭合都会导致开放性NTD，特别是前（颅）神经孔闭合失败会导致无脑畸形，这是一种致命的疾病，其特征是颅骨和脑膜无法形成。然后胎儿的大脑暴露于羊水中，导致正在发育的前脑退化，如这里所示。由于开放性神经管直接渗漏到羊水中，母体血清甲胎蛋白显着升高。产前超声显示眶上方的脑和颅骨缺失。{{exhibit_2}} 许多无脑畸形的胎儿在子宫内死亡；那些出生时患有无脑畸形的婴儿可能保留自发性呼吸和脑干反射（例如，吸吮，莫罗），但在出生后不久就会死亡。\n\n(选项A) 神经嵴细胞是周围神经系统和其他几种细胞类型（例如，黑色素细胞）的前体。神经嵴细胞迁移的紊乱（例如，先天性巨结肠症）涉及周围神经系统，而不是中枢神经系统。\n\n(选项B) 脊索是胚胎模式形成的主要调节者，其发育中断可能会影响中枢神经系统、胃肠道或泌尿生殖道。与脊索发育相关的中枢神经系统结构包括脊髓和椎骨；缺陷不会影响头皮和颅骨。\n\n(选项C) 前脑分裂失败导致全前脑畸形，在这种情况下，大脑无法正常地分成两个半球。可能会出现一系列表现，包括眼距过近、单个鼻孔或吻部，和/或单个中央切牙。\n\n(选项E) 椎骨融合失败描述了隐性脊柱裂。肉眼观察可能无明显异常，或者显示深骶凹、一簇毛发或覆盖的血管瘤。\n\n教育目标：开放性神经管缺陷是原神经胚管形成（神经管的发育和闭合）缺陷的结果。前（颅）神经孔闭合缺陷（例如，无脑畸形）导致颅骨和脑膜无法形成，从而使正在发育的大脑暴露于羊水的破坏性影响。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of neural tube defects, specifically anencephaly, and its underlying embryologic cause related to primary neurulation and the closure of the anterior neuropore.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the gross pathology described as anencephaly, recalling that this is an open neural tube defect, and then linking this defect to the specific stage of embryologic development, which is the closure of the anterior (rostral) neuropore during primary neurulation.",
