    "en": "A 42-year-old woman comes to the office with her husband for evaluation of abnormal movements. The patient has been having involuntary facial grimaces and extremity fidgeting. She has no prior medical or psychiatric conditions, but her husband says she has had frequent anger outbursts over the past year. The patient takes no medications. She smoked cigarettes and used illicit drugs for several years during college but not since then. Her father died of a neurological disorder at age 55. {{exhibit_1}} Physical examination shows intermittent, fidgety, jerky movements of the hands. MRI of the brain is ordered. Which of the following neuroimaging findings is most likely to be seen in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient with chorea (eg, fidgety, jerky, involuntary movements), behavioral abnormalities (eg, outbursts of anger), and a family history of a fatal neurological disease likely has Huntington disease (HD). HD is an autosomal dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in the production and accumulation of abnormal huntingtin protein, which is toxic to neurons.\n\nAlthough patients with HD display generalized cortical atrophy as the disease progresses, the most prominent atrophy is seen bilaterally in the caudate nucleus and putamen, leading to the enlargement of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. The loss of inhibitory GABAergic neurons in these areas causes decreased regulation of the movement and behavioral centers of the cerebral cortex, resulting in the characteristic constellation of symptoms in patients with HD.\n\n(Choice A) Diffuse ventriculomegaly without sulcal widening is seen in normal pressure hydrocephalus (eg, urinary incontinence, gait disturbance, cognitive impairment) due to an increase in cerebrospinal fluid volume. In contrast, neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington disease typically present with both ventriculomegaly and sulcal widening due to generalized cortical atrophy.\n\n(Choice C) A hypoplastic cerebellar vermis with cystic dilation of the fourth ventricle and a posterior fossa cyst is characteristic of congenital Dandy-Walker malformation. Although the diagnosis of Dandy-Walker malformation can be delayed into early adulthood, patients typically have a long history of chronic headaches and neurologic abnormalities (eg, unsteady gait, facial palsy).\n\n(Choices D and E) Early-onset Alzheimer disease (eg, bilateral hippocampal atrophy) or frontotemporal dementia (eg, frontal/temporal lobe atrophy) can present in patients as early as the fourth decade. However, changes in memory, speech, or behavior are the predominant symptoms at presentation; movement abnormalities (eg, myoclonus, akinesia, hyperreflexia) typically develop later in the disease course.",
    "zh": "这位患者出现舞蹈症（例如，烦躁、抽搐、不自主运动）、行为异常（例如，愤怒爆发）以及致命性神经系统疾病的家族史，很可能患有亨廷顿病 (HD)。 HD 是一种常染色体显性遗传、进行性神经退行性疾病，导致异常亨廷廷蛋白的产生和积累，而这种蛋白对神经元有毒性。\n\n尽管HD患者随着疾病进展会出现广泛的皮质萎缩，但最明显的萎缩发生在尾状核和壳核的双侧，导致侧脑室额角增大。 这些区域抑制性GABA能神经元的缺失导致大脑皮层运动和行为中枢的调节能力下降，从而导致HD患者出现特征性的症状群。\n\n(选项A) 弥漫性脑室扩大，无脑沟增宽见于正常压力脑积水（例如，尿失禁、步态障碍、认知障碍），这由于脑脊液容量增加所致。 相比之下，神经退行性疾病（例如亨廷顿病）通常表现为脑室扩大和脑沟增宽，这是由于广泛的皮质萎缩所致。\n\n(选项C) 小脑蚓部发育不全伴第四脑室囊性扩张和后颅窝囊肿是先天性Dandy-Walker畸形的特征。 尽管Dandy-Walker畸形的诊断可能会延迟到成年早期，但患者通常有长期慢性头痛和神经系统异常病史（例如，步态不稳、面部麻痹）。\n\n(选项D和E) 早发性阿尔茨海默病（例如，双侧海马萎缩）或额颞叶痴呆（例如，额叶/颞叶萎缩）可在患者四十多岁时出现。 然而，在就诊时，记忆力、言语或行为的改变是主要症状； 运动异常（例如，肌阵挛、运动不能、反射亢进）通常在疾病病程后期出现。"
