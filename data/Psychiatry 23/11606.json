    "en": "A 62-year-old woman comes to the office for follow-up for worsening hypertension. The patient admits to not taking her antihypertension medication as prescribed. She says she feels fine and adds, \"I always listen to my bodily rhythms when deciding whether to take medication on a particular day.\" The patient explains that her crystal jewelry has healing powers, and she maintains an online forum about the health benefits of crystals. The patient does not trust most people and believes that she can predict the weather based on the number of birds in her yard. She lives alone, has few friends, and is unemployed. On examination, the patient makes limited eye contact and appears mildly anxious. She has no auditory hallucinations, and no specific delusions are elicited. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this clinical presentation?",

    "en": "This patient's eccentric behavior, odd thoughts, perceptual distortions (eg, \"bodily rhythms\"), and social anxiety are consistent with SCHIZOTYPAL PERSONALITY DISORDER. Patients with this disorder typically exhibit MAGICAL THINKING (eg, \"superstitiousness, clairvoyance\") and odd PERCEPTUAL DISTURBANCES that are subthreshold for a psychotic disorder. They do not experience the persistent, fixed delusions or frank hallucinations seen in schizophrenia (Choice F). Individuals with schizotypal personality disorder rarely sustain close interpersonal relationships due to excessive social anxiety that does not decrease with familiarity.\n\n(Choice A) Social anxiety is common in patients with both schizotypal and avoidant personality disorders. However, individuals with avoidant personality disorder desire relationships but fear rejection and do not exhibit the eccentric behaviors of schizotypal personality disorder.\n\n(Choice B) Borderline personality disorder is characterized by unstable relationships, impulsivity, mood lability, and self-harm.\n\n(Choice C) Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is a lifelong pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control.\n\n(Choices D and E) Although individuals with paranoid and schizoid personality disorders also have difficulty sustaining trusting relationships, they do not exhibit the overt eccentricity or perceptual distortions seen in schizotypal personality disorder. Patients with paranoid personality disorder exhibit a pattern of pervasive distrust and suspicion; those with schizoid personality disorder are socially detached and tend to prefer solitary activities.\n\nEducational objective:\nSchizotypal personality disorder is characterized by a long-standing pattern of eccentric behavior, odd beliefs, perceptual distortions, and social anxiety despite familiarity.",
    "zh": "该患者的古怪行为、怪异想法、知觉扭曲（例如，“身体节奏”）和社会焦虑与分裂型人格障碍一致。患有此障碍的患者通常表现出魔幻思维（例如，“迷信，千里眼”）和奇特的知觉障碍，这些障碍低于精神病性障碍的阈值。他们没有经历在精神分裂症（选项 F）中出现的持续的、固定的妄想或明显的幻觉。由于过度的社交焦虑，患有分裂型人格障碍的个体很少维持亲密的、人际关系，这种焦虑不会随着熟悉度的增加而减少。\n\n（选项 A）社交焦虑在分裂型和回避型人格障碍患者中都很常见。然而，患有回避型人格障碍的个体渴望建立关系，但害怕被拒绝，并且没有表现出分裂型人格障碍的古怪行为。\n\n（选项 B）边缘型人格障碍的特征是不稳定的人际关系、冲动性、情绪不稳定和自残。\n\n（选项 C）强迫型人格障碍是一种终生的对秩序、完美主义和控制的先占关注模式。\n\n（选项 D 和 E）尽管患有偏执型和分裂样人格障碍的个体也难以维持信任关系，但他们没有表现出分裂型人格障碍中可见的明显古怪或知觉扭曲。偏执型人格障碍患者表现出普遍的不信任和怀疑模式；患有分裂样人格障碍的患者在社会上孤立，并且倾向于独处。\n\n教育目标：\n分裂型人格障碍的特征是，尽管熟悉，但仍表现出长期的古怪行为、怪异信念、知觉扭曲和社会焦虑。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of DSM-5 personality disorders, specifically differentiating between Cluster A disorders and other related conditions like schizophrenia. It assesses the ability to recognize the constellation of symptoms indicative of schizotypal personality disorder, including eccentric behavior, odd beliefs, perceptual distortions, and social anxiety.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully analyzing the patient's presentation for specific diagnostic criteria of personality disorders. Key elements to identify are the presence of odd or eccentric behavior, unusual beliefs or magical thinking, perceptual distortions, and social deficits, while ruling out the more severe symptoms of psychosis seen in schizophrenia.",
