    "en": "A 63-year-old woman with a prolonged history of hypertension is brought to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. The patient was at church when she experienced sudden-onset, severe chest pain radiating to her back and collapsed to the floor. She regained consciousness spontaneously but has had persistent chest pain. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient is confused and agitated. Blood pressure is 85/60 mm Hg and pulse is 110/min. The jugular veins are distended. The lungs are clear on auscultation. An intraarterial catheter in the radial artery shows significant variation in systolic blood pressure related to the respiratory cycle. Chest x-ray reveals widening of the mediastinum {{exhibit_1}}. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's syncope?",

    "en": "This patient with a history of chronic hypertension has sudden-onset, severe chest pain and a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray, which suggest an acute aortic dissection. The hypotension and syncope are likely due to cardiac tamponade (ie, pericardial fluid accumulation), a potential complication of ascending (type A) aortic dissection. \n\nIn aortic dissection, an intimal tear allows pressurized blood to enter the aortic wall, creating a split that becomes a false aortic lumen. Complications arise from the extension of the dissection into nearby structures; a proximal extension can involve the pericardium and cause aortic rupture into the pericardial sac, resulting in hemopericardium. The abrupt pericardial accumulation of even small amounts of blood can significantly raise pericardial pressure, causing compression of the right-sided cardiac chambers with restricted diastolic filling and jugular venous distension. Less blood is then pumped through the lungs to the left side of the heart, causing reduced cardiac output and hypotension (and sometimes syncope). The lungs remain clear. \n\nPulsus paradoxus is a sensitive (ie, usually present) finding in cardiac tamponade that involves an exaggerated drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration. It results from the restricted right ventricle bowing into the left ventricle during inspiration, causing a transient further decrease in cardiac output. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) Cardiac tachyarrhythmias, most commonly ventricular tachycardia, can cause syncope due to rapid heart rate with impaired diastolic filling and reduced cardiac output. However, cardiac tachyarrhythmia would not explain pulsus paradoxus and a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray. \n\n(Choice B) Intravascular volume depletion can occur with acute blood loss or dehydration and may cause orthostatic syncope (ie, syncope upon standing). In patients with significant intravascular volume depletion, reduced jugular venous pressure (ie, flat neck veins) is expected. \n\n(Choice C) Papillary muscle dysfunction is a potential complication of myocardial infarction that leads to acute mitral regurgitation. Sudden onset hypotension is typical and syncope may occur, but pulmonary edema is expected and pulsus paradoxus is not present. \n\n(Choice E) Syncope can occur with severe aortic stenosis, but it is usually exertional. Physical examination reveals pulsus parvus et tardus (weak and delayed pulses) rather than pulsus paradoxus, and a widened mediastinum is not expected. \n\nEducational objective: \nCardiac tamponade can occur as a complication of acute aortic dissection. It should be suspected in patients with sudden-onset, severe chest pain in combination with hypotension, jugular venous distension, and pulsus paradoxus. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
