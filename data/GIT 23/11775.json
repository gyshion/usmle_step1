    "en": "A 21-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient started having vague periumbilical pain in the morning. Over the next several hours, the pain became more severe, sharper, and localized to the right lower abdominal quadrant. Temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F), blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 12/min. Physical examination shows maximal tenderness in the right lower abdomen two-thirds of the distance from the umbilicus to the anterior superior iliac spine. Bowel sounds are decreased. Laboratory studies reveal a leukocyte count of 16,000/mm³. The change in this patient's pain characteristics is most likely explained by which of the following?",

    "en": "This patient's presentation is concerning for APPENDICITIS, which can cause both visceral (vague, nonlocalized) and somatic (sharp, well-localized) abdominal pain. Visceral abdominal pain is most often due to luminal distension and stretching of smooth muscle and is carried by general visceral afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system. The pain typically occurs in the midline region and is poorly localized and of a dull, constant, or cramping quality. Patients with visceral pain also commonly develop nausea, vomiting, or sweating due to activation of the autonomic nervous system. In contrast, somatic pain is usually due to irritation of the parietal peritoneum and is well localized, more severe, and worsened with deep inspiration or pushing on the abdominal wall.\n\nThe afferent pain fibers for the appendix, proximal colon (including the cecum), and overlying visceral peritoneum cross through the superior mesenteric plexus and enter the spinal cord at the T10 level to produce vague, referred pain at the umbilicus (Choice C). As the appendix becomes more inflamed, it irritates the parietal peritoneum and abdominal wall and causes a more severe somatic pain that shifts from the umbilical region to the McBurney point (two-thirds of the distance from the umbilicus to the anterior superior iliac spine). With peritoneal irritation, the abdominal wall becomes very sensitive to gentle palpation or sudden release of pressure (ie, rebound tenderness). {{exhibit_1}}\n\nThe appendix is usually located 2 cm beneath the ileocecal valve in the right lower quadrant. Depending on its orientation, there can be additional clinical findings. A pelvic appendix lies against the right obturator internus muscle, causing right lower quadrant pain with internal rotation of the right hip (Choice A). Patients with a retrocecal appendix may not have significant right lower quadrant tenderness because the inflamed appendix does not contact the anterior parietal peritoneum, and the cecum (distended with gas) acts as a cushion that blocks the examiner's hand. However, the inflamed appendix will lie against the right psoas muscle, causing pain with hip extension (Choices B and E).\n\nEducational objective:\nAppendicitis causes dull visceral pain at the umbilicus due to afferent pain fibers entering at the T10 level in the spinal cord. Progressive inflammation in the appendix irritates the parietal peritoneum and abdominal wall to cause more severe somatic pain shifting from the umbilicus to McBurney's point (two-thirds of the distance from the umbilicus to the anterior superior iliac spine).",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现提示为阑尾炎，阑尾炎可引起内脏性（模糊、非定位性）和躯体性（尖锐、定位明确）腹痛。内脏性腹痛通常是由于管腔扩张和平滑肌的牵张，由自主神经系统的普通内脏传入纤维传导。疼痛通常发生在正中线区域，定位不佳，呈钝痛、持续性或痉挛性。内脏性疼痛患者也常因自主神经系统激活而出现恶心、呕吐或出汗。相比之下，躯体性疼痛通常是由于壁腹膜受到刺激，定位良好，更剧烈，并且随着深吸气或按压腹壁而加重。\n\n阑尾、近端结肠（包括盲肠）和覆盖的内脏腹膜的传入疼痛纤维通过肠系膜上丛，在T10水平进入脊髓，从而在脐部产生模糊的牵涉痛（选项C）。随着阑尾的炎症加重，它会刺激壁腹膜和腹壁，引起更严重的躯体性疼痛，从脐部转移到麦氏点（从脐部到髂前上棘的距离的2/3处）。在腹膜受到刺激的情况下，腹壁对轻柔的触诊或突然的压力释放（即反跳痛）变得非常敏感。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n阑尾通常位于右下象限回盲瓣下2厘米处。根据其方向，可能出现其他临床表现。盆腔阑尾紧靠右侧闭孔内肌，引起右下象限疼痛，并伴有右髋内旋（选项A）。后盲肠阑尾的患者可能没有明显的右下象限压痛，因为发炎的阑尾没有接触到前壁腹膜，并且盲肠（被气体膨胀）充当缓冲垫，阻挡了检查者的手。然而，发炎的阑尾会抵靠在右侧腰大肌上，引起髋关节伸展疼痛（选项B和E）。\n\n教学目标：\n阑尾炎由于传入疼痛纤维在脊髓T10水平进入，导致脐部钝痛。阑尾进行性炎症会刺激壁腹膜和腹壁，引起更严重的躯体性疼痛，从脐部转移到麦氏点（从脐部到髂前上棘的距离的2/3处）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of appendicitis, specifically the transition from visceral to somatic pain as the inflammation progresses. It also tests the ability to correlate physical exam findings with the underlying anatomical changes in appendicitis.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic progression of pain in appendicitis (periumbilical to right lower quadrant). Understand that the shift in pain character reflects irritation of the parietal peritoneum, leading to localized tenderness at McBurney's point.",
