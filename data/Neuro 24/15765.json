    "en": "A 64-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to left lower extremity weakness. The patient was asymptomatic when he went to bed the night before, but he has had difficulty standing after waking up today. He has had no headache, double vision, or back pain. Medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and myocardial infarction. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, and pulse is 110/min and irregularly irregular. Left lower extremity examination shows motor power is 0/5, deep tendon reflexes are 3+, and Babinski sign is present. Right lower extremity examination is normal. An abnormality in which of the following structures is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

    "en": "This patient with atrial fibrillation (irregularly irregular pulse, tachycardia) has isolated left lower extremity motor deficits, most likely caused by a cardioembolic stroke in the right anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory. The ACA supplies the medial aspects of the frontal and parietal lobes, a region which contains the upper motor neurons responsible for contralateral lower extremity motor control. Occlusion of the ACA characteristically causes contralateral lower limb weakness with upper motor neuron signs (eg, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign). Contralateral sensory deficits occur in a minority of patients.\n\nThe most common etiology of ACA stroke is cardiac embolization due to atrial fibrillation, which can cause blood flow stasis resulting in thrombus formation in the left atrial appendage. Atrial thromboemboli frequently travel to and obstruct branches of ACA or middle cerebral artery (MCA), causing cerebral ischemia with associated neurologic defects.\n\n(Choice A) An embolic occlusion of the anterior spinal artery in the lumbosacral region would cause bilateral lower extremity weakness with hyporeflexia (ischemia of the anterior horns and corticospinal tracts) and loss of pain and temperature sensation (ischemia of the spinothalamic tracts) below the level of the lesion.\n\n(Choice B) Posterior inferior cerebellar artery occlusion characteristically causes ischemia in the lateral medulla (Wallenberg syndrome) and inferior cerebellar peduncle, resulting in dysphagia, hoarseness, and vestibulocerebellar symptoms (eg, ataxia, dizziness, nystagmus).\n\n(Choice C) Although lumbosacral neural foraminal stenosis can cause unilateral lower extremity weakness, compression injury of a spinal nerve root (lower motor neuron fibers) at this level would typically result in significant radicular back and leg pain with hyporeflexia.\n\n(Choice E) MCA strokes predominantly affect the upper extremity and are often associated with homonymous hemianopia, aphasia, and hemineglect. Although large MCA strokes can also cause lower extremity weakness, the deficits in those cases are usually extensive and involve both the upper and lower extremities (hemiparesis).\n\nEducational objective:\nThe anterior cerebral artery (ACA) supplies the medial aspects of the frontal and parietal lobes, which contain the upper motor neurons responsible for contralateral lower extremity motor control. Thromboembolic occlusion of the ACA characteristically results in contralateral lower extremity weakness with hyperreflexia.",
    "zh": "这位房颤（脉搏不规则，心动过速）患者出现孤立性左下肢运动功能障碍，最可能由右侧大脑前动脉（ACA）供血区域的心源性栓塞卒中引起。ACA 为额叶和顶叶的内侧部分供血，该区域包含负责对侧下肢运动控制的上运动神经元。ACA 闭塞的特征是引起对侧下肢无力，并伴有上运动神经元体征（例如，反射亢进，Babinski 征阳性）。少数患者会出现对侧感觉障碍。\n\nACA 卒中最常见的病因是由于房颤导致的心脏栓塞，这会导致血流停滞，从而导致血栓在左心耳形成。心房血栓栓子经常到达并阻塞 ACA 或大脑中动脉 (MCA) 的分支，引起脑缺血，并伴有相关的神经系统缺陷。\n\n(选项 A) 腰骶部前脊髓动脉的栓塞性闭塞会导致双侧下肢无力伴反射减退（前角和皮质脊髓束缺血）以及病变水平以下疼痛和温度感觉的丧失（脊髓丘脑束缺血）。\n\n(选项 B) 后下小脑动脉闭塞的特征是在延髓外侧（Wallenberg 综合征）和小脑下脚发生缺血，导致吞咽困难、声音嘶哑和前庭小脑症状（例如，共济失调、头晕、眼球震颤）。\n\n(选项 C) 尽管腰骶神经孔狭窄可引起单侧下肢无力，但该水平脊神经根（下运动神经元纤维）的压迫损伤通常会导致明显的根性背痛和腿痛伴反射减退。\n\n(选项 E) MCA 卒中主要影响上肢，通常与同向偏盲、失语症和半侧忽略有关。虽然大 MCA 卒中也可引起下肢无力，但这些情况下的缺陷通常很广泛，并涉及上肢和下肢（偏瘫）。\n\n教育目标：\n大脑前动脉 (ACA) 为额叶和顶叶的内侧部分供血，该部分包含负责对侧下肢运动控制的上运动神经元。 ACA 的血栓栓塞性闭塞通常会导致对侧下肢无力伴反射亢进。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of stroke localization based on neurological deficits, specifically focusing on the vascular territories of the cerebral arteries and their associated clinical presentations. It requires correlating the patient's isolated left lower extremity weakness with the specific arterial supply responsible for motor control of that limb.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the affected neurological pathway (motor control of the left lower extremity) and then determine which cerebral artery's territory, when occluded, would lead to such a deficit. Considering the patient's risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation) for embolic stroke is also crucial in narrowing down the differential diagnosis.",
    "zh": "本题考察基于神经功能缺损的卒中定位理解，特别是关注大脑动脉的血管分布及其相关的临床表现。它要求将患者孤立的左下肢无力与负责该肢体运动控制的特定动脉供应联系起来。\n\n为了解决这个问题，必须首先确定受影响的神经通路（左下肢的运动控制），然后确定哪条脑动脉的供血区域在闭塞时会导致这种缺陷。 考虑患者发生栓塞性卒中的危险因素（高血压、糖尿病、房颤）也有助于缩小鉴别诊断范围。"
