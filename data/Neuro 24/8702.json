She sustained no injuries in the collision but is adamant she did not see the car that hit her along the front side of her vehicle. The patient also reports that she has been having daily headaches and has not menstruated in the last 4 months. On physical examination, there is bitemporal hemianopia but no other abnormalities. MRI of the brain is shown below. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient has symptoms suggestive of a pituitary adenoma, including bitemporal hemianopia (due to compression of the optic chiasm), headaches, and amenorrhea (likely due to hormonal dysfunction). Pituitary adenomas arise from the anterior pituitary, which develops from the ANTERIOR PITUITARY, an evagination of the surface ectoderm called the Rathke pouch. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}\n\n(A) Endoderm gives rise to the gastrointestinal tract, liver, pancreas, lungs, thymus, parathyroid glands, thyroid follicular cells, middle ear epithelium, bladder, and urethra.\n(B) Mesoderm gives rise to muscles, connective tissue, bone, cartilage, serosal linings, cardiovascular and lymphatic systems, spleen, hemopoietic cells, kidneys, ureters, internal genitalia, and adrenal cortex.\n(C) Neural crest cells give rise to neural ganglia, adrenal medulla, Schwann cells, pia & arachnoid mater, aorticopulmonary septum & endocardial cushions, branchial arches (bones & cartilage), skull bones, and melanocytes.\n(D) The neural tube gives rise to the brain, spinal cord, posterior pituitary, pineal gland, and retina.\n(E) The notochord forms the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs.\n\nKey pearls:\n- Pituitary adenomas are the most common cause of sellar masses.\n- Bitemporal hemianopia is a classic sign of optic chiasm compression by a sellar mass.\n- The anterior pituitary arises from the Rathke pouch (surface ectoderm).\n- The posterior pituitary arises from the neuroectoderm (neural tube).",
    "zh": "该患者的症状提示垂体腺瘤，包括双颞侧偏盲（由于压迫视交叉）、头痛和闭经（可能由于激素功能障碍）。垂体腺瘤源于前叶垂体，它由表面外胚层（称为 Rathke 囊）的突出部分发育而来。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}\n\n(A) 内胚层发育成胃肠道、肝脏、胰腺、肺、胸腺、甲状旁腺、甲状腺滤泡细胞、中耳上皮、膀胱和尿道。\n(B) 中胚层发育成肌肉、结缔组织、骨骼、软骨、浆膜内衬、心血管和淋巴系统、脾脏、造血细胞、肾脏、输尿管、内生殖器和肾上腺皮质。\n(C) 神经嵴细胞发育成神经节、肾上腺髓质、许旺细胞、软脑膜和蛛网膜、主动脉肺间隔和心内膜垫、鳃弓（骨骼和软骨）、颅骨和黑色素细胞。\n(D) 神经管发育成大脑、脊髓、后叶垂体、松果体和视网膜。\n(E) 脊索形成椎间盘的髓核。\n\n关键要点：\n- 垂体腺瘤是鞍区肿块最常见的原因。\n- 双颞侧偏盲是鞍区肿块压迫视交叉的典型征象。\n- 前叶垂体源于 Rathke 囊（表面外胚层）。\n- 后叶垂体源于神经外胚层（神经管）。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the embryologic origins of the pituitary gland and its tumors. It requires correlating clinical presentation with anatomical structures and their developmental lineage.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the likely diagnosis based on the clinical vignette and physical exam findings. Then, recall or refer to embryologic charts to determine which germ layer gives rise to the affected structure, specifically the anterior pituitary in this case.",
