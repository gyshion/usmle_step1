    "en": "A 26-year-old previously healthy man is brought to the emergency department following a motorbike accident. He is found to have a maxillofacial injury. His condition is stabilized, and surgical repair is performed. While recovering, the patient develops difficulty chewing food. On examination, the jaw deviates to the right side when the patient is instructed to open his mouth. The nerve that has been injured in this patient exits the skull through which of the following foramina?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has symptoms consistent with injury of the third division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve [CN] V3, mandibular nerve), which provides sensory innervation to the face and motor innervation to the muscles of mastication. These include the 3 muscles that close the jaw (masseter, medial pterygoid, temporalis) and the single muscle that opens the jaw (lateral pterygoid).\n\nUnilateral injury to CN V3 will result in unopposed action of the contralateral pterygoid muscles; because of the plane of action of these muscles, this leads to deviation of the mandible toward the paralyzed side on opening the mouth. Bilateral paralysis would cause mandibular drop and lack of jaw movement. CN V3 exits the skull through the foramen ovale, which also contains the lesser petrosal nerve, the accessory meningeal artery, and the meningeal veins.\n\nThe second division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V2, maxillary nerve) exits the skull via the foramen rotundum (Choice C). The foramen spinosum the dura and contains sympathetic fibers to the meningeal artery, middle meningeal vein, and the meningeal (recurrent) branch of CN V3, which supplies the dura and contains sympathetic fibers (Choice D). The first branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V1, ophthalmic nerve) passes through the superior orbital fissure (Choice A). The foramen lacerum contains only a few small vessels (meningeal branch of ascending pharyngeal artery, emissary veins) and is otherwise occluded by fibrous tissue and cartilage. The internal carotid artery passes along its superior surface but does not traverse it. (Choice E) The jugular foramen contains CNs IX, X, and XI; the inferior petrosal and sigmoid sinuses; and the posterior meningeal artery.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe third (mandibular) branch of the trigeminal nerve exits the skull through the foramen ovale and innervates the muscles of mastication, including the masseter, the medial and lateral pterygoids, and the temporalis muscles.",
    "zh": "该患者的症状与三叉神经第三分支（颅神经[CN] V3，下颌神经）损伤一致，该神经支配面部的感觉并支配咀嚼肌的运动。这些包括闭合下颌的3块肌肉（咬肌、内侧翼肌、颞肌）和张开下颌的单块肌肉（外侧翼肌）。\n\nCN V3单侧损伤会导致对侧翼肌的无对抗作用； 由于这些肌肉的作用平面，这会导致下颌骨在张开嘴时偏向瘫痪侧。 双侧麻痹会导致下颌下垂和缺乏下颌运动。 CN V3通过卵圆孔离开颅骨，卵圆孔还包含小的岩浅神经、脑膜副动脉和脑膜静脉。\n\n三叉神经的第二分支（CN V2，上颌神经）通过圆孔离开颅骨（选项C）。棘孔是硬脑膜，包含交感神经纤维，通向脑膜动脉、脑膜中静脉和CN V3的脑膜（复发）分支，该分支供应硬脑膜并包含交感神经纤维（选项D）。三叉神经的第一分支（CN V1，眼神经）穿过眶上裂（选项A）。破裂孔仅包含少量小血管（咽升动脉的脑膜分支、发射静脉），否则被纤维组织和软骨阻塞。颈内动脉沿着其上表面通过，但不会穿过它。（选项E）颈静脉孔包含CNs IX、X和XI； 下岩窦和乙状窦； 以及后脑膜动脉。\n\n教育目标：\n三叉神经的第三（下颌）分支通过卵圆孔离开颅骨，支配咀嚼肌，包括咬肌、内侧和外侧翼肌以及颞肌。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of cranial nerve anatomy, specifically the exit foramina of the trigeminal nerve divisions and their associated functions. It requires correlating clinical signs of motor deficit in mastication with the specific cranial nerve and its anatomical pathway through the skull.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the affected nerve based on the clinical presentation (difficulty chewing, jaw deviation). Recall the functions of the trigeminal nerve divisions and the structures that pass through each of the listed skull foramina. Match the identified nerve to its correct exit foramen.",
    "zh": "此问题测试对颅神经解剖学的理解，特别是三叉神经分支的出口孔及其相关功能。它要求将咀嚼运动缺陷的临床体征与特定的颅神经及其穿过颅骨的解剖学通路相关联。\n\n要解决此问题，请根据临床表现（咀嚼困难、下颌偏斜）确定受影响的神经。 回忆三叉神经分支的功能以及通过每个列出的颅骨孔的结构。将确定的神经与其正确的出口孔相匹配。"
