  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's depression, fatigue, hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and vivid dreams are characteristic of COCAINE WITHDRAWAL. Symptoms occur within hours to days of cessation or reduction of heavy or prolonged use. Following a binge, patients may experience a period of acute, intense symptoms, including severe depression with suicidal ideation, pronounced lassitude (the \"crash\"), and drug cravings. In contrast to withdrawal from opiates, alcohol, and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from cocaine and other stimulants usually results in MINOR PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS. No medication has proven to be effective in treating cocaine withdrawal, and treatment is supportive only.\n\n(Choice A) Alcohol withdrawal is a medically serious syndrome characterized by initial symptoms of agitation, tremors, tachycardia, and hypertension (12-24 hours), with some patients progressing to seizures and delirium tremens.\n\n(Choice B) Symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal include anxiety, insomnia, perceptual disturbances, tachycardia, seizures, and psychosis.\n\n(Choice C) Patients who cease heavy and prolonged cannabis use may have irritability, anxiety, depressed mood, insomnia, restlessness, and decreased appetite. Nonspecific physical symptoms such as muscle aches may also be present.\n\n(Choice E) Insufficient duration of symptoms and probable relationship to substance use make major depressive disorder less likely.\n\n(Choice F) Opioid withdrawal is characterized by abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, yawning, muscle aches, piloerection, lacrimation, and dilated pupils.\n\nEducational objective:\nCocaine withdrawal is characterized by the development of acute depression accompanied by fatigue, hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and vivid dreams.",
    "zh": "该患者的抑郁、疲劳、嗜睡、贪食和生动的梦境是可卡因戒断的特征。症状出现在停止或减少大量或长期使用后的数小时到数天内。在一次狂欢之后，患者可能会经历一段急性、强烈的症状，包括伴有自杀意念的严重抑郁、明显的疲惫（“崩溃”）和药物渴望。与阿片类药物、酒精和苯二氮卓类药物的戒断相比，可卡因和其他兴奋剂的戒断通常会导致轻微的身体症状。没有药物被证明能有效治疗可卡因戒断，治疗仅为支持性治疗。\n\n(选项A) 酒精戒断是一种医学上严重的综合征，其特征是最初的症状为激动、震颤、心动过速和高血压（12-24小时），有些患者会发展为癫痫发作和震颤谵妄。\n\n(选项B) 苯二氮卓类药物戒断的症状包括焦虑、失眠、知觉障碍、心动过速、癫痫发作和精神病。\n\n(选项C) 停止大量和长期使用大麻的患者可能出现易怒、焦虑、情绪低落、失眠、烦躁不安和食欲下降。也可能出现非特异性身体症状，如肌肉酸痛。\n\n(选项E) 症状持续时间不足以及与物质使用的可能关系使得重度抑郁症的可能性较低。\n\n(选项F) 阿片类药物戒断的特征是腹部绞痛、恶心、呕吐、打哈欠、肌肉酸痛、竖毛、流泪和瞳孔扩大。\n\n教学目标：\n可卡因戒断的特征是出现急性抑郁，伴有疲劳、嗜睡、贪食和生动的梦境。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation and differentiating features of various substance withdrawal syndromes, particularly focusing on stimulant withdrawal. It requires the clinician to correlate the patient's specific symptoms with the known withdrawal profiles of different drugs of abuse.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully review the patient's reported symptoms and physical/mental status findings. Then, compare these findings to the typical presentations of withdrawal from common substances like alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, cannabis, and stimulants. Identifying the constellation of symptoms that most closely matches a specific withdrawal syndrome is key to arriving at the correct diagnosis.",
    "zh": "此题考察对各种物质戒断综合征的临床表现和鉴别特征的理解，特别是针对兴奋剂戒断。它要求临床医生将患者的具体症状与已知滥用药物的戒断特征相关联。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须仔细回顾患者报告的症状和体格/精神状态发现。然后，将这些发现与常见物质（如酒精、苯二氮卓类药物、阿片类药物、大麻和兴奋剂）戒断的典型表现进行比较。确定最接近特定戒断综合征的症状组合是得出正确诊断的关键。"
