    "en": "Nasal mucosal ulcerations and glomerulonephritis are most characteristic of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener). Cytoplasmic-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCAs) are virtually pathognomonic for granulomatosis with polyangiitis, with a better than 90% specificity and sensitivity. Proteinase 3-ANCA (also known as c-ANCA) may also be useful as a quantitative measure of disease activity.\n\n(Choice A) Goodpasture syndrome is sometimes called anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody disease. Presenting clinical manifestations of Goodpasture syndrome are hemoptysis, radiographic focal pulmonary consolidations, and a glomerulonephritis that may rapidly progress to renal failure. Upper respiratory tract ulceration is not characteristic.\n\n(Choice B) Smooth muscle cell antibodies are commonly seen in patients with autoimmune hepatitis.\n\n(Choice D) Antierythrocyte antibodies can produce hemolysis of an intravascular and/or extravascular type. Hemoglobinemia from intravascular hemolysis can end in acute renal failure, although this is predominantly seen after transfusion reactions only when other conditions, such as hypovolemia and/or acidemia, coexist. Hemolytic anemia would not cause isolated ulceration of mucosa.\n\n(Choice E) Platelet antibodies can often cause thrombocytopenia by binding to platelets. Neither these autoantibodies, nor thrombocytopenia is known to cause acute renal failure.\n\n(Choice F) Antimitochondrial antibodies are seen in primary biliary cholangitis (cirrhosis).\n\nEducational objective:\nNecrotizing vasculitis of the upper and lower respiratory tract (causing nasal ulcerations, sinusitis, hemoptysis) and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis—producing a variable degree of renal failure—is characteristic of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener). This disease is associated with C-ANCAs, which may target neutrophil proteinase 3.",
    "zh": "鼻粘膜溃疡和肾小球肾炎最能代表多血管炎性肉芽肿病（韦格纳病）。胞质染色抗中性粒细胞胞质抗体（c-ANCA）实际上是多血管炎性肉芽肿病的病理特征，其特异性和敏感性均超过90%。蛋白酶3-ANCA（也称为c-ANCA）也可用作疾病活动性的定量指标。\n\n（选项A）Goodpasture综合征有时被称为抗肾小球基底膜（GBM）抗体病。Goodpasture综合征的临床表现为咯血、放射学肺部局灶性实变以及可能迅速进展为肾衰竭的肾小球肾炎。上呼吸道溃疡并非其特征。\n\n（选项B）平滑肌细胞抗体常见于自身免疫性肝炎患者。\n\n（选项D）抗红细胞抗体可产生血管内和/或血管外溶血。血管内溶血引起的血红蛋白血症可导致急性肾衰竭，尽管这主要见于输血反应后，且仅当其他情况（如低血容量和/或酸中毒）同时存在时。溶血性贫血不会引起孤立的黏膜溃疡。\n\n（选项E）血小板抗体通常可通过与血小板结合引起血小板减少症。已知这些自身抗体和血小板减少症均不会导致急性肾衰竭。\n\n（选项F）抗线粒体抗体见于原发性胆汁性胆管炎（肝硬化）。\n\n教学目标：\n上下呼吸道坏死性血管炎（引起鼻溃疡、鼻窦炎、咯血）和快速进展性肾小球肾炎——导致不同程度的肾衰竭——是多血管炎性肉芽肿病（韦格纳病）的特征。这种疾病与c-ANCA相关，c-ANCA可能靶向中性粒细胞蛋白酶3。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis, and its association with c-ANCA antibodies. It also tests the ability to differentiate GPA from other conditions presenting with glomerulonephritis and pulmonary symptoms.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the classic triad of GPA: upper respiratory tract involvement (nasal ulcerations), lower respiratory tract involvement (though not explicitly mentioned, it's implied), and glomerulonephritis. The presence of c-ANCA antibodies strongly supports the diagnosis.",
