    "en": "This patient has a pruritic rash consistent with lichen planus (LP), an immunologically mediated skin disorder primarily affecting middle-aged adults. {{exhibit_7}} The skin lesions typically occur symmetrically on the flexural surfaces of the wrists and ankles but can also involve the nails, oral mucous membranes, and genitalia. The characteristic skin lesions are described by the 5 Ps: pruritic, purple/pink, polygonal papules and plaques and can form lines of minor trauma (Koebner phenomenon). Chronic lesions often show white, lacy markings known as Wickham striae. Although the etiology of LP is unknown, it is characterized by a (CD8+) T cell-mediated response to the cells along the junction of the dermis and epidermis, resulting in the following characteristic histologic findings: Hyperkeratosis (thickening of stratum corneum), Bandlike lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermoepidermal junction (interface dermatitis), Scattered eosinophilic, colloid (Civatte) bodies (apoptotic keratinocytes), Hypergranulosis (thickening of stratum granulosum), Sawtooth rete ridges. {{exhibit_8}}",
