    "en": "This patient has nasal congestion, sneezing, and rhinorrhea accompanied by conjunctivitis. This is consistent with ALLERGIC RHINOCONJUNCTIVITIS, a type 1 hypersensitivity that occurs via the binding of a previously recognized antigen to IgE antibodies on mast cells.\n\nBecause exposure to allergens results in a rapid allergic response and avoidance of allergens improves symptoms, patients can often distinguish patterns to their reactions. Typical patterns include the following:\n\n*   Seasonal variation: The variation is often related to specific pollinators at particular times of the year.\n*   Geographical variation: Symptoms improve when patients are not exposed to the typical allergens of the region (eg, work travel, vacation).\n*   Animal exposure: Symptoms occur when visiting a house with pets or begin shortly after animal acquisition.\n*   Indoor versus outdoor: Patients with predominantly indoor symptoms may have an allergy to dust mites; outdoor symptoms suggest pollinators.\n\n(Choice A) An allergic reaction to soy products can cause nasal and ocular symptoms. However, it also typically includes a rash, swelling or itching of the mouth and lips, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition, it most commonly presents in early childhood when soy is introduced into the diet.\n\n(Choice C) Rhinitis symptoms caused by exposure to cold air are classically associated with nonallergic or vasomotor rhinitis. Nonallergic rhinitis typically does not cause conjunctivitis symptoms.\n\n(Choice D) Tobacco smoke is a respiratory irritant that can worsen symptoms of allergic rhinitis; however, tobacco allergy is rare, and depending on route of intake, would likely produce significant oral (eg, mouth itching/swelling) and pulmonary (eg, asthma) symptoms.\n\n(Choice E) Like allergic rhinitis, medication allergies can be type 1 hypersensitivity reactions. However, these allergies typically present with an urticarial rash shortly after ingestion of the medication; eye symptoms are uncommon. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该患者有鼻塞、打喷嚏和鼻漏，伴有结膜炎。这与过敏性鼻结膜炎一致，这是一种I型超敏反应，通过先前识别的抗原与肥大细胞上的IgE抗体结合而发生。\n\n由于接触过敏原会导致快速的过敏反应，并且避免过敏原可以改善症状，因此患者通常可以区分其反应的模式。典型模式包括以下内容：\n\n*   季节性变化：这种变化通常与一年中特定时间的特定传粉者有关。\n*   地理差异：当患者未接触到该地区的典型过敏原时，症状会改善（例如，工作旅行、度假）。\n*   动物接触：当访问有宠物或动物获得后不久，就会出现症状。\n*   室内与室外：主要有室内症状的患者可能对尘螨过敏；室外症状表明存在传粉者。\n\n（选项 A）对大豆产品的过敏反应可引起鼻部和眼部症状。然而，它也通常包括皮疹、口腔和嘴唇肿胀或瘙痒，和/或胃肠道症状。此外，它最常在幼儿时期出现，当时将大豆引入饮食中。\n\n（选项 C）暴露于冷空气引起的鼻炎症状通常与非过敏性或血管舒缩性鼻炎相关。非过敏性鼻炎通常不会引起结膜炎症状。\n\n（选项 D）烟草烟雾是一种呼吸道刺激物，可使过敏性鼻炎症状恶化；然而，烟草过敏很少见，并且根据摄入途径，可能会产生明显的口腔（例如，口腔瘙痒/肿胀）和肺部（例如，哮喘）症状。\n\n（选项 E）像过敏性鼻炎一样，药物过敏也可能是一种I型超敏反应。然而，这些过敏通常在摄入药物后不久出现荨麻疹；眼部症状并不常见。{{exhibit_1}}"
