    "en": "A 71-year-old woman with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer is admitted to the intensive care unit for malignant airway obstruction with post-obstructive pneumonia and sepsis. Her oncologist calls the admitting physician to provide sign out, saying, \"Her disease has been progressing. Our plan was to start a third-line chemotherapy regimen next week.\" Despite receiving antibiotics and supportive care, she has rapid deterioration of her respiratory status with a very high likelihood of dying in the intensive care unit. When the physician discusses the patient's condition, the patient and family say, \"Whatever might have a chance of working, we want everything to be done.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate response?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This gravely ill patient has acute respiratory failure due to refractory metastatic lung cancer. Because the patient is rapidly deteriorating, discussions regarding goals of care are time-sensitive, as she may soon be incapacitated (eg, urgently intubated) and unable to participate in her own decision-making (Choice E).\n\nThe patient and her family request that \"everything\" be done, a frequently voiced sentiment during care discussions. In the outpatient oncology setting, \"everything\" meant exhausting multiple chemotherapy regimens to achieve a disease response. Unfortunately, the patient has become unstable and is very likely to die during her acute hospitalization. Predefined preferences should therefore be revisited regularly, including whenever there is a major change in clinical status. The physician cannot presume that a patient's past preferences can be directly extrapolated to a new situation.\n\nPatients can be unsure of how to express evolving preferences without an open invitation to a discussion. Therefore, clarifying the patient's current concept of \"everything\" is the first step toward developing a shared plan of care. \"Everything\" has fluid meanings, shifting across both a patient's life span and different clinical situations. Due to this wide variability, it is critical to guide and support patients as they weigh the acceptability of potentially harmful interventions with a low likelihood of benefit.\n\n(Choice B) The patient and her oncologist may have previously discussed long-term goals of care. However, her current preferences need to be revisited in light of her acute deterioration, with specific clarification about the meaning of \"everything.\"\n\n(Choices C and D) Some patients request \"everything to keep me alive at all costs.\" Radiation and airway stenting can temporarily improve pulmonary function and extend this patient's life by days to weeks. However, her personal beliefs, values, and concept of \"everything\" should be openly discussed and reevaluated prior to offering treatments that may ultimately prolong the inevitable dying process with no meaningful benefit.\n\nEducational objective:\nWhen approaching goals of care, the specific meaning of a patient or family's request that \"everything be done\" should be explored and revisited regularly, including whenever there is a major change in clinical status.",
    "zh": "这位病情严重的患者因难治性转移性肺癌出现急性呼吸衰竭。由于患者病情迅速恶化，关于护理目标的讨论具有时间敏感性，因为她可能很快就会丧失行为能力（例如，紧急插管）并且无法参与自己的决策（选项 E）。\n\n患者及其家属要求“尽一切努力”，这在护理讨论中经常被提及。在门诊肿瘤学环境中，“一切”意味着耗尽多种化疗方案以达到疾病缓解。不幸的是，患者病情变得不稳定，很可能在急性住院期间死亡。因此，应定期重新审视预先确定的偏好，包括在临床状况发生重大变化时。医生不能假定患者过去的偏好可以直接推断到新的情况。\n\n患者可能不确定如何在没有公开邀请讨论的情况下表达不断变化的偏好。因此，澄清患者当前对“一切”的概念是制定共同护理计划的第一步。“一切”具有流动的含义，在患者的整个生命周期和不同的临床情况下都会发生变化。由于这种广泛的变异性，引导和支持患者权衡潜在有害干预措施的可接受性以及低获益的可能性至关重要。\n\n（选项 B）患者及其肿瘤科医生可能之前讨论过长期的护理目标。但是，鉴于她的急性恶化，需要重新审视她当前的偏好，并明确说明“一切”的含义。\n\n（选项 C 和 D）一些患者要求“不惜一切代价让我活下去”。放疗和气道支架置入可以暂时改善肺功能，并将患者的生命延长几天到几周。然而，在提供可能最终延长不可避免的死亡过程而没有有意义益处的治疗之前，应公开讨论和重新评估她的个人信念、价值观和“一切”的概念。\n\n教育目标：\n在处理护理目标时，应探索和定期重新审视患者或家属要求“尽一切努力”的具体含义，包括在临床状况发生重大变化时。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to communicate effectively with patients and families regarding goals of care, especially when there is a request to \"do everything\" in the setting of a rapidly deteriorating patient with advanced cancer. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the patient's perspective and revisiting preferences in light of changing clinical circumstances.\n\nThe best approach is to first acknowledge the patient's and family's desire for aggressive treatment, then gently explore what \"everything\" means to them in the current context. This allows for a shared understanding and a more informed decision-making process, considering the patient's values and the potential benefits and burdens of different interventions.",
