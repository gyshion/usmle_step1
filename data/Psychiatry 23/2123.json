    "en": "A 21-year-old woman comes to the office at her mother's urging due to irritability and low mood. Two months ago, the patient was sexually assaulted in the parking lot of her workplace. Since then, she has felt that \"the world is not a safe place\" and is reluctant to go back to work, preferring to stay home. In the middle of the day she will \"space out\" and hear the voice of her assailant, \"as if I am right there in the parking lot.\" At other times, she feels a sense of unreality as if she is outside her body and cannot recall the exact details about what happened, and says that, \"I feel like I am going crazy.\" The patient has become withdrawn and either avoids her friends or becomes \"snappy\" when they visit her. She has lost interest in her hobbies of writing poetry and exercising. There is a family history of major depression in the patient's mother and schizoaffective disorder in her maternal grandmother.",

    "en": "This patient's 2-month history of intrusive flashbacks, avoidance, dissociative symptoms (amnesia, depersonalization), and emotional detachment following a traumatic incident are suggestive of POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD). Patients suffering from PTSD repeatedly relive a traumatic, life-threatening event in the form of NIGHTMARES AND/OR FLASHBACKS (in which the patient feels as if the traumatic event is actually recurring). Individuals will often AVOID people, places, and activities that remind them of the traumatic event and experience SLEEP DISTURBANCE, HYPERVIGILANCE, low mood, and IRRITABILITY. PTSD requires persistent symptoms for ≥ 1 month.\n\n(Choice A) Acute stress disorder involves symptoms similar to those observed in PTSD, which last 3 days to 1 month after trauma exposure. Symptoms may remit or progress to PTSD after this time. This patient has symptoms lasting 2 months and so meets the criteria for PTSD.\n\n(Choice B) In agoraphobia, the patient avoids situations where escape may not be possible or help is not available if panic or other embarrassing symptoms occur. If the avoidance is secondary to a traumatic event and the criteria for PTSD are met, PTSD is the accurate diagnosis.\n\n(Choice C) This patient's experience of hearing her assailant's voice is characteristic of an intrusive flashback that occurs in PTSD. Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by acute onset of psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations) lasting ≥ 1 day and ≤ 1 month.\n\n(Choices D and E) Patients with PTSD often experience a range of dissociative symptoms, such as DEREALIZATION (detachment from surroundings), DEPERSONALIZATION (detachment from self), or a lapse of autobiographical memory regarding the traumatic event (dissociative amnesia). If the dissociation is part of a cluster of symptoms that meets the criteria for PTSD, PTSD is the overarching and correct diagnosis.\n\n(Choice F) Individuals with PTSD commonly experience negative mood states, including decreased interest in activities and feelings of detachment from others. However, this patient does not meet the full criteria for major depression, and her social withdrawal and loss of interest are better explained by PTSD.\n\nEducational objective:\nPost-traumatic stress disorder is characterized by intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, avoidance of trauma reminders, hypervigilance, and sleep disturbance lasting ≥ 1 month.",
    "zh": "该患者有2个月的侵入性闪回、回避、分离症状（遗忘、人格解体）和情感疏离史，这表明患有创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD)。患有 PTSD 的患者会反复重温创伤性的、危及生命的事件，表现为噩梦和/或闪回（患者感觉创伤性事件实际上正在重演）。个体通常会回避提醒他们创伤事件的人、地点和活动，并会经历睡眠障碍、过度警觉、情绪低落和易怒。PTSD 需要持续 1 个月或更长时间的症状。\n\n（选项 A）急性应激障碍的症状与在 PTSD 中观察到的症状相似，这些症状在创伤暴露后持续 3 天到 1 个月。症状可能会缓解或发展为 PTSD。这位患者的症状持续了 2 个月，因此符合 PTSD 的诊断标准。\n\n（选项 B）在广场恐惧症中，患者避免可能无法逃脱或在恐慌或其他令人尴尬的症状发生时无法获得帮助的情况。如果回避是继发于创伤性事件并且符合 PTSD 的标准，那么 PTSD 是准确的诊断。\n\n（选项 C）该患者听到袭击者声音的经历是 PTSD 中发生的侵入性闪回的特征。短暂精神病性障碍的特征是急性发作的精神病性症状（妄想、幻觉），持续 1 天或更长时间，且不超过 1 个月。\n\n（选项 D 和 E）患有 PTSD 的患者通常会经历一系列分离症状，例如现实解体（与周围环境脱离）、人格解体（与自我脱离）或关于创伤事件的自传式记忆丧失（分离性遗忘症）。如果分离是一组符合 PTSD 标准的症状的一部分，则 PTSD 是总括性和正确的诊断。\n\n（选项 F）患有 PTSD 的个体通常会经历负面情绪状态，包括对活动的兴趣降低以及与他人的疏离感。然而，这位患者并未完全符合重度抑郁症的标准，并且她社交退缩和失去兴趣的情况可以用 PTSD 更好地解释。\n\n教育目标：\n创伤后应激障碍的特征是侵入性想法、噩梦、闪回、避免创伤提醒、过度警觉和睡眠障碍，持续 1 个月或更长时间。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and its differentiation from other trauma- and stressor-related disorders, as well as mood disorders. It requires understanding the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, including intrusive symptoms, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity, and their duration.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the core symptoms presented by the patient following a traumatic event. Evaluate the duration of these symptoms and compare them against the diagnostic criteria for the given options. Recognize that PTSD is an overarching diagnosis that can encompass other symptoms like dissociation and mood changes, provided the core criteria for PTSD are met.",
