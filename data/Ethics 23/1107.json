    "en": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother due to an asthma exacerbation. He has a history of poorly controlled asthma, with nonadherence to medication and outpatient follow-up visits. The mother works 2 jobs to support the family and says she has difficulty bringing the patient to appointments. Initial physical examination shows expiratory wheezes in both lungs. The patient is given nebulized albuterol, and his breathing improves. On repeat examination, a healing, round burn mark is seen on the back. When asked about the burn, the patient says, \"That happens when I'm bad.\" His mother explains that it was an accident resulting from the boy \"playing with the cigarette lighter in the car.\"",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This child's characteristic cigarette burn (eg, \"healing, round burn mark\") and inconsistent explanation of how the injury occurred (\"playing with the cigarette lighter in the car\") are concerning for CHILD ABUSE. The ongoing pattern of poorly controlled asthma and nonadherence to medication and follow-up visits are also concerning for medical neglect.\n\nWhen evaluating an injured child, physicians must carefully screen for suspicious physical findings and any associated historical inconsistencies. Signs suggestive of abuse on examination include multiple injuries of different types and stages of healing, pathognomonic injuries (eg, cigarette burns, symmetrical buttocks scalding), retinal hemorrhages, genital trauma, signs of neglect (eg, uncleanliness, malnutrition), and significant emotional or behavioral disturbances (eg, excessive compliance, pseudomaturity).\n\nPhysicians are obligated to report suspected child abuse or neglect to child protective services (CPS) for further investigation. REPORTING IS MANDATORY, and reasonable suspicion is sufficient; confirmation of abuse or neglect is not required for reporting purposes. CPS conducts assessments, coordinates family and rehabilitative services, and arranges foster family placement when needed.\n\n(Choice A) Children with presentations that do not require hospitalization (eg, \"healing, round burn mark\") can be discharged after the physician and/or CPS determines that the child's immediate safety is not at risk.\n\n(Choice B) There is sufficient evidence to suspect physical abuse and neglect, requiring that CPS be notified for further intervention. Asking about daytime supervision sidesteps the abuse and neglect, which is the most important issue to address. Regardless of whether the mother or another daytime caregiver is the offender, this situation warrants CPS involvement.\n\n(Choice C) Calling security and insisting that the mother leave the room are indicated if there is an immediate risk to the child. This patient has a suspicious examination finding and has already disclosed sufficient evidence of possible abuse, justifying CPS involvement; it is unnecessary to interview him alone, which would unreasonably risk escalating the parent's reaction, prior to contacting CPS.\n\n(Choice E) Openly doubting the mother's explanation will likely be met with denial, and confrontationally challenging caregivers is risky because they may become violent or attempt to flee the emergency department. It is therefore preferable to contact CPS if there are concerns for child abuse.\n\nEducational objective:\nPhysicians are obligated to report suspected child abuse or neglect to child protective services (CPS) for further investigation. Reporting is mandatory, and reasonable suspicion is sufficient to make a report.",
    "zh": "这个孩子的特征性香烟烧伤（例如，“正在愈合的圆形烧伤痕迹”）以及关于受伤如何发生的解释前后矛盾（“在车里玩打火机”）引起了人们对儿童虐待的担忧。持续的哮喘控制不佳以及不遵守用药和复诊也令人担忧医疗疏忽。\n\n在评估受伤儿童时，医生必须仔细筛查可疑的体格检查结果和任何相关的病史不一致之处。检查中提示虐待的体征包括不同类型和愈合阶段的多处损伤、特征性损伤（例如，香烟烧伤、对称性臀部烫伤）、视网膜出血、生殖器外伤、疏忽迹象（例如，不洁、营养不良）以及严重的情绪或行为障碍（例如，过度顺从、假性成熟）。\n\n医生有义务向儿童保护服务机构 (CPS) 报告疑似的儿童虐待或疏忽行为，以作进一步调查。报告是强制性的，合理的怀疑就足够了；报告目的不需要确认虐待或疏忽。CPS 开展评估、协调家庭和康复服务，并在需要时安排寄养家庭安置。\n\n(选项A)不需要住院的儿童（例如，“正在愈合的圆形烧伤痕迹”）可以在医生和/或 CPS 确定儿童的即时安全没有风险后出院。\n\n(选项B) 有足够的证据怀疑存在身体虐待和疏忽，需要通知 CPS 进行进一步干预。询问白天的看护规避了虐待和疏忽，这是要解决的最重要的问题。无论母亲还是其他白天的看护者是肇事者，这种情况都值得 CPS 参与。\n\n(选项C) 如果儿童面临直接风险，则应呼叫保安并坚持让母亲离开房间。该患者有可疑的检查结果，并且已经披露了足够的可能虐待的证据，证明 CPS 的参与是合理的；在联系 CPS 之前，单独询问他是不必要的，这将不合理地增加父母的反应风险。\n\n(选项E) 公开质疑母亲的解释很可能会遭到否认，而充满对抗性地挑战看护者是有风险的，因为他们可能会变得暴力或试图逃离急诊科。因此，如果担心儿童受到虐待，最好联系 CPS。\n\n教育目标：\n医生有义务向儿童保护服务机构 (CPS) 报告疑似的儿童虐待或疏忽行为，以作进一步调查。报告是强制性的，合理的怀疑就足以做出报告。"
