    "en": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the office by his parents, who are worried about his reaction to their recent decision to divorce. Despite their efforts to be supportive and engage him, he has not expressed any feelings directly about the divorce. When the patient is evaluated alone, he shares that he feels his parents are angry with him, although he cannot think of any instances when they expressed any anger toward him. On examination, the patient appears sullen and reports his mood is \"fine.\" This patient is most likely using which of the following defense mechanisms?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Projection is an immature defense mechanism that involves misattributing undesired thoughts or feelings to another person who does not actually have them to avoid acknowledgement in oneself. This patient is likely angry with his parents about the divorce, and, due to his inability to acknowledge these feelings, he projects them onto his parents. As a result, he perceives that his parents are angry with him, even though there is little evidence that they feel this way. Projection commonly occurs in patients who lack insight into their own motivations and feelings.\n\n(Choice A) Acting out refers to expressing unwanted thoughts or impulses through actions (eg, if the boy expressed his anger by destroying his parents' wedding photographs).\n(Choice B) Displacement involves redirecting unacceptable thoughts, feelings, and impulses intended for one person to a more neutral person or object (eg, if this patient redirected his anger at his parents toward a sibling).\n(Choice C) Identification refers to modeling one's behavior after someone who is perceived to be more powerful or prestigious. A classic example is the child of an abusive father who becomes a child abuser himself.\n(Choice E) Reaction formation is the transformation of an unacceptable feeling to its opposite (eg, instead of expressing anger, this patient behaved in an overly affectionate way toward his parents and enthusiastically supported their decision to divorce).\n(Choice F) Regression refers to reverting to a less mature way of coping with difficulties (eg, if this patient began sleeping in his parents' room due to anxiety about being alone, which is more characteristic of an earlier developmental stage).\n\nEducational objective: Projection is an immature defense mechanism involving the misattribution of one's unacceptable feelings or thoughts to another person who does not actually have them.",
    "zh": "投射是一种不成熟的防御机制，涉及将不想要的思想或感觉错误地归因于另一个人，而实际上那个人并没有这些想法或感觉，从而避免在自己身上承认。这个病人很可能对父母的离婚感到生气，并且由于他无法承认这些感觉，他将它们投射到父母身上。因此，他认为他的父母对他很生气，尽管几乎没有证据表明他们有这种感觉。投射通常发生在对自己的动机和感觉缺乏洞察力的患者中。\n\n（选项A）发泄是指通过行动表达不想要的思想或冲动（例如，如果男孩通过毁坏父母的结婚照来表达他的愤怒）。\n（选项B）移置涉及将针对一个人的不可接受的思想、感觉和冲动转移到更中立的人或物体上（例如，如果该患者将他对父母的愤怒转移到兄弟姐妹身上）。\n（选项C）认同是指模仿被认为更有权势或更有声望的人的行为。一个经典的例子是虐待父亲的孩子自己也成为虐待儿童者。\n（选项E）反向形成是将不可接受的感觉转化为其对立面（例如，而不是表达愤怒，该患者以一种过于深情的方式对待他的父母，并热情地支持他们离婚的决定）。\n（选项F）退行是指退回到一种不太成熟的方式来应对困难（例如，如果该患者由于担心独自一人而开始睡在父母的房间里，这更像是早期发育阶段的特征）。\n\n教育目标：投射是一种不成熟的防御机制，涉及将自己不可接受的感觉或想法错误地归因于另一个人，而实际上那个人并没有这些感觉或想法。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of immature defense mechanisms, specifically focusing on projection. It requires the ability to differentiate projection from other defense mechanisms based on a clinical vignette describing a patient's internal feelings and external perceptions.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully analyze the patient's reported feelings and his attributions of those feelings to others. Identify the core conflict or unacceptable emotion and determine if the patient is expressing it directly, displacing it, transforming it, or attributing it to someone else. Compare these observations to the definitions of the provided defense mechanisms to select the most fitting option.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试对不成熟防御机制的理解，特别是侧重于投射。它要求能够根据描述患者内心感受和外部感知的临床小品文来区分投射与其他防御机制。\n\n为了解决这个问题，仔细分析患者报告的感受以及他对这些感受的归因。确定核心冲突或不可接受的情绪，并确定患者是直接表达它、移置它、转化它还是将其归因于其他人。将这些观察结果与所提供的防御机制的定义进行比较，以选择最合适的选项。"
