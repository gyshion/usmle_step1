    "en": "A 16-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department after an eye injury during a baseball game. He was batting for his high school team when the opposing pitcher made a wild throw and the baseball hit him in the right eye. The patient has since had diplopia that worsens when he looks up. On physical examination, he has mild periorbital ecchymosis, enophthalmos, and limited vertical movement of the right eye. Visual acuity and left eye examination are normal. CT scan of the face reveals an orbital floor fracture.",

    "en": "Trigeminal nerve distribution {{exhibit_1}}\n\nThis patient sustained a blunt trauma to the right eye that is now unable to look up with the affected eye. Blunt trauma to the globe can injure the orbital rim, but the deeper walls of the orbit can also sustain damage due to rapid increase in pressure that is transmitted posteriorly into the orbit. This often leads to fracturing of the weakest area of the bony orbit—the orbital floor (ie, blow-out fracture).\n\nAn orbital floor fracture can cause herniation of orbital fat and the inferior rectus muscle into the maxillary sinus. An entrapped inferior rectus keeps the affected globe in a downward position, leading to diplopia on upward gaze despite normal visual acuity.\n\nIn addition, the infraorbital nerve (continuation of the maxillary nerve [V2]) runs along the orbital surface of the maxilla in the infraorbital groove before traversing the infraorbital canal and exiting the skull via the infraorbital foramen just below the orbit. Damage can result in numbness and paresthesia of the upper cheek, lip, and gingiva.\n\n(Choice A) The corneal reflex involves the trigeminal (CN V1) (sensory) and facial (CN VII) (motor) nerves. It can be impaired by trauma to the superior orbital fissure because cranial nerves III, IV, V, and VI pass through this structure.\n\n(Choice B) Hematomas over the mastoid process (Battle sign), with periorbital ecchymosis and clear otorrhea, are signs of basilar skull fractures.\n\n(Choice C) Nasal fractures or high-force trauma can result in loss of smell if the olfactory nerves are torn from the cribriform plate in the ethmoid bone.\n\n(Choice D) The facial nerve (CN VII) controls the motor function of the face. It travels through the temporal bone and can be injured in temporal bone fractures. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}\n\nEducational objective:\nAn orbital floor fracture can result in entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle, which presents with vertical diplopia and restriction of upward movement. In addition, the infraorbital nerve (a branch of V2) runs along the orbital floor and can be damaged, resulting in numbness and paresthesia of the upper cheek, lip, and gingiva.",
    "zh": "三叉神经分布 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n该患者右眼受到钝性创伤，现在无法用受影响的眼睛向上看。对眼球的钝性创伤会损伤眶缘，但由于压力迅速增加并向后传递到眶内，眶的深层壁也会受到损伤。这通常会导致骨眶最薄弱的区域——眶底（即，爆裂性骨折）发生骨折。\n\n眶底骨折可导致眶脂肪和下直肌疝入上颌窦。被困的下直肌使受影响的眼球处于向下位置，尽管视力正常，但在向上凝视时仍会导致复视。\n\n此外，眶下神经（上颌神经[V2]的延续）沿着上颌骨的眶表面在眶下沟中走行，然后穿过眶下管，并通过眶下孔从颅骨中穿出，正好位于眶下方。损伤可导致上颊、上唇和牙龈麻木和感觉异常。\n\n（选项 A）角膜反射涉及三叉神经（CN V1）（感觉）和面神经（CN VII）（运动）。当颅神经 III、IV、V 和 VI 穿过该结构时，眶上裂的损伤会影响角膜反射。\n\n（选项 B）乳突过程上的血肿（Battle 征），伴有眶周瘀斑和清亮耳漏，是颅底骨折的征象。\n\n（选项 C）鼻骨骨折或高强度创伤会导致嗅觉丧失，如果嗅神经从筛骨的筛板上撕裂。\n\n（选项 D）面神经（CN VII）控制面部的运动功能。它穿过颞骨，并且可能在颞骨骨折中受伤。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}\n\n教育目标：\n眶底骨折可导致下直肌受困，表现为垂直复视和向上运动受限。此外，眶下神经（V2 的一个分支）沿着眶底走行，并可能受损，导致上颊、上唇和牙龈麻木和感觉异常。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of orbital floor fractures, their common presentation, and associated nerve injuries, specifically the infraorbital nerve. It requires understanding the anatomical relationships within the orbit and the consequences of a blowout fracture. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the signs and symptoms of an orbital floor fracture (diplopia, enophthalmos, limited eye movement). Recall the course of the infraorbital nerve and its vulnerability in this type of fracture. Eliminate options that are associated with other types of injuries or cranial nerve deficits.",
