  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "In this initial patient encounter, the physician is faced with a specific request for an emotional support animal letter but has very limited information. Although physicians should be responsive to a patient's concerns, they should not feel pressured to make a recommendation before fully evaluating the patient. The best approach is to validate the patient's concerns and gather more information on which to base a decision.\n\nThe physician should begin with an empathetic comment acknowledging this patient's distress and then obtain a more complete understanding of the patient's mood, evaluation for additional depressive symptoms, and medical and psychiatric history as well as an assessment of other psychosocial stressors and the patient's support system. Dismissing the patient's request or coming to a premature decision should be avoided.\n\n(Choice A) This statement fails to acknowledge the patient's distress, avoids addressing her request, and offers specific advice without a full understanding of the situation.\n\n(Choice B) This statement dismisses the patient's immediate concern as unimportant and focuses on long-term strategies. This approach is likely to frustrate the patient feel negative and negatively impact the physician-patient relationship.\n\n(Choice D) This statement may make the patient feel defensive about her decision to move. It may be more difficult to do a full assessment if the patient feels judged.\n\n(Choice E) Writing a letter is up to the physician's discretion but should not be done before fully evaluating the patient and documenting appropriately.",
    "zh": "在这次最初的患者就诊中，医生面临着一个关于情感支持动物证明信的具体请求，但获得的信息非常有限。尽管医生应该对患者的担忧做出回应，但他们不应该在充分评估患者之前就感到有压力要做出建议。最好的方法是认可患者的担忧，并收集更多信息以便做出决定。\n\n医生应该首先以同情的评论开始，承认这位患者的痛苦，然后更全面地了解患者的情绪、对额外抑郁症状的评估、病史和精神病史，以及对其他社会心理压力源和患者支持系统的评估。应该避免驳回患者的请求或过早地做出决定。\n\n（选项A） 这种说法未能承认患者的痛苦，避免处理她的请求，并在没有充分了解情况的情况下提供了具体的建议。\n\n（选项B） 这种说法将患者的即时担忧视为不重要，并侧重于长期策略。这种方法可能会使患者感到沮丧、消极，并对医患关系产生负面影响。\n\n（选项D） 这种说法可能会让患者对搬家的决定感到防备。如果患者感到被评判，进行全面评估可能会更加困难。\n\n（选项E） 写信取决于医生的酌情决定，但不应在充分评估患者并适当记录之前进行。"
