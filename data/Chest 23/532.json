    "en": "A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being found intoxicated in a park. The patient reports a 10-day history of fevers, night sweats, weight loss, and productive cough with foul-smelling sputum. He drinks 1 or 2 pints of vodka daily and has been hospitalized multiple times for intoxication. Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 22/min. Lung auscultation reveals coarse crackles over the right lower lobe. Heart sounds are normal with no murmurs. Laboratory results show an elevated leukocyte count. Chest x-ray reveals a cavitary lesion with an air-fluid level in the superior segment of the right lower lobe of the lung.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a cavitary lesion with an air-fluid level on chest x-ray, raising strong suspicion for lung abscess. Most cases of lung abscess present with several weeks of fever, malaise, weight loss, and leukocytosis. Cough with copious production of greenish, foul-smelling sputum is also common.\n\nLung abscess usually forms due to the aspiration of oropharyngeal bacteria. Risk is greatest in patients with ≥1 of the following:\n\n*   Periods of altered consciousness (eg, alcohol use disorder, seizures, dementia)\n*   Impaired swallowing (eg, nasogastric tube, dysphagia)\n*   Periodontal disease, particularly gingivitis\n\nMost lung abscesses are polymicrobial and feature a mixture of oral anaerobic (eg, *Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides*) and aerobic bacteria. Infections are most common in dependent areas of the right lung because the right bronchus is straighter than the left bronchus; aspiration that occurs in the upright position usually leads to an abscess in the basal segment of the right lower lobe, whereas aspiration that occurs while supine often causes abscess in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe or the superior segment of the right lower lobe.\n\n(Choice A) Aspiration of gastric acid causes chemical pneumonitis (acidic damage to alveoli), which typically results in severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates within hours of an aspiration event. It does not usually present with weeks of productive cough or a cavitary lesion.\n\n(Choice C) Right-sided infective endocarditis may result in the development of multiple lung abscesses due to septic emboli. It is most often seen in intravenous drug use. This patient with alcohol use disorder has a single lung abscess in a dependent portion of the right lung, which is most likely due to aspirated oropharyngeal bacteria.\n\n(Choice D) Cavitary tuberculosis (TB) is usually due to reactivated (not primary) mycobacterial infection. In addition, TB cavities do not typically have air-fluid levels and are most common in the upper portions of the lung.\n\n(Choice E) An aspergilloma (fungal ball) usually colonizes an already existing lung cavity, typically in the presence of TB, lung cancer, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Aspergillomas generally occur in the upper lobes. Unlike chronic aspergillosis, simple aspergillomas are not associated with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, hemoptysis).\n\nEducational objective:\n\nLung abscess usually occurs in individuals with episodes of impaired consciousness (eg, alcohol/substance use disorder, dementia) or decreased ability to swallow (eg, esophageal strictures). They are generally caused by aspiration of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria from the oral cavity into the lower respiratory tract.",
    "zh": "该患者胸部X光片显示有空洞病变伴气液平面，高度提示肺脓肿。大多数肺脓肿病例表现为数周的发烧、不适、体重减轻和白细胞增多。咳出大量绿色恶臭痰液也很常见。\n\n肺脓肿通常是由于吸入口咽细菌而形成。以下患者风险最高：\n\n*   意识改变时期（例如，酒精使用障碍、癫痫发作、痴呆）\n*   吞咽功能受损（例如，鼻饲管、吞咽困难）\n*   牙周病，特别是牙龈炎\n\n大多数肺脓肿是多菌感染，包含混合的口腔厌氧菌（例如，*梭杆菌、消化链球菌、拟杆菌*）和需氧菌。感染在右肺的依赖区最常见，因为右支气管比左支气管更直；站立位发生的吸入通常导致右下肺的基底段形成脓肿，而仰卧位发生的吸入通常导致右上肺的后段或右下肺的上段形成脓肿。\n\n（选项A）胃酸吸入会导致化学性肺炎（对肺泡的酸性损伤），通常会在吸入事件发生后的数小时内导致严重的呼吸困难、低氧血症和弥漫性肺浸润。它通常不会表现为数周的咳痰或空洞病变。\n\n（选项C）右侧感染性心内膜炎可能由于败血性栓子而导致多个肺脓肿的发生。它最常见于静脉药物滥用。这位患有酒精使用障碍的患者在右肺的依赖部分有一个单一的肺脓肿，这很可能是由于吸入口咽细菌所致。\n\n（选项D）空洞性结核病（TB）通常是由于再激活（不是原发性）分枝杆菌感染引起的。此外，结核病空洞通常没有气液平面，并且最常见于肺的上部。\n\n（选项E）曲霉菌球（真菌球）通常定植于已有的肺空洞中，通常是在结核病、肺癌或慢性阻塞性肺病的存在下。曲霉菌球通常发生在肺上叶。与慢性曲霉病不同，单纯性曲霉菌球与全身症状（例如，发烧、咯血）无关。\n\n教育目标：\n\n肺脓肿通常发生在意识受损（例如，酒精/物质使用障碍、痴呆）或吞咽能力下降（例如，食管狭窄）的个体中。它们通常是由来自口腔的厌氧菌和需氧菌吸入下呼吸道引起的。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of lung abscess etiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation. It requires differentiating lung abscess from other causes of cavitary lung lesions.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the patient's risk factors (alcohol use, altered consciousness), the typical location of aspiration pneumonia/abscess (right lower lobe), and the characteristic foul-smelling sputum. This points towards aspiration of oropharyngeal bacteria as the most likely cause.",
    "zh": "此题考察对肺脓肿病因学、危险因素和临床表现的认识。它需要将肺脓肿与其他引起空洞性肺病变的病因区分开来。\n\n最好的方法是认识到患者的危险因素（饮酒、意识改变），吸入性肺炎/脓肿的典型位置（右下肺叶）以及特征性的恶臭痰液。这表明吸入口咽细菌是最可能的原因。"
