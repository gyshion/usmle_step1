    "en": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the office due to bloating, intermittent diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Symptoms have been ongoing for many years and are usually triggered by meals. Past medical history and family history are otherwise unremarkable. Vital signs are within normal limits. BMI is 27 kg/m². The patient is well-appearing, and the abdomen is soft and nontender. Laboratory analysis is unremarkable. The patient is diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, and it is recommended that she take loperamide and consume an adequate amount of dietary fiber. After reading about her disorder on the internet, the patient decides to manage her symptoms with a strict vegan diet that includes a vitamin B₁₂ supplement. This patient is at highest risk for dietary deficiency of which of the following nutrients?",

    "en": "Individuals who adhere to a vegan diet consume only plant-based foods and avoid all meat and other animal-derived products (eg, milk). Adherence to a vegan diet is associated with a decreased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, and stroke.\n\nHowever, most people obtain a significant portion of daily calcium and vitamin D requirements from dairy products; individuals on a vegan diet often consume less calcium and vitamin D than nonvegans. Although some vegan products are fortified with calcium and vitamin D, individuals who do not consume these products may require additional supplementation to avoid long-term consequences (eg, OSTEOPOROSIS, bone fractures). Cobalamin (vitamin B₁₂) deficiency can also be seen in vegans, leading to megaloblastic anemia and subacute combined degeneration of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord.\n\n(Choice B) Folic acid is found in many plant-based products, including leafy vegetables and legumes. Supplementation is recommended during pregnancy to prevent fetal neural tube defects but is not needed in a vegan diet.\n\n(Choice C) Magnesium is found in almost all foods. Hypomagnesemia can cause neuromuscular excitability (eg, tetany) and arrhythmias but is usually related to fluid losses (eg, diarrhea, diuretic use) or heavy alcohol use rather than dietary inadequacy.\n\n(Choice D) Niacin deficiency can lead to pellagra, which is characterized by diarrhea, dermatitis, and possible dementia. Deficiency usually occurs in severely malnourished individuals (eg, alcohol use disorder, anorexia nervosa); however, niacin is plentiful in many vegetables and deficiency is uncommon in a vegan diet.\n\n(Choice E) Thiamine is found in many vegan products, including legumes, brown rice, and whole-grain cereals. Thiamine deficiency is most common in those with alcohol use disorder and leads to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (oculomotor dysfunction, ataxia, memory loss).\n\nEducational objective: Individuals on a vegan diet are at increased risk for deficiencies in calcium and vitamin D, which may increase the risk for osteoporosis and bone fractures. Cobalamin (vitamin B₁₂) deficiency can also occur.",
    "zh": "坚持纯素饮食的人仅食用植物性食物，并避免所有肉类和其他动物来源产品（例如，牛奶）。坚持纯素饮食与降低2型糖尿病、高胆固醇血症、冠状动脉心脏病和中风的风险相关。\n\n然而，大多数人从乳制品中获得每日钙和维生素D需求的重要部分；纯素饮食者通常摄入的钙和维生素D少于非素食者。虽然一些纯素产品富含钙和维生素D，但未食用这些产品的人可能需要额外的补充剂以避免长期后果（例如，骨质疏松症，骨折）。在纯素食者中也可见到钴胺素（维生素B₁₂）缺乏症，导致巨幼细胞性贫血和脊髓后柱亚急性联合变性。\n\n（选项B）叶酸存在于许多植物性产品中，包括绿叶蔬菜和豆类。建议在怀孕期间补充叶酸以预防胎儿神经管缺陷，但在纯素饮食中不需要。\n\n（选项C）镁存在于几乎所有食物中。低镁血症可引起神经肌肉兴奋性（例如，手足抽搐）和心律失常，但通常与液体流失（例如，腹泻、利尿剂使用）或大量饮酒有关，而不是膳食摄入不足。\n\n（选项D）烟酸缺乏可导致糙皮病，其特征是腹泻、皮炎和可能的痴呆。缺乏症通常发生在严重营养不良的个体中（例如，酒精使用障碍，神经性厌食症）；然而，烟酸在许多蔬菜中含量丰富，在纯素饮食中很少发生缺乏。\n\n（选项E）硫胺素存在于许多纯素产品中，包括豆类、糙米和全麦谷物。硫胺素缺乏症最常见于患有酒精使用障碍的人，并导致Wernicke-Korsakoff综合征（动眼神经功能障碍、共济失调、记忆力丧失）。\n\n教育目标：纯素饮食者发生钙和维生素D缺乏的风险增加，这可能会增加骨质疏松症和骨折的风险。也可能发生钴胺素（维生素B₁₂）缺乏症。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of potential nutritional deficiencies associated with a vegan diet, specifically focusing on calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B12. It requires understanding the dietary sources of these nutrients and the implications of their deficiency.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that vegan diets, while beneficial in some aspects, can lead to deficiencies in nutrients primarily found in animal products. Focus on the nutrients that are less abundant in plant-based foods and consider the patient's supplementation with vitamin B12.",
