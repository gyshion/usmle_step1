    "en": "Pituitary sources of ACTH are only relatively resistant to feedback inhibition, and high doses of dexamethasone will suppress ACTH and cortisol levels (Choice A). Nonpituitary ectopic sources of ACTH (eg, small cell lung cancer) are completely resistant to feedback inhibition, and ACTH and cortisol will remain elevated following high doses of dexamethasone.",
