    "en": "A study aims to investigate the effectiveness of the topical application of tetracycline ointment in the prevention of surgical-site infection associated with resection of advanced oral cavity cancer. Fifty patients who underwent locoregional resection were assigned by chance to receive standard care alone or tetracycline-ointment in addition to standard care. The patients were then followed for 1 month and the number and severity of surgical-site infections were recorded for each group.",

    "en": "Research studies are classified as OBSERVATIONAL studies or EXPERIMENTAL studies. In OBSERVATIONAL designs, the researcher OBSERVES the effect of naturally occurring risk factors/exposures on outcomes of interest. In EXPERIMENTAL designs, the researcher RANDOMLY ASSIGNS interventions to potential participants to assess the effect of the controlled interventions. A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL is one of the simplest subtypes of experimental designs; it is an experiment in which PARTICIPANTS are RANDOMLY ALLOCATED to ≥2 GROUPS to assess the effect of SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS.",
    "zh": "研究分为观察性研究或实验性研究。在观察性设计中，研究者观察自然发生的风险因素/暴露对感兴趣结果的影响。在实验性设计中，研究者随机分配干预措施给潜在的参与者，以评估受控干预措施的效果。随机对照试验是实验性设计中最简单的亚型之一；它是一项实验，其中参与者被随机分配到 ≥2 个组中，以评估特定干预措施的效果。"
