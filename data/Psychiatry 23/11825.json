    "en": "A 14-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother due to unusual behavior over the past year. The mother is concerned that her daughter seems overly anxious about eating, and says, \"During lunch, she spent 45 minutes cutting the broccoli on her plate until all the pieces were the same size.\" The patient recently became a vegetarian and spends hours in the grocery store selecting vegetables and checking nutritional information. She also seems very concerned about her appearance; she brushes her hair 21 times on each side, parts her hair strand by strand, and plucks her eyebrows for an hour daily. The patient says, \"If I don't keep things exactly even I'm afraid something bad might happen.\" The patient is medically healthy and has not yet started menstruating. She weighs 45.8 kg (101 lb) and is 157.5 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall. BMI is 18.5 kg/m^2. Physical examination is normal with the exception of extremely sparse eyebrows.",

    "en": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by persistent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive, time-consuming rituals (compulsions) that the individual feels driven to perform to alleviate anxiety or prevent a feared event. This patient's repetitive behaviors with food and grooming appear to be compulsions performed in response to an obsession with symmetry and exactness, which is consistent with a primary diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Obsessions are persistent and unwanted thoughts, urges, or images that often drive an individual to perform compulsions: ritualistic behaviors or mental acts (eg, counting) to alleviate anxiety or prevent a feared event. In this situation, the patient's obsession with symmetry results in compulsions to cut her food into uniform pieces and groom her hair evenly to prevent a bad outcome. Compulsive behaviors in OCD are often illogical (eg, skipping over sidewalk cracks to prevent injury to a relative) or are excessive in nature (eg, checking if the front door is locked 50 times a day). For diagnosis, obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (>1 hr/day) or cause significant distress or functional impairment. OCD is typically a chronic disorder starting in childhood or adolescence.\n(Choice A) This patient has a normal BMI based on age and sex, and her unusual eating behaviors are related to her obsessions and compulsions rather than an intense fear of weight gain.\n(Choice B) In body dysmorphic disorder, individuals have a preoccupation with perceived defects in physical appearance. In contrast, this patient's eating and grooming rituals are driven by a symmetry obsession and the need to prevent a feared event.\n(Choice C) Generalized anxiety disorder involves excessive worry about multiple issues and is not associated with intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors.\n(Choice E) Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder involves a lifelong pattern of insistence on control, orderliness, and perfection and does not include frank obsessions and compulsions that are present in OCD. Personality disorders are generally not diagnosed before age 18 (or in young adolescents) and would not explain this patient's recurrent compulsions performed in response to anxiety-inducing obsessions.\n(Choice F) Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) involves recurrent pulling of hair and repeated attempts to decrease or stop the behavior. It would not be diagnosed in this patient who pulls out her hair as part of a symmetry obsession and compulsions.\n\nEducational objective: Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by persistent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive, time-consuming rituals (compulsions) that the individual feels driven to perform to alleviate anxiety.",
    "zh": "强迫症 (OCD) 的特征是持续的、不想要的 мысли（强迫观念）和重复的、耗时的仪式（强迫行为），个体感到不得不执行这些仪式以减轻焦虑或防止害怕的事件发生。 这位患者在食物和梳洗方面的重复行为似乎是针对对称性和精确性的强迫观念而进行的强迫行为，这与强迫症 (OCD) 的初步诊断一致。 强迫观念是持续且不想要的 мысли、冲动或意象，它们经常促使个体进行强迫行为：仪式行为或精神行为（例如，计数）以减轻焦虑或防止害怕的事件发生。 在这种情况下，患者对对称性的强迫观念导致她强迫将食物切成均匀的块并均匀地梳理头发以防止不良后果。 强迫症中的强迫行为通常是不合逻辑的（例如，跳过人行道裂缝以防止亲戚受伤）或本质上是过度的（例如，一天检查前门是否锁了 50 次）。 为了诊断，强迫观念或强迫行为必须耗时（>1 小时/天）或引起明显的痛苦或功能障碍。 强迫症通常是一种慢性疾病，始于儿童或青少年。\n(选项 A) 该患者根据年龄和性别具有正常的 BMI，并且她异常的进食行为与她的强迫观念和强迫行为有关，而不是对体重增加的强烈恐惧。\n(选项 B) 在躯体变形障碍中，个体会专注于对身体外貌上感知到的缺陷。 相比之下，这位患者的饮食和梳洗仪式是由对称性强迫观念和防止害怕事件的需求驱动的。\n(选项 C) 广泛性焦虑症涉及对多个问题的过度担忧，并且与侵入性 мысли和强迫行为无关。\n(选项 E) 强迫性人格障碍涉及终生坚持控制、秩序和完美的模式，并且不包括强迫症中存在的坦率的强迫观念和强迫行为。 人格障碍通常在 18 岁之前（或在青少年时期）不会被诊断出来，也不会解释这位患者因引起焦虑的强迫观念而重复进行的强迫行为。\n(选项 F) 拔毛癖（拔毛障碍）涉及反复拔毛以及反复试图减少或停止这种行为。 这种情况不会诊断为这位患者，因为她拔头发是由于对称性强迫观念和强迫行为。\n\n教育目标：强迫症的特征是持续的、不想要的 мысли（强迫观念）和重复的、耗时的仪式（强迫行为），个体感到不得不执行这些仪式以减轻焦虑。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), differentiating it from other psychiatric conditions with overlapping symptoms such as anorexia nervosa, body dysmorphic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, and trichotillomania. It requires the identification of obsessions and compulsions as the core features of OCD and their application to a clinical vignette.\nTo solve this question, carefully analyze the patient's reported behaviors and thoughts. Identify the presence of obsessions (intrusive, unwanted thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors performed to reduce anxiety or prevent a feared outcome). Evaluate each option based on the diagnostic criteria for the respective disorder, paying close attention to the primary drivers of the patient's symptoms and the specific nature of her rituals.",
