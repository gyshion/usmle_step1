The pain started as midline chest discomfort several hours ago but then progressively worsened such that the patient could not fall asleep. He received sublingual nitroglycerin in the ambulance without significant pain relief. His medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. ECG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm and ST-segment elevation in leads I, aVL, and V1-V4, with deep Q wave development over the next several hours.

    "en": "This patient presents with persistent substernal chest pain and ECG demonstrating ST elevation in the anterolateral leads has an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In the evolution of STEMI on ECG, peaked T waves in the affected leads are typically the first manifestation, followed by the appearance of ST elevation within several minutes, then Q waves within hours to days. Patients with STEMI typically have sudden-onset substernal chest pain that may be accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis, or dyspnea; the pain does not improve with rest or the administration of short-acting nitrates (eg, nitroglycerin).\n\nMyocardial infarction is usually caused by acute atherosclerotic plaque rupture with release of lipids, collagen, and tissue factor into the blood stream; because these contents are highly thrombogenic, there is rapid formation of overlying thrombus. In STEMI, the overlying thrombus is extensive enough to fully occlude the coronary artery lumen, completely blocking blood flow to a portion of the heart and leading to transmural (full-thickness) infarction of the myocardial wall. Partially obstructive thrombus (Choice E) is likely to produce non-STEMI or unstable angina. Non-STEMI is associated with impaired blood flow to only the subendocardial region; the symptomatic presentation is similar to STEMI, but ECG reveals ST segment and T wave abnormalities with no ST elevation.\n\n(Choice A) Atherosclerotic plaque obstructing 50% of the coronary artery lumen is likely to be asymptomatic. Symptoms of stable angina do not typically become prominent until >70% of the cross-sectional area of the coronary artery lumen is occluded.\n\n(Choice B) Atherosclerotic plaque obstructing 80% of the coronary artery lumen is likely to cause stable angina, characterized by substernal or left-sided chest pressure, tightness, or pain that is precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest or short-acting nitrates.\n\n(Choice D) Coronary artery vasospasm (vasospastic or Prinzmetal angina) results from hyperactivity of intimal smooth muscle, usually in the absence of significant atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. Transient anginal chest pain with corresponding ST elevation on ECG can occur; however, the chest pain should rapidly resolve with nitroglycerin.\n\nEducational objective:\nST-elevation myocardial infarction involves transmural (full-thickness) infarction of the myocardial wall, and usually results from acute atherosclerotic plaque rupture with the development of overlying thrombus that fully occludes the coronary artery lumen. It classically presents with sudden-onset substernal chest pain that is not relieved by rest or short-acting nitrates. ECG demonstrates ST elevation in the affected leads with subsequent development of Q waves.",
    "zh": "该患者表现为持续性胸骨下疼痛，心电图显示前外侧导联ST段抬高，诊断为ST段抬高型心肌梗死（STEMI）。在心电图上STEMI的演变过程中，受累导联T波尖耸通常是首要表现，随后会在几分钟内出现ST段抬高，然后会在数小时到数天内出现Q波。STEMI患者通常会出现突发性胸骨下疼痛，可能伴有恶心、出汗或呼吸困难；这种疼痛不会因休息或使用短效硝酸盐（如硝酸甘油）而缓解。\n\n心肌梗死通常由急性动脉粥样硬化斑块破裂引起，导致脂质、胶原蛋白和组织因子释放到血流中；由于这些物质具有高度血栓形成性，会迅速形成覆盖血栓。在STEMI中，覆盖血栓的范围足够大，可以完全阻塞冠状动脉管腔，完全阻断流向心脏一部分的血流，并导致心肌壁的透壁性（全厚度）梗死。部分阻塞性血栓（选项E）可能会导致非ST段抬高型心肌梗死（non-STEMI）或不稳定型心绞痛。非ST段抬高型心肌梗死与仅累及心内膜下区域的血流受损有关；其症状表现与STEMI相似，但心电图显示ST段和T波异常，无ST段抬高。\n\n（选项A）动脉粥样硬化斑块阻塞冠状动脉管腔的50%可能无症状。稳定型心绞痛的症状通常在冠状动脉管腔横截面积阻塞>70%时才变得明显。\n\n（选项B）动脉粥样硬化斑块阻塞冠状动脉管腔的80%可能会导致稳定型心绞痛，其特征是胸骨下或左侧胸部压迫感、紧绷感或疼痛，由劳力诱发，休息或短效硝酸盐可缓解。\n\n（选项D）冠状动脉血管痉挛（血管痉挛性或Prinzmetal型心绞痛）是由内膜平滑肌的过度活动引起的，通常在没有明显的动脉粥样硬化性冠状动脉疾病的情况下发生。可发生短暂性心绞痛伴心电图上相应的ST段抬高；然而，胸痛应迅速用硝酸甘油缓解。\n\n教学目标：\nST段抬高型心肌梗死涉及心肌壁的透壁性（全厚度）梗死，通常由急性动脉粥样硬化斑块破裂并伴有覆盖血栓的形成引起，该血栓完全阻塞冠状动脉管腔。其典型表现为突发性胸骨下疼痛，不能通过休息或短效硝酸盐缓解。心电图显示受累导联ST段抬高，随后出现Q波。"
