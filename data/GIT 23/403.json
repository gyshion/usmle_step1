    "en": "Primary biliary cholangitis\n\nThis patient with fatigue, pruritus, jaundice, and elevated alkaline phosphatase has liver biopsy results consistent with PRIMARY BILIARY CHOLANGITIS (PBC), a chronic autoimmune disorder that disproportionately affects middle-aged women. PBC is characterized by T-cell-mediated destruction of the small intralobular bile ducts, which is visualized histologically as a dense lymphocytic inflammation of portal tracts with granulomatous destruction of interlobular bile ducts (ie, florid duct lesions).\n\nPBC typically develops insidiously; fatigue and pruritus are often the presenting symptoms. Cholestasis results in a characteristic pattern of liver injury (ie, elevated alkaline phosphatase, elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase, direct hyperbilirubinemia, normal or mildly elevated aminotransferases) and examination findings (eg, hepatomegaly, jaundice). Hypercholesterolemia is also common due to reduced cholesterol excretion. Elevated antimitochondrial antibodies are highly characteristic.\n\n(Choices A and B) Acute hepatitis B and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) both result in a hepatocellular, not a cholestatic, pattern of liver injury. Hepatitis B is characterized histologically by lobular mononuclear inflammation, hepatocyte balloon degeneration, and ground-glass hepatocytes, whereas AIH results in portal and periportal lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the liver (ie, interface hepatitis).\n\n(Choice D) Primary sclerosing cholangitis causes a cholestatic pattern of liver injury but it is identified histologically by fibrous obliteration of bile ducts, as well as concentric periductal deposition of connective tissue in an onion skin-like pattern. It is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis.\n\n(Choice E) Sarcoidosis can cause a cholestatic pattern of liver injury but is characterized by noncaseating granulomas with hepatic fibrosis and a multinucleated giant cell formation. The dense portal lymphocytic infiltration characteristic of PBC is not seen. In addition, most patients have symptoms of systemic sarcoidosis (eg, cough, hilar lymphadenopathy). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}\n\nEducational objective:\nPrimary biliary cholangitis is an autoimmune disorder that most commonly affects middle-aged women and is characterized by fatigue, pruritus, jaundice, cholestasis (eg, elevated alkaline phosphatase, elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase, direct hyperbilirubinemia), and antimitochondrial antibodies. Histologic findings include dense lymphocytic portal tract inflammation with granulomatous destruction of interlobular bile ducts.",
    "zh": "原发性胆汁性胆管炎\n\n该患者出现疲劳、瘙痒、黄疸和碱性磷酸酶升高，肝活检结果与原发性胆汁性胆管炎（PBC）一致，PBC是一种慢性自身免疫性疾病，对中年女性的影响尤为严重。PBC的特征是T细胞介导的小叶内胆管破坏，组织学上表现为门管区的密集淋巴细胞性炎症，伴有小叶间胆管肉芽肿性破坏（即，活跃性胆管病变）。\n\nPBC通常隐匿起病；疲劳和瘙痒通常是首发症状。胆汁淤积导致特征性的肝损伤模式（即，碱性磷酸酶升高、γ-谷氨酰转移酶升高、直接胆红素血症、转氨酶正常或轻度升高）和体格检查结果（如肝肿大、黄疸）。由于胆固醇排泄减少，高胆固醇血症也很常见。抗线粒体抗体升高具有高度特征性。\n\n（选项A和B） 急性乙型肝炎和自身免疫性肝炎（AIH）都会导致肝细胞性而非胆汁淤积性肝损伤模式。乙型肝炎的组织学特征是小叶单核细胞炎症、肝细胞气球样变性和磨玻璃样肝细胞，而AIH导致肝脏门管区和肝周淋巴浆细胞浸润（即，界面性肝炎）。\n\n（选项D） 原发性硬化性胆管炎引起胆汁淤积性肝损伤模式，但其组织学特征是胆管纤维性闭塞，以及洋葱皮样同心性管周结缔组织沉积。它与溃疡性结肠炎密切相关。\n\n（选项E） 结节病可引起胆汁淤积性肝损伤模式，但其特征是非干酪性肉芽肿，伴有肝纤维化和多核巨细胞形成。PBC的特征性密集门管区淋巴细胞浸润未见。此外，大多数患者有全身性结节病的症状（如咳嗽、肺门淋巴结病）。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}\n\n教育目标：\n原发性胆汁性胆管炎是一种自身免疫性疾病，最常见于中年女性，其特征是疲劳、瘙痒、黄疸、胆汁淤积（如碱性磷酸酶升高、γ-谷氨酰转移酶升高、直接胆红素血症）和抗线粒体抗体。组织学发现包括门管区密集淋巴细胞浸润，伴有小叶间胆管肉芽肿性破坏。"
