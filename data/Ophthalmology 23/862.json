    "en": "A 50-year-old woman who has had mild myopia for decades comes to the office for a routine physical examination. The patient has no chronic medical conditions and eats a healthy diet consisting of a variety of organically grown foods. She is excited because she rarely has to wear glasses or contacts anymore. Her visual acuity is 20/30 in both eyes without wearing her glasses. Which of the following conditions has the same etiology as the changes causing this patient's visual improvement?",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's improved visual acuity is due to the development of PRESBYOPIA, which is the age-related loss of the eye's ability to focus on near objects. Normally, when focusing on near objects, the CILIARY MUSCLE contracts, relaxing the zonular fibers, allowing the lens to become more convex so the image focuses on the retina. Starting around age 40-50, almost all individuals develop an inability to focus on near objects. In this condition, called presbyopia, progressive denaturation of lens proteins and changes in lens curvature cause the lens to become less elastic and lose its accommodating power. In most patients, this causes the image of near objects to focus BEHIND the retina, resulting in difficulty reading fine print and the need to hold objects farther away in order to see them clearly. However, in patients with mild MYOPIA (increased axial length with an image focused IN FRONT OF the retina), presbyopia can COMPENSATE for myopia by displacing the image backward, so that it focuses on the retina. These patients often note improvement in visual acuity with age as presbyopia develops.\n\nSkin rhytides (wrinkles) are also directly caused by CHRONOLOGICAL AGING (with a contribution from the harmful effects of ultraviolet light). With aging, skin becomes atrophic and fragile, with reduced elasticity and subdermal fat. There is dermal and epidermal thinning, flattening of the dermoepidermal junction, a decreased number of fibroblasts, and reduced synthesis and increased breakdown of collagen and elastin.\n\n(Choices A, B, and C) Although age is a risk factor for actinic keratoses, angle-closure glaucoma, and atherosclerosis, age-related changes themselves do not cause these conditions. Actinic keratoses (ie, premalignant lesions increasing squamous cell carcinoma risk) are rough, scaly, erythematous papules on sun-exposed areas that result from ultraviolet damage. Angle-closure glaucoma occurs due to impaired aqueous humor flow. Atherosclerosis is primarily attributable to hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and genetic (familial) predisposition.\n\n(Choice D) Femoral head osteonecrosis is associated with vasculitis (lupus), corticosteroid therapy, sickle cell disease, and alcohol use disorder. It is not an age-related condition and can occur in children (eg, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease).\n\nEducational objective:\nPresbyopia and skin wrinkles are age-related changes. Presbyopia occurs due to denaturation of structural proteins within the lens, leading to loss of lens elasticity which can result in improved vision in patients with mild myopia. Decreased synthesis and increased breakdown of collagen and elastin contribute to the development of skin wrinkles.",
    "zh": "该患者视力改善是由于老花眼的发展，老花眼是眼睛与年龄相关的失去聚焦近处物体的能力。通常情况下，当聚焦近处物体时，睫状肌收缩，放松晶状体悬韧带，使晶状体变得更凸，从而使图像聚焦在视网膜上。大约从 40-50 岁开始，几乎所有个体都会发展出无法聚焦近处物体的能力。在这种被称为老花眼的情况下，晶状体蛋白的进行性变性和晶状体曲率的变化导致晶状体弹性降低并失去调节能力。在大多数患者中，这会导致近处物体的图像聚焦在视网膜后方，导致难以阅读小字并需要将物体拿得更远才能看清楚。然而，对于患有轻度近视（轴向长度增加，图像聚焦在视网膜前方）的患者，老花眼可以通过将图像向后移动来代偿近视，从而使其聚焦在视网膜上。这些患者通常会注意到随着年龄的增长，随着老花眼的发展，视力有所改善。\n\n皮肤皱纹也直接由年龄增长引起（紫外线的有害影响也有贡献）。随着年龄的增长，皮肤变得萎缩和脆弱，弹性降低，皮下脂肪减少。真皮和表皮变薄，真皮-表皮连接处变平，成纤维细胞数量减少，胶原蛋白和弹性蛋白的合成减少，分解增加。\n\n（选项 A、B 和 C）虽然年龄是日光性角化病、闭角型青光眼和动脉粥样硬化的危险因素，但与年龄相关的变化本身并不会导致这些疾病。日光性角化病（即增加鳞状细胞癌风险的癌前病变）是暴露在阳光下的区域出现的粗糙、鳞状、红斑性丘疹，是紫外线损伤的结果。闭角型青光眼是由于房水流动受损引起的。动脉粥样硬化主要归因于高脂血症、高血压和遗传（家族性）易感性。\n\n（选项 D）股骨头坏死与血管炎（狼疮）、皮质类固醇治疗、镰状细胞病和酒精使用障碍有关。它不是与年龄相关的疾病，可以发生在儿童身上（例如，Legg-Calve-Perthes 病）。\n\n教育目标：\n老花眼和皮肤皱纹是与年龄相关的变化。老花眼是由于晶状体内结构蛋白变性引起的，导致晶状体弹性丧失，这可能导致轻度近视患者的视力改善。胶原蛋白和弹性蛋白的合成减少和分解增加有助于皮肤皱纹的形成。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of age-related physiological changes, specifically presbyopia and its effect on vision in myopic individuals, and the aging process of the skin leading to wrinkles. It requires differentiating these age-related changes from other pathological conditions that may be influenced by age but are not directly caused by it.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the cause of the patient's improved vision, which is the development of presbyopia compensating for pre-existing myopia. Then, the task is to find an option that shares a similar underlying etiology (age-related degenerative changes) with presbyopia. Recognizing that skin wrinkles are also a direct consequence of chronological aging and collagen/elastin breakdown is key to selecting the correct answer.",
