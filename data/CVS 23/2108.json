    "en": "A 71-year-old man comes to the office due to a 2-month history of progressive exertional dyspnea. The patient is unable to walk half a block without resting and can no longer climb stairs without stopping every few steps. He also has had difficulty sleeping due to repeatedly waking up at night feeling like he is suffocating. Physical examination shows bilateral lower extremity edema and distended neck veins. Cardiac auscultation findings over the apex are given below. This patient's auscultatory findings most likely reflect which of the following?",

    "en": "Cardiac auscultation in this patient reveals a low-frequency sound occurring just after S2, known as an S3. Although an S3 can be normal in young individuals and pregnant patients, in those age >40 it is typically a sign of left ventricular (LV) VOLUME OVERLOAD or FAILURE (causing exertional dyspnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea in this patient).\n\nIn early diastole, the ventricles relax and the atrioventricular valves open, allowing blood to rush in and fill the ventricles. An S3 is thought to represent reverberant sound created by blood entering an enlarged and overfilled ventricular cavity during RAPID PASSIVE FILLING. As a result, S3 is typically heard in pathologic settings causing high ventricular filling pressures and volume overload, particularly aortic or mitral regurgitation and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (eg, dilated cardiomyopathy).\n\n(Choice A) Aortic valve sclerosis may produce a midsystolic ejection murmur but would not produce an extra heart sound. Progression to severe aortic stenosis may eventually produce an S4 due to concentric LV hypertrophy and stiffening of the ventricular wall.\n\n(Choice B) Cardiac tamponade causes the restricted right ventricle to bulge into the left ventricle during inspiration. This phenomenon does not generate an auscultatory sound but does cause a >10 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure during inspiration (pulsus paradoxus).\n\n(Choice C) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can cause dynamic LV outflow obstruction, producing a crescendo-decrescendo ejection systolic murmur. The outflow obstruction can also cause systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, resulting in mitral regurgitation (holosystolic murmur).\n\n(Choice D) Elevated pulmonary arterial pressure (pulmonary hypertension) can present with exertional dyspnea and fatigue and eventual right ventricular failure (elevated jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema). However, auscultation reveals increased intensity of the pulmonic closure sound (P2), and affected patients typically lack nocturnal dyspnea due to intact LV function.\n\nEducational objective:\nAn S3 is a low-frequency sound that occurs just after S2 and is typically associated with ventricular volume overload. It is commonly heard in patients with mitral or aortic regurgitation or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (eg, dilated cardiomyopathy).",
    "zh": "该患者的心脏听诊显示在S2之后出现低频声音，称为S3。虽然S3在年轻人和孕妇中可能正常，但在40岁以上的人群中，它通常是左心室（LV）容量超负荷或衰竭的征象（在该患者中引起劳力性呼吸困难和阵发性夜间呼吸困难）。\n\n在舒张早期，心室舒张，房室瓣开放，允许血液涌入并充满心室。S3被认为代表血液在快速被动充盈期间进入增大和过度充盈的心室腔时产生的回声。因此，S3通常在病理情况下听到，导致高心室充盈压和容量超负荷，特别是主动脉或二尖瓣反流和射血分数降低的心力衰竭（例如，扩张型心肌病）。\n\n（选项 A）主动脉瓣硬化可能产生中收缩期喷射性杂音，但不会产生额外的心音。进展为重度主动脉瓣狭窄最终可能产生S4，这归因于心室壁的向心性左心室肥大和僵硬。\n\n（选项 B）心脏压塞导致受限的右心室在吸气期间膨入左心室。这种现象不会产生听诊声音，但在吸气期间会导致收缩压降低>10 mmHg（奇脉）。\n\n（选项 C）肥厚型心肌病可导致动态左心室流出道梗阻，产生渐强-减弱的喷射性收缩期杂音。流出道梗阻也可导致二尖瓣收缩期前移，导致二尖瓣反流（全收缩期杂音）。\n\n（选项 D）肺动脉压力升高（肺动脉高压）可表现为劳力性呼吸困难和疲劳，并最终导致右心室衰竭（颈静脉压升高，周围水肿）。然而，听诊显示肺动脉瓣关闭音（P2）的强度增加，并且受影响的患者通常缺乏夜间呼吸困难，这归因于左心室功能完整。\n\n教育目的：\nS3是一种低频声音，发生在S2之后，通常与心室容量超负荷相关。它常见于二尖瓣或主动脉瓣反流或射血分数降低的心力衰竭（例如，扩张型心肌病）的患者。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize the significance of an S3 heart sound in an elderly patient presenting with symptoms of heart failure. It requires knowledge of the pathophysiology behind S3 generation and its association with volume overload and ventricular dysfunction.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the S3 heart sound described in the vignette and associating it with the patient's symptoms of dyspnea, edema, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Understanding the underlying causes of an S3, such as heart failure or valvular regurgitation, helps to narrow down the possible diagnoses.",
