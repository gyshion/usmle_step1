  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's forehead lesions are characteristic of actinic keratoses (AKs), which are small, scaly, erythematous lesions with a sandpaper texture occurring on sun-exposed areas. On light microscopy, AKs show hyperkeratosis (hyperplasia of the stratum corneum), parakeratosis (retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum), and atypical keratinocytes with pleomorphic nuclei and multiple mitoses. There may also be pigment irregularities and dilated blood vessels affecting the surrounding skin, which are consistent with chronic sun exposure. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}\n\nAKs do not invade the dermis and are considered to be premalignant lesions. Over several years, a small percentage of AKs transform into invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a change reflected by an increase in lesion size and thickness, dermal invasion, and metastatic potential.\n\n(Choice A) Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer. It arises on sun-exposed areas and has a very low tendency to metastasize (in contrast to melanoma). BCC often presents as pearly papules with central depression or ulceration. Histologically, BCC features nests of basaloid cells and peripheral palisading of nuclei. It is far more likely for AK to progress to SCC than to BCC.\n\n(Choice B) Dermatofibromas (superficial benign fibrous histiocytomas) result from the benign proliferation of fibroblasts. They commonly arise on the lower extremities as solitary nodules.\n\n(Choice C) Kaposi sarcoma is associated with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) and classically occurs in patients with HIV. Lesions typically appear as palpable macules, plaques, and nodules that are usually a dark brown to violet color.\n\n(Choice D) Melanoma is a cancer arising from the malignant transformation of melanocytes. Lesions have irregular borders and marked color variegation. AK is not a precursor to melanoma.\n\n(Choice E) Psoriasis commonly presents as hyperkeratotic plaques that affect the scalp, knees, and elbows. It is characterized histologically by clubbed rete ridges, hyperkeratosis, neutrophils in the stratum corneum, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates.\n\nEducational objective:\nActinic keratoses (AKs) are small (usually <1 cm), erythematous epidermal lesions with adherent scale that are the result of chronic sun exposure. Histologic findings include keratinocyte atypia, hyperkeratosis, and parakeratosis. A small percentage of AKs progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma; therefore, frequent monitoring is necessary.",
    "zh": "该患者的额部皮损是光化性角化病（AKs）的特征，光化性角化病是发生在阳光照射区域的小的、鳞屑状的、红斑性皮损，具有砂纸样质地。在光学显微镜下，AKs显示角化过度（角质层增生）、角化不全（角质层中核的保留）和非典型角质细胞，具有多形性核和多发有丝分裂。周围皮肤也可能出现色素不规则和血管扩张，这与长期日晒有关。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}\n\nAKs不侵入真皮，被认为是癌前病变。在几年内，一小部分AKs会转化为浸润性鳞状细胞癌（SCC），这种变化反映在皮损大小和厚度的增加、真皮浸润和转移潜力。\n\n（选项A）基底细胞癌（BCC）是最常见的皮肤癌。它发生在阳光照射区域，并且转移的倾向非常低（与黑色素瘤相比）。BCC通常表现为珍珠状丘疹，伴有中央凹陷或溃疡。在组织学上，BCC具有基底样细胞巢和核的周边栅栏状排列。AK发展为SCC的可能性远大于BCC。\n\n（选项B）皮纤维瘤（浅表良性纤维组织细胞瘤）是由成纤维细胞的良性增生引起的。它们通常出现在下肢上，呈孤立结节。\n\n（选项C）卡波西肉瘤与人疱疹病毒8型（HHV-8）相关，经典上发生在HIV感染患者中。病变通常表现为可触及的斑疹、斑块和结节，通常呈深棕色至紫罗兰色。\n\n（选项D）黑色素瘤是一种由黑色素细胞恶性转化引起的癌症。皮损具有不规则的边缘和明显的颜色变化。AK不是黑色素瘤的先兆。\n\n（选项E）银屑病通常表现为影响头皮、膝盖和肘部的角化过度斑块。它的组织学特征是杵状钉突、角化过度、角质层中的中性粒细胞和血管周围淋巴细胞浸润。\n\n教育目的：\n光化性角化病（AKs）是小的（通常<1厘米）、红斑性表皮病变，具有粘附性鳞屑，是长期日晒的结果。组织学发现包括角质细胞异型性、角化过度和角化不全。一小部分AKs会发展为浸润性鳞状细胞癌；因此，需要经常监测。"
