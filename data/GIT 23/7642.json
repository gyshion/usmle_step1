    "en": "A 32-year-old man is evaluated due to several weeks of watery diarrhea. He has also had intermittent, crampy abdominal pain and has lost 7.0 kg (15.4 lb) during this period. The patient has a history of HIV and was hospitalized 6 months ago for *Pneumocystis* pneumonia. On physical examination, the patient is afebrile and the abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly. Stool tests for leukocytes and occult blood are negative. Endoscopy is performed and mucosal biopsy shows an inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria and pathogens lining the epithelium, as shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",

    "en": "**Cryptosporidiosis**\n\nPathogenesis:\n*   Fecal-oral transmission (eg, contaminated water, animal contact)\n*   Oocyte ingestion\n*   sporozoite attachment to intestinal epithelium\n*   intraluminal meront formation\n*   fecal oocyte shedding\n\nClinical manifestations:\n*   Immunocompetent: self-resolving, watery (noninflammatory) diarrhea <2 weeks\n*   Immunosuppressed (eg, AIDS, transplant recipient): prolonged, severe diarrhea with weight loss/malabsorption\n\nDiagnosis:\n*   Stool PCR testing\n*   Stool microscopy: acid-fast staining oocysts or immunofluorescent assay\n*   Histology: basophilic *Cryptosporidium* organisms on intestinal brush border, small intestinal villous blunting, lamina propria inflammation\n\n*Cryptosporidium* is a protozoan that causes infectious diarrhea. Oocysts are ingested in contaminated water (less commonly in food), travel to the small intestine, and shed sporozoites that attach to **epithelial cells**. They then mature intraluminally into meronts capable of invading new host intestinal cells (eg, auto-infection) as well as producing oocytes that are then shed in feces.\n\nPatients who are otherwise healthy develop self-limited, **watery diarrhea** that typically lasts <2 weeks. However, those with impaired cell-mediated immunity—particularly individuals with **AIDS** (as is likely in this patient with HIV who recently had *Pneumocystis* pneumonia)—are at risk for life-threatening diarrhea with fluid loss sometimes exceeding >20 L per day.\n\nThe diagnosis can be made by stool PCR testing or modified **acid-fast stain**, which usually reveals *Cryptosporidium* oocysts. Standard ova and parasite stool tests cannot detect the organism, and fecal leukocytes/occult blood tests are often negative (ie, noninflammatory). Histopathologic findings include small intestinal villous blunting, inflammatory infiltration within the lamina propria, and **basophilic *Cryptosporidium* organisms** on the mucosal brush border.\n\n(Choice B) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) enterocolitis in immunosuppressed patients may cause profuse diarrhea, but biopsies of CMV-infected tissues reveal large cells with **intranuclear** and **intracytoplasmic inclusions** (eg, owl's eye appearance); organisms lining the epithelium would not be seen. In addition, most patients have abdominal pain and fever.\n\n(Choice C) *Entamoeba histolytica* is a protozoan that usually causes dysentery (bloody diarrhea); this patient's negative fecal leukocytes and blood make this diagnosis less likely. Moreover, histopathology generally reveals flask-shaped colonic ulcers with \"foamy\" trophozoites that resemble macrophages.\n\n(Choice D) *Giardia lamblia* is a protozoan that causes foul-smelling, oily diarrhea (steatorrhea) from fat malabsorption, which can lead to weight loss. Unlike this case, stool microscopy shows oval-shaped cysts and flagellated pear-shaped trophozoites with two large central nuclei.\n\n(Choice E) *Mycobacterium avium* complex is an opportunistic infection in patients with advanced HIV (CD4 count <50/mm3) and often causes watery diarrhea and weight loss. However, the organism rapidly penetrates the mucosa and disseminates throughout the reticuloendothelial system (eg, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly); it does not remain attached to the intestinal mucosa.\n\nEducational objective:\n*Cryptosporidium* may lead to severe and protracted diarrhea in immunocompromised patients (eg, advanced HIV). Diagnosis is usually made by visualizing acid-fast staining oocysts in the stool. The presence of basophilic organisms lining the brush border on intestinal histopathology is also diagnostic. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of opportunistic infections causing chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, specifically Cryptosporidium parvum in HIV patients. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation and diagnostic methods for Cryptosporidiosis. \n\nThe best approach is to consider the patient's HIV status and recent Pneumocystis pneumonia, which suggests an immunocompromised state.
