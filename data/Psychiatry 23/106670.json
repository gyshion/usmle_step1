    "en": "A 19-year-old man is brought to the office by his mother due to uncharacteristic behaviors. A year ago, the patient's father died unexpectedly in a motor vehicle collision. Afterward, the patient became increasingly withdrawn and stopped responding to his friends' text messages. He became disinterested in completing homework assignments and did not graduate from high school due to failing grades. For the past few months, the patient has spent most of the time alone in his room, listening to music and drawing. His mother says, \"All of his drawings are of numbers in different colors and sizes. He's been fixated on the date and time that his dad died and thinks that they have special meanings.\" The patient is difficult to follow in conversation, changing topics frequently and making random remarks. On mental status examination, he pauses before answering questions and provides brief, unrelated responses. The patient does not make eye contact, and his affect is blunted. He has no suicidal ideation or hallucinations.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms that are highly suggestive of SCHIZOPHRENIA. The onset of symptoms occurred after a significant stressor (father's death), which is common in schizophrenia. Key features include social withdrawal, disinterest in activities, fixation on specific details (date and time of father's death) with the belief that they have special meanings (delusions), disorganized speech (frequent topic changes, random remarks), and blunted affect (negative symptoms). The diagnosis of schizophrenia requires continuous signs of disturbance for at least 6 months, including at least 1 month of active-phase symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, negative symptoms). This patient's symptoms, particularly the delusions and disorganized speech, along with negative symptoms like social withdrawal and blunted affect, meet these criteria.\n\n(Choice A) DELUSIONAL DISORDER is characterized by the presence of one or more delusions for at least 1 month, without other prominent psychotic symptoms. While this patient has delusions, he also exhibits disorganized speech and negative symptoms, which are not typical of delusional disorder.\n\n(Choice B) NORMAL BEREAVEMENT involves grief and sadness following a loss. While the patient's symptoms began after his father's death, his persistent social withdrawal, disorganized speech, and delusions go beyond normal grief and indicate a more severe psychiatric disorder.\n\n(Choice C) OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD) is characterized by obsessions and compulsions. While the patient's fixation on the date and time might seem obsessive, the overall presentation, including disorganized speech and blunted affect, is not consistent with OCD. Furthermore, the belief that these details have 'special meanings' points more towards delusions than obsessions.\n\n(Choice D) POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) involves re-experiencing the traumatic event, avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, and negative alterations in cognitions and mood. While the patient experienced a traumatic event, his primary symptoms are delusions and disorganized speech, not the characteristic intrusive memories, nightmares, or hyperarousal of PTSD. The patient does not report hallucinations, which can sometimes occur in PTSD but are not the defining feature.\n\nKey clinical pearls: SCHIZOPHRENIA is a chronic psychotic disorder characterized by positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech) and negative symptoms (apathy, social withdrawal, blunted affect). The diagnosis requires a significant duration of symptoms and impairment in functioning. The onset is typically in early adulthood. The precipitating stressor in this case unmasked the underlying disorder.",
    "zh": "患者表现出一系列高度提示精神分裂症的症状。症状的出现发生在重大压力源（父亲去世）之后，这在精神分裂症中很常见。关键特征包括社交退缩、对活动失去兴趣、执着于特定细节（父亲去世的日期和时间），并相信它们有特殊的含义（妄想）、思维紊乱（频繁更换话题，随机评论）和情感迟钝（阴性症状）。精神分裂症的诊断需要持续至少6个月的紊乱征兆，包括至少1个月的活跃期症状（妄想、幻觉、思维紊乱、严重紊乱或紧张症行为、阴性症状）。该患者的症状，特别是妄想和思维紊乱，以及社交退缩和情感迟钝等阴性症状，符合这些标准。\n\n（选项A）妄想症的特征是存在一个或多个妄想至少1个月，没有其他突出的精神病症状。虽然该患者有妄想，但他也有思维紊乱和阴性症状，这些都不是妄想症的典型表现。\n\n（选项B）正常哀伤涉及失去后的悲伤和悲痛。虽然患者的症状始于他父亲去世后，但他持续的社交退缩、思维紊乱和妄想超出了正常悲伤的范围，表明存在更严重的精神疾病。\n\n（选项C）强迫症（OCD）的特征是强迫观念和强迫行为。虽然患者对日期和时间的执着看起来可能像是强迫症，但整体表现，包括思维紊乱和情感迟钝，与强迫症不符。此外，认为这些细节有“特殊含义”更多地指向妄想而不是强迫观念。\n\n（选项D）创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）涉及重新体验创伤事件、回避与创伤相关的刺激以及认知和情绪方面的负面改变。虽然患者经历了一次创伤事件，但他的主要症状是妄想和思维紊乱，而不是PTSD的特征性侵入性记忆、噩梦或过度警觉。患者没有报告幻觉，幻觉有时可能发生在PTSD中，但不是其定义特征。\n\n关键临床要点：精神分裂症是一种慢性精神病性疾病，其特征是阳性症状（幻觉、妄想、思维紊乱）和阴性症状（冷漠、社交退缩、情感迟钝）。诊断需要持续相当长时间的症状和功能受损。起病通常在成年早期。在这种情况下，诱发性应激源揭示了潜在的疾病。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to diagnose schizophrenia based on a patient's presentation, differentiating it from other psychiatric disorders that may share some overlapping symptoms. It requires understanding the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, including positive and negative symptoms, and their duration.\n\nTo solve this question, carefully analyze the patient's symptoms, paying close attention to the presence of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and negative symptoms.
