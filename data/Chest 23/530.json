    "en": "A 34-year-old woman comes to the office due to progressive exertional dyspnea for the past 6 months. She has no chest pain, lightheadedness, or syncope. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. The patient's mother died of pulmonary arterial hypertension at age 32. Blood pressure is 125/74 mm Hg and pulse is 75/min. BMI is 23 kg/m². On physical examination, breath sounds are clear without wheezes or crackles. There is a loud S2 at the left upper sternal border. Chest x-ray reveals clear lungs. ECG shows right axis deviation. If this patient's condition is inherited, which of the following is the most likely direct cause of her disease? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient's presentation and family history are suggestive of PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (PAH). Hereditary PAH is most often due to an inactivating mutation in BMPR2, which is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner with variable penetrance. Patients with this mutation have a predisposition for dysfunctional endothelial and SMOOTH MUSCLE CELL PROLIFERATION. An insult (eg, infection, drugs) is thought to then activate the disease process, which involves increased levels of vasoconstrictive, proliferative mediators (eg, endothelin) and decreased levels of vasodilative, antiproliferative mediators (eg, nitric oxide, prostacyclin). The end result is vasoconstriction with vascular smooth muscle proliferation, intimal thickening and fibrosis, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and progressive pulmonary hypertension. Increased pulmonary artery pressure can cause dyspnea and fatigue and can often be detected as a LOUD pulmonic component of S2. Significant pulmonary hypertension leads to compensatory right ventricular hypertrophy (Choice C), which may cause right axis deviation on ECG. Right-sided heart failure can eventually occur, evidenced by elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatic congestion, and peripheral edema. The lungs remain clear in PAH as the lung parenchyma is unaffected.\n\n(Choice A) Elevated left atrial pressure is indicative of heart failure, most commonly due to left ventricular dysfunction. The elevated pressure transmits back to the pulmonary venous system and can lead to pulmonary hypertension; however, evidence of pulmonary edema (eg, crackles, pulmonary congestion on chest x-ray) would be expected.\n\n(Choice B) Excessive hypoxic vasoconstriction of the pulmonary arteries can lead to pulmonary hypertension in patients with severe hypoxic lung disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. However, this patient's normal chest x-ray and BMI rule out these disorders.\n\n(Choice D) Chronic pulmonary arterial thromboembolism decreases the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vasculature and can lead to pulmonary hypertension. However, PAH is more likely in this patient with a positive family history and no evidence of venous thromboembolism. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现和家族史提示肺动脉高压（PAH）。遗传性PAH通常是由于BMPR2基因失活突变引起的，该突变以常染色体显性方式遗传，具有可变的穿透性。携带这种突变的患者易患内皮功能障碍和平滑肌细胞增生。随后，某种损伤（例如，感染、药物）被认为会激活疾病过程，这涉及增加血管收缩、增殖介质（例如，内皮素）的水平，并降低舒张血管、抗增殖介质（例如，一氧化氮、前列环素）的水平。最终结果是血管收缩，伴随血管平滑肌增生、内膜增厚和纤维化、肺血管阻力增加和进行性肺动脉高压。肺动脉压力升高可引起呼吸困难和疲劳，并且通常可检测为响亮的S2肺动脉瓣成分。显著的肺动脉高压会导致代偿性右心室肥大（选项C），这可能导致心电图上出现右轴偏离。右心衰竭最终可能发生，表现为颈静脉压升高、肝淤血和外周水肿。肺在PAH中保持清晰，因为肺实质未受影响。\n\n（选项A）左心房压力升高提示心力衰竭，最常见的原因是左心室功能障碍。升高的压力会传递回肺静脉系统，并可能导致肺动脉高压；然而，预计会出现肺水肿的证据（例如，啰音、胸片上的肺充血）。\n\n（选项B）肺动脉过度低氧性血管收缩可导致严重低氧性肺病患者出现肺动脉高压，包括慢性阻塞性肺病、间质性肺病和肥胖性低通气综合征。然而，该患者正常的胸片和BMI排除了这些疾病。\n\n（选项D）慢性肺动脉血栓栓塞会降低肺血管的横截面积，并可能导致肺动脉高压。然而，对于有阳性家族史且无静脉血栓栓塞证据的该患者，PAH的可能性更大。 {{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), specifically the genetic basis and cellular mechanisms involved in hereditary PAH. It requires understanding the role of BMPR2 mutations and subsequent vascular remodeling.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the clinical presentation suggestive of PAH, consider the family history indicating a genetic component, and then identify the underlying cellular process most directly linked to the disease's development, which is vascular smooth muscle proliferation.",
