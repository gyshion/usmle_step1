    "en": "A 44-year-old man comes to the office due to increasing shortness of breath. While climbing the stairs to his second-floor apartment, the patient must now stop halfway to catch his breath. He has a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. After evaluation, treatment with a new medication is begun that improves his symptoms by increasing urine output and decreasing peripheral vascular resistance. The medication works by inhibiting a metalloprotease to prolong the action of endogenous polypeptides. These polypeptides are most likely secreted by which of the following cell types?",

    "en": "In response to myocardial stretching due to volume overload, atrial and ventricular CARDIOMYOCYTES secrete ATRIAL NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE (ANP) and BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE (BNP). These peptides are subsequently broken down and inactivated by the metalloprotease NEPRILYSIN. This patient with CHRONIC HEART FAILURE was most likely given a NEPRILYSIN INHIBITOR (eg, sacubitril), allowing for enhanced activity of ANP and BNP. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nOnce secreted, ANP and BNP bind to natriuretic peptide receptors to activate guanylate cyclase and form cyclic GMP, which stimulates DIURESIS and peripheral VASODILATION to help alleviate volume overload. Several organs and tissues are affected as follows:\n\n*   **Kidneys:** The afferent arterioles are dilated and the efferent arterioles are constricted, raising the glomerular filtration rate and increasing urinary EXCRETION of sodium and water. Renin secretion from the juxtaglomerular cells is inhibited (**Choice E**), counteracting renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) activity.\n*   **Adrenal glands:** Secretion of aldosterone from the zona glomerulosa cells is inhibited (**Choice A**), further counteracting RAAS activity and bolstering the increase in sodium and water excretion.\n*   **Blood vessels:** Arteriolar and venular smooth muscle relaxes, producing vasodilation. There is also increased capillary permeability, leading to fluid extravasation into the INTERSTITIUM and a decrease in circulating blood volume.\n\n(**Choice C**) Hepatic stellate cells (perisinusoidal cells of Ito) may help regulate hepatic blood flow via release of local mediators; however, these cells do not play a significant role in heart failure.\n\n(**Choice D**) Myocardial Purkinje fibers facilitate the organized transport of electrical impulses from the sinoatrial node through the atria, atrioventricular node, and ventricles; however, these fibers are not known to have endocrine function.\n\n(**Choice F**) Vascular endothelial cells regulate systemic blood flow via release of vasodilators, such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin, and vasoconstrictors, such as endothelin and thromboxane A2. However, these local mediators are not a significant target of therapy for chronic heart failure.\n\nEducational objective:\nAtrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are secreted by atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes in response to myocardial stretching induced by hypervolemia. These natriuretic peptides inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and stimulate peripheral vasodilation and increased urinary excretion of sodium and water. Neprilysin inhibitors (eg, sacubitril) prevent the degradation of ANP and BNP, enhancing their beneficial effects in heart failure.",
    "zh": "为了应对由于容量超负荷引起的心肌牵张，心房和心室心肌细胞分泌心房利钠肽 (ANP) 和脑利钠肽 (BNP)。这些肽随后被金属蛋白酶脑啡肽酶降解并失活。这名患有慢性心力衰竭的患者很可能接受了脑啡肽酶抑制剂（如沙库巴曲），从而增强了 ANP 和 BNP 的活性。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n一旦分泌，ANP 和 BNP 就会与利钠肽受体结合，激活鸟苷酸环化酶并形成环状 GMP，从而刺激利尿和外周血管舒张，以帮助减轻容量超负荷。几个器官和组织受到以下影响：\n\n*   **肾脏：** 入球小动脉扩张，出球小动脉收缩，从而提高肾小球滤过率并增加钠和水的尿排泄。肾近球细胞分泌肾素受到抑制（**选项 E**），从而抵消了肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统 (RAAS) 的活性。\n*   **肾上腺：** 球状带细胞分泌醛固酮受到抑制（**选项 A**），从而进一步抵消 RAAS 的活性并促进钠和水的排泄增加。\n*   **血管：** 动脉和小静脉平滑肌松弛，产生血管舒张。毛细血管通透性也增加，导致液体外渗到间质中，从而减少循环血容量。\n\n（**选项 C**）肝星状细胞（伊托细胞）可以通过释放局部介质来帮助调节肝血流量；然而，这些细胞在心力衰竭中没有发挥重要作用。\n\n（**选项 D**）心肌浦肯野纤维促进电脉冲从窦房结通过心房、房室结和心室的有组织传导；然而，已知这些纤维没有内分泌功能。\n\n（**选项 F**）血管内皮细胞通过释放血管舒张剂（如一氧化氮和前列环素）和血管收缩剂（如内皮素和血栓素 A2）来调节全身血流。然而，这些局部介质不是慢性心力衰竭治疗的重要靶点。\n\n教学目标：\n心房利钠肽 (ANP) 和脑利钠肽 (BNP) 由心房和心室心肌细胞分泌，以应对高血容量引起的心肌牵张。这些利钠肽抑制肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统，并刺激外周血管舒张和增加钠和水的尿排泄。脑啡肽酶抑制剂（如沙库巴曲）可防止 ANP 和 BNP 的降解，从而增强其在心力衰竭中的有益作用。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of neprilysin inhibitors in heart failure, specifically how they prolong the effects of atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP). It also tests the source of these peptides. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the medication is a neprilysin inhibitor, which increases ANP and BNP levels. These peptides are secreted by cardiomyocytes in response to myocardial stretching. Therefore, the correct answer is the cell type that produces these peptides.",
