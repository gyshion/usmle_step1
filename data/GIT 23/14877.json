    "en": "A 42-year-old woman comes to the office due to frequent episodes of burning in her chest and small amounts of regurgitation after meals and at nighttime. Medical history includes hypertension. Vital signs are within normal limits. BMI is 30 kg/m². There is no abdominal tenderness and the remainder of the physical examination is normal. The patient shows the clinician an over-the-counter antacid that she has been taking to relieve her symptoms. The preparation contains a combination of magnesium and aluminum hydroxide. Which of the following is the most likely rationale for combining both mineral salts in this antacid preparation?",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Magnesium salts (eg, magnesium trisilicate, magnesium hydroxide) and aluminum hydroxide are weak alkali mineral salts. They temporarily increase the gastric pH by neutralizing hydrochloric acid, helping to relieve gastroesophageal reflux symptoms.\n\nAluminum hydroxide has a tendency to cause constipation due to interactions with intestinal secretions that form insoluble salts. In contrast, magnesium salts cause osmotic diarrhea. Therefore, the two medications are combined to offset the adverse effects of the individual medications. Patients with reflux symptoms and chronic constipation may benefit from magnesium salt monotherapy, whereas aluminum hydroxide monotherapy may be of value in patients with chronic diarrhea.\n\n(Choice A) Aluminum, when absorbed in large doses, causes osteomalacia, bone pain, hypercalcemia, and dementia. Aluminum absorption in the gastrointestinal tract is minimal from the salt form, and toxicity tends to occur in patients with chronic kidney disease that limits renal excretion. Combination therapy does not alter systemic absorption.\n\n(Choice B) Drug interactions are common with antacid medications, largely due to pH-related changes in protein binding, absorption, or elimination of the drugs. Combining multiple alkalinizing agents would not minimize their effects on other drugs.\n\n(Choice C) Rebound acid hypersecretion can occur with calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, and proton pump inhibitors. This is likely due to increased gastrin release as a result of gastric alkalinization or (in the case of calcium salts) direct ionic stimulation.\n\n(Choice E) Milk-alkali syndrome is caused by excessive use of calcium carbonate antacids and is characterized by hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and renal dysfunction. Kidney injury occurs due to both hypercalcemia-induced renal vasoconstriction and calcium-induced diuresis. The resultant volume depletion, decreased glomerular filtration rate, and alkali intake lead to a metabolic alkalosis. However, severe alkalosis can occur with all antacids, and the combination of magnesium and aluminum would not decrease this risk.",
    "zh": "镁盐（例如，三硅酸镁、氢氧化镁）和氢氧化铝是弱碱性矿物盐。它们通过中和盐酸来暂时增加胃pH值，有助于缓解胃食管反流症状。\n\n由于与形成不溶性盐的肠道分泌物相互作用，氢氧化铝有引起便秘的倾向。相反，镁盐会导致渗透性腹泻。因此，将这两种药物结合使用可以抵消每种药物的不良反应。患有反流症状和慢性便秘的患者可能受益于镁盐单药治疗，而氢氧化铝单药治疗可能对患有慢性腹泻的患者有价值。\n\n（选项A）铝在大量吸收时会导致骨软化症、骨痛、高钙血症和痴呆。铝从盐形式在胃肠道中的吸收量极少，毒性往往发生在限制肾脏排泄的慢性肾脏疾病患者中。联合治疗不会改变全身吸收。\n\n（选项B）抗酸药的药物相互作用很常见，这主要是由于pH值相关的蛋白质结合、药物吸收或消除的变化。联合使用多种碱化剂并不能最大限度地减少它们对其他药物的影响。\n\n（选项C）反弹性酸过度分泌可能发生在碳酸钙、氢氧化镁、氢氧化铝和质子泵抑制剂中。这很可能是由于胃碱化或（对于钙盐）直接离子刺激导致胃泌素释放增加。\n\n（选项E）乳碱综合征是由过量使用碳酸钙抗酸剂引起的，其特征是高钙血症、碱中毒和肾功能障碍。肾损伤是由于高钙血症引起的肾血管收缩和钙引起的利尿所致。由此产生的血容量减少、肾小球滤过率降低和碱摄入导致代谢性碱中毒。然而，所有抗酸剂都可能发生严重碱中毒，镁和铝的组合并不能降低这种风险。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of antacid medications, specifically the rationale for combining magnesium and aluminum hydroxide in a single preparation. It assesses understanding of their individual side effects and how they can be used to counteract each other.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that aluminum hydroxide causes constipation, while magnesium salts cause diarrhea. Combining them helps to minimize these adverse effects, making the medication more tolerable for patients.",
