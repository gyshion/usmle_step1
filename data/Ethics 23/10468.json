I'm going to do whatever I can to be around for my kids.\"",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The physician is confronted with a patient who is in denial about his terminal illness and remains unrealistically hopeful about surviving pancreatic cancer. Patient reactions to terminal illness are variable and mediated by coping style, personality, culture, values, and religious beliefs. Patients may go through 5 stages in coping with terminal illness (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance). However, patients do not necessarily experience all the stages of grief or in a prescribed sequence.\n\nHope, even when unrealistic, can be a powerful mechanism to help patients cope with pain, fear of death, and the ordeal of treatment. If the patient's denial is not interfering with receiving necessary medical care or discussing his goals regarding end-of-life care, it should not be confronted. The physician should be supportive of the patient's hopeful perspective, and at the same time, engage him in discussion regarding important end-of-life care decisions.\n\n(Choices A, B, and D) These responses confront the patient's denial by refuting hope and challenging his self-concept that he is a \"survivor\" who can beat cancer. They focus on what the physician thinks is important, rather than acknowledging where the patient is emotionally. These statements may be perceived as unsupportive and harsh and have a detrimental effect on the patient's ability to cope with the stress of a terminal illness. If the patient's denial is not interfering with his care, it should not be confronted.\n\n(Choice E) Patients cope with terminal illness differently and should not be pressured to deal with any emotional issue unless it is interfering with medical care or significant relationships.\n\nEducational objective:\nDenial is commonly experienced by patients diagnosed with terminal illness and can help them cope with overwhelming thoughts and feelings. When denial is not interfering with receiving end-of-life care or discussing goals of care, it should not be confronted.",
    "zh": "医生面对的病人正在否认他的晚期疾病，并且对战胜胰腺癌保持着不切实际的希望。患者对晚期疾病的反应是多变的，并受应对方式、性格、文化、价值观和宗教信仰的影响。患者可能会经历应对晚期疾病的5个阶段（否认、愤怒、讨价还价、抑郁、接受）。然而，患者不一定按照规定的顺序经历所有悲伤的阶段。\n\n希望，即使是不切实际的，也可以成为帮助患者应对疼痛、对死亡的恐惧和治疗的考验的有力机制。如果患者的否认没有干扰接受必要的医疗护理或讨论他关于临终关怀的目标，则不应与之对抗。医生应该支持患者的希望观点，同时，让他参与讨论关于重要的临终关怀决定。\n\n（选项 A、B 和 D）这些回答通过反驳希望并挑战他作为可以战胜癌症的“幸存者”的自我概念来对抗患者的否认。它们侧重于医生认为重要的事情，而不是承认患者的情感状况。这些陈述可能被认为是缺乏支持和严厉的，并且对患者应对晚期疾病的压力能力产生不利影响。如果患者的否认没有干扰他的护理，则不应与之对抗。\n\n（选项 E）患者应对晚期疾病的方式各不相同，不应强迫他们处理任何情感问题，除非它干扰医疗护理或重要关系。\n\n教育目标：\n否认是晚期疾病患者的常见经历，可以帮助他们应对压倒性的想法和感受。当否认没有干扰接受临终关怀或讨论护理目标时，不应与之对抗。"
