    "en": "A 26-year-old woman comes to the office due to several weeks of pain and muffled hearing in the left ear, along with a sensation of jaw clicking when chewing food. The patient has had episodic headaches and left-sided facial pain for several years that is worse when moving her jaw. She also has been told that she grinds her teeth while asleep. On examination, the patient is unable to fully open her mouth and reports pain with passive movement of the jaw. The external auditory canal and tympanic membrane are normal. A disorder affecting pterygoid muscle contractility is suspected.",
    "zh": "一名26岁的女性因左耳疼痛和听力减退数周前来就诊，同时伴有咀嚼食物时下颌关节弹响感。患者数年来一直有阵发性头痛和左侧面部疼痛，活动下颌时加重。她还被告知她在睡觉时会磨牙。检查时，患者无法完全张开嘴，并报告被动活动下颌时疼痛。外耳道和鼓膜正常。怀疑患有影响翼肌收缩的疾病。"

    "en": "This patient's facial pain, headaches, jaw dysfunction, and ear pain/muffled hearing are characteristic of TEMPOROMANDIBULAR DISORDER (TMD). The underlying etiology of TMD is multifactorial but includes temporomandibular joint (TMJ) derangement (eg, jaw misalignment, trauma) and HYPERSENSITIVITY of the MANDIBULAR NERVE.\n\nThe MANDIBULAR NERVE (CN V3) is the largest branch of the TRIGEMINAL NERVE and supplies sensation to the TMJ, floor of the mouth, anterior tongue, and the lower part of the face. It also innervates the muscles of mastication (eg, medial and lateral pterygoid, masseter, temporalis), tensor veli palatini, and the tensor tympani in the middle ear, which dampens loud sounds by tensing the tympanic membrane.\n\nMechanical derangement of the TMJ can result in irritation and hypersensitivity of the mandibular nerve, leading to pathologic contraction of the pterygoid muscles (worsening the jaw pain and dysfunction) and tensor tympani (causing EAR PAIN and MUFFLED HEARING despite a normal otoscopic examination).\n\n(Choice A) Most patients with TMD have cervical spinal dysfunction and neck pain due to muscular and functional connections between the jaw and cervical regions. However, cervical spinal nerve damage is usually caused by overt structural lesions of the CERVICAL SPINE (eg, cervical spondylosis, disc herniation) and would not result in ear pain or muffled hearing (but rather neck, shoulder, and arm pain/weakness).\n\n(Choice B) The FACIAL NERVE (CN VII) provides sensory innervation to the external auditory canal/concha and motor innervation to the muscles of facial expression and the stapedius muscle, which dampens high-amplitude sound wave transmission. However, the facial nerve does not innervate the pterygoid muscles or TMJ.\n\n(Choice D) The MAXILLARY NERVE (CN V2) provides sensory innervation to the cheek, nares, upper lip, and teeth. Involvement of the maxillary nerve in trigeminal neuralgia can cause facial pain; however, muffled hearing and pterygoid muscle dysfunction indicate mandibular nerve involvement.\n\n(Choice E) The VESTIBULOCOCHLEAR NERVE (CN VIII) carries auditory and balance information from the inner ear. Damage to the cochlear portion of CNVIII (eg, vestibular schwannoma) can result in HEARING LOSS; however, it would not be associated with facial pain or pterygoid muscle dysfunction.\n\nEducational objective:\nTemporomandibular disorder is associated with dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint and hypersensitivity of the mandibular nerve (CN V3). This can result in pathologic contraction of the pterygoid muscles (eg, jaw pain and dysfunction) and the tensor tympani in the middle ear (eg, ear pain, muffled hearing).",
    "zh": "该患者的面部疼痛、头痛、下颌功能障碍以及耳痛/听力减退是颞下颌关节紊乱（TMD）的特征。 TMD 的根本病因是多因素的，但包括颞下颌关节（TMJ）紊乱（例如，下颌错位、外伤）和下颌神经的超敏反应。\n\n下颌神经（CN V3）是三叉神经的最大分支，为 TMJ、口腔底部、舌前部和面部下部提供感觉。它还支配咀嚼肌（例如，内、外翼肌、咬肌、颞肌）、腭帆张肌和中耳的鼓膜张肌，鼓膜张肌通过收紧鼓膜来抑制响亮的声音。\n\nTMJ的机械性紊乱可导致下颌神经的刺激和超敏反应，导致翼肌的病理性收缩（加重下颌疼痛和功能障碍）和鼓膜张肌（导致耳痛和听力减退，尽管耳镜检查结果正常）。\n\n（选项 A）大多数TMD患者由于下颌和颈部区域之间的肌肉和功能连接而出现颈椎功能障碍和颈部疼痛。 然而，颈椎神经损伤通常是由颈椎的明显结构性病变（例如，颈椎病、椎间盘突出）引起的，不会导致耳痛或听力减退（而是颈部、肩部和手臂疼痛/无力）。\n\n（选项 B）面神经（CN VII）为外耳道/耳廓提供感觉神经支配，并为面部表情肌和镫骨肌提供运动神经支配，镫骨肌抑制高振幅声波的传播。 然而，面神经不支配翼肌或TMJ。\n\n（选项 D）上颌神经（CN V2）为面颊、鼻孔、上唇和牙齿提供感觉神经支配。 三叉神经痛中上颌神经受累可引起面部疼痛； 然而，听力减退和翼肌功能障碍表明下颌神经受累。\n\n（选项 E）前庭蜗神经（CN VIII）携带来自内耳的听觉和平衡信息。 CNVIII 的耳蜗部分（例如，前庭神经鞘瘤）的损伤可导致听力损失；然而，它不会与面部疼痛或翼肌功能障碍相关。\n\n教育目标：颞下颌关节紊乱与颞下颌关节功能障碍和下颌神经（CN V3）超敏反应有关。这可导致翼肌的病理性收缩（例如，下颌疼痛和功能障碍）和中耳的鼓膜张肌（例如，耳痛、听力减退）。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of temporomandibular disorder (TMD), its common symptoms, and the neuroanatomy involved in its pathophysiology. Specifically, it assesses the ability to link symptoms like jaw pain, clicking, headaches, and muffled hearing to the involvement of the mandibular nerve and its branches.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the constellation of symptoms as indicative of TMD. Then, by recalling the innervation of the temporomandibular joint, pterygoid muscles, and tensor tympani, the most likely nerve contributing to the patient's ear symptoms can be identified.",
