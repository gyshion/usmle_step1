    "en": " A46-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to 3 days of persistent upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has had similar pain in the past, especially after fatty meals, which resolved spontaneously within several hours. Temperature is 38.6 C (101.5 F), blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, and pulse is 98/min. BMI is 33 kg/m². Physical examination is notable for severe right upper quadrant tenderness. Leukocyte count is 21,000/mm². Laparoscopic surgery is performed and reveals an erythematous, distended gallbladder with patchy necrosis.",

    "en": "This patient likely has ACUTE CALCULOUS CHOLECYSTITIS, an acute inflammation of the gallbladder initiated by gallstone obstruction of the cystic duct. Patients typically present with persistent right upper quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. Examination classically shows Murphy sign, an inspiratory pause elicited by pain during deep palpation of the right upper quadrant. Symptoms are often preceded by transient episodes of abdominal pain and nausea after fatty meals due to temporary cystic duct obstruction (biliary colic).\n\nPersistent gallbladder outflow obstruction promotes hydrolysis of luminal lecithins to lysolecithins, which disrupts the protective mucus layer. The luminal epithelium is then exposed to the detergent action of the bile salts, resulting in chemical irritation and prostaglandin release. Inflammation of the mucosa and deeper tissues causes gallbladder hypomotility. The increasing distension and internal pressure within the gallbladder eventually result in ischemia. Finally, bacteria (eg, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter) invade the injured and necrotic gallbladder wall, causing an infection (Choice A).\n\n(Choices B and D) The gallbladder is vulnerable to ischemic injury as the cystic artery lacks collateral circulation. Although inflammation/edema of the gallbladder may compromise blood flow, ischemic disruption of the mucosal layer is usually the next to last step in the pathogenesis of acute calculous cholecystitis. Gallbladder ischemia is not typically caused by cystic artery thrombosis.\n\n(Choice E) Lecithin hydrolysis and mucosal damage occur after gallbladder outflow obstruction in the pathogenesis of acute calculous cholecystitis.",
    "zh": "该患者可能患有急性结石性胆囊炎，这是一种由胆囊结石阻塞胆囊管引起的胆囊急性炎症。患者通常表现为持续的右上腹疼痛、发热和白细胞增多。体格检查通常显示墨菲征阳性，即在深触诊右上腹时因疼痛引起的吸气暂停。症状通常先于进食油腻食物后出现一过性腹痛和恶心，这是由于胆囊管暂时性阻塞（胆绞痛）所致。\n\n持续的胆囊流出道梗阻促进管腔内卵磷脂水解为溶血卵磷脂，从而破坏保护性黏液层。管腔上皮随后暴露于胆盐的去污剂作用，导致化学刺激和前列腺素释放。黏膜和深层组织的炎症导致胆囊蠕动减弱。胆囊内不断增加的扩张和内压最终导致缺血。最后，细菌（例如，大肠杆菌、肠球菌、克雷伯菌、肠杆菌）侵入受损和坏死的胆囊壁，引起感染（选项A）。\n\n（选项B和D）由于胆囊动脉缺乏侧支循环，胆囊容易发生缺血性损伤。虽然胆囊的炎症/水肿可能会损害血流，但黏膜层的缺血性破坏通常是急性结石性胆囊炎发病机制中的倒数第二步。胆囊缺血通常不是由胆囊动脉血栓形成引起的。\n\n（选项E）卵磷脂水解和黏膜损伤发生在胆囊流出道梗阻之后，是急性结石性胆囊炎发病机制的一部分。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of acute calculous cholecystitis, specifically the sequence of events leading to gallbladder inflammation and necrosis. It requires understanding the role of gallbladder outflow obstruction and its downstream effects.\n\nThe best approach is to recall the typical progression of acute cholecystitis: obstruction, chemical irritation, inflammation, ischemia, and bacterial invasion. Eliminate options that are not primary initiating events or occur later in the disease process.",
