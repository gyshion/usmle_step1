    "en": "A 20-year-old woman comes to the office due to blisters around her mouth associated with a mild burning sensation. She reports that she has been having frequent recurrence of these lesions, which resolve spontaneously within a few days. She has no medical problems and does not take any medications. Physical examination findings are shown in the image below. {{exhibit_1}} It is determined that the causative organism of this patient's condition remains in a latent state in the neuronal cell bodies of sensory ganglia. Upon reactivation, the virus is transported through the nerve axon to the skin.",

    "en": "This patient is suffering from recurrent bouts of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) \"cold sores,\" which are most commonly caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Primary infection occurs following contact with an affected individual's saliva. Although it is often asymptomatic, infection can result in painful blister formation on the oral mucosa and surrounding skin of the mouth and lips. After resolution of the initial infection, the virus enters a latent phase where viral particles lay dormant in neural sensory ganglia (most commonly the trigeminal).\n\nReactivation of the virus occurs during times of stress or illness, resulting in recurrence of the characteristic perioral vesicular lesions. During reactivation, HSV particles rely on anterograde axonal transport to reach the skin and oral mucosa. Anterograde axonal transport is mediated by KINESIN, a motor protein that moves intracellular cargo (eg, organelles, viral particles) away from the nucleus, down the axon, and toward the nerve terminal. Kinesin-mediated movement is powered by ATP hydrolysis and guided by microtubule filaments, which function as an intracellular \"track\" system.\n\n(Choice A) Dynein is a microtubular motor protein that participates in retrograde axonal transport (ie, moving organelles toward the nucleus). Dynein is important in establishing the latent phase following primary HSV infection by transporting viral particles to the neural sensory ganglia. However, it is not responsible for disease recurrence.\n\n(Choice C) Lamins are proteins that help form the fibrillar network that lines the inside of the nuclear envelope. In addition to providing structural support, they also help to organize the genome and regulate gene transcription.\n\n(Choice D) Selectins are a group of cell adhesion molecules that are expressed on endothelial cells during the inflammatory response. They function to bind leukocytes, allowing them to exit blood vessels at the site of inflammation.\n\n(Choice E) Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein located intracellularly along the plasma membrane. It is responsible for maintaining the distinct shape of red blood cells. Protein defects may result in hereditary elliptocytosis and spherocytosis.\n\n(Choice F) Vimentin is a type of intermediate filament expressed in mesenchymal cells. It is responsible for securing organelles inside the cytosol and provides resistance to mechanical stress.\n\nEducational objective:\nKinesin is a microtubule-associated motor protein that functions in the anterograde transport of materials and organelles within cells. Reactivation of latent herpes simplex virus requires anterograde transport of viral particles from neuronal cell bodies in the sensory ganglia to the skin and oral mucosa.",
    "zh": "该患者患有复发性单纯疱疹病毒1型（HSV-1）“唇疱疹”，这通常由单纯疱疹病毒1型（HSV-1）引起。 初次感染发生在与受影响个体的唾液接触后。 虽然它通常无症状，但感染会导致口腔黏膜和口腔和嘴唇周围皮肤上出现疼痛性水疱。 在初始感染消退后，病毒进入潜伏期，病毒颗粒潜伏在神经感觉神经节（最常见的是三叉神经节）中。\n\n病毒的再激活发生在压力或疾病期间，导致特征性的口周水疱病变复发。 在再激活期间，HSV颗粒依靠顺向轴突转运到达皮肤和口腔黏膜。 顺向轴突转运由驱动蛋白介导，驱动蛋白是一种运动蛋白，它将细胞内货物（例如，细胞器、病毒颗粒）从细胞核移开，沿着轴突向下，并朝向神经末梢。 驱动蛋白介导的运动由ATP水解驱动，并由微管丝引导，微管丝充当细胞内的“轨道”系统。\n\n（选项A）动力蛋白是一种参与逆行轴突转运（即，将细胞器向细胞核移动）的微管马达蛋白。 动力蛋白对于通过将病毒颗粒转运到神经感觉神经节来建立初次HSV感染后的潜伏期非常重要。 然而，它不负责疾病复发。\n\n（选项C）核纤层蛋白是帮助形成衬在核被膜内部的纤维网络的蛋白质。 除了提供结构支持外，它们还有助于组织基因组和调节基因转录。\n\n（选项D）选择素是一组在炎症反应期间在内皮细胞上表达的细胞粘附分子。 它们的功能是结合白细胞，使它们能够从血管中移出到炎症部位。\n\n（选项E）血影蛋白是一种细胞骨架蛋白，位于质膜内的细胞内。 它负责维持红细胞的独特形状。 蛋白质缺陷可能导致遗传性椭圆细胞增多症和球形红细胞增多症。\n\n（选项F）波形蛋白是一种在间充质细胞中表达的中间丝。 它负责固定细胞质内的细胞器，并提供对机械应力的抵抗力。\n\n教育目标：\n驱动蛋白是一种微管相关马达蛋白，其功能是细胞内物质和细胞器的顺向转运。 潜伏性单纯疱疹病毒的再激活需要将病毒颗粒从感觉神经节中的神经元细胞体顺向转运到皮肤和口腔黏膜。"
