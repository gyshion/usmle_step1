    "en": "A 24-year-old man comes to the office due to nonproductive cough, subjective fevers, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, and increasing dyspnea for the past 4 weeks. He was empirically treated for pneumonia with levofloxacin at an urgent care center 2 weeks ago but has had no improvement. The patient is an exchange student from the Philippines. Temperature is 37.3 C (99.1 F), blood pressure is 118/86 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination is remarkable for decreased right-sided breath sounds. Chest x-ray shows a large, right-sided pleural effusion. Pleural fluid is drained, and a subsequent chest CT scan reveals right upper lobe infiltrate and calcified hilar adenopathy. {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's clinical findings are consistent with reactivation tuberculosis, given his nonresponse to routine pneumonia treatment, prior residence in an endemic region (ie, Southeast Asia), and CT scan showing calcified hilar adenopathy (representing granulomatous lymph node involvement). Reactivation tuberculosis typically affects the upper lobes of the lungs and is often associated with pleural effusion.\n\nPulmonary infection causes pleural effusion primarily via an inflammatory increase in vascular and pleural membrane permeability, leading to relatively high pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration (Choice D). Such effusions are exudative by Light criteria, with pleural fluid/serum protein ratio >0.5, pleural fluid/serum LDH ratio >0.6, and/or pleural fluid LDH >⅔ the upper limit of normal serum LDH. Normal serum total protein ranges from 6.0 g/dL to 7.8 g/dL; therefore, pleural fluid protein >4 g/dL (ratio >0.5) is most likely in this patient.\n\n(Choice A) Pleural fluid cytology showing atypical cells can be seen with a malignant pleural effusion, but is not expected with tuberculous effusion. Malignant effusions are also typically exudative by Light criteria.\n\n(Choice B) An elevated pleural fluid triglyceride level is diagnostic of a chylothorax, which results from disruption (eg, trauma, malignant invasion) of the thoracic duct leading to leakage of chylomicron-rich lymphatic fluid into the pleural space.\n\n(Choice E) Tuberculosis pleural effusions are typically lymphocyte predominant. Neutrophil predominance is expected with a typical parapneumonic effusion (eg, due to community-acquired bacterial pneumonia).\n\nEducational objective:\nPulmonary infection (eg, community-acquired pneumonia, tuberculosis) causes pleural effusion primarily via an inflammatory increase in vascular and pleural membrane permeability. Such effusions are exudative by Light criteria, typically with relatively high pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations. Tuberculosis pleural effusions typically demonstrate a lymphocyte-predominant leukocyte pattern.",
    "zh": "考虑到该患者对常规肺炎治疗无反应、居住在流行区（即东南亚）以及CT扫描显示钙化性肺门淋巴结肿大（代表肉芽肿性淋巴结受累），该患者的临床表现与结核病复发相符。结核病复发通常累及肺部上叶，并常伴有胸腔积液。\n\n肺部感染主要通过炎症增加血管和胸膜膜的通透性导致胸腔积液，导致胸腔积液蛋白和乳酸脱氢酶（LDH）浓度相对较高（选项D）。根据Light标准，此类积液为渗出性，胸腔积液/血清蛋白比值>0.5，胸腔积液/血清LDH比值>0.6，和/或胸腔积液LDH>2/3血清LDH的正常上限。正常血清总蛋白范围为6.0 g/dL至7.8 g/dL；因此，该患者的胸腔积液蛋白>4 g/dL（比值>0.5）的可能性最大。\n\n（选项A）胸腔积液细胞学检查显示非典型细胞可见于恶性胸腔积液，但结核性胸腔积液中不常见。恶性积液通常也符合Light标准，呈渗出性。\n\n（选项B）胸腔积液甘油三酯水平升高是乳糜胸的诊断依据，乳糜胸是由于胸导管破裂（例如，外伤、恶性浸润）导致富含乳糜微粒的淋巴液渗漏到胸膜腔中。\n\n（选项E）结核性胸腔积液通常以淋巴细胞为主。中性粒细胞占优势常见于典型的肺旁积液（例如，由于社区获得性细菌性肺炎）。\n\n教育目标：\n肺部感染（例如，社区获得性肺炎、结核病）主要通过炎症增加血管和胸膜膜的通透性导致胸腔积液。此类积液根据Light标准为渗出性，通常具有相对较高的胸腔积液蛋白和乳酸脱氢酶浓度。结核性胸腔积液通常表现为淋巴细胞占优势的白细胞模式。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pleural effusion etiology and characteristics, specifically differentiating exudative effusions caused by tuberculosis from other types of effusions. It requires understanding of Light's criteria and the pathophysiology of pleural fluid formation in infectious processes.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the risk factors for tuberculosis (endemic region, lack of response to antibiotics), identify the pleural effusion as exudative, and recall that tuberculosis effusions typically have high protein and LDH levels due to increased vascular permeability.",
    "zh": "本题考察了关于胸腔积液病因和特征的知识，特别是区分由结核病引起的渗出性积液与其他类型的积液。这需要理解Light标准以及感染过程中胸腔积液形成的病理生理学。\n\n为了解决这个问题，需要认识到结核病的危险因素（流行地区，对抗菌药物无反应），确定胸腔积液为渗出性，并回忆起由于血管通透性增加，结核性积液通常具有高蛋白和LDH水平。"
