  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has manifestations characteristic of SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY (SCID). Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is the second most common cause of SCID, after X-linked SCID (eg, IL-2 receptor mutation). ADA is present throughout the human body and functions to eliminate excess adenosine from cells by deaminating adenosine to inosine. Adenosine accumulation is highly toxic to mitotically active cells such as developing lymphocytes: ADA insufficiency leads to widespread death of both T- and B-lymphocytes with resultant combined cellular and humoral immunodeficiency. Because both humoral and cell-mediated immunity are deficient in these patients, they are vulnerable to recurrent, severe infections by bacteria, viruses, and fungi.\n\nTreatment is with hematopoietic (bone marrow) transplantation, but retroviral gene therapy is a promising treatment for patients without an HLA match. Retroviral vectors are used to infect patient hematopoietic stem cells with the genetic code for ADA, resulting in production of ADA by all daughter cells of that stem cell.\n\n(Choice B) Myeloperoxidase is a neutrophil enzyme that helps kill phagocytosed organisms by catalyzing the production of hypochlorite (bleach) from hydrogen peroxide and chloride. A deficiency of this enzyme results in immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent Candida infections.\n\n(Choice C) NADPH oxidase is the enzyme that is deficient in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Without NADPH oxidase, neutrophils are unable to form reactive oxygen species such as superoxide. CGD manifests clinically with recurrent infections by catalase-producing organisms (eg, staphylococci). Dihydrorhodamine or nitroblue tetrazolium testing can be used to diagnose CGD.\n\n(Choice D) Reverse transcriptase is a retroviral enzyme that converts viral genomic RNA (in this case, ADA) to DNA. Although it plays a role in the effectiveness of the retrovirus as a vector for the treatment of SCID, reverse transcriptase is not deficient in patients with this condition.\n\n(Choice E) Xanthine oxidase is the enzyme responsible for the formation of uric acid from hypoxanthine and xanthine and is essential as the final step of purine degradation. Xanthine oxidase deficiency leads to abnormally low levels of uric acid in the serum; it can also lead to renal calculi due to the relative insolubility of xanthine at urine's pH level.",
    "zh": "该患者表现出严重联合免疫缺陷 (SCID) 的特征。腺苷脱氨酶 (ADA) 缺乏症是 SCID 的第二大常见原因，仅次于 X 连锁 SCID（例如，IL-2 受体突变）。ADA 存在于整个人体中，其功能是通过将腺苷脱氨成肌苷来消除细胞中过量的腺苷。腺苷蓄积对有丝分裂活跃的细胞（如发育中的淋巴细胞）具有高度毒性：ADA 不足会导致 T 淋巴细胞和 B 淋巴细胞的大范围死亡，从而导致细胞和体液免疫缺陷。由于这些患者的体液免疫和细胞介导免疫均存在缺陷，因此他们容易受到细菌、病毒和真菌的反复严重感染。\n\n治疗方法是造血干细胞（骨髓）移植，但反转录病毒基因治疗是 HLA 配型不符的患者的一种有前景的治疗方法。反转录病毒载体用于感染患者的造血干细胞，携带 ADA 的遗传密码，从而使该干细胞的所有子细胞产生 ADA。\n\n（选项 B）髓过氧化物酶是一种中性粒细胞酶，它通过催化过氧化氢和氯生成次氯酸盐（漂白剂）来帮助杀死被吞噬的生物体。这种酶的缺乏会导致免疫缺陷，其特征是反复的念珠菌感染。\n\n（选项 C）NADPH 氧化酶是慢性肉芽肿病 (CGD) 中缺乏的酶。如果没有 NADPH 氧化酶，中性粒细胞就无法形成超氧化物等活性氧。CGD 在临床上表现为反复感染产酶的生物体（例如，葡萄球菌）。二氢罗丹明或硝基蓝四唑测试可用于诊断 CGD。\n\n（选项 D）逆转录酶是一种反转录病毒酶，可将病毒基因组 RNA（在这种情况下为 ADA）转化为 DNA。虽然它在反转录病毒作为 SCID 治疗载体的有效性方面发挥作用，但患有这种疾病的患者并不缺乏逆转录酶。\n\n（选项 E）黄嘌呤氧化酶是将黄嘌呤和黄嘌呤形成尿酸的酶，也是嘌呤降解的最后一步。黄嘌呤氧化酶缺乏会导致血清中尿酸水平异常低；由于尿液 pH 值下黄嘌呤的相对不溶性，它也可能导致肾结石。"

It also assesses understanding of retroviral gene therapy as a treatment for ADA deficiency.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the clinical presentation of SCID and recall that ADA deficiency is a common cause.
