  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Humans normally have approximately 5-10 mL of pleural fluid in the intrapleural space of each hemithorax, with inflow and outflow of fluid taking place at equal rates to maintain homeostasis. Pleural fluid is believed to enter the pleural space via filtration from systemic circulation in both the parietal and visceral pleura, with the majority of fluid filtered from the intercostal microvessels in the parietal pleura and a lesser amount from the bronchial microvessels in the visceral pleura.\n\nMost pleural fluid likely exits the pleural space via holes in the parietal pleura known as lymphatic stoma that drain into the parietal pleural lymphatics.\n\nPleural effusion results from an increase in the rate of pleural fluid inflow (eg, increased fluid filtration as occurs with decompensated heart failure, hypoalbuminemia, or an inflammatory increase in pleural vascular permeability) or a decrease in the rate of pleural fluid outflow (eg, malignant obstruction of the parietal pleura lymphatic stoma).\n\n(Choices A, B, AND  ",
    "zh": "人类正常情况下每个半胸腔的胸膜腔内约有 5-10 mL 的胸膜液，液体的流入和流出以相等的速度进行，以维持体内平衡。胸膜液被认为通过系统循环的过滤进入壁层和脏层胸膜，其中大部分液体从壁层胸膜的肋间微血管过滤，少量液体从脏层胸膜的支气管微血管过滤。\n\n大多数胸膜液可能通过壁层胸膜上的孔（称为淋巴管口）排出胸膜腔，这些孔排入壁层胸膜淋巴管。\n\n胸腔积液是由于胸膜液流入速率增加（例如，失代偿性心力衰竭、低蛋白血症或胸膜血管通透性炎症增加引起的液体过滤增加）或胸膜液流出速率降低（例如，恶性肿瘤阻塞壁层胸膜淋巴管口）引起的。\n\n（选项 A、B 和 "
