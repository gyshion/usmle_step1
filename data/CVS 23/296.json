    "en": "A 75-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by paramedics following a high-speed motor vehicle collision. Several attempts are made to resuscitate him but they are unsuccessful. Autopsy findings include heavy calcifications of the aortic valve. The patient's medical records indicate that he had no significant medical history and took no medications. He is described as being in good health and tolerant of moderate levels of physical activity. ECG from his last office visit shows no abnormalities. Which of the following most likely preceded the aortic valve changes observed in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient's aortic valve calcifications most likely represent dystrophic calcification affecting an aging aortic valve. Dystrophic calcification is considered a hallmark of CELL INJURY and death, occurring in all types of NECROSIS (eg, coagulative, fat, caseous, liquefactive) in the setting of NORMAL CALCIUM LEVELS. On gross examination, dystrophic calcium deposits are seen as fine, gritty, white granules or clumps. On hematoxylin and eosin staining, these deposits typically appear as dark purple, sharp-edged aggregates; deposits that develop lamellated outer layers are described as psammoma bodies.\n\nDystrophic calcification in aged (or damaged) cardiac valves is thought to be the result of endothelial and fibroblast injury and death secondary to CHRONIC HEMODYNAMIC STRESS (can be accentuated by valvular abnormalities) or ATHEROSCLEROTIC INFLAMMATION. Subsequent release of cellular degradation products, inflammatory mediators, and other proteins into the valvular interstitium promotes calcification and thickening of the valve leaflets and annulus. These changes are often asymptomatic in older adults (ie, AORTIC SCLEROSIS); however, over time, progressive valvular stiffening can lead to outflow obstruction (ie, CALCIFIC AORTIC STENOSIS) {{exhibit_1}}.\n\n(Choice B) Extracellular amyloid deposition occurs in patients with amyloidosis. Amyloidosis can cause restrictive cardiomyopathy and heart failure, but it is not directly associated with calcification of the aortic valve.\n\n(Choice C) Hypercalcemia is associated with metastatic calcification, which affects normal tissues and organs. In this process, calcium deposition typically occurs in more alkaline tissues involved in acid excretion, such as kidneys, lungs, and gastric mucosa.\n\n(Choice D) Intracellular hemosiderin accumulation is common in patients who have hemolytic anemia or who undergo frequent blood transfusions. It is not directly associated with calcification of the aortic valve.\n\n(Choice E) Pathologic cell hypertrophy of left ventricular cardiomyocytes (ie, left ventricular hypertrophy) can occur as the result of severe aortic stenosis. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者的主动脉瓣钙化最有可能代表影响老化主动脉瓣的营养不良性钙化。营养不良性钙化被认为是细胞损伤和死亡的标志，发生于所有类型的坏死（如凝固性、脂肪性、干酪性、液化性），且是在正常钙水平的背景下发生的。在肉眼检查中，营养不良性钙沉积物被看作是细小、砂砾状的白色颗粒或团块。在苏木精和伊红染色中，这些沉积物通常表现为深紫色、边缘锋利的聚集物；那些形成层状外层的沉积物被称为砂粒体。\n\n老年（或受损）心脏瓣膜中的营养不良性钙化被认为是由于慢性血流动力学应激（可因瓣膜异常而加剧）或动脉粥样硬化性炎症继发的内皮细胞和成纤维细胞损伤和死亡的结果。随后，细胞降解产物、炎症介质和其他蛋白质释放到瓣膜间质中，促进了瓣叶和环的钙化和增厚。这些变化在老年人中通常是无症状的（即主动脉硬化）；然而，随着时间的推移，进行性瓣膜僵硬可导致血流流出道梗阻（即钙化性主动脉瓣狭窄） {{exhibit_1}}。\n\n(选项B) 细胞外淀粉样蛋白沉积发生在患有淀粉样变性的患者中。淀粉样变性可引起限制性心肌病和心力衰竭，但它与主动脉瓣钙化没有直接关系。\n\n(选项C) 高钙血症与转移性钙化相关，后者影响正常组织和器官。在这个过程中，钙沉积通常发生在参与酸排泄的更碱性组织中，如肾脏、肺和胃粘膜。\n\n(选项D) 细胞内含铁血黄素蓄积常见于患有溶血性贫血或经常接受输血的患者。它与主动脉瓣钙化没有直接关系。\n\n(选项E) 左心室心肌细胞的病理性细胞肥大（即左心室肥大）可由严重的主动脉瓣狭窄引起。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of dystrophic calcification in the setting of normal calcium levels, specifically as it relates to aortic valve calcification and aortic sclerosis. It also tests the ability to differentiate dystrophic from metastatic calcification.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the patient has aortic valve calcifications with a normal calcium level. This points towards dystrophic calcification, which is associated with cell injury. Rule out other options based on their association with metastatic calcification or other unrelated conditions.",
