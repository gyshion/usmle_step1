    "en": "A 64-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to worsening shortness of breath. The patient is able to speak in short sentences only and becomes hypoxemic with minimal exertion. His medical history includes hypertension and dyslipidemia. He smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for 40 years and worked for 25 years as a nickel miner. His father died of chronic respiratory failure. While in the emergency department, he rapidly develops respiratory failure and is intubated. Despite appropriate treatment, he dies several days later in the intensive care unit. Autopsy is performed, and examination of the bronchi reveals thickened bronchial walls, inflammatory infiltrates, mucous gland enlargement, and patchy squamous metaplasia of the bronchial mucosa.",

    "en": "This patient with respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and thickened bronchial walls with inflammatory infiltrates and mucous gland enlargement likely had chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is characterized by chronic, productive cough with airflow limitation and is part of the spectrum of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is most commonly caused by tobacco smoking. Chronic irritation by other inhaled environmental substances, such as air pollutants and grain, cotton, or silica dusts, can also contribute to its development. Biopsy typically shows thickened bronchial walls with predominantly lymphocytic infiltrates, mucous gland enlargement with increased numbers of goblet cells (increasing mucus production), and patchy squamous metaplasia of the bronchial mucosa.\n\n(Choice A) Patients with allergic asthma can develop pathologic remodeling of the bronchial wall, which includes thickening of the bronchial epithelium, basement membrane, and bronchial smooth muscle as well as edema, inflammatory infiltrates, and submucosal gland enlargement. However, the infiltrates consist predominantly of eosinophils and mast cells. In addition, although asthma is a risk factor for chronic bronchitis, smoking is a much more common cause.\n\n(Choice C) Genetic factors are not known to strongly predispose to chronic bronchitis. Genetic mutation causing alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can lead to panacinar emphysema; however, chronic bronchitis is not a significant component of the disease.\n\n(Choice D) Repeated bronchial/bronchiolar bacterial and viral infections can contribute to the development of chronic bronchitis, although less significantly than can smoking. Tobacco smoke predisposes to infection by impairing ciliary clearance and directly damaging the respiratory epithelium.\n\n(Choices E and F) Nickel is a carcinogen, and occupational exposure is associated with nasal and lung cancers. However, neoplastic transformation itself does not contribute to the development of chronic bronchitis. Although this patient's history of nickel mining is also suggestive of silica dust exposure, smoking is the most important risk factor for chronic bronchitis.\n\nEducational objective:\nThickened bronchial walls, lymphocytic infiltration, mucous gland enlargement, and patchy squamous metaplasia of the bronchial mucosa are features of chronic bronchitis. Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of chronic bronchitis.",
    "zh": "该患者出现呼吸衰竭、低氧血症以及支气管壁增厚、炎性浸润和粘液腺增大，很可能患有慢性支气管炎。慢性支气管炎的特征是慢性、有痰的咳嗽伴气流受限，是慢性阻塞性肺病的一个组成部分。它最常见的病因是吸烟。其他吸入性环境物质（如空气污染物、谷物、棉花或二氧化硅粉尘）的慢性刺激也可能促成其发展。活检通常显示支气管壁增厚，伴有淋巴细胞浸润为主、粘液腺增大伴杯状细胞数量增加（增加粘液产生）以及支气管粘膜的斑片状鳞状化生。\n\n(选项 A) 患有过敏性哮喘的患者可发展为支气管壁的病理重塑，包括支气管上皮、基底膜和支气管平滑肌增厚，以及水肿、炎性浸润和黏膜下腺增大。但是，浸润主要由嗜酸性粒细胞和肥大细胞组成。此外，虽然哮喘是慢性支气管炎的危险因素，但吸烟是更常见的病因。\n\n(选项 C) 遗传因素已知并不能强烈地诱发慢性支气管炎。导致α-1抗胰蛋白酶缺乏的基因突变可导致全小叶肺气肿；然而，慢性支气管炎并非该疾病的重要组成部分。\n\n(选项 D) 反复的支气管/细支气管细菌和病毒感染可促成慢性支气管炎的发展，尽管不如吸烟那么重要。烟草烟雾通过损害纤毛清除并直接损伤呼吸道上皮，从而易于发生感染。\n\n(选项 E 和 F) 镍是一种致癌物，职业暴露与鼻癌和肺癌有关。然而，肿瘤性转化本身并不会促成慢性支气管炎的发展。虽然该患者的镍矿开采史也提示存在二氧化硅粉尘暴露，但吸烟是慢性支气管炎最重要的危险因素。\n\n教育目标：\n支气管壁增厚、淋巴细胞浸润、粘液腺增大以及支气管粘膜的斑片状鳞状化生是慢性支气管炎的特征。吸烟是慢性支气管炎的主要病因。"
