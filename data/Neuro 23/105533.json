    "en": "Lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome {{exhibit_1}}\n\nThis patient's stroke has resulted in vertigo and bulbar weakness (eg, difficulty swallowing), in addition to loss of pain and temperature sensation on the left side of the face and right side of the body. Because most cranial nerves (other than CN II & IV) do not decussate while most of the body's motor and sensory fibers cross the midline in the medulla, brainstem strokes characteristically lead to ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits and contralateral deficits of the body (ie, crossed signs). Therefore, this patient's stroke likely impacted the left brainstem. Specifically, this patient has the following:\n\n*   Vertigo without hearing loss, suggesting a lesion impacting the vestibular nucleus rather than the peripheral CN VIII (which would likely result in hearing loss as well).\n*   Loss of pain and temperature sensation on the left (ipsilateral) side of the face with neuropathic pain in that area, suggesting involvement of the spinal trigeminal nucleus\n*   Loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right (contralateral) side of the body, which suggests dysfunction of the spinothalamic tract\n\nThese areas are all located in the left lateral medulla. This constellation of symptoms is consistent with lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome. Horner syndrome is also common due to damage of the descending sympathetic nervous system fibers that travel very close to the spinothalamic tract.\n\n(Choices B and E) Ischemia impacting the medial medulla can damage the pyramidal tract (contralateral hemiparesis), medial lemniscus (contralateral loss of tactile, vibratory & position sense), and hypoglossal nucleus, which causes tongue deviation toward the lesion due to ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) palsy. The strong side \"pushes\" the tongue toward the weak side when it is protruded.\n\n(Choices C and F) Strokes in the midbrain can damage the red nucleus (ataxia), cerebral peduncle (contralateral hemiparesis), and, often, oculomotor nerve fascicles (ipsilateral CN III palsy).\n\n(Choice D) A lesion in the right lateral medulla would cause decreased pain and temperature in the right side of the face (ipsilateral) and left side of the body (contralateral).\n\nEducational objective:\nA lateral medullary infarct (Wallenberg syndrome) leads to vertigo (vestibular nucleus), loss of pain/temperature sensation on the ipsilateral face (trigeminal nucleus) and contralateral body (spinothalamic tract), bulbar weakness (lower cranial nerves), and ipsilateral Horner syndrome (descending sympathetic nervous system fibers).",
    "zh": "延髓外侧（Wallenberg）综合征 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n该患者的中风导致了眩晕和延髓性无力（例如，吞咽困难），此外，还出现了面部左侧和身体右侧的痛觉和温度觉丧失。由于大多数脑神经（CN II 和 IV 除外）没有交叉，而身体的大部分运动和感觉纤维在延髓的中线处交叉，脑干卒中通常会导致同侧脑神经功能缺损和对侧身体功能缺损（即，交叉体征）。因此，该患者的中风很可能影响了左侧脑干。具体而言，该患者具有以下表现：\n\n*   眩晕而无听力损失，提示病灶影响前庭神经核，而不是周围的CN VIII（这可能会导致听力损失）。\n*   面部左侧（同侧）痛觉和温度觉丧失，该区域出现神经性疼痛，提示脊髓三叉神经核受累\n*   身体右侧（对侧）痛觉和温度觉丧失，这提示脊髓丘脑束功能障碍\n\n这些区域都位于左侧延髓外侧。这种症状组合与延髓外侧（Wallenberg）综合征一致。由于损伤了非常靠近脊髓丘脑束的下行交感神经系统纤维，霍纳综合征也很常见。\n\n（选项B和E）影响延髓内侧的缺血可损伤锥体束（对侧偏瘫）、内侧丘系（对侧触觉、振动觉和位置觉丧失）和舌下神经核，导致舌头偏向病灶侧，这是由于同侧舌下神经（CN XII）麻痹。当舌头伸出时，有力的一侧会“推动”舌头朝向无力的一侧。\n\n（选项C和F）中脑卒中可损伤红核（共济失调）、大脑脚（对侧偏瘫），并且通常损伤动眼神经束（同侧CN III麻痹）。\n\n（选项D）右侧延髓外侧的病灶会导致面部右侧（同侧）和身体左侧（对侧）的痛觉和温度觉减退。\n\n教学目标：\n延髓外侧梗死（Wallenberg综合征）导致眩晕（前庭神经核）、面部同侧痛觉/温度觉丧失（三叉神经核）和身体对侧痛觉/温度觉丧失（脊髓丘脑束）、延髓性无力（较低脑神经）和同侧霍纳综合征（下行交感神经系统纤维）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg syndrome), its characteristic clinical presentation, and the anatomical structures involved in the medulla. It requires understanding of the crossed signs and ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits associated with brainstem lesions. \n\nTo solve this question, identify the key findings of vertigo, difficulty swallowing, decreased pain and temperature sensation on the ipsilateral face and contralateral body, and absent gag reflex. Recognize that these findings point to a lesion in the lateral medulla, specifically affecting the vestibular nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and spinothalamic tract.",
