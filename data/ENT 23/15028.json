    "en": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the office for evaluation of a neck mass. A week ago, the patient was taken to an urgent care clinic for nasal congestion and sore throat. The symptoms resolved after a few days, but his parents noticed a persistent neck swelling. The patient has no prior medical conditions and immunizations are up to date. On physical examination, he appears active and playful and is well nourished. Neck examination shows a mildly tender, 2-cm, anterior midline mass that moves upward when the patient swallows.",

    "en": "This patient has a thyroglossal duct cyst (TDC), which classically presents as a midline neck mass that moves superiorly with tongue protrusion or swallowing. A TDC may be identified incidentally during routine examination but is often first noticed when it becomes secondarily infected (eg, erythema, swelling, tenderness) after an upper respiratory infection.\n\nIn utero, the thyroid gland forms from an outpouching of pharyngeal epithelium at the base of the tongue. It then descends to the base of the anterior neck via the thyroglossal duct, which extends from the foramen cecum at the base of the tongue to the superior border of the isthmus of the thyroid. Normally, the duct then atrophies.\n\nFailed atrophy of the thyroglossal duct can result in a TDC from the epithelial remnants within the duct. Because the tract connects to the tongue, tongue protrusion or swallowing causes the TDC to move superiorly. Ectopic thyroid tissue may also be present and can form anywhere along the duct's path.\n\n(Choice A) Abnormal migration of neural crest cells can cause paragangliomas, neuroendocrine tumors that develop from extraadrenal, autonomic paraganglia. They most commonly arise from the carotid body and typically present as a lateral neck mass.\n\n(Choice B) Cervical implantation of thymic tissue is a rare cause of cystic neck mass. Ectopic thymic cysts can arise anywhere along the thymus' descent from the angle of the jaw to the mediastinum, but when they form in the neck they are most commonly found on the left side deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle.\n\n(Choice C) Cystic hygromas are fluid-filled sacs of dilated lymphatic vessels that result from abnormal lymphatic development. They present at birth as a soft mass at the posterior or lateral aspects of the neck, not the anterior midline.\n\n(Choice E) Branchial cleft cysts are embryologic remnants of branchial cleft structures that often present as a neck mass after becoming secondarily infected. However, they are located laterally (anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle), not midline, and do not move with swallowing.\n\n(Choice F) Trapped skin structures (eg, hair follicles, sebaceous glands) along embryonic fusion lines result in formation of dermoid cysts within subcutaneous tissue. They may be located in the midline (eg, submental region, neck), but would not rise with swallowing.\n\nEducational objective: Failed atrophy of the thyroglossal duct in utero can result in thyroglossal duct cysts that can be located anywhere along the path of thyroid descent (from the tongue base to the thyroid isthmus). They usually present as an anterior midline neck mass that moves superiorly with swallowing or tongue protrusion.",
    "zh": "该患者患有甲状舌管囊肿 (TDC)，其典型表现为正中颈部肿块，伸舌或吞咽时向上移动。TDC 可以在常规检查中偶然发现，但通常在继发感染（例如，红斑、肿胀、压痛）后首次被注意到，继发感染通常继发于上呼吸道感染。\n\n在子宫内，甲状腺由舌根部的咽上皮外突形成。然后，它通过甲状舌管下降到颈前部，甲状舌管从舌根部的盲孔延伸到甲状腺峡部的上缘。通常，该导管随后萎缩。\n\n甲状舌管萎缩失败可导致导管内的上皮残余物形成TDC。由于该管与舌头相连，伸舌或吞咽会导致TDC向上移动。异位甲状腺组织也可能存在，并且可以形成于沿导管路径的任何位置。\n\n（选项 A）神经嵴细胞的异常迁移可导致副神经节瘤，这是一种由肾外自主神经节发育而来的神经内分泌肿瘤。它们最常起源于颈动脉体，通常表现为颈部侧面肿块。\n\n（选项 B）胸腺组织在颈部的植入是囊性颈部肿块的罕见原因。异位胸腺囊肿可以出现在胸腺从下颌角到纵隔的任何下降路径上，但当它们在颈部形成时，最常见于胸锁乳突肌深部的左侧。\n\n（选项 C）囊性水瘤是由淋巴管异常发育引起的充满液体的扩张淋巴管囊。它们在出生时表现为颈后部或侧面的软肿块，而不是颈前正中。\n\n（选项 E）鳃裂囊肿是鳃裂结构的胚胎残余，通常在继发感染后表现为颈部肿块。然而，它们位于侧面（胸锁乳突肌前方），而不是正中，并且不随吞咽而移动。\n\n（选项 F）沿胚胎融合线的皮肤结构（例如，毛囊、皮脂腺）滞留会导致皮下组织内形成皮样囊肿。它们可能位于正中（例如，颏下区、颈部），但不会随吞咽而上升。\n\n教育目标：子宫内甲状舌管萎缩失败可导致甲状舌管囊肿，这些囊肿可以位于沿甲状腺下降路径的任何位置（从舌根到甲状腺峡部）。它们通常表现为颈前正中肿块，伸舌或吞咽时向上移动。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the embryological origin and clinical presentation of a thyroglossal duct cyst. It requires understanding the anatomical location and characteristic movement of the cyst with swallowing or tongue protrusion.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the anterior midline location of the neck mass and its movement with swallowing. This clinical presentation is highly suggestive of a thyroglossal duct cyst, which arises from incomplete obliteration of the thyroglossal duct.",
    "zh": "此题考察对甲状舌管囊肿的胚胎学起源和临床表现的理解。它需要理解囊肿的解剖位置以及吞咽或伸舌时的特征性运动。\n\n解决此题的关键是认识到颈部肿块位于前正中位置，并随吞咽而移动。这种临床表现高度提示甲状舌管囊肿，其源于甲状舌管的不完全闭锁。"
