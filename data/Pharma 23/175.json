    "en": "The patient is seeking treatment for motion sickness. Antimuscarinic agents (eg, scopolamine) and first-generation antihistamines (eg, meclizine, dimenhydrinate) are most effective for the management of motion sickness. Anticholinergic side effects are common with these medications and may include blurry vision, DRY MOUTH, urinary retention, and constipation.\n\n(Choices A, D, and E) Cough, frequent urination, and nasal congestion are characteristic of stimulation rather than blockade of muscarinic pathways.\n\n(Choice B) Diarrhea may be seen with dopamine receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), but these drugs are primarily used for visceral (eg, diabetic gastroparesis), rather than vestibular, nausea.\n\nEducational objective:\nAntimuscarinic agents and antihistamines with antimuscarinic action are most effective for motion sickness prevention.\n\nReferences\n• Scopolamine (hyoscine) for preventing and treating motion sickness.",
    "zh": "患者正在寻求晕动症的治疗。抗毒蕈碱药（如东莨菪碱）和第一代抗组胺药（如美克利嗪、茶苯海明）对于晕动症的治疗最为有效。这些药物的抗胆碱能副作用很常见，可能包括视力模糊、口干、尿潴留和便秘。\n\n（选项A、D和E）咳嗽、尿频和鼻塞是毒蕈碱通路受刺激而非阻滞的特征。\n\n（选项B）多巴胺受体拮抗剂（如甲氧氯普胺）可能会引起腹泻，但这些药物主要用于内脏（如糖尿病性胃轻瘫）而非前庭性恶心。\n\n教育目标：\n具有抗毒蕈碱作用的抗毒蕈碱药和抗组胺药对预防晕动症最有效。\n\n参考文献\n• 东莨菪碱（天仙子碱）用于预防和治疗晕动症。"
