    "en": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the office due to significant fatigue. Several weeks ago, the patient had a weeklong episode of intermittent fever and severe body aches. Over the last 2 weeks, she has been too tired to complete her normal jogging routine in the mornings and has had to take naps after returning home from work. The patient has no chronic medical conditions and takes no medications. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 20/min. Examination shows pale lips and conjunctivae. The abdomen is soft and there is no hepatosplenomegaly. Examination of the extremities is unremarkable, and no lymphadenopathy is present. Laboratory results are as follows:\n\nHemoglobin 7.0 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 90 µm³\nReticulocytes 0.1%\nPlatelets 40,000/mm³\nLeukocytes 2,000/mm³\nPT 13 sec\nPTT 30 sec\n\nPeripheral blood smear reveals normocytic, normochromic red blood cells, and other cell types appear morphologically normal. This patient's bone marrow biopsy would most likely show which of the following patterns?",

    "en": "{{exhibit_1}}\nThis patient with pancytopenia has inappropriately low reticulocyte count, morphologically normal cell lines on peripheral smear, and no splenomegaly on physical examination, raising strong suspicion for APLASTIC ANEMIA. \n\nAplastic anemia is a form of bone marrow failure caused by direct toxic injury or cytotoxic T-cell destruction of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Because these stem cells generate progenitor cells that produce all blood cells, damage results in a dramatic reduction of immature and mature blood cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. This is reflected on bone marrow biopsy as MARKED HYPOCELLULARITY with an abundance of FAT CELLS and other marrow STROMA; aspiration classically produces a \"DRY TAP.\" \n\nAlthough aplastic anemia is usually idiopathic (no clear cause), it can be triggered by viral infection (eg, hepatitis, HIV), chemical or radiation exposure, or medications (eg, carbamazepine). Patients typically have manifestations of PANCYTOPENIA such as severe fatigue and pale mucous membranes (anemia), bleeding/bruising (thrombocytopenia), or infection (eg, leukopenia). No significant extramedullary hematopoiesis occurs (eg, no splenomegaly) because few hematopoietic stem cells continue to function.\n\n(Choice A) Acute leukemias (eg, acute myeloid leukemia) are usually associated with a HYPERCELLULAR marrow with increased blasts. Although anemia and thrombocytopenia may be present, most patients have mild leukocytosis. In addition, blasts would be seen on peripheral smear.\n\n(Choice B) Chronic myeloid leukemia, a myeloproliferative neoplasm of granulocytes associated with the BCR-ABL fusion gene, is marked by a HYPERCELLULAR marrow with increased granulocytes and megakaryocytes. Patients typically have significant peripheral leukocytosis and thrombocytosis; in addition, hepatosplenomegaly is generally present.\n\n(Choice D) Myelofibrosis, a chronic hematopoietic neoplasm, is marked by hypocellular marrow with extensive fibrosis. Although pancytopenia is typically present, peripheral blood smear usually shows teardrop-shaped and nucleated erythrocytes; significant extramedullary hematopoiesis also occurs, so dramatic splenomegaly is usually present.\n\n(Choice E) Acute promyelocytic leukemia is associated with promyelocytes with Auer rods (rod-shaped cytoplasmic inclusions). This type of acute myeloid leukemia is characterized clinically by disseminated intravascular coagulation (acquired hypercoagulability and bleeding), which is not seen in this patient (normal PT and PTT); immature leukocytes would also be seen on peripheral smear.\n\nEducational objective:\nAplastic anemia is a form of bone marrow failure due to destruction of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells. It is marked by pancytopenia and profound hypocellularity of the bone marrow with an abundance of fat cells and stroma. Impaired reticulocytosis and an absence of splenomegaly are important features.\n{{exhibit_2}}\n{{exhibit_3}}\n{{exhibit_4}}\n{{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "{{exhibit_1}}\n该患者出现全血细胞减少，网织红细胞计数不适当偏低，外周血涂片细胞系形态正常，体格检查无脾肿大，高度怀疑再障。 \n\n再障是一种骨髓衰竭的形式，由多潜能造血干细胞在骨髓中的直接毒性损伤或细胞毒性T细胞破坏引起。由于这些干细胞产生产生所有血细胞的祖细胞，损伤导致骨髓和外周血中未成熟和成熟血细胞的急剧减少。这在骨髓活检中反映为明显的低细胞性，伴有大量脂肪细胞和其他骨髓基质；抽吸通常会产生“干抽”。\n\n虽然再生障碍性贫血通常是特发性的（无明确病因），但它可能由病毒感染（例如，肝炎、HIV）、化学或辐射暴露或药物（例如，卡马西平）触发。患者通常有全血细胞减少的表现，如严重疲劳和粘膜苍白（贫血）、出血/瘀伤（血小板减少症）或感染（例如，白细胞减少症）。没有明显的髓外造血发生（例如，无脾肿大），因为很少有造血干细胞继续发挥作用。\n\n（选项A）急性白血病（例如，急性髓细胞性白血病）通常与富细胞骨髓和原始细胞增多相关。尽管可能存在贫血和血小板减少症，但大多数患者有轻度白细胞增多症。此外，在外周血涂片中可见原始细胞。\n\n（选项B）慢性髓细胞白血病，一种与BCR-ABL融合基因相关的粒细胞增殖性肿瘤，其特征是富细胞骨髓，粒细胞和巨核细胞增多。患者通常有明显的外周白细胞增多症和血小板增多症；此外，通常存在肝脾肿大。\n\n（选项D）骨髓纤维化，一种慢性造血肿瘤，其特征是低细胞骨髓伴广泛纤维化。尽管通常存在全血细胞减少症，但外周血涂片通常显示泪滴状和有核红细胞；也会发生明显的髓外造血，因此通常存在显著的脾肿大。\n\n（选项E）急性早幼粒细胞白血病与含有Auer小体（杆状细胞质内包涵体）的早幼粒细胞相关。这种类型的急性髓细胞性白血病的临床特征是弥漫性血管内凝血（获得性高凝状态和出血），这在该患者中未见（PT和PTT正常）；在外周血涂片中也会看到未成熟的白细胞。\n\n教学目标：\n再生障碍性贫血是由于多潜能造血干细胞破坏导致的骨髓衰竭。其特征是全血细胞减少和骨髓的严重低细胞性，伴有大量脂肪细胞和基质。网织红细胞生成受损和无脾肿大是重要特征。\n{{exhibit_2}}\n{{exhibit_3}}\n{{exhibit_4}}\n{{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of aplastic anemia, specifically the expected bone marrow biopsy findings in a patient presenting with pancytopenia and associated symptoms. It requires understanding the pathophysiology of bone marrow failure and its impact on cellular composition. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the pancytopenia (low hemoglobin, platelets, and leukocytes) with a low reticulocyte count and normal peripheral smear. This points towards a bone marrow problem, specifically aplastic anemia, which is characterized by hypocellularity with increased fat and stroma.",
