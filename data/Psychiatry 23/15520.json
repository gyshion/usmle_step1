    "en": "A 6-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother due to frequent nighttime awakenings. Over the past several months, the patient has had weekly episodes of waking up screaming at night. His mother says, \"He seems fine when we're reading his bedtime story, but 1-2 hours after falling asleep, he wakes up shrieking. He looks scared, hyperventilates, and cries. When I try to hug him, he pushes me away and eventually falls back asleep.\" The mother is concerned that the patient is watching horror movies with his older brother; however, she mentions that the next morning he does not remember his dreams or having awakened.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This child's sudden nighttime awakenings associated with fear, crying, screaming, and inability to be consoled are characteristic of SLEEP TERRORS. Sleep terrors are a common nonrapid eye movement (NREM) parasomnia in children age 2-12, with a peak incidence at age 5-7. They occur during SLOW-WAVE SLEEP in the first half of the night, and the child does NOT fully awaken. There is no associated dream content, and the child typically has NO MEMORY of the incident in the morning.\n\nNightmares, in contrast, occur during REM sleep and are associated with dream recall and full awakenings (Choice B). In most cases, sleep terrors in children are benign and resolve spontaneously in 1-2 years without treatment.\n\n(Choice A) Hypnagogic hallucinations (vivid dreams at sleep onset) are a characteristic of narcolepsy, a neurologic disorder that typically presents in adolescence and young adulthood with excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden loss of muscle tone.\n\n(Choice C) Children with separation anxiety disorder fear separation and loss from a major attachment figure. They often prefer to sleep with their parents due to fears of being separated and are consoled by their presence. These children have difficulty falling asleep on their own but do not experience sudden nighttime awakenings.\n\n(Choice E) Specific phobia is characterized by intense fear when exposed to a phobic stimulus (eg, animals, thunderstorms, injections), typically accompanied by avoidant behavior. It would not explain this child's abrupt nighttime awakenings with no recall.\n\nEducational objective:\nSleep terrors are a common and usually benign parasomnia of childhood. They occur during nonrapid eye movement sleep and are characterized by fear, crying, and/or screaming; lack of dream recall; and amnesia of the event.",
    "zh": "这个孩子夜间突然惊醒并伴有恐惧、哭泣、尖叫和无法安抚的症状，是夜惊的特征。夜惊是2-12岁儿童中常见的非快速眼动（NREM）睡眠异态，发病高峰在5-7岁。它们发生在夜间前半段的慢波睡眠期间，并且孩子不会完全清醒。没有相关的梦境内容，并且孩子通常对早上发生的事件没有记忆。\n\n相比之下，噩梦发生在REM睡眠期间，并伴有梦境回忆和完全清醒（选项B）。在大多数情况下，儿童的夜惊是良性的，并在1-2年内无需治疗即可自发缓解。\n\n（选项A）入睡前幻觉（入睡时的生动梦境）是发作性睡病的一个特征，这是一种神经系统疾病，通常在青春期和青年时期出现，表现为白天过度嗜睡和突然的肌张力丧失。\n\n（选项C）患有分离焦虑症的儿童害怕与主要依恋对象分离和失去。由于害怕分离，他们通常更喜欢和父母一起睡觉，并因父母的存在而得到安慰。这些孩子难以独自入睡，但不会出现夜间突然惊醒的情况。\n\n（选项E）特定恐惧症的特征是在暴露于恐惧刺激（例如，动物、雷雨、注射）时会产生强烈的恐惧，通常伴有回避行为。这不能解释这个孩子突然夜间惊醒且没有记忆的情况。\n\n教育目标：\n夜惊是儿童时期常见且通常是良性的睡眠异态。它们发生在非快速眼动睡眠期间，其特征是恐惧、哭泣和/或尖叫；缺乏梦境回忆；以及对事件的失忆。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of common childhood parasomnias, specifically differentiating between sleep terrors and nightmares based on their timing within the sleep cycle, the child's state of arousal, and dream recall.\n\nTo solve this question, one must analyze the timing of the awakenings (early in the night), the child's behavior (screaming, fear, inconsolable, pushing away parents), and the lack of recall in the morning, which are all hallmarks of sleep terrors.",
