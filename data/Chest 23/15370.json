    "en": "The nonsmoking patient with dyspnea, cough, and weight loss has pleural thickening on imaging; gross pathology of the lungs demonstrates an encasement of the lungs in a rind-like, calcified mass. This presentation is consistent with MESOTHELIOMA, a rare, malignant neoplasm arising from the mesothelial cells that line body cavities (eg, pleural, peritoneal, pericardial).\n\nIn early mesothelioma, multiple nodules form on the parietal pleura and gradually grow to encase the lung parenchyma (which is typically uninvolved). Pleural effusions are common and frequently hemorrhagic. Mesotheliomas typically present with slowly progressive dyspnea, cough, chest pain, and weight loss. ASBESTOS exposure is the primary risk factor; individuals with occupational exposure (eg, mining, shipbuilding, insulation installation) are at increased risk.\n\nHistologically, mesothelioma can appear as cuboidal or flattened cells (epithelium-like) or spindle cells (stromal-like). Immunohistochemistry is an important diagnostic marker; nearly all cases of mesothelioma will stain positive for cytokeratins and many will also typically stain positive for calretinin. Electron microscopy usually shows polygonal tumor cells with numerous long, slender microvilli and abundant tonofilaments.\n\n(Choice A) Tuberculosis is characterized by caseating granulomas with giant cell formation; patients typically have hilar adenopathy and upper lobe infiltrates. Tuberculosis occurs most commonly in immunosuppressed patients or those at high exposure risk (eg, health care workers, incarcerated individuals).\n\n(Choice B) Silicosis is associated with inhaled silica (eg, mining, sand blasting); histology demonstrates nodules composed of whorled collagen fibers and dust-laden macrophages. Imaging demonstrates innumerable upper lobe-predominant nodes within the pulmonary parenchyma.\n\n(Choice C) Small cell lung cancer is characterized by small round cells; however, this malignancy typically arises in the central airways (not the pleura). Neuroendocrine markers, including chromogranin and synaptophysin, are typically positive.\n\n(Choice E) Empyema—composed of a thick, fibrinous exudate and pus—typically occurs when bacteria infect the pleural space (typically from an associated pneumonia). Patients often present with fever, chills, and (occasionally) sepsis, not months of weight loss and dyspnea. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "这位不吸烟的患者出现呼吸困难、咳嗽和体重减轻，影像学检查显示胸膜增厚；肺部的肉眼病理学显示肺部被一层皮样的钙化肿块包裹。这种表现与间皮瘤一致，间皮瘤是一种罕见的恶性肿瘤，起源于覆盖体腔（例如，胸膜、腹膜、心包）的间皮细胞。\n\n在早期间皮瘤中，多个结节形成于壁层胸膜上，并逐渐生长包裹肺实质（通常未受累）。胸腔积液常见，并且常伴有出血。间皮瘤通常表现为缓慢进展的呼吸困难、咳嗽、胸痛和体重减轻。石棉暴露是主要的危险因素；有职业暴露的个体（例如，采矿、造船、绝缘安装）的风险增加。\n\n在组织学上，间皮瘤可表现为立方或扁平细胞（类似上皮细胞）或梭形细胞（类似基质细胞）。免疫组织化学是一项重要的诊断标志物；几乎所有间皮瘤病例对细胞角蛋白呈阳性，并且许多病例也通常对钙网蛋白呈阳性。电子显微镜通常显示具有许多长而细的微绒毛和丰富的张力原纤维的多边形肿瘤细胞。\n\n（选项A）结核病的特征是伴有巨细胞形成的干酪性肉芽肿；患者通常有肺门淋巴结病和上叶浸润。结核病最常见于免疫抑制患者或高暴露风险人群（例如，医护人员、被监禁者）。\n\n（选项B）矽肺病与吸入二氧化硅（例如，采矿、喷砂）有关；组织学显示由漩涡状胶原纤维和尘埃巨噬细胞组成的结节。影像学检查显示肺实质内有无数以上叶为主的结节。\n\n（选项C）小细胞肺癌的特征是小圆形细胞；然而，这种恶性肿瘤通常发生于中央气道（而非胸膜）。神经内分泌标志物（包括嗜铬蛋白和突触素）通常呈阳性。\n\n（选项E）脓胸——由厚厚的纤维素性渗出物和脓液组成——通常发生在细菌感染胸膜腔时（通常由相关肺炎引起）。患者常表现为发热、寒战和（偶尔）脓毒症，而不是数月的体重减轻和呼吸困难。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of mesothelioma pathology and diagnosis, specifically the histological findings associated with this malignancy. It requires recognizing the characteristic features of mesothelioma on histopathology, including spindle cells positive for cytokeratin, and differentiating it from other lung conditions.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's history (including potential asbestos exposure), the imaging findings (pleural thickening), and the histological features described in the options. Recall that mesothelioma is characterized by spindle cells that stain positive for cytokeratin, which helps distinguish it from other lung conditions.",
