    "en": "A 38-year-old man is evaluated for bloody stools, weight loss, and anemia. The patient's past medical history is unremarkable, and he does not take any medications. He uses tobacco and drinks alcohol \"socially.\" The patient's father died of colon cancer at age 40. His younger sister suffers from endometrial cancer. Examination is remarkable for minimal right-sided abdominal tenderness without guarding to deep palpation. Stool is positive for occult blood. Colonoscopy shows a right-sided ulcerative colon mass. No polyps are noted. Biopsy of the mass reveals adenocarcinoma. A mutation in which of the following genes is most likely responsible for this patient's condition?",

    "en": "This case is typical of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), or Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic predisposition to colon cancer. In patients with HNPCC, colon cancer occurs at a young age (age <50). Family history reveals a high incidence of colon cancer and, occasionally, экстраинтестинальный (eg, endometrial) cancers in first-degree relatives. With HNPCC, there is an inherited mutation in one of the genes responsible for DNA mismatch repair (eg, MSH2, MLH1). The products of these genes proofread DNA during replication. Patients with HNPCC inherit a mutation in an allele, and mutation of the second allele occurs during adult life. When 2 dysfunctional copies are present, malignancies will develop readily.\n\n(Choice A) The APC gene is responsible for intercellular attachment. Its mutation leads to the formation of adenomatous polyps from normal mucosa. APC mutation is detected in most sporadic colon cancers and in all familial polyposis syndromes but not in HNPCC.\n\n(Choice B) Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 are classically associated with breast and ovarian cancers.\n\n(Choice C) MEN1 mutations are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome (parathyroid, pituitary, and pancreatic adenomas).\n\n(Choice E) Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene VHL are classically associated with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (hemangioblastoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, pheochromocytoma).\n\nEducational objective:\nHereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), or Lynch syndrome, leads to occurrence of colonic adenocarcinomas at a young age (<50) along with a predisposition for extraintestinal malignancies. Mutations of DNA mismatch repair genes are responsible for HNPCC.",
    "zh": "该病例是遗传性非息肉病性结直肠癌（HNPCC），或称林奇综合征，一种常染色体显性遗传易感结肠癌。在HNPCC患者中，结肠癌发生在年轻时（<50岁）。家族史显示结肠癌高发，偶尔，一级亲属出现肠外（如子宫内膜）癌。对于HNPCC，存在负责DNA错配修复的基因（例如，MSH2、MLH1）之一的遗传突变。这些基因的产物在复制过程中校对DNA。HNPCC患者遗传等位基因的突变，第二个等位基因的突变发生在成年期。当存在2个功能失常的拷贝时，恶性肿瘤很容易发展。\n\n（选项A）APC基因负责细胞间附着。其突变导致正常黏膜形成腺瘤性息肉。APC突变在大多数散发性结肠癌和所有家族性息肉病综合征中均可检测到，但在HNPCC中则不然。\n\n（选项B）抑癌基因BRCA1的突变通常与乳腺癌和卵巢癌相关。\n\n（选项C）MEN1突变与多发性内分泌肿瘤1型综合征（甲状旁腺、垂体和胰腺腺瘤）相关。\n\n（选项E）抑癌基因VHL的突变通常与von Hippel-Lindau综合征（血管母细胞瘤、透明细胞肾细胞癌、嗜铬细胞瘤）相关。\n\n教育目标：遗传性非息肉病性结直肠癌（HNPCC），或称林奇综合征，导致结肠腺癌在年轻时（<50岁）发生，并伴有肠外恶性肿瘤的易感性。DNA错配修复基因的突变是HNPCC的原因。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome, and its genetic basis. It assesses the ability to correlate clinical presentation, family history, and tumor pathology with specific gene mutations associated with hereditary cancer syndromes.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the key features suggestive of Lynch syndrome, such as early-onset colon cancer and a family history of related cancers. Then, recall or deduce which genes are implicated in DNA mismatch repair and are thus responsible for HNPCC, differentiating them from genes associated with other hereditary cancer syndromes.",
