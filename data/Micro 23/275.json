    "en": "A 47-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to fever and fatigue. He has a history of HIV and has not been taking his antiretrovirals consistently. His temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination is notable for hepatosplenomegaly and multiple erythematous papules. Laboratory studies show pancytopenia. *Histoplasma* antigen testing is positive. Intravenous amphotericin B therapy is initiated for disseminated histoplasmosis. A day later, the patient develops palpitations and weakness. An ECG reveals frequent premature ventricular beats. If these new signs and symptoms are caused by drug toxicity, they are most likely related to which of the following?",

    "en": "This patient with HIV has fever, fatigue, hepatosplenomegaly, skin lesions, and pancytopenia; these are consistent with disseminated histoplasmosis, as evidenced by the positive *Histoplasma* antigen test. Amphotericin B is the drug of choice to treat many systemic mycoses. It is also the most toxic antifungal medication.\n\nThe most dangerous adverse effect of amphotericin B is its NEPHROTOXICITY; this is due to both a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and direct toxic effects on the tubular epithelium. Nephrotoxicity can lead to anemia (decreased erythropoietin production) and electrolyte abnormalities. HYPOKALEMIA and (less often) hypomagnesemia are common due to an increase in the membrane permeability of the distal tubule. Hypokalemia can cause weakness and arrhythmias. ECG findings in hypokalemia include T wave flattening, ST-segment depression, prominent U waves, and premature atrial and ventricular contractions. Profound hypokalemia can cause ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.\n\n(Choice A) Bone marrow suppression is associated with many chemotherapeutic agents, chloramphenicol, zidovudine, and gold-containing medications. Bone marrow suppression would not cause ECG changes.\n\n(Choice B) Doxorubicin and daunorubicin are associated with irreversible dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, which is not a side effect of amphotericin B.\n\n(Choice C) Acetaminophen and halothane are examples of medications that can cause liver necrosis. Amphotericin B can lead to liver toxicity, not necrosis. Arrhythmias and palpitations are more likely caused by electrolyte abnormalities due to renal tubular dysfunction.\n\n(Choice D) Busulfan and bleomycin are examples of drugs that cause pulmonary fibrosis and can lead to pulmonary hypertension.\n\nEducational objective: Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia are common electrolyte disturbances in patients undergoing treatment with amphotericin B and reflect an increase in distal tubular membrane permeability.",
    "zh": "这名HIV患者有发热、疲劳、肝脾肿大、皮肤病变和全血细胞减少；这些与播散性组织胞浆菌病一致，正如同*组织胞浆菌*抗原测试阳性所证实的那样。两性霉素B是治疗许多全身性真菌病的药物首选。它也是毒性最强的抗真菌药物。\n\n两性霉素B最危险的不良反应是它的肾毒性；这是由于肾小球滤过率降低和对肾小管上皮细胞的直接毒性作用。肾毒性可导致贫血（促红细胞生成素生成减少）和电解质异常。低钾血症和（较少见）低镁血症很常见，这是由于远曲小管的膜通透性增加。低钾血症可引起乏力和心律失常。低钾血症的心电图表现包括T波变平、ST段压低、U波明显和房性及室性早搏。严重的低钾血症可引起室性心动过速或心室颤动。\n\n（选项A）骨髓抑制与许多化疗药物、氯霉素、齐多夫定和含金药物有关。骨髓抑制不会引起心电图变化。\n\n（选项B）阿霉素和柔红霉素与不可逆的剂量依赖性心脏毒性有关，这不是两性霉素B的副作用。\n\n（选项C）对乙酰氨基酚和氟烷是可引起肝坏死的药物的例子。两性霉素B可导致肝脏毒性，而不是坏死。心律失常和心悸更有可能是由肾小管功能障碍引起的电解质异常引起的。\n\n（选项D）白消安和博莱霉素是引起肺纤维化并可导致肺动脉高压的药物的例子。\n\n教育目标：低钾血症和低镁血症是正在接受两性霉素B治疗的患者中常见的电解质紊乱，反映了远端小管膜通透性增加。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of amphotericin B toxicity, specifically its nephrotoxic effects leading to electrolyte imbalances and cardiac arrhythmias. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of hypokalemia and its association with amphotericin B use.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the drug being used (amphotericin B), recall its common side effects (nephrotoxicity, electrolyte abnormalities), and link the patient's symptoms (palpitations, weakness, ECG changes) to the electrolyte imbalance (hypokalemia) caused by renal tubular dysfunction.",
