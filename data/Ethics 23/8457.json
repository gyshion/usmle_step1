  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's medical history and examination indicate several signs concerning for elder neglect and possible exploitation. The patient's son sold her house, is not at home most days, and is difficult to contact. He has neglected to assist the patient in picking up her prescriptions or drive her places, forcing her to rely on neighbors for help. Her physical examination is remarkable for elevated blood pressure (likely due to not taking lisinopril) and her tattered clothing may also be an indication of neglect.\n\nHealthcare professionals who care for the elderly have a legal and ethical obligation to intervene when elder abuse, neglect, or exploitation (collectively, elder mistreatment) are suspected. Physicians should be alert for signs of elder mistreatment, including evidence of neglect, deterioration in medical conditions and malnutrition, atypical injuries, and behavioral changes (eg, depression, anxiety). The next step in management is to report suspected mistreatment to Adult Protective Services, which can investigate the situation with home visits, initiate review of financial records to identify victims of financial exploitation, and assist in mobilizing resources (eg, assistance with prescriptions and transportation to appointments, home care services).\n\n(Choices A and D) Although home healthcare services and an in-home social work assessment may be helpful for this patient, investigation for elder mistreatment takes priority. It is mandatory to report suspected elder mistreatment to Adult Protective Services without delay.\n\n(Choice B) It would be inappropriate to contact the son to review treatment recommendations when there are signs of neglect and possible financial exploitation.\n\n(Choice E) It is premature to suggest an assisted living facility without first conducting an appropriate investigation into elder mistreatment and assessing the patient's specific needs.\n\nEducational objective:\nPhysicians should be alert for signs of elder mistreatment, including evidence of neglect, deterioration in medical conditions and malnutrition, atypical injuries, and behavioral changes. It is mandatory to report suspected elder mistreatment to Adult Protective Services.",
    "zh": "该患者的病史和检查表明存在一些令人担忧的老年人疏忽和可能的剥削迹象。患者的儿子卖掉了她的房子，大多数日子不在家，并且难以联系。他没有帮助患者取药或开车送她去别的地方，迫使她依赖邻居的帮助。她的体格检查引人注目的是血压升高（可能由于未服用赖诺普利），她破旧的衣服也可能是疏忽的迹象。\n\n照顾老年人的医疗保健专业人员有法律和伦理义务在怀疑存在虐待、疏忽或剥削（统称为老年人虐待）时进行干预。医生应警惕老年人虐待的迹象，包括疏忽的证据、医疗状况恶化和营养不良、非典型损伤和行为改变（例如，抑郁、焦虑）。下一步的处理是向成人保护服务机构报告疑似虐待，该机构可以进行家访调查情况，启动对财务记录的审查以识别金融剥削的受害者，并协助调动资源（例如，协助处方和预约交通、家庭护理服务）。\n\n（选项A和D）虽然家庭医疗保健服务和居家社工评估可能对该患者有所帮助，但对老年人虐待的调查是首要任务。必须毫不拖延地向成人保护服务机构报告疑似老年人虐待。\n\n（选项B）当存在疏忽和可能的经济剥削迹象时，联系儿子审查治疗建议是不合适的。\n\n（选项E）在没有首先对老年人虐待进行适当调查并评估患者的具体需求的情况下，就建议搬入辅助生活机构为时过早。\n\n教育目标：\n医生应警惕老年人虐待的迹象，包括疏忽的证据、医疗状况恶化和营养不良、非典型损伤和行为改变。必须向成人保护服务机构报告疑似老年人虐待。"
