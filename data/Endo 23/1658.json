    "en": "A 61-year-old woman comes to the office due to a neck lump. She is otherwise in good health and has no other symptoms. Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 78/min. On physical examination, there is a nontender, firm nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid. Laboratory results show a normal serum TSH level. Thyroid ultrasonography reveals a 2-cm, hypoechoic thyroid nodule with increased central blood flow. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy shows clusters of cells with large, overlapping nuclei containing finely dispersed chromatin. Numerous intranuclear inclusion bodies and grooves are also seen.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Papillary thyroid carcinoma {{exhibit_1}} is most common, accounting for >70% of cases. Risk factors include a positive family history of thyroid cancer and radiation exposure, especially in childhood.\n\nPapillary carcinoma cells are characteristically large with overlapping nuclei containing finely dispersed chromatin, giving them an empty or ground-glass appearance (sometimes termed Orphan Annie eye nuclei after a cartoon character whose eyes were drawn without pupils or irises). Numerous nuclear grooves as well as intranuclear inclusions composed of cytoplasm (ie, pseudoinclusions) can be seen due to invagination of the nuclear membrane. Psammoma bodies (laminated calcium deposits) may also be found within the tumor.\n\n(Choice A) Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is an aggressive tumor with a very poor prognosis. It is most common in patients age >60. Cytologic features include markedly pleomorphic cells, including irregular giant and spindle cells.\n\n(Choice B) Most benign thyroid nodules are colloid nodules formed from focal hyperplasia of normal thyroid follicular cells. On cytopathology, a colloid nodule consists of variable-sized thyroid follicles, colloid, and macrophages.\n\n(Choices C and D) Follicular neoplasms lack the characteristic nuclear features and psammoma bodies found in papillary carcinoma. Distinguishing a benign follicular adenoma from a well-differentiated follicular carcinoma depends on the presence of vascular or capsular invasion, which cannot be determined on a fine-needle aspiration specimen.\n\n(Choice E) Medullary thyroid carcinoma appears histologically as polygonal or spindle-shaped cells with a slightly granular cytoplasm that stains for calcitonin. Extracellular amyloid deposits consisting of calcitonin polypeptide may also be seen. Medullary thyroid cancer is a component of multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B.\n\nEducational objective:\nPapillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer. Characteristic microscopic features include large cells with nuclei containing finely dispersed chromatin, giving them an empty or ground-glass appearance (ie, Orphan Annie eye), as well as intranuclear inclusions and nuclear grooves. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "乳头状甲状腺癌 {{exhibit_1}} 最常见，占病例的 70% 以上。危险因素包括甲状腺癌家族史和放射线暴露，尤其是在儿童时期。\n\n乳头状癌细胞的特征是大细胞，具有重叠的细胞核，细胞核含有精细分散的染色质，呈现空泡或磨玻璃状外观（有时被称为“Orphan Annie眼”核，以卡通人物的眼睛为名，其眼睛被描绘成没有瞳孔或虹膜）。可见许多核沟以及由细胞质（即假包涵体）组成的核内包涵体，这是由于核膜内陷所致。沙粒体（层状钙沉积）也可能在肿瘤内发现。\n\n(选项 A) 未分化甲状腺癌是一种侵袭性肿瘤，预后非常差。它最常见于年龄>60岁的患者。细胞学特征包括明显的多形性细胞，包括不规则的巨细胞和梭形细胞。\n\n(选项 B) 大多数良性甲状腺结节是由正常甲状腺滤泡细胞的局灶性增生形成的胶体结节。在细胞病理学上，胶体结节由大小不一的甲状腺滤泡、胶体和巨噬细胞组成。\n\n(选项 C 和 D) 滤泡性肿瘤缺乏乳头状癌中发现的特征性核特征和砂粒体。区分良性滤泡腺瘤和分化良好的滤泡癌取决于是否存在血管或包膜浸润，这无法通过细针穿刺标本确定。\n\n(选项 E) 髓样甲状腺癌在组织学上表现为多边形或梭形细胞，胞质略呈颗粒状，可被降钙素染色。也可观察到由降钙素多肽组成的细胞外淀粉样蛋白沉积。髓样甲状腺癌是多种内分泌肿瘤 2A 型和 2B 型的组成部分。\n\n教育目标：\n乳头状甲状腺癌是最常见的甲状腺癌类型。特征性显微特征包括大细胞，其细胞核含有精细分散的染色质，呈现空泡或磨玻璃状外观（即孤儿安妮眼），以及核内包涵体和核沟。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of thyroid nodule evaluation and the characteristic features of papillary thyroid carcinoma on fine-needle aspiration. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing nuclear features like Orphan Annie eye nuclei, nuclear grooves, and intranuclear inclusions.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key findings from the fine-needle aspiration biopsy. The presence of large cells with overlapping nuclei, finely dispersed chromatin, intranuclear inclusions, and nuclear grooves strongly suggests papillary thyroid carcinoma. Rule out other thyroid neoplasms based on their distinct histological features.",
    "zh": "本题考察对甲状腺结节评估的知识以及乳头状甲状腺癌在细针穿刺中的特征。它强调了识别核特征的重要性，如孤儿安妮眼核、核沟和核内包涵体。\n\n要解决这个问题，请关注细针穿刺活检的关键发现。具有重叠细胞核、精细分散染色质、核内包涵体和核沟的大细胞的存在强烈提示乳头状甲状腺癌。根据其他甲状腺肿瘤的独特组织学特征排除其他肿瘤。"
