  "explanation": {
    "en": "Secretin is a hormone produced by duodenal S-cells and released in response to increased duodenal H+ concentrations. Secretin stimulates pancreatic ductal cells to increase bicarbonate secretion in order to neutralize the acidity of the gastric contents entering the duodenum. Remember that pancreatic juice is an isotonic secretion, which normally contains Na+ and K+ in the same concentrations as found in plasma, a higher HCO3- concentration than in plasma and a lower Cl- concentration than in plasma. As pancreatic juice flow rates and secretin stimulation increase, the concentration of HCO3- increases and the concentration of Cl- decreases.\n\n(Choice A) Regardless of flow rate or hormonal stimulation, the sodium concentration of pancreatic secretions is identical to that of plasma.\n\n(Choice B) The chloride content of pancreatic secretions decreases as the bicarbonate content increases, because chloride and bicarbonate are exchanged for one another at the apical surfaces of pancreatic ductal cells.\n\n(Choice C) Trypsinogen is a pancreatic proenzyme that is converted to its active form, trypsin, by enterokinase in the intestinal brush border. Active trypsin can also activate trypsinogen. Cholecystokinin and cholinergic stimulation increase the secretion of pancreatic enzymes.\n\n(Choice E) Phosphate secretion is not regulated in the pancreas.\n\nEducational Objective:\nDuodenal S-cells secrete secretin in response to increasing H+ concentrations. Secretin increases pancreatic bicarbonate secretion. The chloride content of pancreatic secretions decreases in proportion to bicarbonate concentration increases.",
    "zh": "促胰液素是由十二指肠S细胞产生的一种激素，它响应十二指肠H+浓度升高而释放。促胰液素刺激胰管细胞增加碳酸氢盐的分泌，以中和进入十二指肠的胃内容物的酸度。请记住，胰液是一种等渗分泌物，通常含有与血浆中浓度相同的Na+和K+，HCO3-浓度高于血浆，Cl-浓度低于血浆。随着胰液流速和促胰液素刺激的增加，HCO3-的浓度增加，Cl-的浓度降低。\n\n(选项A) 无论流速或激素刺激如何，胰液中钠的浓度都与血浆相同。\n\n(选项B) 胰液中氯化物含量随着碳酸氢盐含量的增加而减少，因为氯化物和碳酸氢盐在胰管细胞的顶端表面相互交换。\n\n(选项C) 胰蛋白酶原是一种胰酶原，在肠刷状缘的肠激酶作用下转化为其活性形式胰蛋白酶。活性胰蛋白酶也可以激活胰蛋白酶原。胆囊收缩素和胆碱能刺激增加胰酶的分泌。\n\n(选项E) 磷酸盐的分泌不受胰腺调节。\n\n教学目标：\n十二指肠S细胞响应H+浓度升高而分泌促胰液素。促胰液素增加胰碳酸氢盐的分泌。胰液中氯化物含量减少的比例与碳酸氢盐浓度增加成正比。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pancreatic secretion regulation, specifically the effect of secretin on bicarbonate and chloride concentrations in pancreatic juice. Secretin stimulates bicarbonate secretion by pancreatic ductal cells, leading to an increase in bicarbonate and a decrease in chloride concentration in the pancreatic juice.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that secretin is released in response to increased duodenal H+ concentrations and stimulates pancreatic ductal cells to secrete bicarbonate. This increase in bicarbonate is accompanied by a decrease in chloride concentration.",
