    "en": "A 39-year-old right-handed man is brought to the office by his wife due to concerns about his behavior. Two months ago, the patient was robbed and hit in the head and knees with a baseball bat when he resisted. He initially had difficulty walking, but his injuries have since healed. His wife and other family members say that his overall demeanor has changed significantly since the attack. Prior to the assault, the patient was kind, considerate, and extremely polite. However, since the attack, he has been very irritable and rude, and was recently fired from his job for insulting customers and making socially insensitive comments to coworkers. Damage to which anatomical region of the brain is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?",

    "en": "This patient's PERSONALITY CHANGE, DISINHIBITION, and IRRITABILITY are most likely due to damage affecting the ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX (OFC). The OFC is located in the frontal lobe and has strong modulatory connections to the limbic system (ie, the brain's primary emotional system); it is involved in behavioral and emotional regulation.\n\nPathological behavioral and emotional changes are more commonly seen with bilateral, rather than unilateral, injury to the OFC. Disinhibition may be associated with significant impulsivity and loss of social etiquette, whereas increased irritability in the context of disinhibition may lead to frank, aggressive behavior. Diagnostic workup includes obtaining information from family and friends about personality changes, neuropsychological testing, and structural brain imaging.\n\n(Choice A) Damage to the corpus callosum can result in the \"split-brain\" syndrome. Although these patients may appear normal in general social situations, further evaluation can demonstrate lack of interhemispheric transfer of information (eg, patient unable to use one hand to retrieve an object palpated with the other hand).\n\n(Choices B and E) The parietal cortex processes and interprets visual, auditory, and motor signals received from other brain areas. Parietal cortex damage results in difficulties with spatial and visual perception. Dominant lesions (>95% of right-handed and >50% of left-handed patients are left hemisphere dominant) result in GERSTMANN SYNDROME with right-left confusion and difficulty with writing and mathematics. Nondominant parietal cortex lesions (most commonly right-sided) can result in hemi-neglect, constructional apraxia, and denial of the problem.\n\n(Choices C and F) Temporal cortex injury can cause disturbances in language, sensory interpretation, and impaired memory. These patients can also exhibit behavioral changes, such as apathy, hyperorality, hypersexuality, and visual agnosia as seen in KLUVER-BUCY SYNDROME. Nondominant (usually right-sided) lesions can affect nonverbal memory, including musical ability; dominant left-sided lesions can affect verbal memory, such as word recognition. This patient's symptoms are most characteristic of an OFC injury.\n\n(Choice D) The lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in executive functioning, which includes motivation, organization, planning, and purposeful action. Damage to the lateral prefrontal cortex may result in DYSEXECUTIVE SYNDROME, a syndrome characterized by significant difficulties performing these functions.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients with orbitofrontal cortex injury often experience personality changes, disinhibition, and irritability secondary to impairment of the behavioral and emotional modulatory systems.",
    "zh": "该患者的个性改变、去抑制和易怒最可能由于影响眶额叶皮层 (OFC) 的损伤。OFC 位于额叶，与边缘系统（即大脑的主要情绪系统）有很强的调节连接； 它参与行为和情绪调节。\n\n病理性行为和情绪变化更常见于双侧而非单侧的 OFC 损伤。 去抑制可能与明显的冲动和失去社会礼仪相关，而易怒的增加可能导致坦率、攻击性行为。 诊断检查包括从家人和朋友那里获取关于人格变化的信息、神经心理学测试和结构性脑成像。\n\n（选项 A）胼胝体损伤可导致“裂脑”综合征。 尽管这些患者在一般社交场合中可能表现正常，但进一步的评估可以证明缺乏半球间的信息传递（例如，患者无法用一只手取回用另一只手触诊的物体）。\n\n（选项 B 和 E）顶叶皮层处理和解释来自其他大脑区域的视觉、听觉和运动信号。 顶叶皮层损伤会导致空间和视觉感知困难。 优势病变（>95% 的右利手患者和 >50% 的左利手患者是左半球优势）导致 GERSTMANN 综合征，表现为左右混淆以及书写和数学困难。 非优势顶叶皮层病变（最常见于右侧）可导致偏侧忽略、结构性失用和否认问题。\n\n（选项 C 和 F）颞叶皮层损伤可导致语言、感觉解释和记忆受损。 这些患者也可能表现出行为改变，例如冷漠、过度口欲、性欲亢进和视觉失认症，如 KLUVER-BUCY 综合征。 非优势（通常是右侧）病变会影响非语言记忆，包括音乐能力； 优势左侧病变会影响语言记忆，例如单词识别。 该患者的症状最能代表 OFC 损伤。\n\n（选项 D）外侧前额叶皮层参与执行功能，包括动机、组织、计划和有目的的行动。 外侧前额叶皮层损伤可能导致执行功能障碍综合征，这是一种以执行这些功能方面遇到明显困难为特征的综合征。\n\n教育目标：\n眶额叶皮层损伤的患者通常会经历人格改变、去抑制和易怒，这继发于行为和情绪调节系统的损伤。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the neuroanatomical correlates of personality changes, disinhibition, and irritability, specifically focusing on the role of the orbitofrontal cortex in behavioral and emotional regulation.\n\nTo solve this question, one must correlate the patient's observed behavioral and personality changes with the known functions of different brain regions. Identifying the orbitofrontal cortex as the primary area responsible for social cognition and emotional control is key to selecting the correct answer.",
