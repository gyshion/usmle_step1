    "en": "A 5-year-old boy has developed persistent food-seeking behavior over the past few months. His mother initially thought that the boy was undergoing a growth spurt, but despite how much she fed him he never seemed satisfied. He has gained more than 4.5 kg (10 lb). The patient has also started complaining of a headache and nausea in the morning. His physical examination is significant for BMI of 32 kg/m². Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 16/min. His pediatrician becomes concerned about possible central nervous system involvement. This patient's food-seeking behavior could be explained by a lesion causing impairment of which hypothalamic nucleus?",

  "correct_answer": "F",

    "en": "The correct answer is F. The hypothalamus is a key region involved in HOMEOSTASIS, including the regulation of temperature, appetite, emotion, growth, and circadian rhythm. The ventromedial nucleus is vital in monitoring blood glucose and MEDIATES SATIETY. Lesions of this area of the hypothalamus (eg, trauma, infection, brain tumors) can result in HYPERPHAGIA and OBESITY. Conversely, the lateral nuclei signal hunger. Lesions can result in loss of appetite (eg, failure to thrive) (Choice B).\n\n(Choices A and C) The anterior and posterior nuclei are involved in temperature control through regulation of the autonomic nervous system. The anterior nucleus coordinates cooling via inhibition of adrenergic input, causing vasodilation and stimulation of cholinergic pathways (eg, sweating). Destruction of this nucleus can cause uncontrolled hyperthermia. Conversely, the posterior nucleus regulates heat conservation and heat production via vasoconstriction and shivering. Destruction can lead to hypothermia.\n\n(Choice D) The suprachiasmatic nucleus is located immediately above the optic chiasm and receives visual input directly from the retina. It helps regulate circadian rhythms by relaying light information to other hypothalamic nuclei and to the pineal gland.\n\n(Choice E) The supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei project axons into the posterior pituitary gland (neurohypophysis), producing vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) and oxytocin. Oxytocin is associated with uterine contractions and milk letdown; vasopressin regulates fluid balance via reabsorption of water from the kidneys.\n\nEducational objective: The hypothalamus is a key region responsible for homeostasis. The ventromedial nucleus mediates satiety; lesions of this area of the hypothalamus can result in hyperphagia and obesity.",
    "zh": "正确的答案是 F。下丘脑是参与内稳态的关键区域，包括温度、食欲、情绪、生长和昼夜节律的调节。腹内侧核对于监测血糖至关重要，并介导饱腹感。该下丘脑区域的病变（例如，外伤、感染、脑肿瘤）可导致贪食症和肥胖症。相反，外侧核发出饥饿信号。病变可导致食欲不振（例如，生长迟缓）（选项 B）。\n\n（选项 A 和 C）前部和后部核通过调节自主神经系统参与体温控制。前核通过抑制肾上腺素能输入来协调冷却，引起血管舒张并刺激胆碱能通路（例如，出汗）。该核的破坏可导致不受控制的高热。相反，后核通过血管收缩和颤抖来调节热量保存和产热。破坏可导致体温过低。\n\n（选项 D）视交叉上核位于视交叉的正上方，直接从视网膜接收视觉输入。它通过将光信息传递给其他下丘脑核和松果体来帮助调节昼夜节律。\n\n（选项 E）视上核和室旁核将轴突投射到垂体后叶（神经垂体），产生加压素（抗利尿激素）和催产素。催产素与子宫收缩和乳汁分泌有关；加压素通过从肾脏重新吸收水分来调节体液平衡。\n\n教育目标：下丘脑是负责内稳态的关键区域。腹内侧核介导饱腹感；下丘脑该区域的病变可导致贪食症和肥胖症。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the functions of different hypothalamic nuclei, specifically their roles in regulating appetite and satiety. It requires correlating clinical presentation of hyperphagia and obesity with a specific lesion location within the hypothalamus.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall the major functions of the hypothalamic nuclei, particularly those involved in appetite regulation. Identifying the symptoms of excessive hunger and weight gain points towards a lesion affecting the satiety center, which is located in the ventromedial nucleus.",
