  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient is experiencing sudden-onset chest tightness and dyspnea, and CT scan of the chest shows a **saddle pulmonary embolism (PE)** straddling the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery. The main pulmonary artery, usually comparable in diameter to the ascending aorta, is significantly dilated due to the proximal increase in hydrostatic pressure from the PE. Saddle PE can result in sudden cardiac death or severe hypotension, but many patients can be hemodynamically stable on presentation.\n\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) (ie, PE or deep venous thrombosis) results from the Virchow triad of endothelial injury, venous stasis, and a hypercoagulable state. **Malignancy** (eg, prostate cancer) induces a hypercoagulable state and is a strong risk factor for VTE. Active **smoking** is also a risk factor as it contributes to endothelial injury and a hypercoagulable state. Age plays a role as well, as older individuals tend to be more **sedentary** and are more prone to venous stasis.\n\n(Choice A) Atherosclerosis primarily affects the higher pressure arteries in the systemic circulation (eg, aorta, popliteal arteries, carotid arteries) and the coronary arteries. Significant atherosclerosis in the relatively low-pressure pulmonary arteries is rare.\n\n(Choice B) Fluid overload causes pulmonary edema, typically appearing as alveolar ground glass opacities on CT scan {{exhibit_2}}. This patient's lungs appear clear of airspace disease.\n\n(Choice D) An intimal tear can lead to aortic dissection, which classically manifests as severe chest pain radiating to the back. Pulmonary artery dissection is extremely rare.\n\n(Choice E) Pulmonary vasculitis (eg, granulomatosis with polyangiitis) could cause dyspnea and chest tightness but would demonstrate an interstitial pattern on CT scan, sometimes leading to pulmonary hemorrhage.\n\n(Choice F) Rupture of pulmonary blebs (thin-walled, air-filled subpleural structures) leads to pneumothorax.\n\n(Choice G) For pulmonary metastasis to cause significant dyspnea, multiple lesions would likely be present. There is no evidence of lung masses on this patient's CT scan.\n\nEducational objective:\nSaddle pulmonary embolism straddles the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery. Venous thromboembolism (ie, pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) arises due to the Virchow triad of endothelial injury, venous stasis, and a hypercoagulable state. Malignancy causes a hypercoagulable state and is a strong risk factor for venous thromboembolism. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}",
    "zh": "该患者出现突发性胸闷和呼吸困难，胸部CT扫描显示**马鞍征肺栓塞（PE）**，横跨主肺动脉的分叉。主肺动脉直径通常与升主动脉相当，由于PE引起的近端静水压升高，主肺动脉明显扩张。马鞍征PE可导致猝死或严重低血压，但许多患者在就诊时血流动力学稳定。\n\n静脉血栓栓塞症 (VTE) (即 PE 或深静脉血栓形成) 源于 Virchow 三联征，即内皮损伤、静脉淤滞和高凝状态。**恶性肿瘤**（例如，前列腺癌）诱发高凝状态，是VTE的强危险因素。**吸烟**也是一个危险因素，因为它会导致内皮损伤和高凝状态。年龄也起作用，因为老年人往往更加**久坐不动**，更容易发生静脉淤滞。\n\n(选项 A) 动脉粥样硬化主要影响体循环中压力较高的动脉（例如，主动脉、腘动脉、颈动脉）和冠状动脉。在相对低压的肺动脉中发生明显的动脉粥样硬化是罕见的。\n\n(选项 B) 液体超负荷导致肺水肿，通常在CT扫描上表现为肺泡磨玻璃影 {{exhibit_2}}。该患者的肺部没有显示出气腔疾病。\n\n(选项 D) 内膜撕裂可导致主动脉夹层，其典型表现为严重的胸痛，并放射到背部。肺动脉夹层非常罕见。\n\n(选项 E) 肺血管炎（例如，肉芽肿性多血管炎）可引起呼吸困难和胸闷，但在CT扫描上会表现出间质性改变，有时会导致肺出血。\n\n(选项 F) 肺大疱（薄壁、含气、肺泡下结构）破裂会导致气胸。\n\n(选项 G) 肺转移要引起明显的呼吸困难，可能需要出现多个病灶。该患者的CT扫描中没有肺部肿块的证据。\n\n教学目标：\n马鞍征肺栓塞横跨主肺动脉的分叉。静脉血栓栓塞症（即肺栓塞或深静脉血栓形成）源于 Virchow 三联征，即内皮损伤、静脉淤滞和高凝状态。恶性肿瘤导致高凝状态，是静脉血栓栓塞症的强危险因素。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pulmonary embolism (PE) risk factors, diagnosis, and the Virchow triad. It also assesses the ability to interpret a CT scan showing a saddle PE.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the patient's risk factors for hypercoagulability (age, smoking history, malignancy) and correlate them with the clinical presentation and CT scan findings. Rule out other causes of chest pain and dyspnea based on the CT scan and clinical history.",
