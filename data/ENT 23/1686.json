    "en": "A 44-year-old man comes to the office for evaluation of a neck lump. The patient first noticed the lump 6 months ago while he was shaving and says that it seems to be growing in size. He has no pain, shortness of breath, cough, hoarseness, or difficulty swallowing. The patient had Hodgkin lymphoma 20 years ago, which was successfully treated with radiation therapy to his chest and neck. Physical examination shows a firm mass in the left thyroid lobe. There is no lymphadenopathy. Serum TSH level is normal. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy reveals papillary thyroid cancer. A total thyroidectomy is performed. During an attempt to ligate the inferior thyroid artery, a nervous structure in close proximity is inadvertently damaged. Which of the following was most likely injured during the surgery? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "The inferior thyroid artery arises from the thyrocervical trunk, a branch of the subclavian artery. Along with the superior thyroid arteries (branches of the external carotid arteries), the inferior thyroid arteries provide blood to the thyroid gland and other structures of the anterior neck. From the thyrocervical trunk, the inferior thyroid artery courses deep to the internal jugular vein, vagus nerve, and common carotid artery before turning toward the thyroid. As it approaches the thyroid, the artery comes in close proximity to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\n\nThe recurrent laryngeal nerve is a branch of the vagus nerve that loops below the aortic arch on the left and below the subclavian artery on the right to provide motor innervation to the intrinsic muscles of the larynx (except the cricothyroid). During thyroid surgery, this nerve may be damaged due to its proximity to the inferior thyroid artery. Unilateral nerve injury often causes hoarseness, whereas bilateral injury may cause inspiratory stridor and respiratory distress due to complete VOCAL CORD PARALYSIS.\n\n(Choice A) The spinal accessory nerve (CN XI) exits the jugular foramen and courses on top of the levator scapulae muscle to innervate the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles on either side.\n\n(Choice B) The ansa cervicalis is a loop of the cervical plexus that receives contributions from C1-C3. It courses deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and loops around the internal jugular vein. Branches from the ansa cervicalis innervate the sternohyoid, sternothyroid, and omohyoid muscles.\n\n(Choice C) The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) exits the cranium through the hypoglossal canal and innervates all the muscles of the tongue except the palatoglossus.\n\n(Choice D) The phrenic nerve arises from the C3-C5 cervical nerves and innervates the diaphragm. The most common cause of iatrogenic phrenic nerve injury is cardiothoracic surgery, in which the nerve can be damaged where it passes between the pericardium and mediastinal pleura. Manifestations include diaphragmatic paralysis (inspiratory weakness).\n\n(Choice F) The superior cervical ganglion is part of the sympathetic nervous system. It can be injured by an expanding lung cancer at the superior pulmonary sulcus (Pancoast tumor), leading to Horner syndrome (ie, ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, and anhydrosis).\n\n(Choice G) The superior laryngeal nerve branches off the vagus nerve high in the neck and divides into an external branch, which supplies the cricothyroid muscle, and an internal branch, which provides sensation over the supraglottic area. The external branch of this nerve may be misligated during thyroid surgery due to its proximity to the superior thyroid artery.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe recurrent laryngeal nerve travels in close proximity to the inferior thyroid artery and can be injured during thyroid surgery, resulting in vocal cord paralysis (eg, hoarseness).",
    "zh": "甲状腺下动脉起源于甲状颈干，是锁骨下动脉的分支。甲状腺上动脉（颈外动脉的分支）和甲状腺下动脉为甲状腺和颈前其他结构提供血液。甲状腺下动脉从甲状颈干发出，行于颈内静脉、迷走神经和颈总动脉的深部，然后转向甲状腺。当它接近甲状腺时，动脉与喉返神经非常接近。\n\n喉返神经是迷走神经的分支，在左侧绕过主动脉弓下方，在右侧绕过锁骨下动脉下方，为喉固有肌（环甲肌除外）提供运动神经支配。在甲状腺手术期间，该神经可能因其靠近甲状腺下动脉而受损。单侧神经损伤通常会导致声音嘶哑，而双侧损伤可能由于完全性声带麻痹而导致吸气性喘鸣和呼吸窘迫。\n\n(选项A) 副神经 (CN XI) 从颈静脉孔发出，走行于肩胛提肌上方，支配两侧的胸锁乳突肌和斜方肌。\n\n(选项B) 颈袢是颈丛的一个环，接受来自C1-C3的贡献。它行于胸锁乳突肌深部，并绕颈内静脉回环。颈袢的分支支配胸骨舌骨肌、胸骨甲状肌和肩胛舌骨肌。\n\n(选项C) 舌下神经 (CN XII) 通过舌下神经管离开颅腔，支配舌的所有肌肉，除了腭舌肌。\n\n(选项D) 膈神经起源于C3-C5颈神经，支配膈肌。医源性膈神经损伤最常见的原因是心胸外科手术，在该手术中，神经可能在心包和纵隔胸膜之间受损。表现包括膈肌麻痹（吸气无力）。\n\n(选项F) 颈上神经节是交感神经系统的一部分。它可能因在肺尖沟的扩张性肺癌（Pancoast 肿瘤）而受损，导致Horner综合征（即同侧眼睑下垂、瞳孔缩小和无汗症）。\n\n(选项G) 喉上神经从颈部的迷走神经分出，分为一个外支，供应环甲肌，和一个内支，提供声门上区域的感觉。该神经的外支可能在甲状腺手术期间因其靠近甲状腺上动脉而误结扎。\n\n教育目的：\n喉返神经走行于甲状腺下动脉附近，在甲状腺手术期间可能受损，导致声带麻痹（例如，声音嘶哑）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the anatomical relationships in the neck, specifically the proximity of the recurrent laryngeal nerve to the inferior thyroid artery during thyroid surgery. It also assesses understanding of the clinical consequences of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the surgical procedure (thyroidectomy) and the anatomical structures at risk during ligation of the inferior thyroid artery. Knowledge of the recurrent laryngeal nerve's course and function is essential to selecting the correct answer.",
