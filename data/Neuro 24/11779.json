    "en": "A 46-year-old man comes to the office with left upper limb weakness and numbness. He has had chronic neck pain since being involved in a motor vehicle collision 4 years ago. He has no other medical problems. Neurological evaluation reveals that the tendon reflex shown in the image below is absent. Reflexes in the right upper extremity and both lower extremities are normal. {{exhibit_1}} Imaging studies reveal degenerative changes in the spine causing mild spinal cord compression.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has an absent biceps reflex. The test is performed by quickly tapping a reflex hammer against the biceps brachii tendon as it passes through the cubital fossa. This action activates the muscle's stretch receptors that communicate via the musculocutaneous nerve with lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the C5-C6 spinal level. Axons from these motor neurons return along the musculocutaneous nerve and cause involuntary biceps muscle contraction and jerking of the forearm. The C5-C6 nerves also control the brachioradialis reflex. A stronger than normal reflex suggests an upper motor neuron lesion whereas an absent or decreased reflex indicates a lower motor neuron lesion at the corresponding spinal cord level.\n\n(Choice A) The C3-C4 cervical nerves provide innervation to the diaphragm but do not mediate any specific reflexes.\n\n(Choices C, D, and E) The C7, C8, and T1 spinal nerve roots form the median and ulnar nerves, which provide motor innervation to the wrist and hand. The T1 and T2 thoracic nerves innervate the rib muscles around the sternum, parts of the axilla, and part of the scapula. However, none of these spinal nerves mediate significant reflexes.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe C5-C6 spinal nerves mediate the biceps and brachioradialis reflexes.",
    "zh": "该患者的肱二头肌反射消失。该测试通过快速敲击反射锤来完成，锤击肱二头肌腱，因为它穿过肘窝。此动作激活肌肉的牵张感受器，这些感受器通过肌皮神经与C5-C6脊髓前角的下运动神经元沟通。这些运动神经元的轴突沿着肌皮神经返回，引起肱二头肌的非自主收缩和前臂抽搐。C5-C6神经也控制肱桡肌反射。反射比正常情况更强提示上运动神经元病变，而反射消失或减弱则提示相应脊髓节段的下运动神经元病变。\n\n(选项A) C3-C4颈神经为膈肌提供神经支配，但不介导任何特定的反射。\n\n(选项C、D和E) C7、C8和T1脊神经根构成正中神经和尺神经，它们为腕部和手部提供运动神经支配。T1和T2胸神经支配胸骨周围的肋骨肌肉、腋窝部分和肩胛骨部分。然而，这些脊神经均不介导重要的反射。\n\n教育目标：\nC5-C6脊神经介导肱二头肌和肱桡肌反射。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the neurological examination, specifically the correlation between absent reflexes and the affected spinal cord level. It requires knowledge of myotomes and reflex arcs for the upper extremities.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the absent reflex (biceps reflex) and recall which spinal nerve roots are responsible for that reflex. The absence of the reflex points to a lower motor neuron lesion at that specific spinal cord level.",
    "zh": "本题测试对神经系统检查的理解，特别是缺失反射与受影响脊髓节段之间的相关性。它需要了解上肢的肌节和反射弧。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要确定缺失的反射（肱二头肌反射），并回忆哪些脊神经根负责该反射。反射的缺失指向该特定脊髓节段的下运动神经元病变。"
