    "en": "Resting cardiac output is approximately 5 L/min and commonly increases to 15 or 20 L/min with exercise. Highly trained endurance athletes with the characteristic cardiovascular adaptations of athlete's heart can often increase their cardiac output up to 35 or 40 L/min. Maximum heart rate does not significantly increase in highly trained athletes; therefore, the increased maximum cardiac output is primarily due to increased stroke volume (cardiac output = stroke volume x heart rate). {{exhibit_1}}\n\nTo meet the metabolic demands of frequent and intense endurance training (eg, long-distance swimming) the body gradually increases both red blood cell mass and plasma volume to increase oxygen carrying capacity. In addition, skeletal muscles develop increased arteriolar and capillary density, which improves oxygen uptake and also causes overall reduced systemic vascular resistance (SVR).\n\nBoth the increased blood volume and reduced SVR contribute to increased cardiac venous return (ie, preload), which places increased volume load on the left ventricle. In response, the left ventricle undergoes eccentric hypertrophy to increase left ventricular cavity size and improve diastolic filling capacity. The resulting increase in end-diastolic volume capacity is the primary driver of the marked increase in stroke volume that occurs with endurance training (a training-induced increase in myocardial contractility also somewhat contributes). Because end-diastolic volume and stroke volume are both proportionally increased, left ventricular ejection fraction is mostly unchanged.\n\nThe right ventricle also undergoes similar cavity enlargement to support the increase in maximum cardiac output. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nEducational objective:\nWith endurace traning, the physiologic changes of athlete's heart allow for increased maximum cardiac output via an increase in stroke volume. The left ventricle undergoes eccentric hypertrophy to increase left ventricular cavity size and improve diastolic filling capacity. The resulting increase in end-diastolic volume capacity allows for increased stroke volume and cardiac output. Because end-diastolic volume and stroke volume are both proportionally increased, left ventricular ejection fraction is mostly unchanged.\n\n*Incorrect Answers:*\n\n*   Answers A and E: Left ventricular ejection fraction is mostly unchanged in athletes.\n*   Answers B and C: Left ventricular cavity size is increased in athletes.\n\n**Key Concept:**\n\n*   Endurance athletes have increased left ventricular cavity size and increased maximum cardiac output, but unchanged left ventricular ejection fraction. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "静息心输出量约为5 L/min，运动时通常增加到15或20 L/min。经过高度训练的耐力型运动员，具有运动员心脏的特征性心血管适应，通常可以将其心输出量增加到35或40 L/min。经过高度训练的运动员的最大心率不会显着增加；因此，增加的最大心输出量主要归因于每搏输出量的增加（心输出量 = 每搏输出量 x 心率）。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n为了满足频繁而剧烈的耐力训练（例如，长距离游泳）的代谢需求，身体逐渐增加红细胞质量和血浆量，以提高氧气携带能力。此外，骨骼肌会增加微动脉和毛细血管密度，从而改善氧气摄取，同时导致全身血管阻力（SVR）降低。\n\n血容量增加和 SVR 降低都有助于增加心脏静脉回流（即，前负荷），这会增加左心室的容量负荷。作为响应，左心室发生向心性肥大，以增加左心室腔大小并改善舒张充盈能力。由此产生的舒张末期容积能力的增加是耐力训练中每搏输出量显着增加的主要驱动因素（训练引起的心肌收缩力增加也略有贡献）。由于舒张末期容积和每搏输出量都成比例地增加，左心室射血分数基本保持不变。\n\n右心室也会发生类似的腔室扩大，以支持最大心输出量的增加。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n教学目标：\n通过耐力训练，运动员心脏的生理变化通过增加每搏输出量来增加最大心输出量。左心室发生向心性肥大，以增加左心室腔大小并改善舒张充盈能力。由此产生的舒张末期容积能力的增加允许每搏输出量和心输出量增加。由于舒张末期容积和每搏输出量都成比例地增加，左心室射血分数基本保持不变。\n\n*错误答案：*\n\n*   答案A和E：运动员的左心室射血分数基本保持不变。\n*   答案B和C：运动员的左心室腔大小增加。\n\n**关键概念：**\n\n*   耐力型运动员的左心室腔大小增加，最大心输出量增加，但左心室射血分数不变。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cardiovascular adaptations in endurance athletes, specifically the changes in left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricle cavity size, and maximum cardiac output. It requires understanding the physiological responses to chronic endurance training.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that endurance training leads to eccentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle, increasing cavity size and stroke volume. While cardiac output increases, the ejection fraction remains relatively unchanged.",
