    "en": "A 6-month-old full-term boy is brought to the emergency department with lethargy and vomiting. He was born by uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery and has been growing and developing normally. The patient was breastfed exclusively until 2 days ago when homemade pureed food was added to his diet. He has had no fever or diarrhea. His parents are healthy and he has had no sick contacts. Examination shows a pale, diaphoretic, and ill-appearing infant. Serum glucose is 30 mg/dL. Diagnostic testing confirms aldolase B deficiency.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Aldolase B metabolizes fructose-1-phosphate, a product of fructose metabolism, to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde, which can then enter the glycolytic pathway. Aldolase B deficiency can result in fructose-1-phosphate accumulation; this toxic metabolite depletes intracellular phosphate and inhibits the activation of hepatic phosphorylase and gluconeogenesis. The resulting condition, hereditary fructose intolerance (eg, fructosemia), is an autosomal recessive disorder.\n\nBecause gluconeogenesis is impaired, fructosemia typically presents with life-threatening hypoglycemia. Consequences of hypoglycemia include lethargy, sweating, vomiting, and dehydration. These symptoms manifest after intake of fructose or sucrose, such as from formula or fruit. Strict abstinence from dietary fructose and sucrose can result in dramatic recovery.\n\n(Choices A and D) Starch (similar to glycogen in mammals) is the major storage form of carbohydrates in plants and contains only glucose molecules. Starch consists of an unbranched portion composed of amylose and a branched portion called amylopectin. Patients with fructosemia have normal metabolism of glucose.\n\n(Choice B) Cellulose is a linear polysaccharide of glucose that is mainly present in the cell wall of plant cells. Cellulose is an insoluble, indigestible dietary fiber that is responsible for the bulk of fecal matter.\n\n(Choices C, E, and F) Breast milk contains the disaccharides lactose (composed of galactose and glucose) and maltose (composed of 2 glucose molecules). Patients with aldolase B deficiency can consume these disaccharides as their breakdown will not produce fructose. However, patients with galactosemia cannot metabolize galactose in breast milk or cow's milk-based formula. These patients typically present in the first few days of life with jaundice, vomiting, poor feeding, and hepatomegaly.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nAldolase B deficiency, or hereditary fructose intolerance, leads to accumulation of the toxic metabolite fructose-1-phosphate. Patients have hypoglycemia and vomiting when fructose or sucrose is consumed. Treatment involves strict removal of both carbohydrates from the diet.",
    "zh": "醛缩酶B代谢果糖-1-磷酸，果糖代谢的产物，生成二羟基丙酮磷酸(DHAP)和甘油醛，然后可以进入糖酵解途径。醛缩酶B缺乏症可导致果糖-1-磷酸积累；这种有毒代谢物会耗尽细胞内磷酸盐，并抑制肝磷酸化酶和糖异生作用的激活。由此导致的疾病，遗传性果糖不耐受症（如果糖血症），是一种常染色体隐性遗传病。\n\n由于糖异生受损，果糖血症通常表现为危及生命的低血糖症。低血糖的后果包括嗜睡、出汗、呕吐和脱水。这些症状在摄入果糖或蔗糖后出现，例如来自配方奶或水果。严格禁食饮食中的果糖和蔗糖可以显著恢复。\n\n（选项A和D）淀粉（与哺乳动物的糖原相似）是植物中碳水化合物的主要储存形式，仅含有葡萄糖分子。淀粉由一个未分叉的部分组成，由直链淀粉组成，和一个分叉的部分组成，称为支链淀粉。果糖血症患者对葡萄糖的代谢是正常的。\n\n（选项B）纤维素是葡萄糖的线性多糖，主要存在于植物细胞壁中。纤维素是一种不溶性、不可消化的膳食纤维，是粪便的主要成分。\n\n（选项C、E和F）母乳中含有二糖乳糖（由半乳糖和葡萄糖组成）和麦芽糖（由2个葡萄糖分子组成）。醛缩酶B缺乏症患者可以食用这些二糖，因为它们的分解不会产生果糖。但是，半乳糖血症患者不能代谢母乳或牛奶配方奶中的半乳糖。这些患者通常在出生后的头几天出现黄疸、呕吐、喂养不良和肝肿大。\n\n教育目标：\n\n醛缩酶B缺乏症或遗传性果糖不耐受症会导致有毒代谢物果糖-1-磷酸的积累。当摄入果糖或蔗糖时，患者会出现低血糖和呕吐。治疗包括严格从饮食中去除这两种碳水化合物。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hereditary fructose intolerance (aldolase B deficiency), its pathophysiology related to fructose metabolism, and dietary management. The question requires recognizing the symptoms of hypoglycemia and vomiting in an infant after the introduction of new foods, suggesting a possible metabolic disorder related to fructose metabolism.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the symptoms and lab findings (hypoglycemia) in the context of the new diet. Identify the disaccharide that contains fructose, which should be avoided in patients with aldolase B deficiency to prevent the accumulation of toxic metabolites.",
