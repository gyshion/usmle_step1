    "en": "A 36-year-old woman with well-controlled asthma and hypothyroidism comes to the office to review recent thyroid function tests with her primary care physician. She has been his patient for the past 8 years. During the visit, she mentions that she is recently divorced and has had difficulty meeting \"smart and interesting\" men. The patient, noticing the physician is not wearing a wedding ring, asks if he is single. The physician responds, \"Yes, why do you ask?\" The patient replies that she was wondering whether he would consider going out for dinner now that they are both single. The physician has always found the patient attractive and would like to accept the invitation.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "A romantic or sexual relationship between a physician and a current patient (as in this scenario) is always considered unethical due to potential exploitation and/or interference with the physician's objective clinical judgment. Such a relationship may be ethically acceptable provided the physician-patient relationship is terminated well before initiating a personal relationship. However, it would also be inappropriate to suggest termination of the physician-patient relationship solely for the purposes of dating, as physician-patient continuity is associated with better patient outcomes; furthermore, the patient should not be forced to choose between having the physician be a treatment provider or a romantic partner (Choices C and F).\n\nOf note, relationships between physicians and current or prior psychiatric patients are always unethical due to the nature of evaluation and treatment, which include discussion of sensitive information and recognition of psychological vulnerabilities.\n\n(Choices A and B) Romantic and sexual relationships with current patients are unacceptable regardless of who initiates them or whether there is mutual interest.\n\n(Choice E) This statement is unnecessarily critical and may make the patient feel embarrassed or ashamed.\n\nEducational objective:\nRomantic and sexual relationships with current patients as well as former psychiatric patients are always unethical. Relationships with former non-psychiatric patients may be acceptable provided the physician-patient relationship is terminated well beforehand.",
    "zh": "医生与目前的患者（如本案例）之间的浪漫或性关系，由于存在潜在的剥削和/或干扰医生的客观临床判断，因此始终被认为是不道德的。如果医患关系在开始私人关系之前就已终止，则这种关系在伦理上可能可以接受。然而，仅仅为了约会的目的而建议终止医患关系也是不合适的，因为医患关系的连续性与更好的患者预后相关；此外，不应强迫患者在让医生作为治疗提供者或浪漫伴侣之间做出选择（选项C和F）。\n\n请注意，由于评估和治疗的性质，包括讨论敏感信息和识别心理脆弱性，医生与目前或之前的精神病患者之间的关系始终是不道德的。\n\n（选项A和B）与目前患者的浪漫和性关系是不可接受的，无论谁发起或是否存在共同的兴趣。\n\n（选项E）这种说法是不必要的批判，并且可能使患者感到尴尬或羞愧。\n\n教育目标：\n与目前的患者以及以前的精神病患者的浪漫和性关系始终是不道德的。与以前的非精神病患者的关系可能可以接受，前提是医患关系事先已终止。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ethical considerations surrounding physician-patient relationships, specifically the prohibition of romantic or sexual relationships with current patients due to potential exploitation and compromised objectivity. The correct approach is to decline the invitation and explain the ethical implications, while avoiding unnecessary criticism or suggesting termination of the physician-patient relationship solely for dating purposes.\n\nTo solve this type of question, prioritize ethical principles and professional boundaries. Recognize that maintaining objectivity and avoiding exploitation are paramount in the physician-patient relationship. Consider the potential impact of different responses on the patient's well-being and the integrity of the therapeutic relationship.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了围绕医患关系的伦理考虑，特别是禁止与现有患者发生浪漫或性关系，因为这可能导致剥削和损害客观性。正确的做法是拒绝邀请并解释伦理含义，同时避免不必要的批评或仅仅为了约会而建议终止医患关系。\n\n要解决这种类型的问题，请优先考虑伦理原则和职业界限。认识到保持客观性和避免剥削在医患关系中至关重要。考虑不同回应对患者福祉和治疗关系完整性的潜在影响。"
