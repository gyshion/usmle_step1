    "en": "A 65-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to abnormal behavior. The patient was in her usual state of health until 3 hours ago, when she suddenly became confused and kept asking repetitive questions. She has had no headache, abnormal motor activity, or focal weakness or numbness. Medical history is significant for hypertension and migraine. Blood pressure is 136/84 mm Hg and pulse is 80/min. On physical examination, the patient is awake and alert but keeps asking, \"What happened?\" She can state her date of birth and address correctly, recognizes her family members, and is aware of current events. The patient recalls 0 of 3 objects after several minutes and cannot retain the physician's name despite many repetitions. Speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia. Cranial nerve examination shows no abnormalities. Motor strength, reflexes, and sensation are normal throughout. Blood cell count and serum chemistry panel are within normal limits. Urine drug screen is negative. CT scan of the head shows no hemorrhage. Two hours later, the patient spontaneously returns to normal. Temporary dysfunction of which of the following neural structures best explains this patient's symptoms?",
    "zh": "一名65岁女性因行为异常被送往急诊科。患者在3小时前一直处于健康状态，当时她突然变得意识模糊，并反复提问。她没有头痛、异常运动、局灶性无力或麻木。病史提示高血压和偏头痛。血压为136/84 mm Hg，脉搏为80/min。体格检查显示，患者清醒并警觉，但反复询问“发生了什么事？”她能正确说出她的出生日期和住址，认出她的家人，并了解时事。几分钟后，患者回忆起3个物体中的0个，尽管反复重复，但无法记住医生的名字。言语流畅，无构音障碍或失语。颅神经检查无异常。全身运动力量、反射和感觉均正常。血细胞计数和血清化学检查结果均在正常范围内。尿液药物筛查阴性。头部CT扫描未显示出血。两小时后，患者自发恢复正常。下列哪种神经结构的暂时性功能障碍最能解释该患者的症状？"

    "en": "This patient's sudden-onset confusion, memory loss, and anterograde amnesia (ie, inability to form new memories) resolving within 2 hours is consistent with TRANSIENT GLOBAL AMNESIA (TGA). The inability to retain new information during a TGA episode frequently causes patients to ask repetitive questions. In addition to PROMINENT ANTEROGRADE AMNESIA, patients with TGA have varying degrees of retrograde amnesia (ie, lack of recall of information prior to the episode). They remain fully alert and oriented to self but are typically disoriented to place. Other cognitive functions remain intact during the episode, and neurologic examination is normal. Episodes are self-limited, and AMNESTIC SYMPTOMS RESOLVE FULLY (except for events that occurred during the TGA episode itself) within 24 hours by definition.\n\nRisk factors for TGA in this patient include older age and history of migraine. Although the specific etiology of TGA is uncertain, the clinical symptoms and neuroimaging studies implicate dysfunction of the HIPPOCAMPUS, the area of the brain critical for formation of new memories.\n\n(Choice A) The arcuate fasciculus is an association fiber tract connecting Broca area and Wernicke area in the brain. Dysfunction in this tract correlates with conduction aphasia. Language comprehension and speech are normal in TGA.\n\n(Choice C) The nucleus accumbens is part of the basal ganglia. It mediates reward and pleasure and plays an important role in addiction.\n\n(Choice D) The piriform cortex is the brain region associated with processing olfactory information.\n\n(Choice E) The pontine reticular formation is located in the brainstem and regulates arousal, attention, sleep, and muscle tone. Dysfunction in this area is associated with delirium, which is characterized by fluctuating levels of arousal. Patients with TGA are alert and have a relatively isolated deficit of anterograde amnesia.\n\nEducational objective:\nTransient global amnesia is a self-limited syndrome characterized by the sudden onset of prominent anterograde amnesia accompanied by repetitive questioning. Symptoms correlate with transient dysfunction of the hippocampus, the brain area responsible for the formation of new memories.",
    "zh": "该患者的突发性意识模糊、记忆丧失和顺行性遗忘（即，无法形成新的记忆）在2小时内消退，这与短暂性全面遗忘症（TGA）一致。在TGA发作期间，无法保留新信息常常导致患者反复提问。除了显著的顺行性遗忘症外，患有TGA的患者还表现出不同程度的逆行性遗忘（即，无法回忆起发作前的信息）。他们在发病期间保持完全清醒，对自身定向，但通常对地点定向障碍。其他认知功能在发作期间保持完整，神经系统检查结果正常。发作具有自限性，并且遗忘症状在24小时内完全缓解（除了在TGA发作期间发生的事件本身）。\n\n该患者TGA的危险因素包括高龄和偏头痛病史。尽管TGA的具体病因尚不明确，但临床症状和神经影像学研究表明，海马体功能障碍与TGA有关，海马体是大脑中对于形成新记忆至关重要的区域。\n\n（选项A）弓形束是将大脑中的Broca区和Wernicke区连接起来的联合纤维束。该束的功能障碍与传导性失语症相关。TGA中语言理解和言语是正常的。\n\n（选项C）伏隔核是基底神经节的一部分。它介导奖励和快乐，并在成瘾中起重要作用。\n\n（选项D）梨状皮质是大脑中与处理嗅觉信息相关的区域。\n\n（选项E）脑桥网状结构位于脑干中，调节唤醒、注意力、睡眠和肌张力。该区域的功能障碍与谵妄有关，其特征是唤醒水平波动。TGA患者清醒，并且具有相对孤立的顺行性遗忘症缺陷。\n\n教育目标：短暂性全面遗忘症是一种自限性综合征，其特征是突然发生的、显著的顺行性遗忘症，伴有反复提问。症状与海马体的短暂性功能障碍相关，海马体是负责形成新记忆的大脑区域。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of transient global amnesia (TGA), its clinical presentation, and the neuroanatomical structures involved in memory formation. It requires differentiating TGA from other neurological conditions based on the patient's symptoms and the transient nature of the deficit.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key features of the patient's presentation that are characteristic of TGA, specifically the sudden onset of anterograde amnesia and repetitive questioning, with spontaneous resolution. Then, recall the brain structures primarily responsible for memory formation and select the one whose transient dysfunction would explain these symptoms.",
