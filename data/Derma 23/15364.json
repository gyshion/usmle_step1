    "en": "This patient has cutaneous warts (verruca vulgaris), presenting as painless, skin-colored papules with a dry, whitish surface. Warts may be single or multiple and can also form irregular plaques or complex filiform structures. The diagnosis of cutaneous warts is usually made on inspection, although a magnified view (ie, dermatoscopy) can be helpful and typically reveals small black dots representing thrombosed capillaries.\n\nCutaneous warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), which is also the cause of plantar warts and anogenital warts (ie, condyloma acuminata). Infection is most prevalent in children, adolescents, and young adults and is usually acquired through direct contact. Immunosuppressed patients (eg, HIV infection) are at increased risk and often develop numerous, large lesions.\n\nAlthough the HPV family is associated with an increased risk for mucosal squamous cell carcinoma (eg, cervical cancer), this is primarily related to high-risk HPV types (eg, 16, 18); most cutaneous warts are due to low-risk types (eg, 2, 4), and malignant transformation is rare.\n\n(Choice A) Coxsackievirus is the most common etiologic agent in hand-foot-and-mouth disease, which is characterized by low-grade fever and vesicles/ulcers on the oral mucosa and skin (especially hands and feet). Chronic papules are more consistent with cutaneous warts.\n\n(Choice B) Herpes simplex virus causes herpetic whitlow, which presents acutely with a prodrome of burning/tingling followed by single or multiple vesicles on an erythematous base.\n\n(Choice D) Disseminated gonococcal infection causes a pustular or bullous rash, which commonly involves both the extremities and torso. It is typically associated with tenosynovitis and migratory polyarthralgia.\n\n(Choice E) Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a pox virus. Although it commonly presents as small papules, the lesions are smooth, pearly, and umbilicated, unlike the rough, dry lesions in this patient.\n\n(Choice F) Condyloma lata is a manifestation of secondary syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum. Although it may present as verruciform lesions, it is often associated with fever and lymphadenopathy and is most common on the oral mucosa or genital area near the site of primary infection.\n\nEducational objective:\nCutaneous warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and typically present as skin-colored papules with a dry, whitish surface. HPV is usually transmitted by direct contact. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}} {{exhibit_10}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有皮肤疣（寻常疣），表现为无痛、肤色丘疹，表面干燥、发白。疣可以是单个或多个，也可以形成不规则的斑块或复杂的丝状结构。皮肤疣的诊断通常通过检查做出，尽管放大观察（即，皮肤镜检查）可能有所帮助，并且通常显示代表血栓形成的毛细血管的小黑点。\n\n皮肤疣由人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）引起，这也是跖疣和肛门生殖器疣（即尖锐湿疣）的原因。感染在儿童、青少年和年轻人中最常见，通常通过直接接触获得。免疫抑制患者（例如，HIV感染）的风险增加，并且经常出现多个大病变。\n\n尽管HPV家族与黏膜鳞状细胞癌（例如，宫颈癌）的风险增加相关，但这主要与高危HPV类型（例如，16、18）有关；大多数皮肤疣是由低危类型（例如，2、4）引起的，恶性转化很少见。\n\n(选项A) 柯萨奇病毒是手足口病最常见的病原体，其特征是低热和口腔黏膜和皮肤（特别是手和脚）上的水疱/溃疡。慢性丘疹更符合皮肤疣。\n\n(选项B) 单纯疱疹病毒引起疱疹性瘭疽，其表现为急性期先驱症状，如烧灼/刺痛感，随后在红斑基础上出现单个或多个水疱。\n\n(选项D) 播散性淋病奈瑟菌感染引起脓疱或大疱性皮疹，通常涉及四肢和躯干。它通常与腱鞘炎和游走性多关节痛相关。\n\n(选项E) 传染性软疣由痘病毒引起。虽然它通常表现为小丘疹，但病变光滑、珍珠样且脐凹，与该患者的粗糙、干燥病变不同。\n\n(选项F) 扁平湿疣是二期梅毒的表现，由梅毒螺旋体引起。虽然它可能表现为疣状病变，但通常与发热和淋巴结病相关，并且最常见于口腔黏膜或原发感染部位附近的生殖器区域。\n\n教育目标：\n皮肤疣由人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）引起，通常表现为肤色丘疹，表面干燥、发白。HPV通常通过直接接触传播。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}} {{exhibit_10}}"

It requires recognizing the characteristic skin lesions and associating them with the causative agent, human papillomavirus (HPV).\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the description of the skin lesions (painless, skin-colored papules) and the patient's age.
