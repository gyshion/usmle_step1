    "en": "A 68-year-old woman comes to the office to discuss lipid-lowering therapy. She was prescribed rosuvastatin 6 months ago following a transient ischemic attack, but her pharmacy sent a notice to the physician a week ago that she has not filled her prescription for the past 3 months. The patient otherwise feels well and has had no recurrent neurologic symptoms. When asked why she is not taking her medication, she says, \"I feel great without it. The ministroke was the scariest thing that ever happened to me, and now that I have put it behind me, I don't want the medication to remind me about my problem all over again.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient's statement?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The psychological impact of serious illness and injury, including initial fear and residual stigma or shame, frequently affects patients' self-image and subsequent personal health decisions. This patient's statement indicates that she negatively associates her statin medication (eg, rosuvastatin, used for secondary prevention of recurrent cerebrovascular events) with memories of her initial transient ischemic attack (TIA), leading her to be nonadherent to therapy.\n\nImproving adherence in this patient should begin with an empathetic appreciation of her TIA and its effect on her emotional well-being. The physician should show respect for her feelings and experiences, avoid judgmental or critical statements, and encourage development of new, positive associations (eg, linking the medication to lower cholesterol and improved future health). If the patient comes to associate the statin with improved health, she may be more likely to adhere to therapy.\n\n(Choice B) This statement superficially acknowledges patient autonomy but primarily puts the attention and responsibility on the physician and does little to explore the patient's motivations and priorities. It is unlikely to influence the patient's medication adherence.\n\n(Choice C) Although this patient is avoiding thinking about her TIA, this is primarily due to negative associations rather than denial of the seriousness of the illness or likelihood of recurrence. Discussing whether she believes another event is likely would be less productive than encouraging new, positive associations.\n\n(Choice D) This statement attempts to universalize the patient's concern and could be helpful for someone who is resistant to therapy due to embarrassment or shame. However, it does not promote positive associations with the treatment and is therefore less likely to improve adherence in this patient.\n\n(Choice E) Focusing on adverse outcomes and complications of nonadherence is likely to reinforce this patient's negative associations of treatment and may make her more resistant to treatment.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe psychological impact of serious illness frequently affects patients' self-image and personal health decisions, including medication adherence. Encouraging patients to develop positive associations (eg, linking treatment with improved health), rather than negative associations (eg, linking treatment with memories of disease), can improve adherence to therapy.",
    "zh": "严重疾病和损伤的心理影响，包括最初的恐惧以及残留的耻辱感，经常影响患者的自我形象和随后的个人健康决策。这位患者的陈述表明，她将他汀类药物（例如，瑞舒伐他汀，用于二级预防复发性脑血管事件）与她最初的短暂性脑缺血发作（TIA）的记忆负面联系起来，导致她不遵守治疗方案。\n\n改善这位患者的依从性应该从同情地理解她的TIA及其对她情绪健康的影响开始。医生应该尊重她的感受和经历，避免带有评判或批评的言论，并鼓励建立新的、积极的联系（例如，将药物与降低胆固醇和改善未来的健康联系起来）。如果患者开始将他汀类药物与改善的健康联系起来，她可能更有可能坚持治疗。\n\n（选项 B）该陈述表面上承认了患者的自主权，但主要将注意力集中在医生身上，并没有过多地探讨患者的动机和优先事项。它不太可能影响患者的用药依从性。\n\n（选项 C）虽然这位患者正在避免思考她的 TIA，但这主要是由于负面联系，而不是否认疾病的严重性或复发的可能性。讨论她是否认为可能发生另一次事件，不如鼓励新的、积极的联系更有效。\n\n（选项 D）该陈述试图普遍化患者的担忧，对于因尴尬或羞耻而抵制治疗的人来说可能有所帮助。然而，它并没有促进与治疗的积极联系，因此不太可能改善这位患者的依从性。\n\n（选项 E）关注不依从治疗的不良后果和并发症，可能会强化这位患者对治疗的负面联想，并可能使她更抗拒治疗。\n\n教育目标：\n严重疾病的心理影响经常影响患者的自我形象和个人健康决策，包括用药依从性。鼓励患者建立积极的联系（例如，将治疗与改善健康联系起来），而不是消极的联系（例如，将治疗与疾病的记忆联系起来），可以提高对治疗的依从性。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to address patient concerns and improve medication adherence by understanding the psychological impact of a serious illness, specifically a transient ischemic attack (TIA), and its influence on the patient's perception of medication. The key is to respond with empathy and encourage positive associations with the medication, rather than focusing on negative aspects or complications.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the patient's underlying concerns and emotional state related to their past medical event and medication. Choose the response that acknowledges their feelings and attempts to reframe the medication in a positive light, promoting adherence and a better understanding of its benefits.",
