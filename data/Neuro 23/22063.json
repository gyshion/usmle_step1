    "en": "This patient has a homogeneously enhancing, extraaxial tumor at the cerebellopontine angle, leading to compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) resulting in unilateral, progressive hearing loss. Pathologically, this may be a vestibular schwannoma or a meningioma. Although imaging findings can help differentiate between the two (eg, extension into internal auditory canal [schwannoma], dural enhancement [meningioma]), histologic analysis is often required for definitive diagnosis.\n\nMeningiomas are considered benign primary brain tumors arising from meningothelial cells and are more commonly found in middle-aged to elderly women. They can cause significant neurologic symptoms if they become large enough to compress neurovascular structures. Classically, meningiomas at the cerebellopontine angle cause progressive sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and imbalance or disequilibrium. With continued growth, they can cause facial weakness (facial nerve [CN VII]) and facial numbness (trigeminal nerve [CN V]). Treatment is typically surgical resection. Histology shows cells arranged in lobules or whorls, often with psammoma bodies.\n\n(Choice A) Arteriovenous malformations are congenital lesions that frequently present with headaches and seizures in children and young adults. On MRI, they often appears as hypointense lesions (due to flow voids) with a honeycomb appearance.\n\n(Choice B) Astrocytomas are pediatric CNS tumors that originate from astrocytes (the dominant glial cell in the brain). Because of this, they develop in the brain parenchyma rather than an extraaxial location.\n\n(Choice C) Ependymomas arise from the ependymal lining of the ventricles, often from the roof of the fourth ventricle in children or the intramedullary space of the spinal cord in adults. They would not be located in the cerebellopontine angle. In addition, intracranial ependymomas typically present with progressive headaches and signs of increased intracranial pressure due to obstructive hydrocephalus.\n\n(Choice D) Medulloblastomas typically present in children (most commonly age 5-9) with vomiting, headache, and cerebellar dysfunction. They are typically located along the cerebellar midline (rather than the cerebellopontine angle) and may compresses the fourth ventricle, causing obstructive hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure.\n\nEducational objective:\nTumors at the cerebellopontine angle can cause unilateral progressive hearing loss due to compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII). These tumors are most likely vestibular schwannomas or meningiomas; histologic analysis is often required to differentiate between them.",
    "zh": "该患者在脑桥小脑角有一个均匀强化的、颅外肿瘤，导致前庭蜗神经（CN VIII）受压，引起单侧进行性听力下降。病理上，这可能是前庭神经鞘瘤或脑膜瘤。虽然影像学检查结果可以帮助区分两者（例如，延伸到内听道[神经鞘瘤]，硬脑膜强化[脑膜瘤]），但通常需要组织学分析才能做出明确诊断。\n\n脑膜瘤被认为是源自脑膜内皮细胞的良性原发性脑肿瘤，更常见于中年至老年女性。如果它们大到足以压迫神经血管结构，则可引起明显的神经系统症状。典型情况下，脑桥小脑角的脑膜瘤会导致进行性感觉神经性听力损失、耳鸣以及平衡失调或不平衡。随着持续生长，它们会引起面部无力（面神经[CN VII]）和面部麻木（三叉神经[CN V]）。治疗通常是手术切除。组织学显示细胞排列成小叶或漩涡状，常伴有砂粒体。\n\n（选项A）动静脉畸形是先天性病变，常表现为儿童和年轻人的头痛和癫痫发作。在MRI上，它们通常表现为低信号病灶（由于流空）并呈蜂窝状外观。\n\n（选项B）星形细胞瘤是源自星形胶质细胞（大脑中占主导地位的神经胶质细胞）的儿科CNS肿瘤。因此，它们发生在大脑实质而不是颅外位置。\n\n（选项C）室管膜瘤起源于脑室的室管膜内衬，通常位于儿童的第四脑室顶部或成人的脊髓髓内空间。它们不会位于脑桥小脑角。此外，颅内室管膜瘤通常表现为进行性头痛和颅内压增高的征象，这与梗阻性脑积水有关。\n\n（选项D）髓母细胞瘤通常见于儿童（最常见于5-9岁），表现为呕吐、头痛和小脑功能障碍。它们通常位于小脑正中线（而不是脑桥小脑角），并且可能压迫第四脑室，导致梗阻性脑积水和颅内压增高。\n\n教育目标：\n脑桥小脑角的肿瘤可因前庭蜗神经（CN VIII）受压而引起单侧进行性听力下降。这些肿瘤最有可能的是前庭神经鞘瘤或脑膜瘤；通常需要组织学分析来区分它们。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cerebellopontine angle tumors, specifically meningiomas, and their clinical presentation with unilateral hearing loss. It also requires differentiating meningiomas from other potential tumors in that location based on age, location, and imaging characteristics.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's age and unilateral hearing loss as suggestive of a cerebellopontine angle tumor. Then, consider the imaging findings of an extra-axial, homogeneously enhancing mass. Finally, rule out other tumor types based on their typical age of presentation and location.",
