    "en": "A 54-year-old man comes to the office due to 2 days of redness and pain in his right arm. He was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis involving the left lower and upper extremities. His symptoms then subsided within days of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy only. The patient has no other past medical history. He has some abdominal discomfort that he attributes to gastroesophageal reflux disease. Temperature is 37.6 C (99.7 F). On examination, there is erythema and tenderness extending linearly from the right forearm to just anterior to the right antecubital fossa. No fluid collection is palpable. Complete blood count shows mild leukocytosis.",

    "en": "Migratory thrombophlebitis should raise suspicion for cancer. Hypercoagulability is a very common paraneoplastic syndrome seen most frequently in visceral adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, colon, and lung. Hypercoagulability develops because adenocarcinomas produce a thromboplastin-like substance capable of causing chronic intravascular coagulations that can disseminate and tend to migrate.\n\nMigratory superficial thrombophlebitis, known as Trousseau syndrome, is named after Armand Trousseau, a well-respected French physician who first described the association with cancer. Trousseau later diagnosed his own visceral cancer after developing the syndrome.\n\nTrousseau also described the Trousseau sign (hand/forearm muscle spasms on sphygmomanometric measurement) associated with hypocalcemia.\n\n(Choice A) Celiac sprue has been associated with a hemorrhagic diathesis (rather than abnormal thrombosis). The malabsorption resulting from celiac sprue can result in vitamin K deficiency.\n\n(Choices B and D) Polycystic kidney disease is not among the conditions commonly associated with an acquired prothrombotic state. Disseminated chlamydia infections are classically associated with reactive arthritis (not thrombophlebitis), and infections in general can create a systemic inflammatory state that favors thrombosis. However, malignancy would be a more likely explanation for migratory superficial thrombophlebitis accompanied by vague abdominal pain.\n\n(Choice C) Hyperthyroidism has been associated with a hypercoagulable state and is occasionally reported in cases of cerebral venous thrombosis, but there is no evidence of a significant association with venous thrombotic events.\n\nEducational objective:\nA paraneoplastic syndrome of hypercoagulability may be seen in some patients with cancer, especially adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, colon, or lung. Superficial venous thromboses may therefore appear in one site and then resolve, only to recur in another site. This is known as Trousseau syndrome (migratory superficial thrombophlebitis), an indication of visceral cancer.",
    "zh": "游走性血栓性静脉炎应引起对癌症的怀疑。高凝状态是一种非常常见的副肿瘤综合征，最常见于胰腺、结肠和肺的内脏腺癌。高凝状态的发展是因为腺癌产生类似血栓生成素的物质，能够引起慢性的血管内凝血，这些凝血可以播散并倾向于游走。\n\n游走性浅表性血栓性静脉炎，即特鲁索综合征，以Armand Trousseau的名字命名，他是一位备受尊敬的法国医生，他首次描述了与癌症的关联。特鲁索后来在患上该综合征后诊断出自己的内脏癌。\n\n特鲁索还描述了与低钙血症相关的特鲁索征象（用血压计测量时手/前臂肌肉痉挛）。\n\n（选项 A）乳糜泻与出血倾向相关（而不是异常血栓形成）。乳糜泻导致的吸收不良可导致维生素K缺乏。\n\n（选项 B 和 D）多囊肾病不是通常与获得性促血栓形成状态相关的疾病。播散性衣原体感染通常与反应性关节炎相关（不是血栓性静脉炎），并且一般感染可以产生有利于血栓形成的全身炎症状态。然而，恶性肿瘤是伴有模糊腹痛的游走性浅表性血栓性静脉炎更有可能的解释。\n\n（选项 C）甲状腺功能亢进与高凝状态有关，偶尔见于脑静脉血栓形成的病例中，但没有证据表明其与静脉血栓形成事件有显著关联。\n\n教育目标：\n在某些癌症患者中，特别是胰腺、结肠或肺的腺癌患者中，可能会出现高凝状态的副肿瘤综合征。因此，浅表静脉血栓形成可能出现在一个部位，然后消退，然后在另一个部位复发。这被称为特鲁索综合征（游走性浅表性血栓性静脉炎），是内脏癌的征兆。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Trousseau's syndrome, a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with visceral malignancies, particularly adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, colon, and lung. It presents as migratory thrombophlebitis due to hypercoagulability caused by tumor-produced thromboplastin-like substances.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the significance of migratory thrombophlebitis and its association with underlying malignancy.
