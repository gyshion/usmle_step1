    "en": "This patient's fever, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and elevated transaminases likely represent ALCOHOLIC HEPATITIS. Heavy ethanol consumption causes oxidative damage in the liver, which triggers the release of neutrophil chemotactic factors (eg, IL-8, leukotriene B4), leading to marked INTRAHEPATIC NEUTROPHIL INFILTRATION. Other histologic findings include hepatocellular ballooning, Mallory bodies, and steatosis. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nLaboratory testing in alcoholic hepatitis typically demonstrates elevated aminotransferases (eg, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) with an AST/ALT ratio >2:1. The disproportionate elevation of AST relative to ALT is caused by deficiencies in pyridoxal phosphate (ALT is more sensitive to vitamin B6 deficiency than AST) and ethanol-induced mitochondrial damage (in hepatocytes, large amounts of AST are found in the mitochondria whereas ALT is present only in the cytosol).\n\nAdditional laboratory findings in alcoholic hepatitis include direct hyperbilirubinemia. PT and PTT are often prolonged due to impaired hepatic production of coagulation factors.\n\n(Choice A) Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic inflammatory bile duct disorder. Histopathology shows inflammation and destruction of interlobular bile ducts with occasional granulomatous lesions. This cholestatic disorder causes not only hyperbilirubinemia, but also elevated alkaline phosphatase, which is not present in this patient. Furthermore, PBC does not cause an AST/ALT ratio >2:1.\n\n(Choices B and D) Chronic hepatitis B and C infections can stimulate an immune response against infected hepatocytes characterized by portal tract-predominant lymphocytic infiltration. Ground-glass hepatocytes may also be seen in chronic hepatitis B, representing an intracytoplasmic accumulation of hepatitis B surface antigen. Although chronic viral hepatitis may cause direct hyperbilirubinemia and aminotransferase elevations, ALT is generally higher than AST and an AST/ALT ratio >2:1 is rare. {{exhibit_3}}\n\nEducational objective:\nAlcoholic hepatitis presents with fever, right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice. Typical laboratory findings include elevated aminotransferases with an AST/ALT ratio >2:1. Histopathology is characterized by marked intrahepatic neutrophil infiltration, hepatocellular ballooning, Mallory bodies, and steatosis. {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "该患者的发热、右上腹疼痛、黄疸和转氨酶升高可能代表酒精性肝炎。大量乙醇摄入会导致肝脏氧化损伤，从而触发中性粒细胞趋化因子（例如，IL-8、白三烯B4）的释放，导致明显的肝内中性粒细胞浸润。其他组织学发现包括肝细胞气球样变性、马洛里小体和脂肪变性。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n酒精性肝炎的实验室检查通常显示转氨酶升高（例如，天冬氨酸转氨酶 [AST]，丙氨酸转氨酶 [ALT]），AST/ALT比值>2:1。AST相对于ALT不成比例升高的原因是吡哆醛磷酸盐缺乏（ALT对维生素B6缺乏症比AST更敏感）和乙醇引起的线粒体损伤（在肝细胞中，大量AST存在于线粒体中，而ALT仅存在于细胞质中）。\n\n酒精性肝炎的其他实验室发现包括直接胆红素血症。由于肝脏凝血因子生成受损，PT和PTT通常会延长。\n\n（选项 A）原发性胆汁性胆管炎 (PBC) 是一种慢性炎症性胆管疾病。组织病理学显示小叶间胆管的炎症和破坏，伴有偶发的肉芽肿性病变。这种胆汁淤积性疾病不仅会导致高胆红素血症，还会导致碱性磷酸酶升高，而该患者没有这种情况。此外，PBC不会导致AST/ALT比值>2:1。\n\n（选项 B 和 D）慢性乙型和丙型肝炎感染可刺激针对被感染肝细胞的免疫反应，其特征是门管区为主的淋巴细胞浸润。慢性乙型肝炎也可见毛玻璃样肝细胞，代表细胞质内乙型肝炎表面抗原的积聚。尽管慢性病毒性肝炎可能导致直接胆红素血症和转氨酶升高，但ALT通常高于AST，AST/ALT比值>2:1的情况很少见。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n教育目标：\n酒精性肝炎表现为发热、右上腹疼痛和黄疸。典型的实验室检查结果包括转氨酶升高，AST/ALT比值>2:1。组织病理学特征是明显的肝内中性粒细胞浸润、肝细胞气球样变性、马洛里小体和脂肪变性。{{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of alcoholic hepatitis, including its clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and characteristic histopathology. It requires differentiating alcoholic hepatitis from other liver diseases based on clinical and laboratory data.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's history of heavy alcohol use, symptoms of liver dysfunction (jaundice, RUQ pain), and lab findings (elevated AST/ALT with AST>ALT) as suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis. Recall that the classic histologic finding is intrahepatic neutrophil infiltration.",
