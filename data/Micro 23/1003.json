    "en": "A 22-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to intermittent fevers and chills over the past few days. Last week, she underwent routine dental cleaning with no complications. The patient has a history of mitral valve prolapse. Temperature is 38.2 C (100.8 F). Physical examination reveals a non-ejection mid-systolic click followed by a late-systolic murmur best heard at the cardiac apex. Blood cultures are drawn and grow gram-positive bacteria that synthesize dextrans from sucrose.",

  "correct_answer": "C",

    "en": "This patient with mitral valve prolapse (as suggested by the auscultated systolic click and murmur) now has bacteremia following dental cleaning. Viridans streptococci are normal inhabitants of the oral cavity and cause transient bacteremia after dental procedures. These gram-positive organisms are capable of producing extracellular polysaccharides (dextrans) using sucrose as a substrate.\nDextrans facilitate streptococcal adherence to fibrin. Fibrin and platelets are deposited at sites of endothelial trauma, providing a site for bacterial adherence and colonization during bacteremia. In patients with pre-existing valvular lesions, viridans streptococci can adhere to the affected valve and establish infection leading to endocarditis. Other factors that facilitate pathogenesis may also be involved. Staphylococcus aureus is more aggressive and can adhere to intact valves. The risk of endocarditis following dental procedures is low with mitral valve prolapse, and antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended; however, cases can still occur.\n(Choice A) Circulating heparins prolong the partial thromboplastin time by activating antithrombin III, thereby decreasing thrombin activity and ultimately preventing fibrinogen conversion to fibrin, thereby preventing clot formation. Circulating heparins would not provide a binding site for bacteria.\n(Choice B) Endothelial surface glycoproteins mediate binding of immune cells to endothelium, facilitated by the expression of cell adhesion molecules on the surface of inflamed endothelium. Neutrophils are then able to bind and migrate between the endothelial cells, followed by monocytes and lymphocytes.\n(Choices D and E) Subendothelial collagen and glycosaminoglycans form the subendothelial fibrous cap over the central core of an atherosclerotic plaque and are potent platelet activators. When exposed (eg, denuded endothelium in atherosclerotic plaque), they contribute to rapid thrombus formation that can lead to myocardial infarction in a coronary artery.\nEducational objective:\nViridans streptococci are normal inhabitants of the oral cavity and are a cause of transient bacteremia after dental procedures in healthy and diseased individuals. In patients with pre-existing valvular lesions, viridans streptococci can adhere to fibrin-platelet aggregates and establish infection that leads to endocarditis.",
    "zh": "该患者患有二尖瓣脱垂（如听诊到的收缩期喀喇音和杂音所示），现在在牙科清洁后出现菌血症。草绿色链球菌是口腔的正常居民，在牙科手术后引起短暂的菌血症。这些革兰氏阳性菌能够利用蔗糖作为底物产生细胞外多糖（葡聚糖）。\n葡聚糖促进链球菌粘附于纤维蛋白。纤维蛋白和血小板沉积在内皮损伤部位，为菌血症期间细菌粘附和定植提供了场所。在患有既往瓣膜病变的患者中，草绿色链球菌可以粘附于受影响的瓣膜并建立感染，导致心内膜炎。也可能涉及促进发病机制的其他因素。金黄色葡萄球菌更具侵袭性，可以粘附于完整的瓣膜。二尖瓣脱垂术后发生心内膜炎的风险较低，不建议进行抗生素预防；然而，仍然可能发生病例。\n（选项A）循环肝素通过激活抗凝血酶III延长部分凝血活酶时间，从而降低凝血酶活性，最终阻止纤维蛋白原转化为纤维蛋白，从而防止血栓形成。循环肝素不会为细菌提供结合位点。\n（选项B）内皮表面糖蛋白介导免疫细胞与内皮的结合，这由炎症内皮表面的细胞粘附分子的表达促进。随后，中性粒细胞能够结合并在内皮细胞之间迁移，然后是单核细胞和淋巴细胞。\n（选项D和E）内皮下胶原和糖胺聚糖形成动脉粥样硬化斑块中心核心上的内皮下纤维帽，是有效的血小板活化剂。当暴露时（例如，动脉粥样硬化斑块中的脱落内皮），它们有助于快速血栓形成，这可能导致冠状动脉心肌梗死。\n教育目标：\n草绿色链球菌是口腔的正常居民，是健康和患病个体在牙科手术后发生短暂菌血症的原因。在患有既往瓣膜病变的患者中，草绿色链球菌可以粘附于纤维蛋白-血小板聚集体并建立感染，导致心内膜炎。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathogenesis of endocarditis, specifically the role of viridans streptococci and dextran production in adherence to damaged heart valves. It also tests understanding of the risk factors for endocarditis and the mechanisms of action of various medications.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the patient's history of mitral valve prolapse and recent dental cleaning, which increases the risk of transient bacteremia with viridans streptococci. Understanding that these bacteria produce dextrans, which facilitate adherence to fibrin-platelet aggregates, leads to the correct answer.",
