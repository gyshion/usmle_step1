    "en": "This patient most likely has a form of **GALACTOSEMIA**, a condition that results from deficiency of enzymes involved in galactose metabolism. Her late presentation, normal growth, and the isolated presence of cataracts are particularly suggestive of **GALACTOKINASE (GALK) DEFICIENCY**.\n\nAfter lactose is broken down to galactose and glucose, galactose is normally phosphorylated to galactose-1-phosphate by GALK. Deficiency causes galactose buildup, and this excess is converted to **GALACTITOL**, an osmotic agent that causes **CATARACTS**. Excess galactose also spills into the urine and causes it to test positive for a reducing substance.\n\nSerious systemic manifestations are typically **NOT SEEN** in GALK deficiency, and cataracts are frequently the only manifestation (some developmental milestones [e.g., social smile] may be impacted if they occur early in life). In contrast, galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (**GALT**) deficiency results in a more serious form of galactosemia. This is related to the accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate, a toxic metabolite that causes hepatic and renal dysfunction; patients with GALT deficiency present early, in the neonatal period, with vomiting, lethargy, and failure to thrive.\n\n**(Choice A) Aldolase B deficiency** (hereditary fructose intolerance) is characterized by an inability to metabolize fructose, leading to hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, and failure to thrive when fructose is ingested. While reducing substances can be positive in the urine, cataracts are not a feature of this condition. Thus, this choice is incorrect.\n\n**(Choice B) Alpha-galactosidase A deficiency** (an X-linked recessive disorder) causes Fabry disease. Patients with Fabry disease can present with cataracts (verticillata or spoke-like opacities) but also exhibit characteristic neurological findings (e.g., numbness, tingling, burning pain in the hands and feet due to peripheral neuropathy) and angiokeratomas. The patient's presentation lacks these neurological and dermatological findings, making this an unlikely diagnosis.\n\n**(Choice C) Fructokinase deficiency** leads to essential fructosuria, a benign condition where fructose accumulates in the urine. This condition can result in a positive test for reducing substances in the urine, but it does not cause cataracts or other significant clinical symptoms, making it an incorrect answer for a patient with blurry vision due to lens opacities.\n\n**(Choice E) Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency** is the cause of glycogen storage disease type 1 (von Gierke disease). This enzyme is crucial for converting glucose-6-phosphate to glucose. Its deficiency leads to severe hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hepatomegaly, and hypertriglyceridemia. Cataracts are not a typical manifestation of von Gierke disease.\n\n**(Choice F) Hexosaminidase A deficiency** causes Tay-Sachs disease, a lysosomal storage disorder. Affected infants typically present with progressive neurodegeneration, developmental regression, and a characteristic retinal cherry-red spot. Cataracts are not a feature of Tay-Sachs disease.\n\n**(Choice G) Sphingomyelinase deficiency** is responsible for Niemann-Pick disease. This lysosomal storage disorder leads to the accumulation of sphingomyelin. Clinical features include hepatosplenomegaly, motor neuropathy, anemia, and macular cherry-red spots, but not cataracts. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Educational objective:** Lenticular accumulation of **GALACTITOL** in the lenses of patients with galactosemia can cause osmotic damage and development of **CATARACTS**. Cataracts are frequently the only manifestation of **GALACTOKINASE DEFICIENCY**.",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有**半乳糖血症**，这是一种由参与半乳糖代谢的酶缺乏引起的疾病。她迟发病、生长正常以及孤立存在的白内障，尤其提示**半乳糖激酶 (GALK) 缺乏症**。\n\n乳糖分解成半乳糖和葡萄糖后，半乳糖通常被 GALK 磷酸化成半乳糖-1-磷酸。缺乏会导致半乳糖堆积，而这种过量的半乳糖会转化为**半乳糖醇**，这是一种导致**白内障**的渗透剂。过量的半乳糖也会溢出到尿液中，并导致尿液对还原性物质呈阳性反应。\n\nGALK 缺乏症通常**未见**严重的全身表现，而白内障往往是唯一的表现（如果发生在生命的早期，一些发育里程碑[例如，社会性微笑]可能会受到影响）。相比之下，半乳糖-1-磷酸尿苷转移酶 (**GALT**) 缺乏症会导致更严重的半乳糖血症。这与半乳糖-1-磷酸的积累有关，半乳糖-1-磷酸是一种有毒代谢物，可导致肝肾功能障碍；GALT 缺乏症的患者通常在新生儿期出现，表现为呕吐、嗜睡和生长迟缓。\n\n**(选项 A) 醛缩酶 B 缺乏症**（遗传性果糖不耐受症）的特征是无法代谢果糖，导致低血糖、低磷血症，以及摄入果糖后生长迟缓。虽然尿液中的还原性物质可能呈阳性，但白内障并非该病的特征。因此，此选项不正确。\n\n**(选项 B) α-半乳糖苷酶 A 缺乏症**（X 连锁隐性遗传病）会导致 Fabry 病。Fabry 病患者可出现白内障（轮状或辐条状混浊），但也表现出特征性的神经系统表现（例如，由于周围神经病变导致手脚麻木、刺痛、灼痛）和血管角化瘤。患者的临床表现缺乏这些神经系统和皮肤病学发现，因此这不太可能是诊断。\n\n**(选项 C) 果糖激酶缺乏症**导致原发性果糖尿，这是一种良性病症，果糖会在尿液中积累。这种情况可能导致尿液中还原性物质呈阳性，但不会引起白内障或其他明显的临床症状，因此对于因晶状体混浊而视力模糊的患者来说，这是一个不正确的答案。\n\n**(选项 E) 葡萄糖-6-磷酸酶缺乏症**是 1 型糖原累积病（von Gierke 病）的原因。这种酶对于将葡萄糖-6-磷酸转化为葡萄糖至关重要。其缺乏会导致严重的低血糖、乳酸酸中毒、肝肿大和高甘油三酯血症。白内障不是 von Gierke 病的典型表现。\n\n**(选项 F) 己糖胺酶 A 缺乏症**会导致 Tay-Sachs 病，这是一种溶酶体贮积症。受影响的婴儿通常表现为进行性神经变性、发育倒退和特征性的视网膜樱桃红斑。白内障不是 Tay-Sachs 病的特征。\n\n**(选项 G) 鞘磷脂酶缺乏症**是 Niemann-Pick 病的原因。这种溶酶体贮积症导致鞘磷脂的积累。临床特征包括肝脾肿大、运动神经病、贫血和黄斑樱桃红斑，但没有白内障。因此，此选项不正确。\n\n**教育目标：** 半乳糖血症患者晶状体内**半乳糖醇**的积聚可引起渗透性损伤和**白内障**的发展。白内障通常是**半乳糖激酶缺乏症**的唯一表现。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of inborn errors of metabolism, specifically differentiating between various enzyme deficiencies based on their clinical presentation, focusing on the presence of cataracts and positive urine reducing substances. It assesses the ability to identify galactokinase deficiency as a cause of isolated cataracts in the setting of positive urine reducing substances, contrasting it with more severe forms of galactosemia and other lysosomal storage disorders.\n\nThe main approach to solving this question involves recognizing the key clinical findings: blurry vision due to bilateral lens opacities (cataracts) and urine positive for reducing substances, in an 11-year-old girl without systemic symptoms or developmental delays. This specific constellation of symptoms strongly points to galactokinase deficiency due to galactitol accumulation, allowing for the exclusion of other metabolic disorders that present with more severe systemic involvement or different ocular findings.",
