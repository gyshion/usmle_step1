  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's stroke has resulted in vertigo and bulbar weakness (eg, difficulty swallowing), in addition to loss of pain and temperature sensation on the left side of the face and right side of the body. Because most cranial nerves (other than CN II & IV) do not decussate while most of the body's motor and sensory fibers cross the midline in the medulla, brainstem strokes characteristically lead to ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits and contralateral deficits of the body (ie, crossed signs). Therefore, this patient's stroke likely impacted the left brainstem. Specifically, this patient has the following:\n\n*   Vertigo without hearing loss, suggesting a lesion impacting the vestibular nucleus rather than the peripheral CN VIII (which would likely result in hearing loss as well).\n*   Loss of pain and temperature sensation on the left (ipsilateral) side of the face with neuropathic pain in that area, suggesting involvement of the spinal trigeminal nucleus.\n*   Loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right (contralateral) side of the body, which suggests dysfunction of the spinothalamic tract.\n\nThese areas are all located in the left lateral medulla. This constellation of symptoms is consistent with LATERAL MEDULLARY (WALLENBERG) SYNDROME. Horner syndrome is also common due to damage of the descending sympathetic nervous system fibers that travel very close to the spinothalamic tract.\n\n(Choices B and E) Ischemia impacting the medial medulla can damage the pyramidal tract (contralateral hemiparesis), medial lemniscus (contralateral loss of tactile, vibratory & position sense), and hypoglossal nucleus, which causes tongue deviation toward the lesion due to ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) palsy. The strong side \"pushes\" the tongue toward the weak side when it is protruded.\n\n(Choices C and F) Strokes in the midbrain can damage the red nucleus (ataxia), cerebral peduncle (contralateral hemiparesis), and, often, oculomotor nerve fascicles (ipsilateral CN III palsy).\n\n(Choice D) A lesion in the right lateral medulla would cause decreased pain and temperature in the right side of the face (ipsilateral) and left side of the body (contralateral).\n\nEducational objective:\nA lateral medullary infarct (Wallenberg syndrome) leads to vertigo (vestibular nucleus), loss of pain/temperature sensation on the ipsilateral face (trigeminal nucleus) and contralateral body (spinothalamic tract), bulbar weakness (lower cranial nerves), and ipsilateral Horner syndrome (descending sympathetic nervous system fibers).",
    "zh": "该患者的中风导致了眩晕和延髓无力（例如，吞咽困难），此外，面部左侧和身体右侧的疼痛和温度感觉丧失。由于大多数脑神经（CN II 和 IV 除外）没有交叉，而身体的大部分运动和感觉纤维在延髓中穿过中线，脑干卒中通常会导致同侧脑神经功能缺损和身体对侧功能缺损（即交叉征）。因此，该患者的中风可能影响了左侧脑干。具体来说，该患者有以下情况：\n\n*   无听力损失的眩晕，提示病变影响前庭神经核，而不是周围的 CN VIII（这可能也会导致听力损失）。\n*   面部左侧（同侧）疼痛和温度感觉丧失，该区域出现神经性疼痛，提示脊髓三叉神经核受累。\n*   身体右侧（对侧）疼痛和温度感觉丧失，这表明脊髓丘脑束功能障碍。\n\n这些区域都位于左侧延髓外侧。这种症状组合与延髓外侧（Wallenberg）综合征一致。由于下降的交感神经系统纤维非常靠近脊髓丘脑束，因此 Horner 综合征也很常见。\n\n（选项 B 和 E）影响延髓内侧的缺血会损害锥体束（对侧偏瘫）、内侧丘系（对侧触觉、振动和位置觉丧失）和舌下神经核，这会导致舌头偏向病变侧，因为同侧舌下神经（CN XII）麻痹。当舌头伸出时，强大的一侧“推动”舌头朝向弱侧。\n\n（选项 C 和 F）中脑卒中会损伤红核（共济失调）、大脑脚（对侧偏瘫），并且通常会损伤动眼神经束（同侧 CN III 麻痹）。\n\n（选项 D）右侧延髓外侧病变会导致面部右侧（同侧）和身体左侧（对侧）的疼痛和温度感觉减退。\n\n教育目标：\n延髓外侧梗死（Wallenberg 综合征）导致眩晕（前庭神经核）、面部同侧（三叉神经核）和身体对侧（脊髓丘脑束）疼痛/温度感觉丧失、延髓无力（低位脑神经）和同侧 Horner 综合征（下降的交感神经系统纤维）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg syndrome) and the localization of neurological deficits based on crossed signs in the brainstem. It requires correlating specific symptoms such as vertigo, ipsilateral facial sensory loss, and contralateral body sensory loss with the anatomical structures affected in the lateral medulla.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the pattern of \"crossed signs\" (ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits and contralateral long tract deficits) and relate these to the specific neurological pathways that decussate at different levels of the brainstem. Recognizing the constellation of symptoms as characteristic of Wallenberg syndrome and pinpointing the affected structures in the lateral medulla is key to arriving at the correct answer.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试对延髓外侧综合征（Wallenberg 综合征）的理解，以及根据脑干的交叉征定位神经功能缺损。它需要将特定的症状（如眩晕、同侧面部感觉丧失和对侧身体感觉丧失）与延髓外侧受影响的解剖结构相关联。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须识别“交叉征”（同侧脑神经功能缺损和对侧长束功能缺损）的模式，并将这些与在脑干的不同水平交叉的特定神经通路联系起来。将症状组合识别为 Wallenberg 综合征的特征，并确定延髓外侧受影响的结构是得出正确答案的关键。"
