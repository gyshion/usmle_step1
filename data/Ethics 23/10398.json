    "en": "A 65-year-old woman comes to the office accompanied by her husband for follow-up of hypertension. She has been prescribed a thiazide diuretic, and her dose was increased at the last visit due to poorly controlled blood pressure. At today's visit, the patient's blood pressure remains elevated. Her husband says, \"I'm trying to do everything I can to get her blood pressure under control. I cook healthy food and remind her to take the medication, but I'm not sure she's taking it.\" The patient says, \"Taking the medication is a hassle; I know my pressure has been high but I feel absolutely fine.\" Which of the following responses by the physician is the most appropriate?",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Nonadherence to medication is a common cause of poor clinical outcomes. Sustaining medication adherence for chronic, asymptomatic medical conditions (ie, \"silent illnesses\"), such as hypertension, is particularly difficult. This patient is likely nonadherent with medication, but her specific concerns about taking the antihypertensive are unclear. There may be multiple reasons for nonadherence, including inadequate understanding of the illness and the role of medication, complicated regimens, medication cost, side effects, illness perceptions, treatment beliefs, and psychological factors (eg, depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, denial).\n\nThe best initial approach is to make the patient feel supported by normalizing her difficulty with adherence, followed by open-ended and nonjudgmental exploration of her reason(s) for nonadherence. Once an alliance is established and the specific factors are identified, the physician can more effectively intervene with a targeted intervention. Strategies to improve adherence include educating the patient; simplifying regimens; choosing generic (less costly) medications; addressing side effects and psychological issues; and increasing supervision, monitoring, and follow-up.\n\n(Choices A and D) It would be inappropriate to recommend a change in medication or addition of a second medication without first addressing her likely nonadherence. These interventions could be considered if her blood pressure remained poorly controlled despite medication adherence.\n\n(Choice B) Reviewing the patient's regimen and offering suggestions on how to improve adherence would be premature without first understanding the patient's perspective and exploring her specific concerns about taking her medication.\n\n(Choice E) If the patient seemed reluctant to discuss her medication usage with her husband in the room, the physician might suggest that they speak with her husband not present. There is no evidence to suggest that this is necessary at this time.\n\n(Choice F) Although assessing the patient's understanding of hypertension is important in providing targeted education, this statement aligns the physician with the husband rather than with the patient. She may feel attacked, which could put her on the defensive.\n\nEducational objective:\nIdentifying and managing nonadherence is critical to improving outcomes for many chronic conditions, including hypertension. Creating an alliance by validating the patient's perspective and using an open-ended, nonjudgmental question is the most effective way to initiate a discussion.",
    "zh": "不依从药物治疗是临床预后不良的常见原因。维持对慢性、无症状疾病（即“隐性疾病”），如高血压的药物依从性尤其困难。这位患者很可能没有依从药物治疗，但她对服用降压药的具体担忧尚不清楚。不依从的原因可能有多种，包括对疾病和药物作用的理解不足、复杂的治疗方案、药物费用、副作用、疾病认知、治疗信念和心理因素（如抑郁、焦虑、认知障碍、否认）。\n\n最好的初始方法是让患者感受到支持，通过使其服药困难正常化，然后开放式、非评判性地探索她不依从的原因。一旦建立了联盟并确定了具体因素，医生就可以通过有针对性的干预进行更有效的干预。改善依从性的策略包括对患者进行教育；简化治疗方案；选择仿制药（费用较低）；解决副作用和心理问题；以及加强监督、监测和随访。\n\n（选项 A 和 D）在没有首先解决她可能的不依从问题的情况下，建议更换药物或增加第二种药物是不合适的。如果她的血压在依从药物治疗后仍然控制不佳，可以考虑这些干预措施。\n\n（选项 B）在没有首先了解患者的观点并探讨她对服用药物的具体担忧的情况下，回顾患者的治疗方案并提供关于如何提高依从性的建议为时过早。\n\n（选项 E）如果患者似乎不愿在丈夫在场的情况下讨论她的用药情况，医生可能会建议他们与丈夫单独谈谈。目前没有证据表明这样做是必要的。\n\n（选项 F）虽然评估患者对高血压的理解对于提供有针对性的教育很重要，但这种说法使医生与丈夫而非患者站在了一起。她可能会感到被攻击，这可能会让她采取防御姿态。\n\n教育目标：\n识别和管理不依从性对于改善包括高血压在内的许多慢性疾病的预后至关重要。通过验证患者的观点并使用开放式、非评判性的问题来建立联盟是启动讨论的最有效方法。"
