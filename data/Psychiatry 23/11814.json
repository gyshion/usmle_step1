    "en": "An 8-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician for school refusal. He has not gone to school for a few days, saying that he has a stomach ache. However, when it comes time for soccer practice, he has no physical symptoms. When the pediatrician asks how things are going at school, the patient says, \"kids laughed at me when the teacher said she couldn't read my homework.\" His mother brings a report from the boy's teacher, which says that he is able to read and do math, but that when writing he fidgets a lot and stares out the window. His writing is unclear, disorganized, and below the level of his peers. His mother received a call from his teacher last week after the boy threw his writing book on the floor and began to cry. Vital signs and physical examination, including abdominal examination, are normal. At this time, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "zh": "一名8岁男孩因拒绝上学被带到儿科医生处就诊。他已经几天没去上学了，说他肚子疼。然而，当到了踢足球训练的时间时，他没有任何身体症状。当儿科医生询问他在学校的情况时，患者说：“当老师说她看不懂我的家庭作业时，孩子们嘲笑我。”他的母亲带来了男孩老师的一份报告，报告称他能够阅读和做数学，但当写作时，他会经常坐立不安并凝视窗外。他的书写不清楚、杂乱无章，并且低于同龄人的水平。上周，男孩的母亲接到了老师的电话，因为男孩把他的写作书扔在地上并开始哭泣。生命体征和体格检查，包括腹部检查，均正常。目前，该患者最有可能的诊断是什么？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "A LEARNING DISORDER is characterized by difficulties with key academic skills (reading, writing, or mathematics). Problems manifest at school age when these skills are being acquired, and performance is well below average for age. Many children display symptoms of anxiety, inattention, defiance, or hyperactivity when under stress to perform in an area of weakness, as exemplified by this child's struggle to pay attention and his emotional outburst in class. Learning disorders are often comorbid (eg, writing plus reading). In addition to academic dysfunction, they can also impact social skills and self-confidence.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis requires comprehensive assessment, including educational testing and ruling out intellectual disability, hearing or vision impairment, and other psychiatric or neurological disorders. Providers should consider the possibility of a learning disorder in any child presenting with school difficulty. Early intervention can be helpful in improving self-esteem and preventing further disability.\n\n(Choice A) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is characterized by inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity across at least 2 settings. There is no indication that this child struggles with inattention or hyperactivity when asked to read or do math or that this is a problem in the home setting.\n\n(Choice B) Language disorder presents with difficulties in acquiring and using language, which manifests in spoken as well as written language.\n\n(Choice C) Intellectual disability begins in early development and includes deficits in general mental abilities and adaptive functioning. Specific learning disorders occur in the presence of normal levels of intellectual functioning.\n\n(Choice D) In oppositional defiant disorder, there is a pattern of anger or irritability, argumentativeness, and defiant behavior. This patient's school refusal and throwing a book are in the context of stress. There is no indication that he is routinely defiant or argumentative.\n\n(Choice E) This patient enjoys playing soccer, and his school refusal is more likely due to fears of being teased. A diagnosis of social anxiety disorder requires persistent symptoms ≥ 6 months. This boy's learning disorder should be addressed to avoid further social anxiety.\n\n(Choice F) In somatic symptom disorder, anxiety revolves around a patient's symptoms. This boy is not anxious about his stomach ache; his stomach ache is a manifestation of his anxiety about school.\n\nEducational objective:\nLearning disorders are characterized by difficulties with key academic skills (reading, writing, or mathematics), resulting in performance well below expectations for age. Providers should consider a possible learning disorder in any school-aged child with behavioral, academic, or social difficulties at school.",
    "zh": "学习障碍的特征是关键学术技能（阅读、写作或数学）方面的困难。问题在学龄时出现，此时正在获得这些技能，并且表现远低于同龄人的平均水平。许多儿童在面临在薄弱领域表现的压力时，会表现出焦虑、注意力不集中、反抗或多动的症状，例如该儿童难以集中注意力以及在课堂上情绪爆发。学习障碍通常是共病的（例如，写作加上阅读）。除了学业功能障碍外，它们还会影响社交技能和自信心。\n\n明确的诊断需要全面的评估，包括教育测试和排除智力障碍、听力或视力障碍以及其他精神或神经系统疾病。提供者应考虑在任何出现学习困难的儿童中存在学习障碍的可能性。早期干预有助于提高自尊并防止进一步的残疾。\n\n(选项 A) 注意力缺陷多动障碍的特征是在至少 2 个环境中存在注意力不集中和/或多动-冲动。没有迹象表明该儿童在被要求阅读或做数学时难以集中注意力或多动，或者这在家中是一个问题。\n\n(选项 B) 语言障碍表现为在获得和使用语言方面的困难，这体现在口语和书面语中。\n\n(选项 C) 智力障碍始于早期发育，包括一般 mental 能力和适应性功能方面的缺陷。特定学习障碍出现在正常智力功能水平的情况下。\n\n(选项 D) 在对立违抗性障碍中，存在愤怒或易怒、争辩和反抗行为的模式。该患者的拒绝上学和扔书是在压力的情况下发生的。没有迹象表明他经常反抗或争辩。\n\n(选项 E) 该患者喜欢踢足球，他拒绝上学更有可能是由于害怕被嘲笑。社交焦虑障碍的诊断需要持续 6 个月或更长时间的症状。应该解决这名男孩的学习障碍，以避免进一步的社交焦虑。\n\n(选项 F) 在躯体症状障碍中，焦虑围绕着患者的症状。这名男孩对他的肚子痛并不焦虑；他的肚子痛是他对学校焦虑的表现。\n\n教育目标：\n学习障碍的特征是关键学术技能（阅读、写作或数学）方面的困难，导致表现远低于同龄人的预期。提供者应考虑在任何学龄儿童中可能存在学习障碍，这些儿童在学校有行为、学业或社交困难。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of specific learning disorders, their presentation in children, and differentiation from other neurodevelopmental and behavioral conditions. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing academic struggles that manifest as behavioral issues and school refusal.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully analyze the patient's symptoms, focusing on the specific academic difficulties described (writing), the context of these difficulties (school), and the absence of other primary diagnoses like ADHD, intellectual disability, or oppositional defiant disorder. Ruling out other conditions and identifying the core academic deficit is key.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试了对特定学习障碍的理解、它们在儿童中的表现以及与其他神经发育和行为状况的区别。它强调了识别表现为行为问题和拒绝上学的学术斗争的重要性。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须仔细分析患者的症状，重点关注所描述的特定学术困难（写作）、这些困难的背景（学校）以及不存在其他主要诊断，如多动症、智力障碍或对立违抗性障碍。排除其他情况并确定核心学术缺陷是关键。"
