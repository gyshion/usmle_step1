    "en": "A 36-year-old man comes to the office due to involuntary deviation of the head to the right, accompanied by muscle pain in his neck. The head-turning occurs in spells that start spontaneously, last 30-40 minutes, and is sometimes suppressed by placing a hand on the chin. Between episodes, there are no symptoms.",

    "en": "This patient has recurrent forceful contraction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, resulting in head rotation. This is consistent with CERVICAL DYSTONIA (ie, torticollis), a form of focal dystonia.\n\nDystonia is a neurologic movement disorder characterized by SUSTAINED, INVOLUNTARY muscle contractions, which force certain parts of the body into abnormal, sometimes painful MOVEMENTS or POSTURES. Focal dystonias affect a single muscle or group of related muscles, the most common of which include cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, and brachial dystonia (ie, writer's cramp).\n\nThe presence of a SENSORY TRICK is a common feature of focal dystonias, in which symptoms can sometimes be temporarily relieved with sensory input (eg, placing a hand on the chin).\n\n(Choice A) Bradykinesia is slow movement. It is commonly seen in Parkinson disease.\n(Choice B) Chorea is involuntary muscle activity that flows from one muscle group to another. Movements may appear fragmented or jerky, and the patient may display a dance-like gait. Chorea is a prominent feature of Huntington disease.\n(Choice C) Cogwheel rigidity refers to the intermittent ratchet-like resistance to movement that can be felt on passive extension/flexion of a parkinsonian limb.\n(Choice E) Hemiballism refers to flinging of the limbs (arm and/or leg) on one side of the body. Hemiballism occurs due to contralateral injury in or near the subthalamic nucleus.\n(Choice F) Myoclonus is a sudden, brief, sometimes severe (shock-like) muscle contraction. Examples of physiologic myoclonus are hiccups and hypnic jerks (occur when falling asleep). Pathologic myoclonus is seen in epilepsy and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\n\nEducational objective:\nDystonia is a neurologic movement disorder characterized by sustained, involuntary muscle contractions that often result in abnormal, sometimes painful posturing. Many patients can have temporary relief with the use of a sensory trick (eg, touching the face).",
    "zh": "该患者的胸锁乳突肌反复强烈收缩，导致头部旋转。这与颈部肌张力障碍（即，斜颈）一致，这是一种局灶性肌张力障碍。\n\n肌张力障碍是一种神经系统运动障碍，其特征是持续的、不自主的肌肉收缩，这迫使身体的某些部位进入异常的、有时是痛苦的运动或姿势。局灶性肌张力障碍影响单个肌肉或一组相关肌肉，其中最常见的是颈部肌张力障碍、睑痉挛和臂肌张力障碍（即，书写痉挛）。\n\n感觉技巧的存在是局灶性肌张力障碍的常见特征，在这种情况下，症状有时可以通过感觉输入（例如，用手托住下巴）暂时缓解。\n\n（选项A）运动迟缓是运动迟缓。它常见于帕金森病。\n（选项B）舞蹈症是不自主的肌肉活动，从一个肌肉群流向另一个肌肉群。动作可能显得断断续续或抽搐，并且患者可能表现出舞蹈步态。舞蹈症是亨廷顿病的突出特征。\n（选项C）齿轮状僵硬是指在帕金森病肢体的被动伸展/屈曲时可以感觉到的间歇性棘轮状的运动阻力。\n（选项E）偏身性投掷症是指身体一侧肢体（手臂和/或腿）的投掷运动。偏身性投掷症是由于丘脑下核附近或附近的对侧损伤引起的。\n（选项F）肌阵挛是一种突然、短暂、有时严重的（休克样）肌肉收缩。生理性肌阵挛的例子有打嗝和睡眠抽动（发生在入睡时）。病理性肌阵挛见于癫痫和克雅氏病。\n\n教育目标：\n肌张力障碍是一种神经系统运动障碍，其特征是持续的、不自主的肌肉收缩，通常会导致异常的、有时是痛苦的姿势。许多患者可以通过使用感觉技巧（例如，触摸面部）来暂时缓解。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of hyperkinetic movement disorders, specifically differentiating between various types based on clinical presentation. It requires recognizing the characteristic features of dystonia, such as sustained muscle contractions, abnormal postures, and the presence of sensory tricks.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully analyze the patient's symptoms, including the nature of the involuntary movement (head turning), its duration, spontaneity, and any alleviating factors (sensory trick). By comparing these features to the definitions of the provided options, the most fitting diagnosis can be identified.",
