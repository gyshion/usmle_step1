    "en": "This patient is suffering from PRIMARY BILIARY CHOLANGITIS (PBC), a chronic liver disease characterized by autoimmune destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts and cholestasis. The condition presents most commonly in middle-aged women and is insidious in onset. Pruritus is usually the first symptom and may be very severe, especially at night. Fatigue is also often reported. Physical findings typically include hepatosplenomegaly and xanthomatous lesions in the eyelids or in the skin and tendons. As the disease progresses, jaundice, steatorrhea, and portal hypertension may develop.\n\nAbnormalities on laboratory testing are consistent with cholestasis and include ELEVATED ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE cholesterol, and bile acids (causing pruritus) due to spillage of bile into the blood. Diagnosis is confirmed with demonstration of ANTI-MITOCHONDRIAL ANTIBODIES in the serum. Associated conditions include AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES such as Sjögren's syndrome, Raynaud's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\n\n(Choices A and B) Expected laboratory findings in a patient with acute viral hepatitis include significant elevations in ALT and AST (with ALT > AST), followed by rises in bilirubin.\n\n(Choice C) Alcohol-Induced hepatitis is typically associated with a significant drinking history and is commonly characterized by an AST:ALT ratio greater than 2:1.\n\n(Choice D) Budd-Chiari syndrome arises secondary to thrombotic occlusion of the hepatic veins and/or the intra- or suprahepatic inferior vena cava. The venous occlusion causes the sinusoidal pressure to increase, ultimately leading to portal hypertension, ascites, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly.\n\n(Choices F and G) Hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease cause hepatocellular injury and thus are associated with elevated ALT and AST rather than cholestatic picture.",
    "zh": "该患者患有原发性胆汁性胆管炎 (PBC)，这是一种以肝内胆管自身免疫性破坏和胆汁淤积为特征的慢性肝病。该病症最常见于中年女性，起病隐匿。瘙痒通常是第一个症状，并且可能非常严重，尤其是在夜间。疲劳也经常被报告。体格检查结果通常包括肝脾肿大以及眼睑或皮肤和肌腱中的黄色瘤病变。随着疾病的进展，可能出现黄疸、脂肪泻和门静脉高压。\n\n实验室检查的异常与胆汁淤积一致，包括碱性磷酸酶、胆固醇和胆汁酸升高（引起瘙痒），这是由于胆汁溢入血液所致。通过在血清中检测抗线粒体抗体可确诊。相关疾病包括自身免疫性疾病，例如干燥综合征、雷诺综合征、系统性硬化症和桥本甲状腺炎。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）急性病毒性肝炎患者的预期实验室检查结果包括 ALT 和 AST 显着升高（ALT > AST），随后胆红素升高。\n\n（选项 C）酒精性肝炎通常与饮酒史有关，其特征通常是 AST:ALT 比率大于 2:1。\n\n（选项 D）布加综合征继发于肝静脉和/或肝内或肝上腔静脉血栓性闭塞。静脉闭塞导致窦性压力升高，最终导致门静脉高压、腹水、肝肿大和脾肿大。\n\n（选项 F 和 G）血色病和威尔逊病会导致肝细胞损伤，因此与 ALT 和 AST 升高相关，而不是胆汁淤积表现。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), its clinical presentation, associated conditions, and diagnostic findings, particularly in the context of a patient with Sjögren's syndrome. It requires recognizing the typical symptoms and lab abnormalities associated with PBC.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the key features of the case, such as pruritus, Sjögren's syndrome, and elevated alkaline phosphatase, and then associate these findings with the most likely diagnosis. Rule out other liver diseases based on their distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics.",
