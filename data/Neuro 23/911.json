    "en": "A 57-year-old man is hospitalized for aspiration pneumonia. The patient was healthy and worked as an engineer without difficulty until about 4 months ago. Since that time, he has developed severe confusion, mood changes, and memory impairment and had to take medical leave from work. The patient is now completely dependent on his wife for toileting, feeding, and general self-care. {{exhibit_1}} Physical examination shows disorientation and sporadic, jerky extremity movements. During hospitalization, the patient lapses into a coma and dies. Postmortem examination of his brain shows widespread atrophy of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Histologic analysis of the patient's brain tissue would most likely show accumulation of which of the following?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This previously healthy patient developed rapidly progressive dementia with myoclonus (eg, involuntary, jerky extremity movements) and brain atrophy (due to widespread neuronal loss). These findings are consistent with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a rapidly fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy caused by prions.\n\nPrion protein (PrP) is found in both neuronal and nonneuronal brain cells and normally exists in an alpha-helical structure (PrPC). Prion disease occurs after a domain in this protein undergoes a conformational change from an alpha helix into a beta pleated sheet isoform (PrPSC), which confers the ability to induce similar conformational changes in other proteins. This beta sheet conformation is resistant to proteases and forms long, highly neurotoxic fibrils that accumulate intracellularly in neurons and form extracellular deposits.\n\nOn microscopy, there is spongiform degeneration of the gray matter, which is characterized by formation of microscopic vacuoles within the neuronal processes. This leads to widespread neuronal loss and reactive gliosis without associated inflammation. This may be evident on imaging or gross pathology as widespread atrophy involving both the cerebrum and cerebellum (in contrast to many other neurodegenerative diseases that spare the cerebellum).\n\n(Choice A) Cytoplasmic inclusions of alpha-synuclein are characteristic of dementia with Lewy bodies, which is characterized by visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, cognitive fluctuations, and REM sleep disorder.\n\n(Choice B) Deposition of beta-amyloid occurs in Alzheimer dementia, which commonly presents with early and prominent memory impairment with language deficits and spatial disorientation. It is characterized by a slow (years to decades) decline in function until death.\n\n(Choice C) Phosphorylated tau forms paired helical filaments that create intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. This is seen in both Alzheimer disease as well as frontotemporal dementia. Although memory impairment and behavioral changes can occur in these diseases, this patient's myoclonus and rapid progression leading to death are more consistent with CJD.\n\n(Choice E) Prion diseases are the only known diseases that are transmissible by protein. Prion isoforms do not contain nucleic acids. Although HIV (an RNA virus) can cause dementia, it typically causes mild, subacute cognitive impairment without myoclonus.",
    "zh": "这位先前健康的患者出现了快速进展的痴呆、肌阵挛（例如，不自主的、抽搐的肢体运动）和脑萎缩（由于广泛的神经元损失）。这些发现与克雅病(CJD)一致，克雅病是由朊病毒引起的快速致死的传染性海绵状脑病。\n\n朊蛋白(PrP)存在于神经元和非神经元脑细胞中，通常以α螺旋结构(PrPC)存在。朊病毒病发生在蛋白的一个结构域从α螺旋构象转变为β折叠片状异构体(PrPSC)后，这赋予了在其他蛋白中诱导类似构象变化的能力。这种β折叠片状构象耐受蛋白酶，形成长而高度神经毒性的原纤维，在神经元内积聚并形成细胞外沉积物。\n\n在显微镜下，可见灰质的海绵状变性，其特征是在神经元突起内形成微小的空泡。这导致广泛的神经元损失和反应性神经胶质增生，而无相关的炎症。这可能在影像学或大体病理学中表现为涉及大脑和小脑的广泛萎缩（与许多其他神经退行性疾病不同，这些疾病会保留小脑）。\n\n(选项A) α-突触核蛋白的胞质内包涵体是路易体痴呆的特征，其特征是视觉幻觉、帕金森病、认知波动和REM睡眠障碍。\n\n(选项B) β-淀粉样蛋白沉积发生在阿尔茨海默病痴呆中，阿尔茨海默病通常表现为早期且突出的记忆障碍，伴有语言缺陷和空间定向障碍。其特征是功能缓慢（数年至数十年）下降直至死亡。\n\n(选项C) 磷酸化tau蛋白形成成对的螺旋状丝，产生细胞内神经原纤维缠结。这可见于阿尔茨海默病和额颞叶痴呆。尽管在这些疾病中可能发生记忆障碍和行为改变，但该患者的肌阵挛和快速进展至死亡更符合CJD。\n\n(选项E) 朊病毒病是唯一已知的可通过蛋白质传播的疾病。朊病毒异构体不含核酸。尽管HIV（一种RNA病毒）可引起痴呆，但它通常引起轻度、亚急性认知障碍，且无肌阵挛。"

    "en": "The patient presented with rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, and brain atrophy, consistent with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). CJD is caused by prions, which are misfolded proteins (PrPSC) that accumulate in the brain. Histologically, this leads to spongiform degeneration and neuronal loss. The correct answer is accumulation of protease-resistant protein (prions).",
