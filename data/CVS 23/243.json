    "en": "A 73-year-old man is evaluated for exertional dyspnea. His exercise tolerance has decreased over the last year, and he can barely walk 2-3 blocks without stopping. The patient also reports occasional episodes of lightheadedness and palpitations. He has had no chest pain or syncope. He was diagnosed with hypertension in the past but does not take any medications. Physical examination reveals a cardiac murmur. The patient is referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation. Cardiac catheterization is performed, and the findings are shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}.",

    "en": "In the absence of any aortic valve pathology, the pressure in the aorta is similar to left ventricular pressure during systole. However, this patient's hemodynamic profile shows an abnormal pressure gradient between the left ventricular and aortic pressure tracings during systole (compare to normal), indicating significant aortic stenosis (AS). The intensity of the murmur of AS is directly related to the magnitude of the left ventricle to aorta pressure gradient. The maximum pressure difference between the left ventricular and aortic pressure tracings is noted at point B and corresponds to the peak intensity of a cardiac murmur during auscultation.\n\n(Choices A and C) The murmur of AS is a systolic ejection-type crescendo-decrescendo murmur that starts after the first heart sound following the opening of the aortic valve (point A). It typically ends before the A2 component of the second heart sound (point C). At points A and C, the left ventricular and aortic pressures are nearly equal with no or minimal flow across the aortic valve, and the murmur of AS would not be appreciated.\n\n(Choices D and E) These points occur during diastole, when the aortic valve is closed and the mitral valve is open. There is no abnormally elevated pressure gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle. This is consistent with normal, unobstructed diastolic filling of the left ventricle, and no murmur would be heard during diastole.\n\nEducational objective: The murmur of aortic stenosis (AS) is a systolic ejection-type, crescendo-decrescendo murmur that starts after the first heart sound and typically ends before the A2 component of the second heart sound. The intensity of the murmur is proportional to the magnitude of the left ventricle to aorta pressure gradient during systole. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "在没有主动脉瓣病变的情况下，收缩期主动脉内的压力与左心室压力相似。然而，该患者的血流动力学特征显示，收缩期左心室和主动脉压力描记图之间存在异常的压力梯度（与正常情况相比），表明存在严重的主动脉瓣狭窄 (AS)。 AS杂音的强度与左心室到主动脉的压力梯度大小直接相关。在B点观察到左心室和主动脉压力描记图之间的最大压力差，这对应于听诊时心脏杂音的峰值强度。\n\n（选项 A 和 C）AS杂音是一种收缩期喷射型、渐强-减弱型杂音，在主动脉瓣开放（A点）后的第一心音之后开始。它通常在第二心音的A2成分（C点）之前结束。在A点和C点，左心室压力和主动脉压力几乎相等，主动脉瓣的血流很少或没有，因此不会听到AS杂音。\n\n（选项 D 和 E）这些点发生在舒张期，此时主动脉瓣关闭，二尖瓣开放。左心房和左心室之间没有异常升高的压力梯度。这与左心室正常的、无受阻的舒张期充盈相一致，并且在舒张期不会听到杂音。\n\n教学目标：主动脉瓣狭窄 (AS) 的杂音是一种收缩期喷射型、渐强-减弱型杂音，在第一心音之后开始，通常在第二心音的A2成分之前结束。杂音的强度与收缩期左心室到主动脉压力梯度的大小成正比。 {{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of aortic stenosis and its hemodynamic consequences, specifically how the pressure gradient between the left ventricle and aorta relates to the intensity of the murmur.

This point corresponds to the peak intensity of the aortic stenosis murmur.",
