    "en": "A 62-year-old man comes to the office due to worsening dysphagia. Three months ago, the patient started having difficulty swallowing large bites of solid food, and now he can swallow only liquids and mashed food. He has lost 9.1 kg (20 lb) since the onset of his symptoms. Medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. The patient recently reduced the doses of his diabetic medications due to weight loss and lower blood glucose levels. He has no recent travel outside of the United States. Vital signs are normal. BMI is 29 kg/m². Physical examination is normal. A barium swallow study reveals an esophageal mass that significantly narrows the lumen. Endoscopic biopsy reveals moderately differentiated tumor cells with keratin nests and pearls. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient has squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which is characterized by flattened polyhedral or ovoid epithelial cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, keratin nests or pearls within or between cells, and intercellular bridging. Esophageal SCC typically presents with progressive solid-food dysphagia and weight loss. Chronic gastrointestinal blood loss may result in iron deficiency anemia.\n\nThe incidence of esophageal SCC is decreasing in the United States, with the highest incidence occurring in middle-aged and older individuals (age >50). The most significant risk factors for SCC in the United States include cigarette smoking and alcohol intake. In Asia, the chewing of betel nuts and consumption of foods containing N-nitroso compounds (often found in preserved or pickled vegetables) are commonly associated with SCC. Other risk factors include preexisting esophageal disease (eg, achalasia, caustic injury) and ingestion of high-temperature liquids (Choice B).\n\n(Choice C) Chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophagitis can lead to Barrett metaplasia and can increase the risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice D) Helicobacter pylori infection, a common cause of gastritis, is associated with an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma. However, it is not associated with increased risk of the development of Barrett esophagus, esophageal adenocarcinoma, or esophageal SCC.\n\n(Choice E) Obesity and metabolic syndrome are associated with increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, likely because of increased acid reflux into the esophagus due to anatomic abnormalities. {{exhibit_3}}\n\nEducational objective:\nMajor risk factors for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma include smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and intake of foods containing N-nitroso compounds.",
    "zh": "该患者患有鳞状细胞癌 (SCC)，其特征是扁平的多边形或卵圆形上皮细胞，具有嗜酸性细胞质，细胞内或细胞间有角蛋白巢或珍珠，以及细胞间桥接。食管SCC通常表现为进行性固体食物吞咽困难和体重减轻。慢性胃肠道失血可能导致缺铁性贫血。\n\n在美国，食管SCC的发病率正在下降，最高发病率发生在中年和老年人（年龄>50岁）。美国SCC最显著的危险因素包括吸烟和饮酒。在亚洲，槟榔的咀嚼和食用含有N-亚硝基化合物的食物（通常存在于腌制或腌制蔬菜中）通常与SCC有关。其他危险因素包括已有的食管疾病（例如，贲门失弛缓症、腐蚀性损伤）和摄入高温液体（选项B）。\n\n（选项C）慢性胃食管反流病和食管炎可导致Barrett化生，并可能增加食管腺癌的风险。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n（选项D）幽门螺杆菌感染是胃炎的常见原因，与胃腺癌的风险增加有关。但是，它与Barrett食管、食管腺癌或食管SCC的发生风险增加无关。\n\n（选项E）肥胖和代谢综合征与食管腺癌的风险增加有关，这可能是由于解剖结构异常导致胃酸反流进入食管所致。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n教育目标：\n食管鳞状细胞癌的主要危险因素包括吸烟、过量饮酒和摄入含有N-亚硝基化合物的食物。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the risk factors associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. It requires differentiating between risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma versus adenocarcinoma.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's presentation (dysphagia, weight loss, esophageal mass) suggests esophageal cancer.
