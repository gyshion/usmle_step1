    "en": "A 10-year-old boy comes to the office for a first visit. His family recently came to the United States as political refugees. The patient's mother says that she has required several blood product transfusions due to anemia, but she does not have prior records available with her. On examination, the patient's temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F). BMI is 21 kg/m². Examination is notable for conjunctival pallor and moderate splenomegaly. Laboratory results are as follows:\n\nHemoglobin 9.4 g/dL\nPlatelets 240,000/mm³\n\nEnzyme assays performed on circulating blood cells demonstrate low pyruvate kinase activity.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Pyruvate kinase is a glycolytic pathway enzyme that converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, resulting in the generation of a molecule of ATP. Allosteric stimulation of pyruvate kinase (by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate) stimulates glycolysis. Mature red blood cells (RBCs), which do not contain mitochondria, rely on lactate as the main metabolite for glycolysis.\n\nMost of the ATP produced is used for transport of cations against a concentration gradient in the RBC membrane. Therefore, pyruvate kinase deficiency, which results in insufficient ATP production, disrupts this gradient, leading to water and potassium loss, defective maintenance of membrane architecture (echinocyte formation), and hemolysis. As reticuloendothelial cells in the splenic red pulp are involved in removal of damaged RBCs, their increased activity in the setting of pyruvate kinase deficiency causes them to undergo hyperplasia, resulting in splenomegaly.\n\n(Choice A) The spleen is important in fighting infectious pathogens in the body; therefore, many acute and chronic infections lead to enlargement of the spleen due to proliferation of lymphoid tissue.\n\n(Choice B) Disorders such as leukemia and lymphoma result in splenomegaly from neoplastic proliferation of lymphoid tissue within the spleen.\n\n(Choice C) Passive congestion of the spleen with blood occurs in the setting of portal hypertension, splenic vein thrombosis, or congestive heart failure. Resultant splenic sinusoid dilation can lead to splenomegaly.\n\n(Choice D) In infective endocarditis, circulating immune complexes can deposit in the kidneys and the spleen, likely contributing to splenomegaly.\n\n(Choice F) Splenomegaly in the lysosomal storage diseases Niemann-Pick disease and Gaucher disease is due to the accumulation of sphingomyelin and glucocerebrosides, respectively.\n\nEducational objective:\nPyruvate kinase deficiency causes hemolytic anemia due to failure of glycolysis and resultant failure to generate sufficient ATP to maintain erythrocyte structure. In this case, splenic hyperplasia results from increased work of the splenic parenchyma, which must remove these deformed erythrocytes from the circulation.",
    "zh": "丙酮酸激酶是一种糖酵解途径酶，可将磷酸烯醇式丙酮酸转化为丙酮酸，从而产生一个ATP分子。丙酮酸激酶的变构激活（由果糖1,6-二磷酸激活）刺激糖酵解。成熟红细胞（RBCs）不含线粒体，依靠乳酸作为糖酵解的主要代谢物。\n\n产生的大部分ATP用于将阳离子逆浓度梯度转运到红细胞膜中。因此，丙酮酸激酶缺乏症导致ATP产生不足，从而破坏了这种梯度，导致水和钾的流失、膜结构的缺陷（棘细胞形成）和溶血。由于脾脏红髓中的网状内皮细胞参与清除受损的红细胞，它们在丙酮酸激酶缺乏症的情况下活性增加，导致其增生，从而导致脾肿大。\n\n（选项A）脾脏在抵抗体内感染性病原体方面很重要；因此，许多急性和慢性感染会导致脾脏肿大，原因是淋巴组织增生。\n\n（选项B）白血病和淋巴瘤等疾病会导致脾脏淋巴组织在脾内发生肿瘤性增生，从而导致脾肿大。\n\n（选项C）脾脏被动充血发生在门静脉高压、脾静脉血栓形成或充血性心力衰竭的情况下。由此导致的脾窦扩张可导致脾肿大。\n\n（选项D）在感染性心内膜炎中，循环免疫复合物会沉积在肾脏和脾脏中，这可能导致脾肿大。\n\n（选项F）溶酶体贮积病Niemann-Pick病和Gaucher病的脾肿大分别是由鞘磷脂和葡萄糖脑苷脂的蓄积引起的。\n\n教育目标：\n丙酮酸激酶缺乏症导致溶血性贫血，原因是糖酵解失败，导致无法产生足够的ATP来维持红细胞结构。在这种情况下，脾脏增生是由于脾实质工作量增加所致，后者必须从循环中清除这些变形的红细胞。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pyruvate kinase deficiency, a cause of hemolytic anemia, and its association with splenomegaly due to red pulp hyperplasia. It requires understanding the pathophysiology of pyruvate kinase deficiency and its impact on red blood cell metabolism and splenic function.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key findings of anemia, splenomegaly, and low pyruvate kinase activity. Connect these findings to the underlying mechanism of increased red pulp activity in the spleen due to the removal of damaged red blood cells in pyruvate kinase deficiency.",
