    "en": "This patient with excessive alcohol use, epigastric pain, and steatorrhea likely has chronic pancreatitis with exocrine insufficiency. Atrophy and fibrosis of pancreatic acinar cells result in failed secretion of adequate amounts of digestive enzymes (eg, lipase). Consequently, patients may develop fat malabsorption with greasy, malodorous stools that are difficult to flush. A 72-hour stool collection can confirm excessive excretion of fecal fat.\n\nThe head, neck, and body of the pancreas are retroperitoneal, whereas the tail is peritoneal. The head of the pancreas lies in the curve of the duodenum and overlies the L2 vertebra, with a portion extending behind the superior mesenteric vessels (uncinate process). The neck connects the head to the body and lies anterior to the portal vein and superior mesenteric vessels. The pancreas body overlies the L1 and L2 vertebrae and makes contact posteriorly with the aorta, left adrenal gland, left kidney, and renal vessels. The tail of the pancreas courses within the splenorenal ligament alongside the splenic vessels.\n\n(Choice A) This structure is the second (descending) part of the duodenum.\n\n(Choice C) This structure is the inferior vena cava, which lies on the right side of the vertebrae in a retroperitoneal position.\n\n(Choice D) This structure is the abdominal aorta, which lies on the left side of the vertebrae in a retroperitoneal position.\n\n(Choice E) At this level in the abdominal cavity, these loops of small bowel represent jejunum. If this CT slice were lower in the abdomen, these loops would more likely represent ileum.\n\nEducational objective:\nChronic pancreatitis often presents with epigastric pain and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency resulting in fat malabsorption/steatorrhea. On abdominal CT scan, the pancreas can be identified by its head in close association with the second part of the duodenum; its body overlying the aorta, left kidney, and renal vessels; and its tail lying within the splenorenal ligament. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者有饮酒过量、剑突下疼痛和脂肪泻，很可能患有慢性胰腺炎伴外分泌功能不全。胰腺腺泡细胞萎缩和纤维化导致消化酶（如脂肪酶）分泌不足。因此，患者可能会出现脂肪吸收不良，粪便油腻、气味难闻，难以冲洗。72小时粪便收集可以证实粪便脂肪过度排出。\n\n胰腺的头部、颈部和体部位于腹膜后，而尾部位于腹膜内。胰腺头位于十二指肠弯曲处，覆盖L2椎体，一部分延伸到肠系膜上血管后方（钩突）。颈部连接头部和体部，位于门静脉和肠系膜上血管的前方。胰腺体覆盖L1和L2椎体，后部与主动脉、左肾上腺、左肾和肾血管接触。胰腺尾部沿着脾肾韧带，与脾血管并列。\n\n（选项A）该结构是十二指肠的第二（降）部分。\n\n（选项C）该结构是下腔静脉，位于椎骨右侧的腹膜后位置。\n\n（选项D）该结构是腹主动脉，位于椎骨左侧的腹膜后位置。\n\n（选项E）在腹腔的这个水平，这些小肠袢代表空肠。如果此CT切片在腹部较低的位置，这些袢更可能代表回肠。\n\n教育目标：\n慢性胰腺炎常表现为剑突下疼痛和胰腺外分泌功能不全，导致脂肪吸收不良/脂肪泻。在腹部CT扫描上，可以通过其与十二指肠第二部分密切相关的头部、覆盖主动脉、左肾和肾血管的体部以及位于脾肾韧带内的尾部来识别胰腺。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of chronic pancreatitis, its etiology (alcohol abuse), clinical presentation (abdominal pain, steatorrhea), and diagnostic findings (excessive fecal fat excretion, pancreatic abnormalities on CT scan). It also requires understanding of pancreatic anatomy and its relationship to surrounding structures.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic triad of chronic pancreatitis and correlate it with the CT scan findings. Identify the pancreas on the CT scan and relate its location to the labeled structures. Rule out other structures based on their anatomical location and the patient's clinical presentation.",
