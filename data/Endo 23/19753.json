    "en": "A newborn boy is found to have markedly elevated serum TSH and low thyroxine on routine screening. Laboratory findings using a venous blood sample confirm the diagnosis. The patient was born at 39 weeks gestation to a 34-year-old healthy woman, who had been taking prenatal vitamins regularly. He has no symptoms or abnormal findings on clinical examination. Imaging studies reveal an ectopic thyroid gland just below the tongue. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's otherwise normal physical examination despite abnormal thyroid laboratory findings?",
    "zh": "一名新生男婴在常规筛查中被发现血清促甲状腺激素(TSH)明显升高，甲状腺素水平偏低。使用静脉血样本进行的实验室检查证实了这一诊断。该患者出生于妊娠39周，母亲为一名34岁的健康女性，该女性定期服用产前维生素。该患儿在临床检查中无任何症状或异常发现。影像学检查显示舌下有一个异位甲状腺。以下哪项最可能是该患者在甲状腺实验室检查结果异常的情况下，体格检查却正常的可能原因？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This infant has primary hypothyroidism, a congenital disorder that is most commonly caused by abnormal thyroid gland development (ie, agenesis, hypoplasia) or location (ectopy). During normal embryogenesis, the thyroid descends from the developing pharynx to its normal location anterior to the trachea. Abnormal migration results in an ectopic thyroid (eg, lingual, mediastinal), as seen in this patient.\n\nMost patients with thyroid dysgenesis have hypothyroidism, with routine newborn screening findings of increased TSH and decreased thyroxine (T4) levels. However, newborns are typically asymptomatic for the first few weeks due to the presence of maternal T4, which crosses the placenta in small amounts during gestation. The amount of neonatal T4 is still low compared to that in unaffected patients but is sufficient to initially prevent clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism.\n\nAs maternally derived neonatal T4 begins to wane in the first few weeks to months of life, classic symptoms of untreated hypothyroidism develop. Presenting signs include lethargy, hypotonia, constipation, and poor feeding. A hoarse cry, macroglossia, facial edema, and prolonged jaundice are also common. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Ectopic thyroid tissue typically produces decreased, not increased, T4.\n\n(Choice B) Physiologically increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels in pregnancy result in increased total maternal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) to maintain a euthyroid state. Because maternal levels of free T4 and T3 remain normal, the increase in maternal TBG does not affect the fetus.\n\n(Choice C) Transplacental transfer of thyroid-stimulating antibodies in mothers with Graves disease results in transient neonatal hyperthyroidism (neonatal Graves disease). Laboratory findings would show increased T4 and decreased TSH.\n\n(Choice E) TSH is a polypeptide hormone that does not cross the placenta.\n\nEducational objective:\nCongenital hypothyroidism, most commonly caused by abnormal thyroid gland development or location (ie, ectopy), is identified by elevated TSH and decreased thyroxine (T4) levels. Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism are not present at birth due to the transplacental transfer of small amounts of maternal T4.",
    "zh": "该婴儿患有原发性甲状腺功能减退症，这是一种先天性疾病，最常见的原因是甲状腺发育异常（即，无腺症、发育不全）或位置异常（异位）。在正常的胚胎发生过程中，甲状腺从发育中的咽部下降到其正常位置，即气管前方。异常的迁移导致异位甲状腺（例如，舌部，纵隔），如该患者所示。\n\n大多数甲状腺发育不全的患者患有甲状腺功能减退症，常规新生儿筛查结果显示TSH升高和甲状腺素(T4)水平降低。然而，由于母亲的T4存在，且在妊娠期间少量通过胎盘，新生儿通常在前几周无症状。与未受影响的患者相比，新生儿的T4量仍然较低，但足以最初防止甲状腺功能减退症的临床表现。\n\n随着母体来源的新生儿T4在出生后几周到几个月内开始减弱，未经治疗的甲状腺功能减退症的典型症状就会出现。表现症状包括嗜睡、肌张力减退、便秘和喂养不良。嘶哑的哭声、巨舌症、面部水肿和黄疸持续时间延长也很常见。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项A) 异位甲状腺组织通常产生甲状腺素减少，而不是增加。\n\n(选项B) 妊娠期生理性甲状腺结合球蛋白(TBG)水平升高，导致总母体T4和三碘甲状腺原氨酸(T3)升高，以维持甲状腺功能正常状态。由于母体游离T4和T3水平保持正常，母体TBG的增加不会影响胎儿。\n\n(选项C) 患有格雷夫斯病的母亲，促甲状腺抗体经胎盘转移会导致短暂的新生儿甲状腺功能亢进症（新生儿格雷夫斯病）。实验室检查结果显示T4升高和TSH降低。\n\n(选项E) TSH是一种多肽激素，不能通过胎盘。\n\n教育目的：\n先天性甲状腺功能减退症，最常见的原因是甲状腺发育或位置异常（即，异位），其特征是TSH升高和甲状腺素(T4)水平降低。由于少量母体T4经胎盘转移，出生时不会出现甲状腺功能减退症的临床表现。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of congenital hypothyroidism and the influence of maternal thyroxine (T4) on newborn presentation. It assesses understanding of thyroid hormone physiology and the impact of transplacental transfer.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that maternal T4 crosses the placenta, preventing immediate symptoms of hypothyroidism in newborns. Consider the normal physiology of thyroid hormone transfer during pregnancy and the expected lab findings in congenital hypothyroidism.",
