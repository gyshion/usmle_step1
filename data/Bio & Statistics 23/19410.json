    "en": "A randomized controlled trial is conducted to compare transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), using a self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve bioprosthesis, with surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis. The objective is to determine the difference in risk of death from any cause. Seven hundred forty-seven patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at increased surgical risk are recruited and randomly assigned to groups for treatment with TAVR or surgical valve replacement. Follow-up assessments are performed at discharge and at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year. The 1-year follow-up results are as follows:\n\n\nWhich of the following best represents the absolute risk reduction for death from any cause in patients treated with TAVR compared to those treated with surgical replacement?",

    "en": "Absolute risk reduction (ARR) describes the difference in risk of an unfavorable outcome between the treatment group (eg, new treatment) and the control group (eg, standard treatment):\n\nARR = (Riskcontrol – Risktreatment)\n\nIn this example, Riskcontrol is the risk of death from any cause in the group treated with surgical aortic valve replacement and is determined by dividing the number of deaths in that group (68) by the total number of patients in that group (357). Risktreatment is the risk of death from any cause in the group treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and is determined by dividing 57 by 390. Therefore, the ARR for death from any cause in patients treated with TAVR compared to those treated with surgical replacement is calculated as follows:\n\nARR = (68/357) – (57/390) = 0.044\n\nARR can be used to determine the number needed to treat (NNT), calculated as:\n\nNNT = 1 / ARR\n\nNNT is the number of patients who need to be treated with a treatment (eg, TAVR) to prevent 1 additional negative event (eg, death from any cause) when compared to a control group (eg, surgical replacement). A lower NNT indicates a more effective treatment because fewer patients need to be treated to prevent 1 additional negative outcome. In this example, the approximate NNT with TAVR to prevent 1 additional death from any cause is:\n\nNNT = 1 / [(68/357) – (57/390)] = 22.562 (Choice E)\n\n(Choice B) [(68/357) – (57/390)] / (68/357) = 0.233 represents the relative risk reduction (RRR) for death from any cause in the TAVR group compared to the surgical replacement group: RRR = (Riskcontrol – Risktreatment) / Riskcontrol. Unlike ARR, which quantifies the absolute difference in risk between the groups, RRR describes the difference in risk between the groups as a proportion of baseline risk (ie, risk in the control group).\n\n(Choices C and D) Switching the numerator and denominator changes the interpretation of the relative risk (RR, the ratio of the probability of an event occurring in one group compared to the other group). In this example, (57/390) / (68/357) represents the RR of death from any cause in the TAVR group compared to the surgical replacement group; (68/357) / (57/390) represents the RR of death from any cause in the surgical replacement group compared to the TAVR group.\n\nEducational objective:\nAbsolute risk reduction (ARR) describes the difference in risk between control and treatment groups. It is calculated as follows: ARR = (Riskcontrol – Risktreatment).",
    "zh": "绝对风险降低 (ARR) 描述了治疗组（例如，新治疗）与对照组（例如，标准治疗）之间不良结局的风险差异：\n\nARR = (风险对照组 – 风险治疗组)\n\n在本例中，风险对照组是指接受外科主动脉瓣置换术的组中因任何原因导致死亡的风险，其计算方法是将该组的死亡人数 (68) 除以该组的患者总数 (357)。风险治疗组是指接受经导管主动脉瓣置换术 (TAVR) 治疗的组中因任何原因导致死亡的风险，其计算方法是将 57 除以 390。因此，与接受外科置换术的患者相比，接受 TAVR 治疗的患者因任何原因导致死亡的 ARR 计算如下：\n\nARR = (68/357) – (57/390) = 0.044\n\nARR 可用于确定需要治疗的人数 (NNT)，计算如下：\n\nNNT = 1 / ARR\n\nNNT 是指与对照组（例如，外科置换术）相比，需要用某种治疗（例如，TAVR）治疗的患者人数，以预防 1 例额外的负面事件（例如，因任何原因导致死亡）。NNT 越低，表明治疗效果越好，因为需要治疗的患者越少，才能预防 1 例额外的负面结局。在本例中，TAVR 预防 1 例额外因任何原因导致死亡的近似 NNT 为：\n\nNNT = 1 / [(68/357) – (57/390)] = 22.562（选项 E）\n\n（选项 B）[(68/357) – (57/390)] / (68/357) = 0.233 代表 TAVR 组与外科置换组相比，因任何原因导致死亡的相对风险降低 (RRR)：RRR = (风险对照组 – 风险治疗组) / 风险对照组。与量化各组间风险绝对差异的 ARR 不同，RRR 将各组间的风险差异描述为基线风险（即，对照组中的风险）的比例。\n\n（选项 C 和 D）交换分子和分母会改变相对风险 (RR，一个组中发生事件的概率与另一个组的概率之比) 的解释。在本例中，(57/390) / (68/357) 代表 TAVR 组与外科置换组相比因任何原因导致死亡的 RR；(68/357) / (57/390) 代表外科置换组与 TAVR 组相比因任何原因导致死亡的 RR。\n\n教育目标：\n绝对风险降低 (ARR) 描述了对照组和治疗组之间的风险差异。其计算方法如下：ARR = (风险对照组 – 风险治疗组)。"
