On the third day of hospitalization, temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 122/78 mm Hg, and pulse is 86/min. On physical examination, he is mildly lethargic and his voice is soft and breathy. Rhonchi are still heard over the lower right lung. There is left-sided facial droop and hemiparesis from a previous stroke. Chest x-ray demonstrates dense air space opacities in the superior region of the right lower lobe. {{exhibit_1}} Which of the following underlying factors most likely predisposed this patient to his current hospitalization?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient developed septic shock secondary to pneumonia (rhonchi on lung examination and radiographic lung opacities). His history of dementia and stroke with residual hemiparesis and evidence of vocal cord paralysis (soft, breathy voice) is highly suggestive of aspiration pneumonia due to inhalation of oral secretions. The superior regions of the lower lobes and posterior regions of the upper lobes are the most dependent locations in the lungs of supine individuals; infiltrates in these locations are further evidence of aspiration pneumonia.\n\nAlthough early studies indicated that anaerobic organisms were largely responsible for aspiration pneumonia, newer data indicate that aerobic upper respiratory organisms are primarily involved. Therefore, first-line empiric treatment targets typical community-acquired pneumonia pathogens. Anaerobic coverage is only required when lung abscess or empyema are present.\n\n(Choice A) Enteral feeding, specifically oral intake, increases the risk of aspiration in patients with dysphagia.\n\n(Choices B and D) Reduced intercostal muscle strength can result in atelectasis and hypoxia. Extended immobility can produce atelectasis in the posterior lungs if the patient remains in a supine position. These conditions can also predispose to the development of pneumonia if pulmonary hygiene is inadequate. However, aspiration pneumonia is less likely in such patients as long as swallow and cough reflexes are intact.\n\n(Choice C) Impaired cellular immunity can increase the risk of pneumonia. However, affected patients usually have a history of recurrent viral and fungal infections.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients with dementia or hemiparesis may have dysphagia, which is a risk factor for aspiration pneumonia. Dependent lung consolidation is commonly seen in aspiration pneumonia.",
    "zh": "该患者继发于肺炎（肺部检查的啰音和放射学肺部混浊）发生感染性休克。他有痴呆和卒中病史，残留偏瘫以及声带麻痹的证据（声音低沉、气喘）高度提示吸入性肺炎，原因在于吸入口腔分泌物。仰卧位患者的肺下叶上部区域和上叶后部区域是肺部最依赖的部位；这些部位的浸润进一步证明了吸入性肺炎。\n\n尽管早期研究表明，厌氧菌是吸入性肺炎的主要原因，但新的数据显示，需氧性上呼吸道病原体是主要的病原体。因此，一线经验性治疗针对常见的社区获得性肺炎病原体。仅当存在肺脓肿或脓胸时才需要厌氧菌覆盖。\n\n（选项 A） 肠内喂养，特别是口服摄入，会增加吞咽困难患者的误吸风险。\n\n（选项 B 和 D） 肋间肌力下降可导致肺不张和低氧血症。长期制动可导致仰卧位患者的肺后部发生肺不张。如果肺部卫生不充分，这些情况也可能易患肺炎。但是，只要吞咽和咳嗽反射完整，吸入性肺炎在这些患者中发生的可能性就较小。\n\n（选项 C） 细胞免疫受损会增加肺炎的风险。但是，受影响的患者通常有反复发生的病毒和真菌感染病史。\n\n教育目标：\n患有痴呆或偏瘫的患者可能患有吞咽困难，这是吸入性肺炎的危险因素。依赖性肺实变常见于吸入性肺炎。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of risk factors for aspiration pneumonia, particularly in the context of a patient with neurological deficits. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation suggestive of aspiration and identifying the underlying predisposing condition.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to identify the patient's risk factors (dementia, stroke, hemiparesis) and connect them to the most likely cause of pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia is common in patients with impaired swallowing or cough reflexes.",
