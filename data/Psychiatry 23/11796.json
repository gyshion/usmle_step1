    "en": "A 13-month-old girl is brought to the office by her mother. She is worried that there is something wrong and explains, \"My daughter used to sit on her own and loved babbling and clapping her hands. She still plays with her sisters and likes snuggles, but for the past 3 months she hasn't babbled as much, and can no longer sit without my help. She twists her hands together and I cannot get her to stop. I am worried that the skin on her hands is getting red, dry, and painful.\" Weight and height are in the 60th percentile. The patient's head growth, however, has decreased from the 50th to the 40th percentile in 3 months. On examination, the child is globally hypotonic and unable to sit upright without being held. She makes no sound apart from an occasional grunt. She shows interest in toys the doctor provides her but does not reach out for them, wringing her hands repeatedly.",

    "en": "This patient's normal development through age 10 months followed by regression (eg, loss of babbling and motor control) and development of hand wringing is characteristic of RETT SYNDROME, a neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs mainly in girls. Most cases are due to de novo mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene. Rett syndrome is characterized by normal development until age 6-18 months, followed by a loss of motor and language skills and the development of STEREOTYPIC HAND MOVEMENTS. Deceleration of head growth is a classic feature of Rett syndrome and can be an early sign. Other features include seizures, intellectual disability, autistic features, and breathing abnormalities. There is no specific therapy for Rett syndrome; many patients survive well into adulthood with severe, permanent neurologic deficits.\n\n(Choice A) Features of Angelman syndrome include a happy disposition, jerky gait, and hand flapping. Development is commonly delayed rather than initially normal.\n\n(Choice B) Although this patient has deficits in verbal communication and stereotypic hand movements, she does not display other features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) such as deficits in social reciprocity, emotional restriction, or repetitive interests. She plays and snuggles with family and appears to be trying to interact with the doctor.\n\n(Choice C) Fragile X syndrome mainly affects males and is associated with CGG trinucleotide repeats on the X chromosome. Features include intellectual disability; a long, narrow face; large protruding ears; macrocephaly; and macroorchidism.\n\n(Choice D) Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency in HGPRT (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase), leading to an increase in uric acid levels. Although hypotonia and involuntary movements such as hand wringing may be present, developmental milestones are typically delayed rather than normal. Gout and self-mutilating behaviors (eg, lip and finger biting) are commonly seen.\n\n(Choice F) Tay-Sachs disease is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency in beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A). Like Rett syndrome, it presents with a regression of motor skills, but it typically begins earlier (age 2-6 months) and is associated with macrocephaly and a cherry red spot on the macula.",

    "en": "This question tests the recognition of Rett syndrome based on a classic presentation of neurodevelopmental regression in a young girl, characterized by loss of acquired skills, stereotypic hand movements, and deceleration of head growth.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key features of regression after a period of normal development, the specific type of hand movements, and the pattern of head growth deceleration. Differentiate these findings from other neurodevelopmental disorders that may present with developmental delay or regression.",
