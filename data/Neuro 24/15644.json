    "en": "A 72-year-old man comes to the office due to poor sleep. He is concerned that he is sleeping less since he retired a year ago. He says, \"I used to sleep a solid 8 hours, but now I wake up several times a night. And I'm up for the day between 5:00 and 6:00 AM, which is a full hour before I want to get up. I'm probably only getting about 6 or 7 hours of sleep total.\" The patient typically falls asleep while watching television at 10:00 PM. He sometimes awakens to use the bathroom in the middle of the night but typically falls back asleep within 15 minutes. The patient likes to do crosswords and play golf in the mornings but occasionally takes 30-minute naps in the afternoon. The patient's wife says that the snores softly, but she has not witnessed any breathing pauses. Medical problems include hypertension and a history of depression. The patient does not use alcohol or illicit drugs.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's sleep changes are consistent with NORMAL AGING. Age-related changes in sleep architecture include DECREASED TOTAL SLEEP TIME and slow-wave sleep with increased nighttime sleep latency. As a result of these changes, elderly patients may experience more FRAGMENTED SLEEP with nocturnal awakenings and an EARLIER WAKE-UP TIME when compared to their previous sleep pattern. All these changes can in turn lead to subjective reports of insomnia and unintentional and unintentional daytime napping.\n\nThis patient functions well during the daytime and does not exhibit any other symptoms that would be concerning for a sleep disorder (eg, sleep apnea). He should be reassured that these changes are normal.\n\n(Choice A) Adjustment disorder should be considered in a patient who develops mood symptoms within 3 months of a stressor. If mood symptoms persist for >6 months after the stressor, then adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed. This patient does not have any mood symptoms, and his retirement was >6 months ago.\n\n(Choice C) Insomnia disorder involves persistent difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, resulting in clinically significant distress or impairment. It would not be diagnosed in a patient with normal age-related sleep changes.\n\n(Choice D) Although sleep changes are frequent in major depressive disorder, this patient lacks other key depressive symptoms necessary to meet criteria for it (eg, sadness, decreased interest, anhedonia, decreased appetite, suicidality).\n\n(Choice E) Sleep apnea is associated with hypertension and fragmented sleep. However, this patient has no history of witnessed apneas and his sleep changes are classic for normal aging.\n\n(Choice F) REM sleep behavior disorder is a parasomnia characterized by dream-enactment behaviors that occur due to loss of normal REM sleep atonia.\n\nEducational objective:\nAge-related sleep changes may be reported as insomnia and must be differentiated from primary sleep disorders and other disorders. Normal changes include decreased total sleep time, increased nighttime awakenings, sleepiness earlier in the evening with earlier morning awakening, and increased daytime napping.",
    "zh": "该患者的睡眠变化与正常衰老一致。与年龄相关的睡眠结构变化包括总睡眠时间减少和慢波睡眠减少，夜间睡眠潜伏期增加。由于这些变化，老年患者可能会经历更支离破碎的睡眠，伴有夜间觉醒和更早的起床时间，与他们之前的睡眠模式相比。所有这些变化反过来又会导致对失眠的主观报告以及无意和无意的白天小睡。\n\n该患者在白天功能良好，并且没有表现出任何其他令人担忧的睡眠障碍症状（例如，睡眠呼吸暂停）。应该向他保证这些变化是正常的。\n\n（选项 A）应考虑在应激源发生3个月内出现情绪症状的患者中诊断适应障碍。如果情绪症状在应激源后持续超过6个月，则无法诊断适应障碍。该患者没有任何情绪症状，而且他退休的时间已经超过6个月了。\n\n（选项 C）失眠障碍涉及持续难以入睡或维持睡眠，导致临床上显着的痛苦或损害。在有正常年龄相关睡眠变化的患者中，不会诊断为失眠障碍。\n\n（选项 D）尽管睡眠变化在重度抑郁症中很常见，但该患者缺乏符合诊断标准所需的其他关键抑郁症状（例如，悲伤、兴趣降低、快感缺失、食欲下降、自杀倾向）。\n\n（选项 E）睡眠呼吸暂停与高血压和睡眠片段化有关。然而，该患者没有目击呼吸暂停的病史，而且他的睡眠变化是典型的正常衰老。\n\n（选项 F）REM睡眠行为障碍是一种睡症，其特征是由于正常REM睡眠肌张力消失而发生的梦境行为。\n\n教育目标：\n年龄相关的睡眠变化可能被报告为失眠，必须与原发性睡眠障碍和其他障碍区分开来。正常变化包括总睡眠时间减少、夜间觉醒增加、晚上更早感到困倦，早上更早醒来以及白天小睡增加。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of age-related changes in sleep patterns and how to differentiate them from primary sleep disorders like insomnia or sleep apnea. It requires recognizing the typical alterations in sleep architecture that occur with normal aging.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully evaluating the patient's reported sleep disturbances in the context of their age and medical history. Key is to identify symptoms that align with normal aging processes versus those that suggest a pathological condition, considering the absence of other significant symptoms for alternative diagnoses.",
