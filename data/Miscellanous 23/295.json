    "en": "A 54-year-old man is admitted to the hospital following a high-speed motor vehicle collision. He is found to have long bone fractures of the right leg that require open reduction/internal fixation. After the patient's condition is stabilized, he is transferred to a skilled nursing facility for extended rehabilitation. During his stay, his right leg is immobilized for several weeks. Management is complicated by decreased nutritional intake due to adverse effects of opioid pain medications. Measurement of the thigh following removal of casting materials finds a 2-cm decrease in diameter. The underlying process responsible for this patient's change in body measurement is most likely to also occur in which of the following?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's right leg, immobilized for several weeks, has decreased in diameter. This decrease in size is due to ATROPHY, which is a cellular adaptation characterized by a decrease in cell size and number, leading to a decrease in organ size. In this case, the skeletal muscle fibers in the leg have atrophied due to decreased physical workload.\n\nPathologic atrophy can occur due to various causes, including lack of use (as seen in the patient's leg), loss of hormonal or neurologic stimulation, impaired circulation, mechanical compression, aging, and nutritional insufficiency. At the cellular level, atrophy represents an attempt to decrease metabolic requirements by reducing the number and size of organelles and protein synthesis, which can lead to increased protein breakdown and, in prolonged states, apoptosis and further reduction in cell numbers.\n\nOption A: Adrenal glands undergo atrophy during prolonged glucocorticoid use. Glucocorticoids suppress ACTH release, leading to decreased stimulation of the adrenal cortex and subsequent atrophy. This is a correct example of atrophy.\n\nOption B: Bronchial tissue subjected to prolonged tobacco smoke exposure undergoes METAPLASIA, specifically squamous metaplasia, where the normal columnar epithelium is replaced by squamous epithelium. This is a change in cell type, not a decrease in cell size or number.\n\nOption C: Endometrial tissue during estrogen replacement therapy typically undergoes HYPERPLASIA, characterized by an increase in cell number and/or size, leading to increased endometrial thickness. Atrophy of the endometrium is more commonly seen with estrogen deficiency (e.g., postmenopause).\n\nOption D: Esophageal mucosa on repeated acid exposure (e.g., GERD) can undergo metaplasia, specifically intestinal metaplasia (Barrett esophagus), where the normal squamous epithelium is replaced by columnar epithelium. This is a change in cell type.\n\nOption E: Heart muscle subjected to long-standing hypertension undergoes HYPERTROPHY, characterized by an increase in cell size (not number), leading to an increase in the size of the heart muscle. This is an adaptation to increased workload, not atrophy.\n\nKey takeaway: Atrophy is a decrease in cell size and number. Hypertrophy is an increase in cell size. Hyperplasia is an increase in cell number. Metaplasia is a change in cell type. The patient's immobilized leg demonstrates atrophy due to disuse.",
    "zh": "患者的右腿因固定数周，直径减小。这种尺寸减小是由于萎缩所致，萎缩是一种细胞适应，其特征是细胞大小和数量减少，导致器官尺寸减小。在这种情况下，腿部的骨骼肌纤维由于体力劳动减少而萎缩。\n\n病理性萎缩可由多种原因引起，包括不使用（如患者的腿）、激素或神经刺激的丧失、循环障碍、机械压迫、衰老和营养不良。在细胞水平上，萎缩代表着通过减少细胞器数量和大小以及蛋白质合成来降低代谢需求的尝试，这可能导致蛋白质分解增加，在长期状态下，导致细胞凋亡和细胞数量的进一步减少。\n\n选项A：长期使用糖皮质激素期间，肾上腺会发生萎缩。糖皮质激素抑制促肾上腺皮质激素 (ACTH) 的释放，导致肾上腺皮质的刺激减少，并随之发生萎缩。这是萎缩的一个正确例子。\n\n选项B：长期暴露于烟草烟雾的支气管组织会发生化生，特别是鳞状化生，其中正常的柱状上皮被鳞状上皮取代。这是一种细胞类型的改变，而不是细胞大小或数量的减少。\n\n选项C：在雌激素替代治疗期间，子宫内膜组织通常会发生增生，其特征是细胞数量和/或大小的增加，从而导致子宫内膜厚度的增加。子宫内膜萎缩更常见于雌激素缺乏症（例如，绝经后）。\n\n选项D：反复酸暴露（例如，胃食管反流病 (GERD)）下的食管黏膜可发生化生，特别是肠化生（Barrett 食管），其中正常的鳞状上皮被柱状上皮取代。这是一种细胞类型的改变。\n\n选项E：长期高血压下的心肌会发生肥大，其特征是细胞大小（而非数量）的增加，导致心肌大小的增加。这是一种对工作量增加的适应，而不是萎缩。\n\n关键要点：萎缩是细胞大小和数量的减少。肥大是细胞大小的增加。增生是细胞数量的增加。化生是细胞类型的改变。患者的固定腿由于废用而表现出萎缩。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of cellular adaptations, specifically differentiating between atrophy, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and metaplasia. It requires applying the concept of disuse atrophy to other physiological and pathological conditions.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the cellular adaptation described in the vignette (atrophy due to disuse). Then, evaluate each option to determine which one also represents atrophy, considering the underlying causes and cellular mechanisms of each adaptation.",
