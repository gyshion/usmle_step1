    "en": "A 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to an hour of intense substernal chest burning accompanied by sweating. He has a history of obesity and diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. On initial evaluation, blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg and pulse is 60/min and regular. Oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient is comfortable lying flat and no heart murmurs are heard. Lungs are clear on auscultation. Immediate ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with a 2-mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Aspirin and morphine are administered. As the patient is about to be transported to the catheterization lab for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention, he develops dizziness and the telemetry monitor shows sinus bradycardia at 40/min. The patient appears pale and diaphoretic and peripheral pulses are faint. Blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF has an acute inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI), which most commonly occurs due to occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). The RCA usually supplies blood to the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, and most of the bundle of His; therefore, CONDUCTION IMPAIRMENT (eg, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block) is common in patients with inferior wall MI.\n\nSinus bradycardia is the most common arrhythmia in those with inferior wall MI (nearly 50% of patients); it occurs due to both nodal ischemia and ENHANCED VAGAL TONE triggered by infarction of myocardial tissue. The bradycardia is usually transient and resolves with restoration of coronary blood flow; however, patients with hypotension or symptoms of bradycardia (eg, lightheadedness, syncope) should be managed with INTRAVENOUS ATROPINE. The ANTICHOLINERGIC effects of atropine counteract the enhanced vagal tone to increase heart rate and improve symptoms.\n\n(Choice A) Adenosine hyperpolarizes the atrioventricular node to cause transient atrioventricular conduction delay. It is useful in the treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, but it is likely to worsen bradycardia.\n\n(Choice B) Alteplase is a fibrinolytic agent indicated for the acute management of patients with ST-elevation MI who cannot undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in a timely manner. PCI is associated with reduced mortality and a lower rate of complications (eg, cerebral hemorrhage) compared with fibrinolytic therapy and is the preferred intervention whenever possible.\n\n(Choice C) Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent that can be used for the management of ventricular arrhythmia (eg, ventricular tachycardia) in patients with acute MI. However, the drug causes negative chronotropy and is not used to treat bradyarrhythmias.\n\n(Choice E) Naloxone, an opioid-receptor antagonist, is used to reverse the effects of opioid overdose (eg, somnolence, respiratory and cardiac depression). Although morphine may cause bradycardia, this patient's bradycardia is more likely due to his inferior wall MI.\n\n(Choice F) Physostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that prolongs the effects of acetylcholine, is used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. Its effects essentially oppose those of atropine; it would worsen the bradycardia in this patient. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该患者II、III和aVF导联ST段抬高，患有急性下壁心肌梗死（MI），这最常见的原因是右冠状动脉（RCA）闭塞。RCA通常向窦房结、房室结和希氏束的大部分区域供血；因此，传导障碍（例如，窦性心动过缓、房室传导阻滞）在下壁心肌梗死患者中很常见。\n\n窦性心动过缓是下壁心肌梗死患者中最常见的心律失常（近50%的患者）；它发生的原因是结节缺血和心肌组织梗死引起的迷走神经张力增强。心动过缓通常是短暂的，随着冠状动脉血流的恢复而缓解；但是，有低血压或心动过缓症状（例如，头昏眼花、晕厥）的患者应使用静脉注射阿托品进行管理。阿托品的抗胆碱能作用抵消了增强的迷走神经张力，从而增加心率并改善症状。\n\n（选项A）腺苷使房室结超极化，导致短暂的房室传导延迟。它用于治疗阵发性室上性心动过速，但可能会加重心动过缓。\n\n（选项B）阿替普酶是一种溶栓剂，适用于无法及时进行经皮冠状动脉介入治疗（PCI）的ST段抬高型心肌梗死患者的急性治疗。与溶栓治疗相比，PCI与降低死亡率和并发症发生率（例如，脑出血）相关，并且只要有可能，PCI就是首选干预措施。\n\n（选项C）胺碘酮是一种III类抗心律失常药物，可用于治疗急性心肌梗死患者的室性心律失常（例如，室性心动过速）。然而，该药物会导致负性变时性，不用于治疗心动过缓性心律失常。\n\n（选项E）纳洛酮是一种阿片受体拮抗剂，用于逆转阿片类药物过量的影响（例如，嗜睡、呼吸和心脏抑制）。虽然吗啡可能导致心动过缓，但该患者的心动过缓更有可能是由于他的下壁心肌梗死。\n\n（选项F）毒扁豆碱是一种乙酰胆碱酯酶抑制剂，可延长乙酰胆碱的作用，用于治疗重症肌无力。它的作用本质上与阿托品相反；它会加重该患者的心动过缓。{{exhibit_1}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the management of bradycardia in the setting of acute inferior wall myocardial infarction. It assesses the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and appropriate interventions.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the signs of hemodynamic instability (hypotension, diaphoresis) due to bradycardia secondary to inferior wall MI. Atropine is the first-line treatment to counteract the increased vagal tone and improve heart rate and blood pressure.",
