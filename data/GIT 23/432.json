    "en": "A 65-year-old man is referred to a gastroenterology clinic by his primary care provider after he develops symptoms suspicious for colorectal cancer. The patient has a history of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He often eats steaks and hamburgers but avoids vegetables as \"they have no flavor.\" The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years and occasionally consumes alcohol. He undergoes a colonoscopy and is found to have a mass lesion in the ascending colon. The mass is biopsied, and the histopathologic findings are consistent with colon adenocarcinoma. This patient most likely initially presented with which of the following clinical symptoms?",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The location of colon adenocarcinoma can influence its clinical manifestations. Right-sided colon cancers usually grow as exophytic masses. Patients generally do not develop intestinal obstruction because the ascending colon has a larger caliber lumen than the descending colon and stool in the proximal colon is more liquid. Right-sided colon cancers typically present with features of IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA (eg, fatigue, pallor) due to occult blood loss. Nonspecific symptoms such as anorexia, malaise, and unintentional weight loss may also occur.\n\nEnvironmental and lifestyle factors that may have increased this patient's risk of colon cancer include obesity, cigarette smoking, consumption of red/processed meat, and low dietary intake of vegetables.\n\n(Choice A) Left-sided colon cancers tend to infiltrate the intestinal wall and encircle the lumen, causing a change in bowel habits (eg, constipation) and symptoms of intestinal obstruction (eg, abdominal pain, distension, nausea/vomiting).\n\n(Choice B) Constipation that alternates with diarrhea is characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n(Choice C) Recurrent grossly bloody stool associated with abdominal discomfort and low-grade fever is characteristic of ulcerative colitis, which is a risk factor for colon cancer. Rectosigmoid cancer often causes hematochezia, but fever is uncommon.\n\n(Choice D) Tenesmus (ineffectual/painful straining on defecation) and small-caliber stool are characteristic of rectal adenocarcinoma.\n\nEducational objective:\nRight-sided colon cancers usually grow as exophytic masses and present with occult bleeding and symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. Left-sided colon cancers tend to infiltrate the intestinal wall and encircle the lumen, causing constipation and symptoms of intestinal obstruction. Rectosigmoid involvement often causes hematochezia.",
    "zh": "结肠腺癌的位置会影响其临床表现。右侧结肠癌通常生长为外生性肿块。患者通常不会出现肠梗阻，因为升结肠的管腔直径大于降结肠，并且近端结肠中的粪便更稀。右侧结肠癌通常表现出铁缺乏性贫血（例如，疲劳、苍白）的特征，这是由于隐血丢失引起的。也可能出现非特异性症状，如厌食、不适和非意向性体重减轻。\n\n可能增加该患者结肠癌风险的环境和生活方式因素包括肥胖、吸烟、食用红肉/加工肉类和蔬菜摄入量低。\n\n（选项A）左侧结肠癌倾向于浸润肠壁并包围管腔，导致排便习惯改变（例如，便秘）和肠梗阻的症状（例如，腹痛、腹胀、恶心/呕吐）。\n\n（选项B）便秘与腹泻交替出现是肠易激综合征的特征。\n\n（选项C）反复出现肉眼可见的血便伴有腹部不适和低烧是溃疡性结肠炎的特征，溃疡性结肠炎是结肠癌的危险因素。直乙状结肠癌常引起便血，但发烧不常见。\n\n（选项D）里急后重（无效/排便时疼痛）和小口径粪便是直肠腺癌的特征。\n\n教育目标：\n右侧结肠癌通常生长为外生性肿块，并表现为隐血和铁缺乏性贫血的症状。左侧结肠癌倾向于浸润肠壁并包围管腔，导致便秘和肠梗阻的症状。直乙状结肠受累常引起便血。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the clinical presentation of right-sided colon cancer, specifically its association with iron deficiency anemia and nonspecific symptoms like weight loss and fatigue. It also requires differentiating it from left-sided colon cancer and other conditions with similar symptoms.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the location of the tumor (ascending colon) and its likely presentation. Remember that right-sided colon cancers often present with iron deficiency anemia due to occult bleeding, leading to symptoms like fatigue and weight loss, rather than obstructive symptoms.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对右侧结肠癌临床表现的了解，特别是其与缺铁性贫血以及体重减轻和疲劳等非特异性症状的关系。它还要求将其与左侧结肠癌和其他具有类似症状的疾病区分开来。\n\n要解决这个问题，重点关注肿瘤的位置（升结肠）及其可能的表现。记住，右侧结肠癌通常因隐血引起缺铁性贫血，导致疲劳和体重减轻等症状，而不是梗阻性症状。"
