    "en": "A 9-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department following a 3-minute generalized seizure. She has had a fever with a worsening headache for 3 days. The girl has no medical problems and is not taking any medications. She lives with her parents and pet cat and has traveled to Canada and {{exhibit_1}}. On physical examination, she is disoriented and has difficulty staying awake. Her speech is difficult to understand due to inappropriate word choice. She is admitted to the intensive care unit for further workup. The patient becomes unresponsive the following day and dies overnight. Autopsy reveals bilateral, hemorrhagic necrosis of the {{exhibit_2}} and {{exhibit_3}} temporal lobes. This patient's condition was most likely caused by infection with which of the following?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of encephalitis, including fever, headache, altered mental status (disorientation, difficulty staying awake, inappropriate word choice), and seizures. The autopsy findings of bilateral, hemorrhagic necrosis of the temporal lobes are highly characteristic of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) encephalitis. HSV-1 is the most common cause of fatal sporadic encephalitis and typically involves the temporal lobes. The explanation details how HSV-1 travels via the olfactory tract to the temporal lobe and can cause edema and hemorrhagic necrosis. The other options are less likely: Enteroviruses can cause meningitis and encephalitis but temporal lobe involvement is not typical. Naegleria fowleri causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis, which is rapidly fatal but usually acquired from freshwater and affects the olfactory bulb and frontal lobes primarily. Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae are common causes of bacterial meningitis, which primarily affects the meninges rather than causing parenchymal necrosis of the temporal lobes. Toxoplasma gondii can cause encephalitis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, but the presentation and autopsy findings are more classic for HSV encephalitis.",
    "zh": "患者出现提示脑炎的症状，包括发烧、头痛、精神状态改变（定向障碍、难以保持清醒、用词不当）和癫痫发作。尸检发现颞叶双侧出血性坏死，这高度提示单纯疱疹病毒(HSV)脑炎。HSV-1 是致命性散发性脑炎最常见的病因，通常累及颞叶。该解释详细说明了HSV-1如何通过嗅觉通路到达颞叶，并可引起水肿和出血性坏死。其他选项的可能性较小：肠道病毒可引起脑膜炎和脑炎，但颞叶受累并不典型。福氏耐格里阿米巴原虫引起原发性阿米巴脑膜脑炎，这种疾病进展迅速，但通常通过淡水获得，主要影响嗅球和额叶。脑膜炎奈瑟菌和肺炎链球菌是细菌性脑膜炎的常见病因，主要影响脑膜，而不是引起颞叶的实质性坏死。弓形虫可引起脑炎，尤其是在免疫功能低下的个体中，但其表现和尸检结果更符合 HSV 脑炎。"
