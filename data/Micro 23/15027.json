    "en": "A 70-year-old man is hospitalized due to abrupt-onset, severe left thigh pain with no preceding trauma. Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 24/min. Left thigh examination shows diffuse swelling with dusky skin discoloration and several bullae filled with hemorrhagic fluid. There is significant tenderness and crepitus on palpation. Gram staining of the bullae fluid reveals numerous gram-positive rods, and subsequent culture grows Clostridium septicum.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Clostridium septicum is a spore-forming, exotoxin-producing, gram-positive bacterium that is a normal commensal of the gastrointestinal tract in humans. Although the organism is largely nonpathogenic, breakdowns in the gastrointestinal mucosa can lead to invasion with subsequent hematogenous dissemination to healthy muscle tissue, resulting in SPONTANEOUS GAS GANGRENE (nontraumatic). Manifestations include rapid-onset muscle pain, fever, HEMORRHAGIC BULLAE with dusky surrounding skin, and tissue edema/crepitus. Urgent antibiotics and surgery are required, as the infection is often fatal even with early treatment.\n\nMost cases of spontaneous gas gangrene are triggered by an underlying COLONIC MALIGNANCY, which creates a portal of entry for the bacteria. Inflammatory bowel disease and immunosuppression are also risk factors. Unlike C septicum gas gangrene, C perfringens gas gangrene is usually associated with preceding trauma.\n\n(Choice B) Patients with hemochromatosis are at increased risk for fulminant Vibrio vulnificus infections (the organism is dependent on free iron for growth). Although V vulnificus can cause rapid-onset sepsis and bullous skin lesions, it is a gram-negative bacterium. In addition, most infections occur due to shellfish consumption or wound contamination with seawater.\n\n(Choice C) Indwelling vascular catheters increase the risk for candidemia, which can cause sepsis, abscesses, and pustular skin lesions on an erythematous base.\n\n(Choice D) Multiple myeloma impairs lymphocyte function and reduces the ability of plasma cells to generate normal immunoglobulin, which increases risk of infection. Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae and urinary infections due to Escherichia coli are most common.\n\n(Choice E) Recent antibiotic use increases the risk of C difficile infection, which usually presents with diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain.\n\nEducational objective:\nClostridium septicum is a spore-forming, exotoxin-producing, gram-positive organism that is the most common cause of spontaneous gas gangrene (eg, rapid-onset pain, hemorrhagic bullae, tissue crepitus). Underlying colonic malignancy is the greatest risk factor for infection.",
    "zh": "产气荚膜梭菌是一种形成孢子、产生外毒素的革兰阳性细菌，是人体胃肠道的正常共生菌。尽管该生物体在很大程度上无致病性，但胃肠粘膜的破坏会导致侵袭，随后血源性播散到健康的肌肉组织，导致自发性气性坏疽（非外伤性）。表现包括快速发作的肌肉疼痛、发热、周围皮肤发灰的出血性大疱和组织水肿/捻发音。需要紧急抗生素和手术，因为即使早期治疗，这种感染也常常是致命的。\n\n大多数自发性气性坏疽病例是由潜在的结肠恶性肿瘤引起的，结肠恶性肿瘤为细菌创造了一个进入途径。炎症性肠病和免疫抑制也是危险因素。与产气荚膜梭菌气性坏疽不同，产气荚膜梭菌气性坏疽通常与先前外伤有关。\n\n（选项B）血色病患者发生侵袭性创伤弧菌感染的风险增加（该生物体依赖于游离铁的生长）。尽管创伤弧菌可引起快速发作的败血症和大疱性皮肤病变，但它是一种革兰阴性细菌。此外，大多数感染是由于食用贝类或伤口被海水污染引起的。\n\n（选项C）留置血管导管会增加念珠菌血症的风险，这可导致脓毒症、脓肿和红斑基底上的脓疱性皮肤病变。\n\n（选项D）多发性骨髓瘤损害淋巴细胞功能，降低浆细胞产生正常免疫球蛋白的能力，从而增加感染风险。肺炎链球菌和流感嗜血杆菌引起的肺炎以及大肠杆菌引起的尿路感染是最常见的。\n\n（选项E）近期使用抗生素会增加艰难梭菌感染的风险，通常表现为腹泻、发热和腹痛。\n\n教学目标：\n产气荚膜梭菌是一种形成孢子、产生外毒素的革兰阳性生物，是自发性气性坏疽（例如，快速发作的疼痛、出血性大疱、组织捻发音）的最常见原因。潜在的结肠恶性肿瘤是感染的最大危险因素。"

It assesses the ability to recognize the clinical presentation of spontaneous gas gangrene and identify the most common predisposing factor.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the signs of spontaneous gas gangrene (rapid-onset pain, hemorrhagic bullae, crepitus) and recall that colonic malignancy is the most common underlying cause.
