    "en": "A 7-year-old boy is evaluated for fatigue. For the last year, he has been avoiding any significant outdoor activities with his peers due to poor energy and shortness of breath. He also describes occasional pounding in the chest. Physical examination shows a holosystolic murmur best heard at the lower sternal border. Echocardiography reveals apical displacement of the tricuspid valve leaflets, decreased right ventricular volume, and atrialization of the right ventricle. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation is also present. If this patient's diagnosis is due to a side effect of a drug taken during pregnancy, his biological mother most likely had which of the following conditions?",

    "en": "The patient presents with findings consistent with Ebstein's anomaly, including apical displacement of the tricuspid valve leaflets, decreased right ventricular volume, atrialization of the right ventricle, and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Ebstein's anomaly is a congenital heart defect that can be associated with maternal lithium use during pregnancy. Lithium is a mood stabilizer used to treat bipolar disorder. Therefore, the mother most likely had bipolar disorder and was treated with lithium during pregnancy.\n\n(Choice A) Alcohol use during pregnancy may result in fetal alcohol syndrome, which is characterized by dysmorphic facies, growth retardation, and central nervous system abnormalities. It is not typically associated with Ebstein's anomaly.\n\n(Choice C) Prenatal cocaine use increases the risk of preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion, fetal demise, and placental abruption. It is not directly linked to Ebstein's anomaly.\n\n(Choice D) Atrial and ventricular septal defects are the most common congenital cardiac anomalies in patients with Down syndrome. While cardiac defects can occur in Down syndrome, Ebstein's anomaly is not the characteristic finding.\n\n(Choice E) Seizures are not associated with major fetal malformations, but antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) significantly increase the risk of neural tube, renal, skeletal, and cleft palate abnormalities. Although AEDs also increase the risk of congenital heart defects, they are not specifically associated with Ebstein's anomaly.\n\n(Choice F) Gestational diabetes is associated with fetal macrosomia, caudal regression syndrome, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It does not cause Ebstein's anomaly.\n\n(Choice G) Untreated maternal hypothyroidism in pregnancy is associated with obstetric complications and cognitive impairment in offspring. It is not a cause of Ebstein's anomaly.\n\n(Choice H) Opioid use may cause neonatal withdrawal symptoms (irritability, diarrhea, vomiting) after delivery. Opioid dependence increases the risk of multiple obstetric complications but not major cardiac defects like Ebstein's anomaly.\n\n(Choice I) Schizophrenia and antipsychotics are not associated with the development of major fetal malformations, including Ebstein's anomaly.\n\nKey Pearls:\n* EBSTEIN'S ANOMALY is a congenital heart defect characterized by displacement of the tricuspid valve.\n* MATERNAL LITHIUM USE during pregnancy is a known teratogen associated with Ebstein's anomaly.\n* BIPOLAR DISORDER is commonly treated with lithium.",
    "zh": "患者表现出与 Ebstein 畸形一致的发现，包括三尖瓣叶片尖端移位、右心室容积减小、右心房化以及中度至重度三尖瓣反流。 Ebstein 畸形是一种先天性心脏缺陷，可能与孕期母亲使用锂有关。锂是一种用于治疗双相情感障碍的情绪稳定剂。因此，这位母亲很可能患有双相情感障碍，并在孕期接受了锂的治疗。\n\n（选项 A）孕期饮酒可能导致胎儿酒精综合征，其特征是面容畸形、生长迟缓和中枢神经系统异常。它通常与 Ebstein 畸形无关。\n\n（选项 C）产前可卡因使用会增加先兆子痫、自然流产、胎儿死亡和胎盘早剥的风险。它与 Ebstein 畸形没有直接联系。\n\n（选项 D）房室间隔缺损是唐氏综合征患者最常见的先天性心脏异常。虽然唐氏综合征可能发生心脏缺陷，但 Ebstein 畸形并非特征性表现。\n\n（选项 E）癫痫发作与主要的胎儿畸形无关，但抗癫痫药物 (AEDs) 会显著增加神经管、肾脏、骨骼和腭裂畸形的风险。虽然 AEDs 也会增加先天性心脏缺陷的风险，但它们并非专门与 Ebstein 畸形相关。\n\n（选项 F）妊娠期糖尿病与胎儿巨大儿、尾部退化综合征、低血糖、低钙血症和肥厚型心肌病有关。它不会导致 Ebstein 畸形。\n\n（选项 G）孕期未经治疗的母体甲状腺功能减退症与后代的产科并发症和认知障碍有关。它不是 Ebstein 畸形的原因。\n\n（选项 H）阿片类药物的使用可能会在分娩后引起新生儿戒断症状（烦躁、腹泻、呕吐）。阿片类药物依赖会增加多种产科并发症的风险，但不会增加 Ebstein 畸形等主要心脏缺陷的风险。\n\n（选项 I）精神分裂症和抗精神病药与主要胎儿畸形（包括 Ebstein 畸形）的发生无关。\n\n关键要点：\n* EBSTEIN 畸形是一种先天性心脏缺陷，其特征是三尖瓣移位。\n* 孕期母体使用锂是与 Ebstein 畸形相关的已知致畸剂。\n* 双相情感障碍通常用锂治疗。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of congenital heart defects and their association with maternal drug use during pregnancy. Specifically, it assesses the understanding of Ebstein's anomaly and its link to lithium exposure.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the physical and echocardiographic findings as indicative of Ebstein's anomaly. Then, recall or deduce the teratogenic effects of common medications used during pregnancy, identifying lithium as a cause of Ebstein's anomaly and linking it to the treatment of bipolar disorder.",
    "zh": "此题考察了先天性心脏缺陷及其与孕期母体用药的关系。具体来说，它评估了对 Ebstein 畸形的理解及其与锂暴露的联系。\n\n要解决这个问题，首先必须认识到体格检查和超声心动图的发现表明 Ebstein 畸形。然后，回忆或推断孕期常用药物的致畸作用，确定锂是 Ebstein 畸形的原因，并将其与双相情感障碍的治疗联系起来。"
