    "en": "A 65-year-old man is found dead at his home due to a suspected suicide. The family reports that the patient has been having difficulty swallowing, dyspnea on exertion, and arm and leg weakness for the past several months and had undergone a medical workup. They suspect the physician may have given bad news and the patient ended his life so he would not have to live with the diagnosed condition. External examination shows atrophy of the muscles of the right lower and left upper extremities. Autopsy would most likely reveal which of the following additional findings?",

    "en": "This patient with a history of bulbar symptoms (eg, difficulty swallowing) and limb weakness has postmortem evidence of asymmetric muscular atrophy. This presentation is concerning for AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS), a progressive, fatal NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE of both upper motor neurons (UMNs) and lower motor neurons (LMNs).\n\nALS has the highest incidence in patients age 60-75. The most common initial presentation includes ASYMMETRIC WEAKNESS of the extremities; bulbar symptoms are also common and can include dysphagia and dysarthria. Because any upper or lower motor neuron can be affected, the initial presentation may vary widely. UMN degeneration leads to spasticity and hyperreflexia; LMN degeneration leads to denervation ATROPHY of skeletal muscles.\n\nThe most concerning site of LMN degeneration involves the DIAPHRAGM because it results in DYSPNEA, as reported by this patient, and eventual RESPIRATORY FAILURE. Diaphragmatic function can be monitored with imaging studies (eg, ultrasound) and via testing of respiratory muscle strength (eg, sniff tests); postmortem studies typically demonstrate striking DIAPHRAGMATIC ATROPHY.\n\n(Choice A) Degeneration of dorsal spinal roots would lead to sensory dysfunction, not motor dysfunction, as seen in this patient. Sensory dysfunction is not a classic feature of ALS.\n\n(Choice C) Because ALS results primarily in neurodegeneration of motor neurons, atrophy is seen predominately in the motor cortex rather than diffusely throughout the brain.\n\n(Choice D) Inflammatory infiltrates in skeletal muscles are seen in inflammatory myopathies, including dermatomyositis and polymyositis. Long-standing disease can lead to muscle atrophy; however, ALS causes muscle atrophy due to denervation rather than inflammation.\n\n(Choice E) Plaques and gliosis in periventricular white matter are characteristic pathologic findings of MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. These inflammatory demyelinating lesions occur in the CNS; therefore, weakness is often associated with spasticity (UMN sign) rather than atrophy (LMN sign). In addition, it typically occurs in younger women (age <55).\n\nEducational objective:\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis causes degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons and can result in bulbar and skeletal muscle weakness. Denervation atrophy can affect the diaphragm and contribute to respiratory failure.",
    "zh": "这位有延髓症状（例如吞咽困难）和肢体无力病史的患者，尸检结果显示有不对称的肌肉萎缩。这种表现提示肌萎缩侧索硬化症（ALS），这是一种进行性、致命的神经退行性疾病，累及上运动神经元（UMN）和下运动神经元（LMN）。\n\nALS在60-75岁患者中的发病率最高。最常见的初始表现包括肢体不对称性无力；延髓症状也很常见，可包括吞咽困难和言语不清。由于任何上运动神经元或下运动神经元都可能受到影响，因此最初的表现可能差异很大。上运动神经元变性导致痉挛和反射亢进；下运动神经元变性导致骨骼肌失神经性萎缩。\n\n最令人担忧的LMN变性部位涉及膈肌，因为它会导致呼吸困难，正如这位患者所报告的那样，并最终导致呼吸衰竭。膈肌功能可以通过影像学检查（例如超声检查）和呼吸肌力量测试（例如嗅觉测试）来监测；尸检研究通常显示明显的膈肌萎缩。\n\n（选项A）脊髓背根变性会导致感觉功能障碍，而不是像该患者那样出现运动功能障碍。感觉功能障碍不是ALS的典型特征。\n\n（选项C）由于ALS主要导致运动神经元的神经退行性病变，萎缩主要发生在运动皮质，而不是弥漫性地遍及整个大脑。\n\n（选项D）骨骼肌炎性浸润见于炎性肌病，包括皮肌炎和多发性肌炎。长期疾病可导致肌肉萎缩；然而，ALS引起的肌肉萎缩是由于失神经支配而不是炎症。\n\n（选项E）室周白质斑块和神经胶质增生是多发性硬化的特征性病理表现。这些炎性脱髓鞘病变发生在CNS中；因此，无力通常与痉挛（UMN体征）相关，而不是萎缩（LMN体征）。此外，它通常发生在年轻女性（年龄<55岁）中。\n\n教育目标：\n肌萎缩侧索硬化症导致上、下运动神经元变性，并可导致延髓和骨骼肌无力。失神经支配性萎缩会影响膈肌，并导致呼吸衰竭。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology and autopsy findings associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). It requires correlating clinical symptoms of motor neuron degeneration with specific pathological changes that would be observed postmortem.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation of progressive weakness, bulbar symptoms, and muscle atrophy. Then, recall the characteristic pathological findings of ALS, particularly the involvement of lower motor neurons and its impact on respiratory muscles like the diaphragm.",
