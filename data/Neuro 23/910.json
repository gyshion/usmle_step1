    "en": "A 10-year-old boy whose family recently immigrated to the United States is brought to the physician with ataxia, myoclonus, and visual problems. His parents say that he began acting strangely and having difficulty with school work several months ago. After the appropriate workup, a brain biopsy is obtained and an RNA virus containing hemagglutinin is cultured from the tissue sample.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's presentation of ataxia, myoclonus, visual problems, and behavioral changes in a 10-year-old boy, coupled with the isolation of an RNA virus containing hemagglutinin from a brain biopsy, strongly suggests Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). SSPE is a rare, progressive, and fatal neurological complication of measles infection that typically occurs years after the initial measles illness, often in childhood or adolescence. The virus, a paramyxovirus, persists in the brain and leads to chronic inflammation, demyelination, and neuronal damage. The presence of hemagglutinin in the cultured virus is consistent with a measles virus infection.\n\n(Choice A) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a prion disease that causes rapidly progressive dementia. While it can present with neurological symptoms, it is not caused by a viral infection and typically affects older individuals. Brain biopsy in CJD shows spongiform degeneration.\n\n(Choice B) Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system, usually presenting with ascending weakness and areflexia following an infection. It does not typically cause the central nervous system symptoms described, nor is it associated with culturing a virus from the brain.\n\n(Choice C) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that usually manifests in young adults with relapsing-remitting neurological deficits. While it can cause visual and neurological problems, it is an autoimmune disease and not caused by a viral infection with the described characteristics.\n\n(Choice D) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus, typically occurring in immunocompromised individuals. While it causes progressive neurological deficits, the causative agent is a DNA virus (polyomavirus), not an RNA virus containing hemagglutinin, and it is less common in immunocompetent children.\n\n(Choice E) Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects gait, eye movements, and cognition, usually in older adults. It is a form of parkinsonism and is not caused by a viral infection.\n\nKey clinical pearls: SSPE is a LATE complication of MEASLES infection. The presence of OLIGOCLONAL BANDS of measles antibodies in CSF is characteristic. The virus has a MUTATED or absent matrix protein, preventing effective virion assembly but allowing intracellular replication. This leads to accumulation of viral nucleocapsids, causing neuronal damage and inflammation.",
    "zh": "患者表现出共济失调、肌阵挛、视力问题和10岁男孩的行为改变，再加上从脑活检中分离出一种含有血凝素的RNA病毒，强烈提示亚急性硬化性全脑炎（SSPE）。SSPE是麻疹感染的一种罕见的、进行性的、致命的神经系统并发症，通常发生在最初的麻疹疾病发生几年后，常在儿童或青少年时期。该病毒，一种副粘病毒，持续存在于大脑中，导致慢性炎症、脱髓鞘和神经元损伤。培养病毒中血凝素的存在与麻疹病毒感染一致。\n\n（选项A）克雅病（CJD）是一种朊病毒病，可导致快速进展的痴呆。虽然它可能表现出神经系统症状，但它不是由病毒感染引起的，并且通常影响老年人。CJD的脑活检显示海绵状变性。\n\n（选项B）格林-巴利综合征（GBS）是一种自身免疫性疾病，影响周围神经系统，通常表现为感染后出现进行性上升性无力症和反射消失。它通常不会引起所描述的中枢神经系统症状，也不与从脑中培养病毒有关。\n\n（选项C）多发性硬化症（MS）是一种中枢神经系统的脱髓鞘疾病，通常在年轻成人中表现为复发缓解的神经功能缺损。虽然它可以引起视觉和神经系统问题，但它是一种自身免疫性疾病，并非由具有所述特征的病毒感染引起。\n\n（选项D）进行性多灶性白质脑病（PML）是由JC病毒引起的脱髓鞘疾病，通常发生在免疫功能低下的人群中。虽然它会导致进行性神经功能缺损，但病原体是一种DNA病毒（多瘤病毒），而不是一种含有血凝素的RNA病毒，并且在免疫功能正常的儿童中不太常见。\n\n（选项E）进行性核上性麻痹（PSP）是一种神经退行性疾病，影响步态、眼球运动和认知功能，通常发生在老年人中。它是一种帕金森病，并非由病毒感染引起。\n\n关键临床要点：SSPE是麻疹感染的后期并发症。脑脊液中麻疹抗体的寡克隆条带的存在是其特征。该病毒具有突变的或缺失的基质蛋白，阻止有效的病毒粒子组装，但允许细胞内复制。这导致病毒核衣壳的积累，引起神经元损伤和炎症。"
