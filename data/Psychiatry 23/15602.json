    "en": "A 13-year-old boy is brought to the office by his parents after being involved in a fight with another student at school. His parents say, \"He has never gotten into fights before, and we are getting worried because his grades have been declining as well. He seems irritable and moody, stays in his room for hours at a time, and no longer invites friends home.\" When interviewed alone about the incident, the patient says, \"The wall people warned me that he was trying to poison my lunch.\" The patient has no significant medical history; there is a family history of bipolar disorder in a paternal aunt. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. Physical examination shows a postural tremor on extension of the arms and a broad-based gait. Mental status examination is significant for slurred speech, sad mood, and distractibility. Laboratory studies reveal elevated serum transaminases.",

    "en": "This patient's auditory hallucinations, mood and personality changes associated with neurologic features (slurred speech, tremor, gait instability), and abnormal liver function tests suggest a diagnosis of WILSON DISEASE. Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive condition marked by COPPER ACCUMULATION in the liver, brain, and cornea, which most commonly manifests in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood with hepatic involvement and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms.\n\nPsychiatric symptoms range from subtle personality changes to depression, mania, and/or psychosis. These symptoms may predate HEPATIC or NEUROLOGIC manifestations and be mistaken for normal adolescence or primary psychiatric illness. Evaluation includes a ceruloplasmin level, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and slit-lamp examination for copper deposition in the cornea (Kayser-Fleischer rings).\n\n(Choice A) Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) can present with psychiatric symptoms; however, these are episodic in nature and normally associated with abdominal pain and peripheral neuropathy. AIP commonly manifests in midlife rather than childhood.\n\n(Choice B) Heavy alcohol use can result in elevated transaminases and psychiatric symptoms, and acute intoxication can present with slurred speech and unsteady gait. However, acute intoxication would likely present with stupor or disinhibition, alcohol on the breath, and additional findings such as abnormal vital signs (eg, hypotension, tachycardia), or other metabolic abnormalities (eg, hypoglycemia, hyperlactatemia). Tremors would be expected in alcohol withdrawal, not intoxication.\n\n(Choices C and E) Although this patient has mood and psychotic symptoms, these primary psychiatric disorders would not explain his neurologic findings and abnormal liver function tests. Major depressive and bipolar disorders are not diagnosed when symptoms are attributable to another medical condition.\n\n(Choice D) In hemochromatosis, there is an abnormal buildup of iron, which particularly affects the liver, heart, and pancreas. It may present with abnormal liver function tests, diabetes, arthralgia, and/or cardiomegaly. Hemochromatosis tends to present in later life (eg, age ≥ 40). Neurologic findings and psychosis are uncommon.\n\n(Choice F) Prodromal schizophrenia often presents with personality changes and social withdrawal prior to the onset of overt psychosis. However, because primary psychotic disorders in children and adolescents are rare, a thorough workup of substance-induced and other etiologies is necessary. This patient's psychiatric symptoms are better explained as a manifestation of Wilson disease.",
    "zh": "该患者的幻听、与神经系统特征相关的精神状态和人格改变（言语不清、震颤、步态不稳）以及肝功能检查异常提示诊断为威尔逊病。 威尔逊病是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是铜在肝脏、大脑和角膜中积聚，最常见于儿童、青少年或成年早期，表现为肝脏受累和/或神经精神症状。\n\n精神症状的范围从微妙的人格改变到抑郁、躁狂和/或精神病。这些症状可能早于肝脏或神经系统表现，并可能被误认为是正常青春期或原发性精神疾病。评估包括血清铜蓝蛋白水平、24小时尿铜排泄量和裂隙灯检查，以检查角膜中铜的沉积（Kayser-Fleischer环）。\n\n（选项A）急性间歇性卟啉症（AIP）可表现为精神症状；然而，这些症状具有发作性，通常与腹痛和周围神经病变相关。 AIP通常在中年而非儿童时期发病。\n\n（选项B）大量饮酒可导致转氨酶升高和精神症状，急性中毒可表现为言语不清和步态不稳。 然而，急性中毒可能表现为昏迷或失抑制、口中酒精，以及其他发现，例如生命体征异常（例如，低血压、心动过速）或其他代谢异常（例如，低血糖症、高乳酸血症）。 震颤应该出现在戒酒期，而不是中毒期。\n\n（选项C和E）尽管该患者有情绪和精神病症状，但这些原发性精神疾病并不能解释他的神经系统发现和肝功能检查异常。当症状归因于另一种医学疾病时，不诊断重度抑郁症和双相情感障碍。\n\n（选项D）在血色病中，铁的异常堆积，尤其影响肝脏、心脏和胰腺。 它可能表现为肝功能检查异常、糖尿病、关节痛和/或心脏肥大。 血色病往往在晚年出现（例如，40岁以上）。 神经系统发现和精神病并不常见。\n\n（选项F）前驱期精神分裂症通常在明显精神病发作之前出现人格改变和社会退缩。 然而，由于儿童和青少年原发性精神疾病很少见，因此有必要对物质诱导和其他病因进行彻底检查。 该患者的精神症状可以更好地解释为威尔逊病的表现。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation, and its varied clinical manifestations including hepatic, neurologic, and psychiatric symptoms. It emphasizes the importance of considering organic causes for neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially in younger patients with abnormal liver function tests.\n\nTo solve this question, one must integrate the patient's age, presenting symptoms (psychiatric, neurologic, and hepatic), and family history. The constellation of symptoms, particularly the combination of psychiatric changes, tremor, gait disturbance, and elevated transaminases in a young patient, should prompt consideration of Wilson disease. Ruling out other differentials based on specific clinical features is also crucial.",
