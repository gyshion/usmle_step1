    "en": "A case-control study is an observational study design in which potential participants are initially identified as cases or controls according to their disease status (ie, have or do not have the disease of interest). {{exhibit_1}}\n\nIn the study described above, a cohort of adults newly diagnosed with hepatitis C (HCV) represents the cases, and a cohort of HCV-negative adults represents the controls. Note that \"cohort\" in this case refers to a group of individuals with similar characteristics (eg, HCV-positivity), not to a \"cohort study,\" in which a group of individuals are followed over time.\n\nOnce cases and controls are identified, the frequency of past exposure to ≥1 risk factors of interest is compared between cases and controls to estimate the association between the risk factors and the outcomes. Therefore, an appropriate measure for the proposed study would be any event that preceded HCV infection. Among the given choices, a history of past blood transfusions precedes HCV infection.\n\nBecause of the retrospective nature of a case-control study, this study design is not able to compare the frequency (ie, incidence, risk, rate) of any event that occurs after a disease has been diagnosed (ie, prospective outcomes). Prospective outcomes are reasonable in cohort studies and experimental designs (Choices A, C, D, and E).\n\nEducational objective:\nIn a case-control study, potential participants are initially identified as cases or controls according to their disease status. The frequency of past exposure to ≥1 risk factors of interest is then compared between the risk factors and the outcomes.",
    "zh": "病例对照研究是一种观察性研究设计，其中潜在的参与者最初根据其疾病状态（即，是否患有所关注的疾病）被确定为病例或对照。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n在上述研究中，一组新诊断为丙型肝炎（HCV）的成年人代表病例，而一组HCV阴性成年人代表对照。请注意，在这种情况下，“队列”指的是一组具有相似特征的个体（例如，HCV阳性），而不是“队列研究”，在队列研究中，一组个体被随时间跟踪。\n\n一旦确定了病例和对照，就会比较病例和对照中过去暴露于≥1个感兴趣的危险因素的频率，以评估危险因素与结果之间的关联。因此，对于拟议的研究，一个合适的指标将是任何发生在HCV感染之前的事件。在给定的选项中，既往输血史早于HCV感染。\n\n由于病例对照研究的回顾性，这种研究设计无法比较在疾病诊断后发生的任何事件的频率（即，发病率、风险、比率）（即，前瞻性结果）。前瞻性结果在队列研究和实验设计中是合理的（选项A、C、D和E）。\n\n教育目标：\n在病例对照研究中，潜在的参与者最初根据其疾病状态被确定为病例或对照。然后，将病例和对照中过去暴露于≥1个感兴趣的危险因素的频率进行比较。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of case-control study design and the appropriate measures of interest in such studies. It emphasizes the retrospective nature of case-control studies and the importance of identifying risk factors that precede the disease of interest.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that case-control studies investigate past exposures in individuals with and without a disease. The most appropriate measure of interest would be a factor that occurred before the diagnosis of hepatitis C, such as past blood transfusions.",
