    "en": "A 5-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents due to intense perianal itching, especially during the night. The patient is otherwise healthy and her development has been normal. Physical examination shows perianal excoriation. Cellulose adhesive tape is applied to the perianal area shortly after she wakes in the morning. Microscopic analysis of the tape reveals the presence of eggs that are asymmetrically flattened on one side.",

    "en": "United States and is frequently seen in children. The life cycle occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, and the adult worms typically live in the cecum and appendix. In contrast to other worms that release eggs into the intestine, the female worm migrates to the perianal area at night to deposit eggs. Larvae mature in the eggs within 6 hours, and the infective eggs can either be ingested by the same individual or spread to other humans. Eggs and worms in the perianal area cause an inflammatory reaction, resulting in perianal itching (pruritus ani). Scratching contaminates the hands and furthers transmission.\n\nDiagnosis is made by the CELLULOSE TAPE TEST (ie, microscopy of adhesive tape applied to the perianal region), which reveals oval eggs flattened on one side. Treatment options include albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate.\n\n(Choice B) Diethylcarbamazine is indicated for the treatment of Loa loa (loiasis) and Wuchereria bancrofti (lymphatic filariasis) infections.\n\n(Choice C) Ivermectin is used to treat infections caused by Strongyloides stercoralis (strongyloidiasis) and Onchocerca volvulus (onchocerciasis).\n\n(Choice D) Nifurtimox is used to treat diseases caused by trypanosomes, including Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease).\n\n(Choice E) Infections caused by Schistosoma (schistosomiasis), Clonorchis sinensis (clonorchiasis), and Paragonimus westermani (paragonimiasis) are treated with praziquantel.\n\nEducational objective:\nEnterobius vermicularis infection (enterobiasis) occurs most frequently in children and presents with perianal pruritus. Diagnosis is made by identifying eggs in the perianal region (cellulose tape test). Treatment options include albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate.",
    "zh": "在美国，它经常在儿童中出现。其生活周期发生在胃肠道内，成虫通常寄生于盲肠和阑尾。与其他将虫卵释放到肠道中的蠕虫不同，雌虫在夜间移行至肛周区域产卵。幼虫在卵内6小时内成熟，感染性虫卵可以被同一人摄入或传播给其他人。肛周区域的虫卵和蠕虫引起炎症反应，导致肛周瘙痒（肛门瘙痒）。抓挠会污染手部并促进传播。\n\n通过纤维素胶带测试（即，将胶带应用于肛周区域的显微镜检查）进行诊断，该测试显示一侧扁平的卵形虫卵。治疗选择包括阿苯达唑、甲苯咪唑和双羟萘酸嘧啶。\n\n（选项B）乙胺嗪适用于治疗罗阿罗虫病（loiasis）和班氏吴策线虫病（淋巴丝虫病）感染。\n\n（选项C）伊维菌素用于治疗由粪类圆线虫（粪类圆线虫病）和盘尾丝虫（盘尾丝虫病）引起的感染。\n\n（选项D）硝呋替莫用于治疗由锥虫引起的疾病，包括克氏锥虫（恰加斯病）。\n\n（选项E）由血吸虫（血吸虫病）、中华肝吸虫（肝吸虫病）和肺吸虫（肺吸虫病）引起的感染用吡喹酮治疗。\n\n教育目标：蛲虫感染（enterobiasis）最常发生在儿童中，并表现为肛周瘙痒。通过鉴定肛周区域的虫卵（纤维素胶带测试）进行诊断。治疗选择包括阿苯达唑、甲苯咪唑和双羟萘酸嘧啶。"
