  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis shows that both parents demonstrate 2 bands. Each parental band represents a homologous chromosome 21. The child has 3 bands, indicating that he has 3 different versions of chromosome 21 that he obtained from his parents. He received the lower band from the father and both of the upper bands from the mother. The fact that he received 2 different bands from the mother indicates that he inherited both of her homologous chromosomes. Therefore, the problem occurred in the mother during meiosis I, when homologous chromosomes are separated. In fact, the vast majority of Down syndrome cases arise due to nondisjunction during maternal meiosis I.",
    "zh": "限制性片段长度多态性 (RFLP) 分析显示，双亲均显示2条带。每条亲本带代表同源染色体21。该孩子有3条带，表明他有3个来自父母的不同版本的染色体21。他从父亲那里获得了较低的带，从母亲那里获得了较高的两条带。他从母亲那里获得2条不同带的事实表明他继承了母亲的全部同源染色体。因此，问题发生在母亲的减数分裂I期间，即同源染色体分离时。事实上，绝大多数唐氏综合征病例是由于母源性减数分裂I期间的不分离引起的。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "The question asks about the most likely meiotic event where nondisjunction occurred, based on RFLP analysis of a child with trisomy 21 and their parents. The correct answer is Maternal meiosis I, as the child inherited both homologous chromosomes from the mother, indicating a failure of separation during meiosis I.",
    "zh": "该问题基于对患有21-三体综合征的孩子及其父母的RFLP分析，询问了最有可能发生不分离的减数分裂事件。正确答案是母源性减数分裂I，因为该孩子从母亲那里继承了全部同源染色体，表明减数分裂I期间未能分离。"
