    "en": "A 43-year-old man comes to the office due to progressive memory loss and cognitive decline over the past several years. Medical history includes HIV infection diagnosed 11 years ago. Highly active antiretroviral therapy was prescribed, but he is nonadherent. The patient describes concerns with attention, concentration, and speech. In the past few months, he has become more apathetic and increasingly lethargic. More recently, he has had difficulty with balance and has fallen on multiple occasions. The patient has had headache, tremor, vision change, fever, nausea, vomiting, or urinary incontinence. His brother has a history of severe intellectual disability and epilepsy. The patient scores 18/30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination and appears emotionally blunted. He also has postural instability and difficulty performing fine motor tasks. Noncontrast CT scan of the head is shown in the exhibits (2 images) {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}. This patient's condition can best be characterized as which of the following?",

    "en": "This patient with a long history of inadequately treated HIV infection has memory impairment with evidence of subcortical dysfunction (eg, inattention, impaired psychomotor function and speed), which is characteristic of HIV-associated dementia. \n\nCT scan reveals dramatic enlargement of the ventricles (ie, ventriculomegaly) consistent with hydrocephalus. In addition, there is increased prominence of the sulci consistent with cortical atrophy. Therefore, the compensatory increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume is due to significant loss of neuronal volume rather than a CSF disorder (HYDROCEPHALUS EX VACUO).\n\nAny advanced neurodegenerative disease (eg, HIV-associated dementia, Alzheimer disease) or other condition that leads to neuronal loss (eg, trauma, stroke) can progress to hydrocephalus ex vacuo. Associated clinical manifestations are typically those associated with the primary cause of the neuronal loss rather than those specifically related to hydrocephalus.\n\n(Choices A and D) Many forms of hydrocephalus are due to an inappropriate increase in CSF volume. These forms of hydrocephalus can be classified by whether there is obstruction of flow within the ventricular system (communicating vs noncommunicating). Although this patient has no obstruction of flow within the ventricular system, the increased CSF volume is compensatory due to a decrease in neuronal volume, which is better characterized as hydrocephalus ex vacuo.\n\n(Choice C) Lissencephaly (agyria) is a congenital absence of gyri. This condition is typically accompanied by severe intellectual disability and seizures. On gross examination and imaging, the brain surface has a smooth appearance.\n\n(Choice E) Pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) refers to elevated intracranial pressure in the absence of ventricular enlargement on imaging. This disorder classically presents in young, obese women with headache, papilledema, and possible vision loss due to optic neuropathy.\n\n(Choice F) Transtentorial (uncal) herniation can occur due to an intracranial mass (eg, tumor, hemorrhage) or cerebral edema. The herniation may lead to compression of the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve (CN III) and posterior cerebral artery. A fixed, dilated pupil on the same side as the lesion is often the first sign of uncal herniation.\n\nEducational objective:\nHydrocephalus ex vacuo can occur due to neurodegenerative disease (eg, HIV infection) when significant neuronal loss leads to a compensatory increase in the volume of cerebrospinal fluid. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者有长期未充分治疗的HIV感染病史，有记忆力损害，并有皮质下功能障碍的证据（例如，注意力不集中，精神运动功能和速度受损），这是HIV相关性痴呆的特征。\n\nCT扫描显示脑室明显扩大（即，脑室扩大），与脑积水一致。此外，脑沟的突出也增加，与皮质萎缩一致。因此，代偿性脑脊液（CSF）容量增加是由于神经元体积的显著损失，而不是脑脊液疾病（真空性脑积水）。\n\n任何晚期神经退行性疾病（例如，HIV相关性痴呆，阿尔茨海默病）或其他导致神经元丢失的疾病（例如，外伤，中风）都可能进展为真空性脑积水。相关的临床表现通常与神经元丢失的根本原因相关，而不是与脑积水特别相关。\n\n（选项A和D）许多形式的脑积水是由于脑脊液体积不适当增加引起的。这些形式的脑积水可以通过脑室系统内是否存在流量阻塞来分类（交通性与非交通性）。尽管该患者的脑室系统内没有流量阻塞，但脑脊液体积的增加是代偿性的，是由于神经元体积减少，这更适合描述为真空性脑积水。\n\n（选项C）平脑症（无脑回）是先天性脑回缺失。这种情况通常伴有严重的智力障碍和癫痫发作。在肉眼检查和影像学检查中，脑表面呈现光滑的外观。\n\n（选项E）假性脑瘤（特发性颅内高压）是指在影像学上没有脑室扩大的情况下颅内压升高。这种疾病通常表现为年轻、肥胖的女性，伴有头痛、视乳头水肿，并可能因视神经病变而导致视力丧失。\n\n（选项F）幕上（钩回）疝可能由于颅内占位性病变（例如，肿瘤，出血）或脑水肿而发生。疝会导致同侧动眼神经（CN III）和大脑后动脉受压。病变同侧固定的、扩大的瞳孔通常是钩回疝的第一个征兆。\n\n教育目标：\n真空性脑积水可能由于神经退行性疾病（例如，HIV感染）而发生，当显着的神经元丢失导致脑脊液体积的代偿性增加时。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hydrocephalus ex vacuo, its association with neurodegenerative diseases like HIV-associated dementia, and the interpretation of CT scan findings. It also requires differentiating hydrocephalus ex vacuo from other types of hydrocephalus and conditions that can cause similar symptoms. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's history of HIV, cognitive decline, and CT scan findings of ventriculomegaly and cortical atrophy. Consider the underlying pathophysiology of hydrocephalus ex vacuo as a compensatory mechanism for neuronal loss, and rule out other causes of hydrocephalus based on the clinical presentation and imaging.",
