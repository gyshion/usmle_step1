    "en": "An 8-month-old previously healthy infant is brought to the urgent care clinic due to vomiting and watery diarrhea for the past 3 days. He attends a day care where recently several other children had similar symptoms. His mother states that the infant is less active and has no interest in feeding. Physical examination shows a listless infant with tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, and decreased skin turgor. The abdomen is nontender with hyperactive bowel sounds. Compared to pre-illness levels, which of the following sets of laboratory findings are most likely present in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient's history of vomiting and diarrhea and physical examination findings of tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, and decreased skin turgor are consistent with moderate to severe HYPOVOLEMIA. Vomiting and diarrhea cause gastrointestinal losses of both sodium and water from the extracellular space with a consequent decrease in plasma volume. Because red blood cells and proteins such as albumin are relatively large and trapped intravascularly, these blood components become concentrated, leading to increased hematocrit and increased serum albumin. Such hemoconcentration can be a clue to hypovolemia caused by salt and/or water depletion; however, it does not occur with hypovolemia due to acute blood loss because red blood cells and albumin are also depleted.\n\nIn the setting of hypovolemia, the kidneys respond by increasing sodium reabsorption to increase circulating blood volume. This increased sodium reabsorption occurs in both the distal renal tubule via increased aldosterone activity and the proximal renal tubule through poorly understood mechanisms. Uric acid absorption is closely tied and directly related to sodium absorption in the proximal renal tubule; therefore, there is typically increased serum uric acid in the setting of hypovolemia. Although uric acid levels are not typically collected in the management of hypovolemia, the relationship between hypovolemia and serum uric acid level has clinical application in that hypovolemia increases the risk of acute gout flares.\n\nEducational objective: Hypovolemia due to loss of sodium and/or water causes increased concentration of red blood cells (ie, hematocrit) and albumin as both of these blood components are trapped within the intravascular space. Hypovolemia also triggers increased absorption of uric acid in the proximal renal tubule, resulting in an increased serum uric acid level.",
    "zh": "该患者的呕吐和腹泻病史以及心动过速、黏膜干燥和皮肤张力降低的体格检查结果与中度至重度低血容量血症一致。呕吐和腹泻会导致细胞外空间中钠和水的胃肠道流失，从而导致血浆容量减少。由于红细胞和白蛋白等蛋白质相对较大并被困在血管内，这些血液成分会浓缩，导致血细胞比容升高和血清白蛋白升高。这种血液浓缩可能是由盐和/或水分耗竭引起的低血容量血症的线索；然而，由于急性失血导致的低血容量血症不会发生这种情况，因为红细胞和白蛋白也会耗竭。\n\n在低血容量血症的情况下，肾脏通过增加钠重吸收来增加循环血容量。这种增加的钠重吸收发生在远端肾小管中，通过增加醛固酮活性，并在近端肾小管中通过人们知之甚少的机制。尿酸吸收与近端肾小管中的钠吸收密切相关并直接相关；因此，在低血容量血症的情况下，血清尿酸通常会升高。尽管通常不在低血容量血症的管理中收集尿酸水平，但低血容量血症和血清尿酸水平之间的关系在临床上有应用，因为低血容量血症会增加急性痛风发作的风险。\n\n教育目标：由于钠和/或水分的流失而引起的低血容量血症会导致红细胞（即血细胞比容）和白蛋白的浓度增加，因为这两种血液成分都被困在血管内空间。低血容量血症还会触发近端肾小管中尿酸的吸收增加，导致血清尿酸水平升高。"

It assesses the understanding of hemoconcentration and the body's compensatory mechanisms in response to fluid loss.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the signs of hypovolemia and understand that vomiting and diarrhea lead to fluid loss, causing hemoconcentration and increased levels of hematocrit, albumin, and uric acid.",
