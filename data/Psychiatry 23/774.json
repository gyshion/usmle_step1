    "en": "A 67-year-old man comes to the hospital due to an acute worsening of chronic back pain associated with new-onset bilateral leg weakness and numbness. He has a history of colorectal cancer with vertebral metastases for which he has received colectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation treatment. The patient takes oral morphine sulfate for his back pain. Examination shows focal vertebral tenderness, along with reduced muscular strength, decreased sensitivity to light touch, and spasticity in both legs. Imaging studies reveal a vertebral compression fracture with cord compression. Surgical decompression is planned.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Opioids work by selectively binding to G protein-coupled opioid receptors, mimicking the actions of endogenous opioid peptides. However, long-term activation of mu-opioid receptors on nociception-transmitting neurons is associated with increased pain sensitivity (central sensitization) due to:\n\n* Increased turnover of inhibitory opioid receptors (receptor downregulation) and decoupling of receptors from their second messenger system (receptor uncoupling)\n* Upregulation of excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors\n\nThis manifests as an increasing dose requirement to provide the same level of pain relief (tolerance) and pain sensations triggered by benign stimuli (opioid-induced hyperalgesia). Opioid withdrawal can occur within 24-48 hours of acute cessation in opioid-tolerant patients and is characterized by nausea/vomiting, myalgias, dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and tachycardia.\n\nBUPRENORPHINE is a partial opioid agonist that has low intrinsic activity (efficacy) for opioid mu-receptors. However, it binds with high affinity (potency) and can prevent binding of other opioid medications. Therefore, buprenorphine acts as an opioid receptor antagonist in the presence of full opioid agonists and can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-tolerant patients with chronic pain.\n\n(Choices B, C, D, E, F, and G) These agents are full agonists of the opioid mu-receptor. Although they vary in potency, none have significant opioid receptor antagonist properties. Use of these drugs in equianalgesic doses should not cause withdrawal.\n\nEducational objective:\nBuprenorphine is a partial opioid receptor agonist that binds with high affinity but has low intrinsic activity. In patients on long-term opioid therapy, buprenorphine can displace other opioids and precipitate withdrawal.",
    "zh": "阿片类药物通过选择性结合G蛋白偶联的阿片类受体发挥作用，模拟内源性阿片肽的作用。然而，长时间激活伤害感受传递神经元上的μ-阿片受体与痛觉敏感性增加（中枢敏化）有关，这是由于：\n\n* 抑制性阿片受体的周转增加（受体下调）以及受体与其第二信使系统的解偶联（受体解偶联）\n* 兴奋性N-甲基-D-天冬氨酸（NMDA）受体上调\n\n这表现为需要增加剂量才能提供相同水平的镇痛（耐受性）以及由良性刺激引起的疼痛感觉（阿片类药物诱导的痛觉过敏）。在阿片类药物耐受患者中，阿片类药物戒断可在急性停药后24-48小时内发生，其特征是恶心/呕吐、肌痛、瞳孔扩大、出汗和心动过速。\n\n丁丙诺啡是一种部分阿片类激动剂，对μ-阿片受体具有较低的内在活性（效能）。然而，它以高亲和力（效价）结合，并且可以阻止其他阿片类药物的结合。因此，在存在完全阿片类激动剂的情况下，丁丙诺啡充当阿片类受体拮抗剂，并可导致慢性疼痛的阿片类药物耐受患者出现戒断症状。\n\n（选项B、C、D、E、F和G）这些药物是阿片μ-受体的完全激动剂。尽管它们的效价不同，但没有一种具有显着的阿片类受体拮抗特性。使用等效镇痛剂量的这些药物不应引起戒断症状。\n\n教育目标：\n丁丙诺啡是一种部分阿片类受体激动剂，它以高亲和力结合，但内在活性较低。在长期接受阿片类药物治疗的患者中，丁丙诺啡可以取代其他阿片类药物并引起戒断。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of opioid pharmacology, specifically the mechanism by which partial opioid agonists can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-tolerant patients. It requires knowledge of the difference between full and partial agonists and their clinical implications.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the patient's opioid tolerance status and then evaluate the pharmacological properties of each listed drug. Recognize that partial agonists, like buprenorphine, can act as antagonists in the presence of full agonists, leading to withdrawal symptoms.",
