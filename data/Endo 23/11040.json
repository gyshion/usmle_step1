For the past several months, he has been having difficulty starting and maintaining a urinary stream. In the last 3 weeks, he has had 2 episodes of nocturnal enuresis and multiple daytime episodes of uncontrolled voiding without any sensation of a full bladder. His other medical problems include chronic kidney disease and gastroparesis. He does not use tobacco or alcohol.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's findings suggest overflow incontinence, which is mainly due to impaired detrusor contractility or bladder outlet obstruction (eg, tumor obstructing the urethra). Patients usually develop involuntary and continuous urinary leakage when the bladder is full and often have incomplete emptying. This patient's overflow incontinence is most likely due to diabetic autonomic neuropathy affecting detrusor muscle innervation, which is common in type 1 diabetics.\n\nPatients initially have infrequent urination due to loss of autonomic afferent innervation and inability to sense a full bladder. Involvement of efferent fibers to the bladder subsequently causes incomplete emptying. Patients can develop recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and overflow incontinence with poor urinary stream and dribbling. Pelvic floor relaxation at night combined with a full bladder can lead to nocturnal enuresis. Postvoid residual (PVR) testing with ultrasound or catheterization can confirm inadequate bladder emptying.\n\n(Choice A) Enlarged prostate on rectal examination may indicate either benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer, which causes urge incontinence (bladder irritation from the enlarged prostate) or overflow incontinence (urethral obstruction). However, these conditions are commonly seen in older individuals (age >50-60).\n\n(Choice C) Loss of sensation in perineal area (saddle anesthesia) can indicate cauda equina syndrome, which is commonly due to epidural cord compression from a malignancy. Patients usually have urinary retention late in the course of the disease, usually associated with fecal incontinence.\n\n(Choices D and E) Cognitive impairment (mini-mental status examination score ≤22) is often seen in normal pressure hydrocephalus, and lower extremity hyperreflexia would suggest spinal cord disease. Both of these conditions can cause loss of central nervous system inhibition of detrusor contraction, leading to urge incontinence. Urge incontinence is characterized by a sudden desire to urinate. However, absence of other symptoms (eg, gait disturbance) in this patient makes these conditions less likely.\n\nEducational objective:\nDiabetic autonomic neuropathy is common in type 1 diabetics and can cause overflow incontinence due to inability to sense a full bladder and incomplete emptying. Postvoid residual (PVR) testing with ultrasound or catheterization can confirm inadequate bladder emptying.",
    "zh": "该患者的发现提示溢出性尿失禁，这主要归因于逼尿肌收缩功能受损或膀胱出口梗阻（例如，肿瘤阻塞尿道）。当膀胱充盈时，患者通常会出现不自主的、持续的尿液渗漏，并且经常出现排空不完全。该患者的溢出性尿失禁很可能是由于糖尿病自主神经病变影响逼尿肌神经支配，这在1型糖尿病患者中很常见。\n\n患者最初由于自主传入神经支配的丧失和无法感知膀胱充盈而出现排尿不频繁。随后，对膀胱的传出纤维受累导致排空不完全。患者可能会发生反复的尿路感染 (UTIs) 和溢出性尿失禁，伴有尿流差和滴尿。夜间盆底肌肉松弛加上膀胱充盈可导致夜间遗尿。使用超声或导尿管进行的排尿后残余尿量 (PVR) 测试可以确认膀胱排空不足。\n\n(选项 A) 直肠检查发现前列腺增大可能表明良性前列腺增生或前列腺癌，这会导致急迫性尿失禁（前列腺增大引起的膀胱刺激）或溢出性尿失禁（尿道梗阻）。然而，这些情况常见于老年人（年龄 >50-60岁）。\n\n(选项 C) 会阴区感觉丧失（马鞍区麻木）可能表明马尾综合征，这通常是由于恶性肿瘤引起的硬膜外脊髓压迫所致。患者通常在疾病晚期出现尿潴留，通常伴有粪便失禁。\n\n(选项 D 和 E) 认知障碍（简易精神状态量表评分≤22分）常出现在正常压力脑积水中，下肢反射亢进提示脊髓疾病。这两种情况都可导致中枢神经系统对逼尿肌收缩的抑制作用丧失，从而导致急迫性尿失禁。急迫性尿失禁的特点是突然想排尿。然而，该患者没有其他症状（例如，步态障碍），这使得这些情况不太可能。\n\n教育目标：\n糖尿病自主神经病变在1型糖尿病患者中很常见，可导致溢出性尿失禁，原因是无法感知膀胱充盈和排空不完全。使用超声或导尿管进行的排尿后残余尿量 (PVR) 测试可以确认膀胱排空不足。"

It assesses the ability to differentiate between various causes of urinary incontinence based on clinical presentation and physical exam findings.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's risk factors (diabetes) and symptoms (frequent involuntary urination, difficulty starting/maintaining stream, nocturnal enuresis, lack of sensation).
