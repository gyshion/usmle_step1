    "en": "A newborn boy is being evaluated in the nursery. The patient was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery. A cystic lesion is noted overlying the lumbosacral spine region. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Ultrasound imaging confirms a neural tube defect. The mother had no prenatal care, and further discussion reveals that she took a medication known to be teratogenic during pregnancy. Exposure to the medication most likely occurred during which of the following weeks of embryonic development?",

    "en": "The patient has a neural tube defect. Like other major congenital anomalies, neural tube defects develop during the embryonic stage of fetal development, or 3-8 weeks after fertilization (ie, weeks 5-10 of gestation). During this crucial time, the embryo is undergoing organogenesis, or rapid cell division and differentiation of all major organ systems, making it particularly susceptible to teratogens. The beginning of the embryonic stage is marked by gastrulation, which establishes 3 distinct cell layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. All tissues and organs are derived from these 3 layers. Structures formed by the end of the embryonic stage include the gastrointestinal tract and lungs (endoderm); the heart, kidneys, and spleen (mesoderm); and the skin and central nervous system (ectoderm). The central nervous system develops via neurulation during the third and fourth weeks. During neurulation, the neural plate forms from the ectoderm, and the lateral edges of the plate (neural folds) migrate toward the midline and fuse. Fusion begins in the cervical region and extends rostrally and caudally, forming the neural tube (precursor to the brain and spinal cord). The ends, or neuropores, close at the end of the fourth week. In this case, exposure to a teratogenic medication (eg, folic acid antagonist such as valproic acid) likely occurred during neurulation, interfering with caudal neural tube closure and causing a neural tube defect. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choices A and B) Fertilization is the process by which the male and female gametes form a zygote. The zygote transforms into a blastocyst, which implants in the uterine wall approximately 1 week after fertilization. Significant teratogenic exposure prior to gastrulation usually results in spontaneous abortion or no abnormalities, as the undamaged pluripotent cells can fully compensate if enough survive.\n\n(Choices D and E) The central nervous system matures throughout pregnancy and can be affected by teratogens beyond the first 8 weeks (eg, alcohol causing fetal alcohol syndrome). However, defects related to neural tube formation (neurulation) occur only during the early embryonic period.\n\nEducational objective:\nOrganogenesis occurs in the embryonic stage of development (3-8 weeks after fertilization), during which time the embryo is particularly susceptible to teratogens. Neurulation (neural tube formation) occurs during weeks 3 and 4, and abnormalities in this process result in neural tube defects.",
    "zh": "患者患有神经管缺陷。与其他主要的先天性异常一样，神经管缺陷发生在胎儿发育的胚胎期，即受精后3-8周（即妊娠第5-10周）。在这个关键时期，胚胎正在经历器官发生，即所有主要器官系统的快速细胞分裂和分化，这使得它特别容易受到致畸原的影响。胚胎期的开始以原肠胚形成开始，它建立了3个不同的细胞层：外胚层、中胚层和内胚层。所有组织和器官都源于这3层。胚胎期末形成的结构包括胃肠道和肺（内胚层）；心脏、肾脏和脾脏（中胚层）；以及皮肤和中枢神经系统（外胚层）。中枢神经系统在第三和第四周通过神经胚形成而发育。在神经胚形成过程中，神经板由外胚层形成，板的侧缘（神经褶）向中线移动并融合。融合始于颈部区域，并向前和向后延伸，形成神经管（大脑和脊髓的前体）。末端，即神经孔，在第四周末闭合。在这种情况下，接触致畸性药物（例如，叶酸拮抗剂，如丙戊酸）很可能发生在神经胚形成期间，干扰尾部神经管闭合并导致神经管缺陷。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n（选项A和B）受精是男性和女性配子形成合子的过程。合子转变为胚泡，在大约受精后1周植入子宫壁。在原肠胚形成之前，重要的致畸原暴露通常会导致自然流产或没有异常，因为未受损的多能细胞如果存活足够多，就可以完全代偿。\n\n（选项D和E）中枢神经系统在整个妊娠过程中不断成熟，并且可能受到超过前8周的致畸原的影响（例如，酒精导致胎儿酒精综合征）。然而，与神经管形成（神经胚形成）相关的缺陷仅发生在早期胚胎期。\n\n教育目标：\n器官发生发生在发育的胚胎期（受精后3-8周），在此期间，胚胎特别容易受到致畸原的影响。神经胚形成（神经管形成）发生在第3周和第4周，此过程中的异常会导致神经管缺陷。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of embryological development, specifically the timing of neurulation and the susceptibility of the developing embryo to teratogens during organogenesis. It requires understanding the critical period for neural tube closure and the impact of teratogenic exposure during this time.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that neural tube defects occur due to disruptions during neurulation, which takes place in the 3rd and 4th weeks of embryonic development. Therefore, exposure to teratogens during this period is most likely to cause such defects. Rule out options related to fertilization or later stages of pregnancy.",
