    "en": "A 24-year-old man is found unconscious in the basement of his house. His mother calls emergency responders and informs them that the patient has a history of substance abuse and was recently hospitalized for major depressive disorder. In the emergency department, the patient is found to be cyanotic and unresponsive to painful stimuli. Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 101/62 mm Hg, pulse is 61/min, and respirations are 4/min. His pupils are constricted and minimally responsive to light. Resuscitation efforts are initiated. The patient receives intravenous medication and regains consciousness 2 minutes later. The drug most likely used to treat this patient has the greatest affinity for which of the following receptors?",

    "en": "This patient's history of substance abuse, MIOSIS, PROFOUND SEDATION, and RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION with rapid reversal of signs/symptoms with antidotal therapy is consistent with an OPIOID OVERDOSE. Several opioid receptor subtypes, including mu, delta, and kappa, have been identified. Available opioid medications (eg, morphine, hydromorphone) produce therapeutic analgesic effects by binding to these receptors and modulating pain perception.\n\nNaloxone is a pure opioid receptor antagonist devoid of any agonist properties. Although it antagonizes opioid effects at all receptor types, it has the GREATEST AFFINITY for MU RECEPTORS (responsible for opioid-induced cardiorespiratory depression). Naloxone competes with opioid medications, displacing them from opioid receptors; it is therefore an ideal agent for REVERSING OPIOID INTOXICATION/OVERDOSE. Reversal effects can occur within minutes, and the duration is dose dependent (usually 1-4 hours). Naloxone must be given parenterally because it is metabolically inactivated by the liver when administered orally.\n\n(Choice A) Medications with an affinity for 5-HT (serotonin) receptors do not have a role in the treatment of opioid overdose. Cyproheptadine, a 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A antagonist, is an oral medication that can be used to treat serotonin syndrome. Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 antagonist that may be administered intravenously for nausea and vomiting.\n\n(Choices B and E) Delta and kappa are also opioid receptors that modulate pain. Although naloxone does bind to these receptors, it binds to mu opioid receptors with greatest affinity.\n\n(Choices C and D) GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and is the target of many drugs. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates work by binding to specific sites on GABA A receptors to facilitate inhibitory effects of GABA. Flumazenil is a GABA A benzodiazepine receptor antagonist used to reverse benzodiazepine intoxication. Baclofen is an agonist at the GABA B receptor that acts as a skeletal muscle relaxant. This patient's miosis and profound respiratory depression are more indicative of opioid overdose than benzodiazepine or baclofen intoxication.\n\n(Choice G) Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter that binds to NMDA receptors. Ketamine, a general anesthetic, is an example of an NMDA receptor antagonist. Naloxone does not have effects on NMDA receptors.\n\nEducational objective:\nNaloxone is a pure opioid receptor antagonist used to treat opioid intoxication or overdose. Although it binds to mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors, it has the greatest affinity for mu receptors (which mediate opioid-induced bradycardia and respiratory depression), making it an ideal agent for treating opioid intoxication.",
    "zh": "该患者的药物滥用史、MIOSIS（缩瞳）、严重镇静和呼吸抑制，以及使用解毒治疗迅速逆转体征/症状，与阿片类药物过量一致。已经确定了几种阿片受体亚型，包括μ、δ和κ。现有的阿片类药物（例如，吗啡、氢吗啡酮）通过与这些受体结合并调节疼痛感知，产生治疗性镇痛作用。\n\n纳洛酮是一种纯阿片受体拮抗剂，没有任何激动剂特性。尽管它拮抗所有受体类型的阿片类药物作用，但它对μ受体（负责阿片类药物引起的心肺抑制）的亲和力最大。纳洛酮与阿片类药物竞争，将它们从阿片受体中置换出来；因此，它是逆转阿片类药物中毒/过量的理想药物。逆转作用可在几分钟内发生，持续时间取决于剂量（通常为1-4小时）。纳洛酮必须通过肠外途径给药，因为它在口服给药时会被肝脏代谢失活。\n\n（选项A）对5-HT（血清素）受体有亲和力的药物在治疗阿片类药物过量中没有作用。赛庚啶是一种5-HT1A和5-HT2A拮抗剂，是一种可用于治疗血清素综合征的口服药物。昂丹司琼是一种5-HT3拮抗剂，可静脉注射用于治疗恶心和呕吐。\n\n（选项B和E）δ和κ也是调节疼痛的阿片受体。尽管纳洛酮确实与这些受体结合，但它对μ阿片受体的亲和力最大。\n\n（选项C和D）GABA是大脑中主要的抑制性神经递质，是许多药物的靶标。苯二氮卓类和巴比妥类药物通过与GABA A受体上的特定位点结合来促进GABA的抑制作用。氟马西尼是一种GABA A苯二氮卓类受体拮抗剂，用于逆转苯二氮卓类药物中毒。巴氯芬是一种GABA B受体激动剂，可作为骨骼肌松弛剂。该患者的缩瞳和严重呼吸抑制更表明阿片类药物过量，而不是苯二氮卓类或巴氯芬中毒。\n\n（选项G）谷氨酸是一种兴奋性神经递质，与NMDA受体结合。氯胺酮是一种全身麻醉剂，是NMDA受体拮抗剂的例子。纳洛酮对NMDA受体没有影响。\n\n教育目标：\n纳洛酮是一种纯阿片受体拮抗剂，用于治疗阿片类药物中毒或过量。尽管它与μ、κ和δ阿片受体结合，但它对μ受体（介导阿片类药物引起的心动过缓和呼吸抑制）的亲和力最大，这使其成为治疗阿片类药物中毒的理想药物。"
