    "en": "A 58-year-old woman comes to the office for a health checkup prior to starting volunteer work at a hospital. She has a history of hypothyroidism and takes levothyroxine. The patient feels well, and review of systems is negative. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Her examination findings are unremarkable. During a laboratory test, her white blood cells are incubated with mycobacterial antigens. Compared to the control, a large amount of interferon-gamma is detected in her blood sample {{exhibit_1}}. Which of the following cell types is most directly responsible for this finding?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) activates macrophages, increases major histocompatibility complex expression, and promotes T helper 1 lymphocyte (Th1) differentiation. It is produced primarily by activated T lymphocytes and natural killer cells and is critical for immunity against viral and intracellular bacterial infections. IFN-γ release assays (IGRAs) test for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) by measuring the response of T lymphocytes when exposed to antigens unique to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Similar to tuberculin skin tests (eg, purified protein derivative), IGRAs measure cell-mediated immunity.\n\nIGRAs have comparable sensitivity and specificity to tuberculin skin tests, but advantages include their lack of cross-reactivity to the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine and that a follow-up visit is not required. Neither skin tests nor IGRAs can be used to distinguish active tuberculosis from LTBI.\n\n(Choice A) B lymphocytes are the main cell type involved in the humoral immune system and the production of circulating antibodies.\n\n(Choice B) Antigen-presenting cells such as monocyte-derived macrophages interact with T cells to control the immune response but are not directly responsible for IFN-γ release.\n\n(Choice C) Neutrophils are involved in the phagocytosis of bacteria and other pathogens.",
    "zh": "干扰素-γ (IFN-γ) 激活巨噬细胞，增加主要组织相容性复合体表达，并促进T辅助1淋巴细胞 (Th1) 分化。它主要由活化的T淋巴细胞和自然杀伤细胞产生，对抵抗病毒和细胞内细菌感染至关重要。干扰素-γ释放试验 (IGRAs) 通过测量T淋巴细胞暴露于结核分枝杆菌特有的抗原时的反应来检测潜伏性结核感染 (LTBI)。与结核菌素皮肤试验（如纯化的蛋白衍生物）类似，IGRAs 测量细胞介导的免疫力。\n\nIGRAs 具有与结核菌素皮肤试验相当的敏感性和特异性，但其优点包括它们与卡介苗 (BCG) 疫苗没有交叉反应，并且不需要复诊。皮肤试验和 IGRAs 都不能用于区分活动性结核病和 LTBI。\n\n(选项 A) B 淋巴细胞是参与体液免疫系统和产生循环抗体的主要细胞类型。\n\n(选项 B) 抗原呈递细胞，如单核细胞衍生的巨噬细胞，与T细胞相互作用以控制免疫反应，但不能直接导致 IFN-γ 释放。\n\n(选项 C) 中性粒细胞参与细菌和其他病原体的吞噬。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of interferon-gamma production and the role of T lymphocytes in cell-mediated immunity, specifically in the context of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing. It also assesses knowledge of the differences between IGRAs and tuberculin skin tests.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that interferon-gamma is primarily produced by T lymphocytes in response to mycobacterial antigens. Understanding the mechanism of IGRAs and the role of different immune cells in the immune response is crucial.",
