    "en": "A 70-year-old man comes to the office due to abdominal pain that began 1 month ago. He has also experienced fatigue and weight loss. He has no chronic medical conditions and takes no daily medications. The patient worked in a factory that produced polyvinyl chloride for several decades and is now retired. Physical examination shows hepatomegaly. Imaging demonstrates a liver mass, which is subsequently resected. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor cells is positive for CD31 {{exhibit_1}}. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Hepatic angiosarcoma is a rare, aggressive vascular malignancy. It usually presents in older men (age >60) and is associated with carcinogen exposure. Implicated chemicals include vinyl chloride (eg, exposure during production of polyvinyl chloride, a widely used plastic), arsenic (eg, exposure to pesticides), and Thorotrast (formerly used radioactive contrast medium). Clinical manifestations can include abdominal pain, fatigue, weight loss, and hepatomegaly, as well as intraabdominal hemorrhage (caused by tumor rupture).\n\nAngiosarcomas are derived from endothelial cells. In the liver, they appear grossly as poorly circumscribed, hemorrhagic lesions. Microscopic examination typically shows vascular structures lined by atypical (eg, hyperchromatic, pleomorphic) cells that express CD31 (ie, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule [PECAM1]). PECAM1 is expressed on the surface of endothelial cells and functions in leukocyte migration through the endothelium.\n\n(Choice A) Hepatic cavernous hemangiomas are common benign vascular lesions. Microscopy shows a well-circumscribed proliferation of dilated vascular structures that are lined by endothelial cells lacking atypia. Although cavernous hemangiomas express CD31, patients are typically asymptomatic (eg, lesion incidentally found on imaging).\n\n(Choice B) Cholangiocarcinomas are rare, malignant tumors derived from bile duct epithelium. They may present with abdominal pain and weight loss, but CD31 expression would not be expected.\n\n(Choice D) Hepatoblastomas are malignant liver tumors derived from immature, multipotent cells. Most cases occur in children age <5.\n\n(Choice E) Hepatocellular adenomas are benign liver tumors derived from hepatocytes. Although clinical manifestations may include abdominal pain, they typically present in young women (ie, reproductive years) and are associated with oral contraceptives or anabolic steroid use.\n\n(Choice F) Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular neoplasm associated with human herpesvirus 8 that can involve the liver. Microscopy typically shows proliferation of spindle-shaped endothelial cells (ie, CD31 positive) with slit-like vascular spaces. However, it typically presents in immunocompromised patients (eg, those with AIDS) and often initially involves the skin (eg, purple papules on the lower extremities).\n\nEducational objective:\nHepatic angiosarcoma is an aggressive vascular malignancy associated with exposure to carcinogens (eg, vinyl chloride). The tumor cells express CD31 (ie, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule [PECAM1]), an endothelial cell marker important for leukocyte transmigration. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "肝血管肉瘤是一种罕见且具有侵袭性的血管恶性肿瘤。它通常发生于老年男性（年龄>60岁），并与致癌物暴露有关。涉及的化学物质包括氯乙烯（例如，在生产聚氯乙烯（一种广泛使用的塑料）期间的暴露）、砷（例如，接触杀虫剂）和钍（以前使用的放射性造影剂）。临床表现可包括腹痛、疲劳、体重减轻和肝肿大，以及腹腔内出血（由肿瘤破裂引起）。\n\n血管肉瘤来源于内皮细胞。在肝脏中，它们在肉眼下表现为边界不清的出血性病变。显微镜检查通常显示血管结构，其内衬有表达CD31的非典型（例如，过度染色、多形性）细胞（即血小板内皮细胞粘附分子[PECAM1]）。PECAM1在内皮细胞表面表达，并在白细胞穿过内皮细胞的过程中发挥作用。\n\n（选项A）肝海绵状血管瘤是常见的良性血管病变。显微镜显示扩张血管结构的增生，这些血管结构被缺乏非典型性的内皮细胞内衬。虽然海绵状血管瘤表达CD31，但患者通常无症状（例如，在影像学检查中偶然发现病变）。\n\n（选项B）胆管细胞癌是罕见的恶性肿瘤，来源于胆管上皮。它们可能表现为腹痛和体重减轻，但预计不会表达CD31。\n\n（选项D）肝母细胞瘤是来源于未成熟、多潜能细胞的恶性肝肿瘤。大多数病例发生在5岁以下的儿童中。\n\n（选项E）肝细胞腺瘤是来源于肝细胞的良性肝肿瘤。虽然临床表现可能包括腹痛，但它们通常发生于年轻女性（即生育年龄），并与口服避孕药或合成代谢类固醇的使用有关。\n\n（选项F）卡波西肉瘤是一种与人类疱疹病毒8相关的血管肿瘤，可累及肝脏。显微镜下通常显示梭形内皮细胞的增生（即，CD31阳性），并伴有狭缝状血管腔。然而，它通常发生于免疫功能低下的患者（例如，患有艾滋病的人），并且最初常累及皮肤（例如，下肢出现紫色丘疹）。\n\n教育目标：\n肝血管肉瘤是一种侵袭性血管恶性肿瘤，与接触致癌物（例如，氯乙烯）有关。肿瘤细胞表达CD31（即，血小板内皮细胞粘附分子[PECAM1]），这是一种重要的白细胞迁移的内皮细胞标志物。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hepatic angiosarcoma, its association with vinyl chloride exposure, and the significance of CD31 expression in tumor cells. It also requires differentiating it from other liver lesions based on clinical presentation and immunohistochemical findings.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's age, history of exposure to vinyl chloride, and the CD31 positivity.
