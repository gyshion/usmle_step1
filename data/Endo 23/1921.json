    "en": "This patient has fatigue, weakness, and weight loss associated with a suspicious lung mass. His hypertension, ecchymoses, and hyperpigmentation suggest paraneoplastic hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome) due to ectopic ACTH secretion. As with primary adrenal insufficiency, excess ACTH secretion leads to hyperpigmentation, likely due to co-secretion of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) (both ACTH and alpha-MSH are derived from pro-opiomelanocortin) and direct stimulation of the MC2R receptor on melanocytes by ACTH. Although patients with paraneoplastic hypercortisolism may have many of the typical metabolic features of cortisol excess (eg, hypertension, hyperglycemia, edema), weight loss is more common than classic Cushingoid central obesity.\n\nParaneoplastic hypercortisolism is most commonly associated with small cell lung cancer but can also be seen with other neuroendocrine tumors (eg, bronchial or pancreatic carcinoid). ACTH secreted by small cell lung cancer is not inhibited by high-dose exogenous corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), whereas pituitary ACTH secretion decreases via negative feedback.\n\n(Choice B) Cortisol is produced by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex, and autonomous cortisol production (ie, ACTH-independent hypercortisolism) is almost always due to a primary adrenal disorder (eg, adrenal adenoma). Regardless of the source, excess cortisol in a patient with intact hypothalamus-pituitary function suppresses ACTH and patients do not develop hyperpigmentation.\n\n(Choice C) Given this patient's large lung mass and associated weight loss (instead of weight gain and central fat deposition), paraneoplastic ACTH secretion is more likely than an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease).\n\n(Choice D) Metastasis to the hypothalamus would likely cause endocrine insufficiency resulting from a lack of trophic hormones to the anterior pituitary. Decreased production of corticotropin-releasing hormone would lead to central adrenal insufficiency, not hypercortisolism.\n\n(Choice E) The adrenal glands are a common site of metastasis. If significant destruction of the adrenal cortical tissue occurs bilaterally, adrenal insufficiency may result. A subsequent increase of ACTH may cause hyperpigmentation; however, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (eg, hypotension) would be expected, as opposed to the symptoms of cortisol excess seen in this patient.\n\nEducational objective: Paraneoplastic hypercortisolism, most commonly caused by small cell lung cancer, is due to ectopic ACTH secretion. Clinical features include hypertension, hyperglycemia, edema, and hyperpigmentation. Unlike nonparaneoplastic Cushing syndrome, central obesity is uncommon.",
    "zh": "该患者出现疲劳、乏力、体重下降，并伴有可疑的肺部肿块。他的高血压、瘀斑和色素沉着过度提示异位ACTH分泌引起的副肿瘤性皮质醇增多症（库欣综合征）。与原发性肾上腺功能不全一样，过多的ACTH分泌会导致色素沉着过度，这可能与α-促黑素细胞刺激素（α-MSH）的共同分泌有关（ACTH和α-MSH均来自阿片黑素皮质素原）以及ACTH直接刺激黑素细胞上的MC2R受体有关。尽管患有副肿瘤性皮质醇增多症的患者可能具有许多皮质醇过多的典型代谢特征（例如，高血压、高血糖、水肿），但体重减轻比经典的库欣样向心性肥胖更为常见。\n\n副肿瘤性皮质醇增多症最常见于小细胞肺癌，但也可见于其他神经内分泌肿瘤（例如，支气管或胰腺类癌）。小细胞肺癌分泌的ACTH不会被大剂量外源性皮质类固醇（例如，地塞米松）抑制，而垂体ACTH的分泌则通过负反馈减少。\n\n（选项B）皮质醇由肾上腺皮质的束状带产生，自主皮质醇产生（即，不依赖ACTH的皮质醇增多症）几乎总是由于原发性肾上腺疾病（例如，肾上腺腺瘤）引起。无论来源如何，在下丘脑-垂体功能完整的患者中，皮质醇过多会抑制ACTH，患者不会出现色素沉着过度。\n\n（选项C）鉴于该患者的肺部肿块较大，且伴有体重减轻（而不是体重增加和中心性脂肪沉积），副肿瘤性ACTH分泌比产生ACTH的垂体腺瘤（库欣病）更有可能。\n\n（选项D）转移到下丘脑可能会导致内分泌功能不全，原因是缺乏对垂体前叶的促激素。促肾上腺皮质激素释放激素的产生减少将导致中枢性肾上腺功能不全，而不是皮质醇增多症。\n\n（选项E）肾上腺是转移的常见部位。如果双侧肾上腺皮质组织发生显着破坏，则可能导致肾上腺功能不全。随后的ACTH增加可能导致色素沉着过度；然而，预计会出现肾上腺功能不全的症状（例如，低血压），而不是该患者所见的皮质醇过多的症状。\n\n教育目标：副肿瘤性皮质醇增多症，最常见由小细胞肺癌引起，是由于异位ACTH分泌。临床特征包括高血压、高血糖、水肿和色素沉着过度。与非副肿瘤性库欣综合征不同，中心性肥胖并不常见。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of paraneoplastic syndromes, specifically ectopic ACTH production leading to Cushing's syndrome, and its association with lung cancer. It also assesses the ability to differentiate between Cushing's syndrome caused by pituitary adenoma versus ectopic ACTH production. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome (hypertension, ecchymoses, hyperpigmentation) in the context of a lung mass and weight loss, which is more indicative of ectopic ACTH production rather than a pituitary adenoma. Understanding the pathophysiology of ACTH secretion and its effects on cortisol production and melanocyte stimulation is crucial.",
