    "en": "A 63-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to high fever, confusion, headache, watery diarrhea, and cough. The patient smokes 2 packs of cigarettes daily and has a history of chronic bronchitis. Temperature is 40.1 C (104.2 F), blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg, pulse is 91/min, and respirations are 28/min. Sputum Gram staining reveals numerous neutrophils but no bacteria. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current condition?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient likely has LEGIONELLA PNEUMOPHILA infection, a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Most cases present with high fever and fatigue followed by GASTROINTESTINAL (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), pulmonary (eg, cough, shortness of breath), and nonspecific (eg, headache, confusion) symptoms. Patients age >50 who SMOKE and have CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE are at greatest risk. Isolated cases are common, but outbreaks can occur when the pathogen contaminates MANMADE WATER RESERVOIRS (eg, hot tub, air cooling system, drinking water system).\n\nL. PNEUMOPHILA is a facultative intracellular organism that requires specialized media (eg, buffered charcoal yeast extract) to grow; although the pathogen is gram negative, it STAINS POORLY WITH GRAM STAIN due to a unique lipopolysaccharide in its outer membrane. Therefore, the diagnosis is most commonly confirmed based on positive PCR testing or positive urine LEGIONELLA antigen testing.\n\n(Choice A) Coccidioides immitis is a dimorphic fungus endemic to the deserts of the southwestern United States. Although most cases of C. immitis infection are asymptomatic, it can cause CAP. However, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, and confusion makes LEGIONELLA far more likely.\n\n(Choice B) Klebsiella pneumoniae is a gram-negative rod that causes nosocomial pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia. However, this organism can generally be visualized on sputum Gram stain and does not typically cause concurrent diarrhea.\n\n(Choice D) Mycobacterium kansasii is an atypical mycobacterium that causes an illness similar to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, diarrhea, confusion, and high fever are relatively uncommon.\n\n(Choice E) Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection causes tracheobronchitis or walking pneumonia. M. pneumoniae cannot be detected on Gram stain due to a lack of peptidoglycan in the cell wall. However, symptoms of infection are typically subacute and mild. The presence of high fever and confusion makes an alternate diagnosis far more likely.\n\nEducational objective:\nLegionella pneumophila infection is typically marked by high fever and fatigue followed by significant gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and constitutional symptoms. The organism is not well visualized on Gram stain and does not grow on traditional culture media; L. PNEUMOPHILA infection is primarily diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction or urine antigen testing.",
    "zh": "该患者可能患有嗜肺军团菌感染，这是社区获得性肺炎 (CAP) 的常见原因。大多数病例表现为高热和疲劳，随后出现胃肠道（例如，恶心、呕吐、腹泻）、肺部（例如，咳嗽、呼吸急促）和非特异性（例如，头痛、意识模糊）症状。年龄 >50 岁且吸烟并患有慢性肺病的患者风险最高。散发病例很常见，但当病原体污染人造水库（例如，热水浴缸、空气冷却系统、饮用水系统）时，可能会发生爆发。\n\n嗜肺军团菌是一种兼性细胞内生物，需要特殊培养基（例如，缓冲炭酵母提取物）才能生长；虽然该病原体是革兰氏阴性菌，但由于其外膜中的独特脂多糖，它在革兰氏染色中着色较差。因此，该诊断最常通过PCR检测阳性或尿液军团菌抗原检测阳性来确认。\n\n(选项 A) 粗球孢子菌是一种在美国西南部沙漠地区流行的二态真菌。虽然大多数粗球孢子菌感染病例无症状，但它可引起 CAP。然而，胃肠道症状、头痛和意识模糊的存在使嗜肺军团菌的可能性大得多。\n\n(选项 B) 肺炎克雷伯菌是一种革兰氏阴性杆菌，可引起医院获得性肺炎和吸入性肺炎。然而，这种生物通常可以在痰液革兰氏染色中被观察到，并且通常不会引起并发腹泻。\n\n(选项 D) 堪萨斯分枝杆菌是一种非典型分枝杆菌，可引起类似于结核分枝杆菌的疾病。然而，腹泻、意识模糊和高热相对不常见。\n\n(选项 E) 肺炎支原体感染引起气管支气管炎或非典型肺炎。由于细胞壁中缺乏肽聚糖，肺炎支原体无法通过革兰氏染色检测到。然而，感染症状通常为亚急性且轻微。高热和意识模糊的存在使另一种诊断的可能性更大。\n\n教育目标：\n嗜肺军团菌感染的典型特征是高热和疲劳，随后出现明显的胃肠道、肺部和全身症状。该生物在革兰氏染色中不易被观察到，并且不在传统培养基中生长；嗜肺军团菌感染主要通过聚合酶链反应或尿抗原检测进行诊断。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Legionella pneumophila pneumonia, including its clinical presentation, risk factors, and diagnostic methods. Key features include high fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, pulmonary symptoms, and a history of smoking or chronic lung disease.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's risk factors (smoking, chronic bronchitis), symptoms (high fever, confusion, diarrhea), and lab findings (neutrophils but no bacteria on Gram stain). This combination points towards Legionella, which stains poorly and is associated with water sources.",
