The patient has been doing well feeding with specialized bottle nipples and is gaining weight. As part of his multidisciplinary care, the parents are told that he will need to be monitored for ear infections and hearing loss. This is because the patient most likely has dysfunction of which of the following muscles?",

    "en": "This patient has a cleft lip and palate, which can lead to problems with feeding, speech, and orthognathic (ie, jaw) development. Children with cleft palate often have recurrent otitis media due to eustachian tube dysfunction. The muscles primarily responsible for opening the eustachian tube include the tensor veli palatini and the levator veli palatini.\n\nThe levator veli palatini arises from the petrous portion of the temporal bone and medial part of the eustachian tube. Its fibers insert into the superior portion of the palatine aponeurosis (soft palate) and interdigitate in the midline with the contralateral muscle fibers. It elevates the soft palate during swallowing to prevent food from refluxing into the nasopharynx; contraction also opens the eustachian tube. With cleft palate, levator veli palatini insertion is no longer stable, so contraction does not lead to force on the eustachian tube.\n\n(Choice A) The lateral pterygoid muscles depress the mandible (ie, open the jaw). They are not impacted in cleft lip or palate.\n\n(Choice C) The orbicularis oris encircles the mouth, acting as a sphincter to close the mouth and pucker the lips. In cleft lip, it does not form a complete circle, but inserts into the base of the nose on either side of the cleft; however, it does not impact the function of the eustachian tube.\n\n(Choice D) The stapedius muscle is innervated by the facial nerve (CN VII). It arises from the wall of the tympanic cavity and inserts on the neck of the stapes bone. It functions to stabilize the stapes. Contraction causes dampening of sound transmission in response to loud noises. It does not open the eustachian tube.\n\n(Choice E) The superior pharyngeal constrictor forms portions of the posterior and lateral oropharyngeal walls. Contraction propels food and liquid inferiorly into the esophagus during swallowing. Together with the levator veli palatini, it elevates the palate to seal the nasal cavity during swallowing. Although both functions are impaired in cleft palate, the superior pharyngeal constrictor does not play a direct role in opening the eustachian tube.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients with cleft palate are at increased risk of chronic or recurrent acute otitis media, partly because of dysfunction of the muscles (eg, levator veli palatini) that contract against the soft palate to open the eustachian tube. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有唇腭裂，这可能导致喂养、言语和正颌（即下颌）发育方面的问题。患有腭裂的儿童通常由于咽鼓管功能障碍而反复发生中耳炎。主要负责打开咽鼓管的肌肉包括腭帆张肌和腭帆提肌。\n\n腭帆提肌起自颞骨的岩部和咽鼓管的内侧部分。其纤维插入腭腱膜（软腭）的上部，并在中线与对侧肌纤维相互交织。它在吞咽时抬高软腭，以防止食物反流入鼻咽；收缩也可打开咽鼓管。对于腭裂，腭帆提肌的插入不再稳定，因此收缩不会对咽鼓管产生作用。\n\n(选项 A) 外侧翼状肌使下颌骨下降（即，张开下巴）。它们不受唇裂或腭裂的影响。\n\n(选项 C) 口轮匝肌围绕口腔，充当括约肌以闭合口腔并撅起嘴唇。在唇裂中，它没有形成一个完整的圆圈，而是插入裂隙两侧的鼻底；但是，它不影响咽鼓管的功能。\n\n(选项 D) 镫骨肌由面神经 (CN VII) 支配。它起自鼓室壁，插入镫骨颈。它的功能是稳定镫骨。收缩会导致对响亮噪音的响应，从而减弱声音的传输。它不会打开咽鼓管。\n\n(选项 E) 咽上缩肌构成后部和侧部口咽壁的一部分。收缩将食物和液体在吞咽时向下推入食管。它与腭帆提肌一起抬高腭，在吞咽时封闭鼻腔。尽管这两种功能在腭裂中均受损，但咽上缩肌并未在打开咽鼓管中发挥直接作用。\n\n教育目标：\n腭裂患者发生慢性或复发性急性中耳炎的风险增加，部分原因是由于对抗软腭以打开咽鼓管的肌肉（例如，腭帆提肌）的功能障碍。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the anatomy and function of the muscles involved in opening the eustachian tube, specifically the levator veli palatini, and how cleft palate can lead to dysfunction of this muscle, resulting in recurrent otitis media.\n\nTo solve this question, understand the relationship between cleft palate, eustachian tube dysfunction, and the muscles responsible for opening the eustachian tube.
