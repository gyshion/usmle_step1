    "en": "A 29-year-old woman comes to the office due to 2 weeks of severe, progressive joint pain in her hands, wrists, and ankles. The pain started in several fingers and spread over the course of a day to more joints. It is so severe that she is unable to perform daily activities, and ibuprofen provides only partial relief. The patient has no medical conditions but developed a high fever and diffuse rash on her trunk and extremities during a trip to Puerto Rico 2 weeks ago. Evaluation at a local medical facility was negative for malaria, and her fever and rash resolved spontaneously after a few days. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs and is in a monogamous relationship with her husband. Temperature is 37 C (99 F), blood pressure is 122/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 86/min. On physical examination, the patient has pink, moist oropharyngeal mucosa; no rash; clear lungs; normal heart sounds; and no abdominal organomegaly. Periarticular swelling and tenderness are noted in the wrists, ankles, and interphalangeal joints of her hands. Range of motion in these joints is decreased due to pain. Laboratory testing reveals lymphopenia.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient developed a transient febrile illness and rash while traveling in Puerto Rico and now has severe, persistent polyarthritis. The likely cause is CHIKUNGUNYA, an alphavirus infection transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Outbreaks are common in tropical and subtropical regions (eg, Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Indian and Pacific Ocean islands) during the rainy seasons; travelers may bring the illness home.\n\nManiestations generally begin a few days after transmission and include high fever; diffuse maculopapular rash; and severe, symmetric polyarticular arthralgia that begins in the small joints of the hands and feet and may move proximally. Transient lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia are common. Fever and rash usually abate within a few days, but many (>70%) patients have persistent arthralgia, polyarticular arthritis (particularly of the wrists, hands, or ankles), or tenosynovitis for weeks or months. Because Aedes mosquitoes also transmit the viruses that cause dengue, yellow fever, and Zika, coinfection can occur.\n\n(Choice A) Gout causes recurrent, acute joint inflammation due to monosodium urate crystal deposition. However, most cases are monoarticular and occur in lower extremity joints.\n\n(Choice B) Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are autoantibody disorders that cause symmetric, inflammatory polyarthritis. Patients generally develop morning stiffness followed by joint swelling in the fingers, wrists, and toes; this migrates in SLE and progresses to eventual joint destruction in RA. The presence of a febrile illness while traveling and persistent nonmigratory joint pain makes an infection like chikungunya more likely than an autoantibody-mediated inflammatory arthritis.\n\n(Choice C) Reactive arthritis is a rare condition that primarily follows a gastrointestinal (eg, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter) or genital (eg, Chlamydia) bacterial infection. Manifestations typically include an asymmetric oligoarthritis that often affects the knees. This patient's febrile illness while traveling and symmetric polyarthritis make chikungunya more likely.\n\n(Choice D) Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Initial symptoms usually include fever, malaise, and a spreading, annular rash (erythema migrans). Several months or years later, late manifestations such as monoarticular arthritis of the knee or asymmetric oligoarthritis can develop.\n\nEducational objective:\nChikungunya is an alphavirus transmitted by mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical areas. Initial manifestations include fever, diffuse rash, and severe polyarthralgia. Although fever and rash quickly resolve, many patients have chronic arthralgia, polyarthritis (eg, wrist, fingers, ankles), or tenosynovitis.",
    "zh": "患者在波多黎各旅行期间出现了短暂的发热性疾病和皮疹，现在患有严重的、持续性的多关节炎。最可能的原因是基孔肯雅病，这是一种由埃及伊蚊传播的甲病毒感染。在热带和亚热带地区（例如，加勒比海、非洲、亚洲、印度洋和太平洋岛屿）的雨季，疫情很常见；旅行者可能会将这种疾病带回家。\n\n症状通常在感染后几天开始，包括高热、弥漫性斑丘疹和严重的、对称性多关节痛，多关节痛从手和脚的小关节开始，并可能向近端移动。短暂的淋巴细胞减少和血小板减少很常见。发热和皮疹通常在几天内消退，但许多（>70%）患者会持续数周或数月出现关节痛、多关节炎（尤其是腕关节、手或踝关节）或腱鞘炎。由于埃及伊蚊还传播引起登革热、黄热病和寨卡病毒的病毒，因此可能发生混合感染。\n\n（选项A）痛风是由尿酸单钠晶体沉积引起的复发性急性关节炎症。然而，大多数病例为单关节炎，并发生在下肢关节。\n\n（选项B）类风湿性关节炎（RA）和系统性红斑狼疮（SLE）是自身抗体疾病，可引起对称性炎症性多关节炎。患者通常会发展晨僵，随后手指、手腕和脚趾出现关节肿胀；这种肿胀会在SLE中迁移，并在RA中进展为最终的关节破坏。旅行期间出现发热性疾病和持续的非迁移性关节疼痛，使得基孔肯雅病等感染比自身抗体介导的炎症性关节炎更有可能。\n\n（选项C）反应性关节炎是一种罕见疾病，主要继发于胃肠道（例如，沙门氏菌、志贺氏菌、弯曲杆菌）或生殖道（例如，衣原体）细菌感染。表现通常包括非对称性少关节炎，常影响膝关节。该患者旅行期间出现发热性疾病和对称性多关节炎，使得基孔肯雅病更有可能。\n\n（选项D）莱姆病由疏螺旋体伯氏疏螺旋体引起。最初的症状通常包括发热、不适和播散性、环状皮疹（游走性红斑）。数月或数年后，可能出现晚期表现，如膝关节的单关节炎或非对称性少关节炎。\n\n教育目标：\n基孔肯雅病是由热带和亚热带地区蚊子传播的甲病毒。最初的表现包括发热、弥漫性皮疹和严重的多关节痛。虽然发热和皮疹很快消退，但许多患者会出现慢性关节痛、多关节炎（例如，腕关节、手指、踝关节）或腱鞘炎。"
