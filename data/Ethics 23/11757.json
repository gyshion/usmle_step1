    "en": "An 82-year-old woman is hospitalized in a busy tertiary care hospital due to fever and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She is diagnosed with pneumonia and started on empiric antibiotic therapy overnight by the admitting physician. After several days of treatment, the patient's condition deteriorates, and she is transferred to the intensive care unit. Sputum cultures were obtained on admission, but the results were not checked by the daytime team, resulting in a delay in initiating more specific antibiotic treatment.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "In the hospital setting, multiple providers will assume responsibility for a patient's care at different times of the day, which can result in discontinuity of care. As a result, patients are at higher risk of adverse outcomes when providers do not communicate well during transitions. The process of transferring responsibility for medical care is referred to as a patient handoff, with \"sign-out\" referring to the process of transmitting information about the patient and needed follow-up care. Oversights and COMMUNICATION FAILURES during the sign-out and handoff process have been linked to ADVERSE EVENTS in a range of hospital settings. Omission of key information during handoffs can result in medication errors, avoidable escalations in care (eg, transfer to the intensive care unit), redundancies in care, and delays in diagnosis or treatment.\n\nSTANDARDIZED HANDOFFS that include specified key elements (eg, a systematic procedure for sign-out, checklists of tasks that need to be completed) have been shown to significantly REDUCE PREVENTABLE ADVERSE EVENTS.\n\n(Choices A and B) Reducing patient caseloads and increasing the frequency of team meetings to discuss critically ill patients can both provide more time for physicians to communicate patient care information. However, these interventions would not ensure that critical information is transmitted consistently between providers.\n\n(Choice C) Consulting an infectious disease specialist would help ensure correct ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT and could be appropriate in this patient depending on the clinical scenario and/or culture results. However, this intervention is not cost-effective for every patient and therefore would not be the most effective intervention.\n\n(Choice D) Requiring more detailed sign-out notes provides more information on each patient but decreases efficiency and increases the probability that important details will be overlooked. Applying a systematic organization method to sign-out notes is a more effective strategy to ensure that essential tasks are not neglected.",
    "zh": "在医院环境中，多个医护人员将在一天中的不同时间承担患者护理的责任，这可能导致护理的中断。因此，当医护人员在交接期间沟通不畅时，患者发生不良后果的风险会更高。转移医疗护理责任的过程被称为患者交接，其中“交班”指的是传递有关患者和所需后续护理的信息的过程。在交班和交接过程中，疏忽和沟通失败与一系列医院环境中的不良事件有关。交接过程中关键信息的遗漏可能导致用药错误、可避免的护理升级（例如，转入重症监护病房）、护理的冗余以及诊断或治疗的延迟。\n\n包含特定关键要素（例如，交班的系统程序、需要完成的任务清单）的标准化交接已被证明可显著减少可预防的不良事件。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）减少患者负荷量和增加团队会议的频率以讨论危重患者，两者都可以为医生提供更多的时间来沟通患者护理信息。然而，这些干预措施并不能确保关键信息在医护人员之间保持一致地传递。\n\n（选项 C）咨询感染性疾病专家将有助于确保正确的抗生素治疗，并且可能适用于该患者，具体取决于临床情况和/或培养结果。然而，这种干预措施并非对每位患者都具有成本效益，因此它不是最有效的干预措施。\n\n（选项 D）要求更详细的交班记录提供了有关每位患者的更多信息，但降低了效率并增加了重要细节被忽略的可能性。在交班记录中应用系统的组织方法是确保不忽视基本任务的更有效策略。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of strategies to prevent medical errors, specifically focusing on the importance of effective communication during patient handoffs. It assesses understanding of how standardized handoff procedures can reduce adverse events in hospital settings.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the intervention that directly addresses the communication breakdown described in the scenario. Standardized handoffs are designed to ensure consistent and complete information transfer, making them the most effective solution.",
