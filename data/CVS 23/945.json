She also has trouble breathing at night and sleeps with 2 or 3 pillows to prop her up. She has had occasional palpitations but no chest pain. The patient takes no medications on a regular basis, and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. After initial evaluation, she is scheduled for a left heart catheterization, the findings of which are shown below {{exhibit_1}}.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "In mitral regurgitation (MR), an incompetent mitral valve allows backflow of blood from the left ventricle during ventricular systole, leading to markedly elevated left atrial pressure during this time. This creates an early and large V wave, the characteristic pressure tracing finding in patients with MR {{exhibit_2}}. \n\nThe elevated left atrial pressure in MR leads to atrial dilation and often precipitates atrial fibrillation, symptomatically manifesting with palpitations. Over time, decompensated heart failure, evidenced by dyspnea and orthopnea in this patient, can also occur.\n\n(Choice A) In aortic regurgitation, backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole results in rapid loss of aortic pressure and elevated LV end-diastolic volume with a compensatory increase in LV stroke volume. Pressure tracings show loss of the diastolic dicrotic notch (normally seen around aortic valve closure), rapid decline of aortic pressure during diastole, and elevated peak LV and aortic systolic pressures. There is also early closure of the mitral valve due to elevated LV diastolic pressure.\n\n(Choice B) Aortic stenosis causes obstruction of LV outflow resulting in discordance of LV and aortic systolic pressure. Pressure tracings characteristically show peak LV systolic pressure significantly higher than aortic systolic pressure.\n\n(Choice D) Mitral stenosis causes elevated left atrial pressures throughout the cardiac cycle with peak atrial pressure occurring at the time of atrial kick, just before the mitral valve closes at the end of ventricular diastole.\n\n(Choice E) Tricuspid regurgitation causes an early and large V wave on right atrial pressure tracing, similar to that seen on left atrial pressure tracing in the setting of MR. Left-sided pressure tracings (left atrial, left ventricular, aortic) are minimally affected in tricuspid regurgitation.\n\nEducational objective:\nLeft ventricular systole corresponds to the time of passive filling of the left atrium (atrial diastole). Mitral valve regurgitation leads to markedly elevated left atrial pressure during this period, creating the characteristic early and large V wave on left atrial pressure tracing {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}.",
    "zh": "在二尖瓣关闭不全 (MR) 中，功能不全的二尖瓣允许血液在心室收缩期间从左心室回流，导致此时左心房压力显著升高。这会产生早期且大的 V 波，这是 MR 患者的特征性压力描记图发现 {{exhibit_2}}。\n\nMR 中升高的左心房压力导致心房扩张，并经常诱发心房颤动，表现为心悸。随着时间的推移，也可能发生失代偿性心力衰竭，患者出现呼吸困难和端坐呼吸。\n\n(选项A) 在主动脉瓣关闭不全中，舒张期血液从主动脉回流到左心室会导致主动脉压力迅速降低，左心室舒张末期容积升高，并伴有左心室搏动量代偿性增加。压力描记图显示舒张期重搏切迹消失（通常出现在主动脉瓣关闭附近），舒张期主动脉压力迅速下降，左心室和主动脉收缩压峰值升高。由于左心室舒张压升高，二尖瓣也会提前关闭。\n\n(选项 B) 主动脉瓣狭窄导致左心室流出道梗阻，导致左心室和主动脉收缩压不一致。压力描记图的特征是左心室收缩压峰值明显高于主动脉收缩压。\n\n(选项 D) 二尖瓣狭窄导致整个心脏周期内左心房压力升高，心房压力峰值出现在心房收缩期，即二尖瓣在心室舒张末期关闭之前。\n\n(选项 E) 三尖瓣关闭不全会导致右心房压力描记图上出现早期且大的 V 波，这与在 MR 背景下左心房压力描记图上观察到的相似。左侧压力描记图（左心房、左心室、主动脉）受三尖瓣关闭不全的影响很小。\n\n教育目标：\n左心室收缩对应于左心房的被动充盈期（心房舒张期）。二尖瓣关闭不全导致此期间左心房压力显着升高，从而在左心房压力描记图上产生特征性的早期且大的 V 波 {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of mitral regurgitation and its hemodynamic effects, specifically the characteristic V wave seen on left heart catheterization. It also requires differentiating mitral regurgitation from other valvular heart diseases based on pressure tracings.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the symptoms of heart failure (dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations) and correlate them with the pressure tracing showing an elevated V wave.
