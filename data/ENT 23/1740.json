    "en": "Development of the face {{exhibit_1}}\nstructures: frontonasal prominence, paired maxillary prominences, and paired mandibular prominences. Upper lip development involves the following steps:\n\n*   The frontonasal prominence (overlies the forebrain) gives rise to the lateral and medial nasal prominences.\n*   The medial nasal prominences fuse and give rise to a midline structure, the intermaxillary segment.\n*   The intermaxillary segment fuses with the left and right maxillary prominences beneath the nose to form the upper lip. Failed fusion on either side leads to a unilateral cleft lip, as seen in this patient; failed fusion of both sides creates a bilateral cleft lip.\n\nAlthough cleft lip can occur in isolation, as in this child, the presence of a cleft lip increases the risk for cleft palate. For example, fusion of the intermaxillary segment and maxillary prominences also contributes to the development of the anterior portion of the hard palate (primary palate), and an anterior cleft palate may be an associated finding in some patients. A cleft palate can also develop from failed fusion of the palatine shelves, which are thin sheets of tissue derived from the maxillary prominences that grow medially, fuse, and form the posterior (secondary) palate (Choice C).\n\n(Choice A) Failed fusion of the medial nasal prominences to form the intermaxillary segment is associated with severe midline defects, such as holoprosencephaly.\n\n(Choice D) The orbits normally arise from the sides of the face and rotate medially. Hyperplasia of the frontonasal prominence can result in hypertelorism (wide-set eyes), in addition to a broad forehead and wide nasal bridge.\n\n(Choice E) Hypoplasia of the mandibular prominence causes micrognathia. In Pierre Robin sequence, severe micrognathia results in posterior displacement of the tongue, which can prevent fusion of the palatine shelves due to mechanical obstruction, causing cleft palate. Mandibular hypoplasia does not contribute to cleft lip development.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nCleft lip occurs due to failed fusion of the left or right maxillary prominence with the intermaxillary segment in early gestation. Cleft palate occurs primarily when the palatine shelves fail to fuse. Cleft lip and palate can occur together or in isolation. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "面部 {{exhibit_1}} 结构的发育：额鼻突、成对的上颌突和成对的下颌突。 上唇的发育包括以下步骤：\n\n*   额鼻突（位于前脑上方）产生侧鼻突和内侧鼻突。\n*   内侧鼻突融合并产生一条中线结构，即颌间段。\n*   颌间段与鼻子下方的左、右上颌突融合形成上唇。任何一侧融合失败都会导致单侧唇裂，如该患者所示；两侧融合失败会产生双侧唇裂。\n\n虽然唇裂可能单独发生，如该儿童所示，但唇裂的存在会增加腭裂的风险。 例如，颌间段和上颌突的融合也有助于硬腭前部（初级腭）的发育，并且前腭裂可能是某些患者的相关发现。 腭裂也可能由腭板融合失败引起，腭板是源自上颌突的薄层组织，向内侧生长、融合并形成后（次级）腭（选项 C）。\n\n（选项 A）内侧鼻突融合失败形成颌间段与严重的身体中线缺陷相关，例如前脑无脑症。\n\n（选项 D）眼眶通常从面部的侧面出现并向内侧旋转。 额鼻突增生可导致眼距过宽（眼距过宽），此外还有宽额头和宽鼻梁。\n\n（选项 E）下颌突发育不全会导致小颌症。 在 Pierre Robin 序列中，严重的小颌症会导致舌后移，这会由于机械性阻塞而阻止腭板融合，从而导致腭裂。 下颌发育不全对唇裂的发育没有贡献。\n\n教育目标：\n\n唇裂是由于妊娠早期左侧或右侧上颌突与颌间段融合失败引起的。 腭裂主要发生在腭板融合失败时。 唇裂和腭裂可以同时发生或单独发生。 {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

It requires understanding the structures derived from each prominence and the consequences of their failed fusion. \n\nThe best approach is to recall the steps of facial development and the specific structures involved in forming the upper lip.
