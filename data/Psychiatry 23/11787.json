At his last appointment, he revealed that he had increased his intake of 12-oz cans of beer from 3 to 6 cans daily due to stress at work. The physician advised him to seek help for his alcohol use because it could be causing his elevated blood pressure and has many negative health risks. The patient now tells the physician, \"I thought about what you said. I know my alcohol use has gotten out of hand and is affecting my health. My wife and daughter also say that I need to quit. I have made an appointment with a counselor to talk about my options.\"",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The transtheoretical model of behavioral change describes 5 stages that many people progress through when making significant behavioral change. It begins with initial denial of the problem (precontemplation), moving through admitting the problem and the need to change (contemplation), committing to change and planning a change strategy (preparation), and taking concrete steps to implement change (action). Finally, behavioral change requires efforts for long-term maintenance.\n\nThis patient has acknowledged his drinking problem and is developing plans for behavioral change. Characteristic features of the preparation stage include the following:\n\n*   The individual is no longer simply considering change but has made a commitment to change.\n*   The individual is weighing specific options to effect change.\n*   The individual may be seeking supportive resources to assist change.\n\nIn the preparation stage, the individual may take initial, preliminary steps to effect behavioral change (eg, contacting a substance abuse counselor) but has not yet taken concrete action with a demonstrable change in the subject behavior.\n\n(Choice A) In the action stage, the individual has initiated a specific plan and taken concrete steps to effect change. Demonstrable changes in the subject behavior (eg, reducing the quantity of alcohol consumption) are seen.\n(Choices B and D) In the precontemplation stage, patients deny the problem or attribute it to external factors (eg, work stress) without acknowledging the need for change. In the contemplation stage, the patient acknowledges the problem but is ambivalent about the need for change and is not yet considering specific strategies for change.\n(Choices C and F) Intellectualization and rationalization are defense mechanisms rather than stages of change. Intellectualization is the use of intellectual argument to avoid painful feelings. Rationalization is the making of excuses to justify behavior or avoid the truth. Defense mechanisms are often used in the precontemplation or contemplation phases to avoid acknowledging the problem or making behavioral changes.\n\nEducational objective:\nIn the transtheoretical stages of change model, the preparation stage represents the stage in which the individual has committed to behavioral change and is considering change strategies but has not determined or instituted a specific course of action. Individuals at this stage may be weighing options and seeking additional support.",
    "zh": "行为改变的跨理论模型描述了许多人在进行重大行为改变时所经历的5个阶段。它始于最初否认问题（前沉思），然后经过承认问题和需要改变（沉思），致力于改变和计划改变策略（准备），并采取具体措施来实施改变（行动）。最后，行为改变需要长期维持的努力。\n\n该患者已经承认了他的饮酒问题，并且正在制定行为改变的计划。准备阶段的特征包括：\n\n*   个体不再仅仅考虑改变，而是已经承诺改变。\n*   个体正在权衡影响改变的具体选择。\n*   个体可能正在寻求支持性资源以协助改变。\n\n在准备阶段，个体可能会采取初步的、初步的措施来影响行为改变（例如，联系药物滥用咨询师），但尚未采取具体行动，其行为尚未发生明显改变。\n\n（选项A）在行动阶段，个体已经启动了具体的计划，并采取了具体措施来影响改变。可以看到主体行为的明显变化（例如，减少酒精消费量）。\n（选项B和D）在前沉思阶段，患者否认问题或将其归因于外部因素（例如，工作压力），而不承认需要改变。在沉思阶段，患者承认问题，但对需要改变感到矛盾，尚未考虑改变的具体策略。\n（选项C和F）理智化和合理化是防御机制，而不是改变的阶段。理智化是使用理性的论点来避免痛苦的感觉。合理化是找借口为行为辩护或逃避真相。防御机制通常用于前沉思或沉思阶段，以避免承认问题或做出行为改变。\n\n教育目标：\n在跨理论的改变阶段模型中，准备阶段代表了个体已经致力于行为改变并正在考虑改变策略，但尚未确定或实施特定的行动方案的阶段。处于此阶段的个体可能正在权衡选择并寻求额外的支持。"
