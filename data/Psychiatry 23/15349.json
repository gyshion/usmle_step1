    "en": "A 28-year-old medical student comes to the office due to anxiety and trouble concentrating. He has worked part-time as a volunteer firefighter and reports that he has been struggling to concentrate in class ever since witnessing a child who had been badly burnt pulled out of a house fire 3 weeks ago. On two occasions the patient began to sweat, shake, and have trouble breathing: \"I felt like my head was spinning and had to run out of the classroom to catch my breath.\" He also reports having trouble sleeping, being irritable with friends and family, and occasionally feeling like he is in a dream. The patient says, \"Sometimes I'll be sitting in class, and I suddenly feel like I am back in the burning house. I can smell the fire and see the child.\" He has missed almost half of his classes to avoid being in crowded classrooms and has recently quit his volunteer job.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's intrusive flashbacks, arousal (ie, panic-like symptoms, sleep disturbance, irritability), avoidance of returning to his volunteer work, and derealization (feeling detached from his surroundings) lasting for 3 weeks after experiencing a life-threatening event are suggestive of ACUTE STRESS DISORDER (ASD). Nightmares of the event, depressed mood, difficulty concentrating, decreased interest in activities, and HYPERVIGILANCE are also common. Reminders of the event, such as being in an enclosed or crowded space, can result in anxiety or panic and lead to avoidance. This often results in significant functional impairment.\n\nIn ASD, symptoms usually develop directly following the trauma and last from 3 days to 1 month, after which they can resolve or develop into more chronic symptoms. When symptoms persist for more than 1 month, the diagnosis is changed to POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (Choice F).\n\n(Choice B) The precipitating incidents in ADJUSTMENT DISORDERS are typically common stressors rather than life-threatening traumas. Adjustment disorders are also not diagnosed when symptoms meet the criteria for another, more specific disorder, such as ASD.\n\n(Choice C) In AGORAPHOBIA, patients avoid situations where escape may not be possible or help may not be available if panic or other embarrassing symptoms occur. This patient's avoidance is secondary to a traumatic event, and his symptoms better meet criteria for ASD.\n\n(Choice D) DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS such as depersonalization (detachment from self) or derealization (detachment from surroundings) commonly occur as part of the symptom cluster in ASD. Depersonalization/derealization disorder is not diagnosed separately if the patient meets criteria for ASD.\n\n(Choice E) PANIC DISORDER is associated with recurrent panic attacks that occur without a clear precipitant. This patient's panic symptoms are related to his recent trauma.\n\nEducational objective:\nACUTE STRESS DISORDER is characterized by intrusive experiences (flashbacks, nightmares), arousal (poor concentration, restless sleep), dissociative symptoms, and avoidance of traumatic reminders, as well as mood disturbances in response to a life-threatening trauma. Symptoms last between 3 days and 1 month.",
    "zh": "该患者的侵入性闪回、唤醒（即类似惊恐的症状、睡眠障碍、易怒）、避免重返志愿工作以及持续3周的现实解体（感觉与周围环境脱离），提示为急性应激障碍(ASD)。关于该事件的噩梦、情绪低落、注意力难以集中、对活动的兴趣降低以及过度警惕也很常见。对该事件的提醒，例如身处封闭或拥挤的空间，会导致焦虑或惊恐，并导致回避。这通常会导致显著的功能障碍。\n\n在ASD中，症状通常在创伤后直接出现，持续3天到1个月，之后症状可以缓解或发展成更慢性的症状。当症状持续超过1个月时，诊断改为创伤后应激障碍（选项F）。\n\n（选项B）适应障碍中的诱发事件通常是常见的应激源，而不是危及生命的创伤。当症状符合另一种更具体的疾病的标准（例如ASD）时，也不会诊断出适应障碍。\n\n（选项C）在广场恐惧症中，患者会避免可能无法逃脱或在出现惊恐或其他令人尴尬的症状时可能无法获得帮助的情况。该患者的回避是继发于创伤性事件，并且他的症状更符合ASD的标准。\n\n（选项D）解离症状，例如人格解体（与自我分离）或现实解体（与周围环境分离），通常作为ASD症状群的一部分出现。如果患者符合ASD的标准，则不会单独诊断人格解体/现实解体障碍。\n\n（选项E）惊恐障碍与反复发作的惊恐发作有关，这些发作没有明确的诱因。该患者的惊恐症状与他最近的创伤有关。\n\n教育目标：\n急性应激障碍的特征是侵入性体验（闪回、噩梦）、唤醒（注意力不集中、睡眠不安）、解离症状以及回避创伤性提醒，以及对危及生命的创伤的情绪紊乱。症状持续3天到1个月。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the diagnostic criteria for Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) and its differentiation from other trauma- and anxiety-related disorders, particularly Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Adjustment Disorder.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully evaluating the patient's symptoms in relation to the timing of the traumatic event and the duration of the symptoms, applying the DSM-5 criteria for ASD and considering the differential diagnoses presented in the options.",
