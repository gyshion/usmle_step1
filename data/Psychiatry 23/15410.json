    "en": "A 72-year-old man is hospitalized due to a leg injury following a high-speed motor vehicle collision. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and hearing loss. The patient drinks a glass of wine every day. Examination shows localized swelling and severe tenderness under the right knee; the presence of a tibial fracture is confirmed by imaging. The patient undergoes open reduction and internal fixation without any perioperative complications. On the first postoperative night, he describes visual hallucinations of his deceased brother in the hospital room with him and perseverates about people invading his home. Vital signs are normal. The patient is disoriented and unable to cooperate with the mental status examination. He appears to respond to internal stimuli.",

    "en": "The patient's presentation is consistent with DELIRIUM, a common confusional state characterized by ALTERED CONSCIOUSNESS and cognitive disturbances such as disorientation, hallucinations, and illusions. Delirium is often multifactorial and can be precipitated by underlying medical conditions, surgery, medications, and environmental factors. This patient has several risk factors for delirium, including advanced age, a history of alcohol use (daily wine consumption suggests potential for withdrawal or dependence), hospitalization, surgery, and sensory impairment (hearing loss).\n\n(Choice A) Facilitating uninterrupted nocturnal sleep is a key strategy in delirium prevention and management. Sleep-wake cycle disruption is both a risk factor for and a manifestation of delirium. Ensuring adequate and uninterrupted sleep helps maintain circadian alignment and can significantly decrease delirium incidence. Minimizing noise and patient interventions at night promotes uninterrupted sleep, and physiologically appropriate lighting (ie, bright day/dim night) helps maintain circadian alignment. These measures significantly decrease delirium incidence and sedative-hypnotic use (an additional delirium risk factor).\n\n(Choice B) Benzodiazepines have a limited role in the treatment of delirium and are often contraindicated. They can precipitate or prolong delirium, especially in elderly patients. While they may be used in specific situations like alcohol withdrawal delirium, they are generally avoided for routine delirium management due to their adverse effects.\n\n(Choice C) Reducing daytime visual stimulation by closing window blinds is generally NOT recommended. Maintaining a normal day-night cycle is important for circadian rhythm regulation. While reducing excessive stimulation might be considered in some cases, completely closing blinds during the day can disrupt the intrinsic circadian system and worsen sleep-wake cycle disturbances, thereby increasing delirium risk.\n\n(Choice D) Reducing hyperstimulation by removing hearing aids is also generally NOT recommended. Sensory impairment, such as hearing loss, is a risk factor for delirium. Providing appropriate sensory aids, such as hearing aids, can help reduce disorientation and sensory deprivation, thus decreasing delirium risk. Removing them would likely exacerbate the problem.\n\n(Choice E) Treating pain with nonpharmacologic aids only is not always sufficient, and adequate pain management is crucial. While opioids can precipitate delirium, untreated or undertreated pain itself is a significant stressor that can contribute to delirium. A multimodal approach to pain management, including pharmacologic agents when necessary, is often required. Nonpharmacologic methods should be used adjunctively, not exclusively, if pain is significant.\n\nKey clinical pearls: Delirium is an ACUTE confusional state, distinct from dementia. Risk factors include age, sensory deficits, sleep deprivation, polypharmacy, and immobilization. Prevention strategies focus on addressing these risk factors, including optimizing sleep, managing pain, ensuring adequate hydration and nutrition, early mobilization, and reorientation. The mnemonic 'DELIRIUM' can be helpful: Drugs, Elimination disorders, Lack of sleep, Impaired sensory input, Reduced mobility, Infection/Intra-cranial issues, Urinary retention/Unusual metabolic issues.",
    "zh": "患者的临床表现与谵妄一致，谵妄是一种常见的意识模糊状态，其特征是意识改变和认知障碍，如定向力障碍、幻觉和错觉。谵妄通常是多因素的，可由潜在的医学疾病、手术、药物和环境因素引起。该患者有几个谵妄的危险因素，包括高龄、饮酒史（每天饮用葡萄酒表明可能出现戒断或依赖）、住院、手术和感觉障碍（听力损失）。\n\n(选项A) 促进不间断的夜间睡眠是预防和治疗谵妄的关键策略。睡眠-觉醒周期的紊乱既是谵妄的危险因素，也是谵妄的表现。确保充足和不间断的睡眠有助于维持昼夜节律的同步，并可显著降低谵妄的发生率。尽量减少夜间的噪音和对患者的干预，有助于促进不间断的睡眠，而生理上适宜的光照（即，白天明亮/夜晚昏暗）有助于维持昼夜节律的同步。这些措施可显著降低谵妄的发生率和镇静催眠药的使用（另一个谵妄的危险因素）。\n\n(选项B) 苯二氮卓类药物在谵妄的治疗中作用有限，通常是禁用的。它们可诱发或延长谵妄，尤其是在老年患者中。虽然它们可能用于特定情况，如酒精戒断谵妄，但由于其不良反应，通常避免用于常规谵妄治疗。\n\n(选项C) 一般不建议通过关闭百叶窗来减少白天的视觉刺激。维持正常的昼夜周期对于昼夜节律的调节很重要。虽然在某些情况下可能考虑减少过度刺激，但在白天完全关闭百叶窗会破坏内在的昼夜节律系统，并加重睡眠-觉醒周期的紊乱，从而增加谵妄的风险。\n\n(选项D) 一般也不建议通过取下助听器来减少过度刺激。感觉障碍，如听力损失，是谵妄的危险因素。提供适当的感官辅助工具，如助听器，有助于减少定向力障碍和感觉剥夺，从而降低谵妄的风险。取下它们可能会加剧这个问题。\n\n(选项E) 仅使用非药物辅助措施治疗疼痛并不总是有充分的，充足的疼痛管理至关重要。虽然阿片类药物可诱发谵妄，但未治疗或治疗不足的疼痛本身就是一种重要的应激源，可能导致谵妄。通常需要采用多模式的疼痛管理方法，包括必要时使用药物。如果疼痛严重，应联合使用非药物方法，而不是单独使用。\n\n关键临床要点：谵妄是一种急性意识模糊状态，不同于痴呆。危险因素包括年龄、感觉缺陷、睡眠剥夺、多药治疗和制动。预防策略侧重于解决这些危险因素，包括优化睡眠、控制疼痛、确保充足的补液和营养、早期活动和重新定向。助记符“DELIRIUM”可能有所帮助：药物（Drugs）、排泄障碍（Elimination disorders）、睡眠不足（Lack of sleep）、感觉输入受损（Impaired sensory input）、活动能力下降（Reduced mobility）、感染/颅内问题（Infection/Intra-cranial issues）、尿潴留/异常代谢问题（Urinary retention/Unusual metabolic issues）。"
