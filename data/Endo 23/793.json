    "en": "This patient's abdominal imaging and ambiguous genitalia are consistent with CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA (CAH). The most common cause of CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, accounting for 90% of all cases. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone (aldosterone precursor) in the zona glomerulosa, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol (cortisol precursor) in the zona fasciculata. In 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the adrenal gland cannot synthesize aldosterone and cortisol efficiently. ACTH levels increase as a result of low cortisol levels, stimulating increased adrenal androgen production by diverting the accumulating aldosterone and cortisol precursors toward the androgen biosynthetic pathway. Genetic females (46,XX) affected with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency are usually identified at birth as increased androgen levels lead to ambiguous genitalia (virilization). However, genetic males (46,XY) have normal genitalia and therefore typically present later with symptoms of salt-wasting or precocious puberty. Infants with 21-hydroxylase deficiency are often detected during routine newborn screening, and a high serum level of 17-hydroxyprogesterone confirms the diagnosis. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) Side-chain cleavage enzyme catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone. Lack of this enzyme leads to absent steroid hormone synthesis. Complete enzyme deficiency is lethal due to absent placental progesterone synthesis.\n\n(Choice B) Dehydroepiandrosterone is converted to androstenedione by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, an enzyme that also converts pregnenolone to progesterone and 17-hydroxypregnenolone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Although deficiency of this enzyme can result in adrenal insufficiency and ambiguous genitalia (in both sexes), it is a very rare cause of CAH.\n\n(Choice D) Synthesis of 17-hydroxyprogesterone from progesterone is catalyzed by 17α-hydroxylase. Deficiency of this enzyme causes mineralocorticoid excess and impaired androgen synthesis. Genetic males have ambiguous genitalia, whereas genetic females appear phenotypically normal.\n\n(Choice E) 5α-reductase deficiency prevents the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, the hormone responsible for the development of male external genitalia. Affected genetic males, not females, are born with ambiguous genitalia.",
    "zh": "该患者的腹部影像学检查和生殖器模糊与先天性肾上腺皮质增生症 (CAH) 一致。CAH 最常见的原因是 21-羟化酶缺乏症，占所有病例的 90%。该酶催化孕酮在球状带转化为 11-脱氧皮质酮（醛固酮前体），并在束状带转化为 17-羟孕酮为 11-脱氧皮质醇（皮质醇前体）。在 21-羟化酶缺乏症中，肾上腺不能有效地合成醛固酮和皮质醇。由于皮质醇水平低，ACTH 水平升高，通过将积累的醛固酮和皮质醇前体转移到雄激素生物合成途径，刺激肾上腺雄激素的产生增加。受经典 21-羟化酶缺乏症影响的女性（46,XX）通常在出生时被发现，因为雄激素水平升高会导致生殖器模糊（男性化）。然而，遗传男性（46,XY）具有正常的生殖器，因此通常晚些时候出现失盐或性早熟的症状。患有 21-羟化酶缺乏症的婴儿通常在常规新生儿筛查中被检测出来，而 17-羟孕酮的血清水平升高证实了诊断。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n(选项 A) 侧链裂解酶催化胆固醇转化为孕烯醇酮。缺乏这种酶会导致类固醇激素合成缺失。由于胎盘孕酮合成缺失，完全的酶缺乏是致命的。\n\n(选项 B) 脱氢表雄酮被 3β-羟基类固醇脱氢酶转化为雄烯二酮，这种酶也将孕烯醇酮转化为孕酮，并将 17-羟孕烯醇酮转化为 17-羟孕酮。虽然这种酶的缺乏会导致肾上腺功能不全和生殖器模糊（在两性中），但它是一种非常罕见的 CAH 病因。\n\n(选项 D) 17-羟孕酮由孕酮合成是由 17α-羟化酶催化的。这种酶的缺乏会导致盐皮质激素过多和雄激素合成受损。遗传男性有生殖器模糊，而遗传女性表型正常。\n\n(选项 E) 5α-还原酶缺乏症阻止睾酮转化为二氢睾酮，二氢睾酮是负责男性外生殖器发育的激素。受影响的遗传男性（而非女性）出生时生殖器模糊。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), specifically 21-hydroxylase deficiency, its presentation, and the biochemical pathway involved. It assesses the ability to recognize the clinical features of CAH and link them to the deficient enzyme.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the ambiguous genitalia in a female infant, consider the most common cause of CAH (21-hydroxylase deficiency), and recall the enzyme's role in converting progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol.",
