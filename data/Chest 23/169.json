    "en": "A 32-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to severe shortness of breath. She has no chest pain. The patient does not use tobacco. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 132/81 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 30/min. During physical examination, her condition deteriorates and she is emergently intubated due to acute respiratory failure. Shortly after intubation, she goes into cardiac arrest and dies despite resuscitation efforts. Review of the patient's medical records shows that she had been prescribed multiple medications but had a history of noncompliance. Autopsy shows hyperinflated lungs, airway mucus plugging, and cellular infiltration of the bronchial wall. Long-term use of which of the following drugs would have best prevented the cellular reaction in this patient's airways?",

    "en": "This patient's autopsy findings of lung hyperinflation and bronchial inflammation are suggestive of uncontrolled asthma, a disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and intermittent bronchoconstriction. Chronic inflammation, composed mainly of eosinophils, helper T cells, and mast cells, causes airway remodeling (ie, bronchial wall thickening, increased smooth muscle), which further worsens airway obstruction and asthma symptoms.\n\nCorticosteroids inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators (eg, cytokines, prostaglandins, leukotrienes), reduce leukocyte extravasation into the respiratory epithelium, and induce apoptosis of inflammatory cells. In addition, corticosteroids decrease smooth muscle proliferation and mucus production by goblet cells.\n\nSystemic corticosteroids (eg, oral prednisone) are used in short courses to treat acute asthma exacerbations, whereas inhaled corticosteroids (eg, fluticasone) reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations and are used for long-term asthma control in patients with persistent symptoms. Suppression of airway inflammation is evident within hours of administration but reaches maximal effect after several months of inhaled therapy. Nonadherence to long-term therapy can increase the risk of life-threatening asthma exacerbation.\n\n(Choices A and C) Albuterol is a selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist that induces bronchodilation. Acetylcholine released through vagal stimulation mediates bronchoconstriction via muscarinic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells; ipratropium is a muscarinic antagonist that promotes bronchodilation and reduced mucus production. Neither of these agents has anti-inflammatory properties, and although short-acting beta agonists are widely used to provide rapid relief of symptoms during an exacerbation, they do not prevent inflammation-induced airway remodeling or alter the chronic disease course.\n\n(Choice D) Magnesium sulfate inhibits calcium influx into airway smooth muscle and promotes bronchodilation when given intravenously during an acute asthma flare-up. Magnesium also reduces inflammation by stabilizing T cells and inhibiting mast cell degranulation; however, it is less effective than corticosteroids.\n\n(Choice E) Leukotriene inhibitors are potent inducers of airway bronchoconstriction and inflammation. Leukotriene inhibitors (eg, montelukast) are useful for long-term control in some patients with asthma. However, they possess less efficacy and have fewer anti-inflammatory properties than inhaled glucocorticoids.\n\n(Choice F) Theophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, results in increased intracellular cyclic AMP, which contributes to its role as a bronchodilator. Theophylline also has anti-inflammatory effects, although they are far less potent than glucocorticoids.\n\nEducational objective: Asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, which leads to airway remodeling, airway hyperresponsiveness, and bronchoconstriction. Corticosteroids reduce airway inflammation and are used for both chronic asthma management (inhaled administration) and acute exacerbations (systemic administration).",
    "zh": "该患者的尸检结果显示肺过度充气和支气管炎症，提示不受控制的哮喘，这是一种以慢性气道炎症、气道高反应性和间歇性支气管收缩为特征的疾病。慢性炎症主要由嗜酸性粒细胞、辅助性T细胞和肥大细胞组成，导致气道重塑（即支气管壁增厚、平滑肌增加），这会进一步加剧气道阻塞和哮喘症状。\n\n皮质类固醇抑制炎性介质（如细胞因子、前列腺素、白三烯）的产生，减少白细胞向呼吸上皮的渗出，并诱导炎性细胞凋亡。此外，皮质类固醇可减少杯状细胞产生的平滑肌增生和黏液产生。\n\n全身性皮质类固醇（如口服泼尼松）用于短期治疗急性哮喘加重，而吸入性皮质类固醇（如氟替卡松）可降低哮喘加重的频率和严重程度，用于长期控制持续性症状患者的哮喘。抑制气道炎症可在给药后数小时内显现，但吸入治疗数月后才能达到最大效果。不依从长期治疗会增加危及生命的哮喘加重的风险。\n\n（选项A和C）沙丁胺醇是一种选择性β-2肾上腺素能受体激动剂，可诱导支气管扩张。乙酰胆碱通过迷走神经刺激释放，通过支气管平滑肌细胞上的毒蕈碱受体介导支气管收缩；异丙托溴铵是一种毒蕈碱拮抗剂，可促进支气管扩张和减少黏液产生。这两种药物均不具有抗炎特性，尽管短效β受体激动剂广泛用于在加重期间迅速缓解症状，但它们不能预防炎症引起的气道重塑或改变慢性病程。\n\n（选项D）硫酸镁可抑制钙涌入气道平滑肌，并在急性哮喘发作期间静脉注射时促进支气管扩张。镁还可以通过稳定T细胞和抑制肥大细胞脱颗粒来减轻炎症；然而，它不如皮质类固醇有效。\n\n（选项E）白三烯抑制剂是气道支气管收缩和炎症的有效诱导剂。白三烯抑制剂（如孟鲁司特）对某些哮喘患者的长期控制有效。然而，它们的效果较差，抗炎特性也较吸入型糖皮质激素少。\n\n（选项F）茶碱是一种磷酸二酯酶抑制剂，可导致细胞内环磷酸腺苷（cyclic AMP）增加，这有助于其作为支气管扩张剂的作用。茶碱也有抗炎作用，尽管它们的作用远不如糖皮质激素。\n\n教育目标：哮喘的特征是慢性气道炎症，导致气道重塑、气道高反应性和支气管收缩。皮质类固醇可减轻气道炎症，用于慢性哮喘管理（吸入给药）和急性加重（全身给药）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of asthma pathophysiology, specifically the role of chronic inflammation in airway remodeling and the mechanism of action of inhaled corticosteroids in preventing this process. It also assesses understanding of the long-term management of asthma and the importance of adherence to inhaled corticosteroid therapy.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the autopsy findings as indicative of chronic asthma with airway remodeling. Then, identify the medication that directly targets the underlying inflammatory process to prevent long-term airway changes. Rule out bronchodilators and other agents that primarily address acute symptoms.",
