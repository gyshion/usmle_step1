    "en": "A 30-year-old woman comes to the office due to chronic anxiety and tension. The patient says she worries constantly about multiple issues involving her work, finances, and family. At work, she has difficulty concentrating as she repeatedly calls to check on the whereabouts and safety of her husband and children. The patient also describes frequent tension headaches, back pain, and fatigue. She does not feel depressed and says that her sleep and appetite are normal. Laboratory studies, including thyroid function tests, are within normal limits. In addition to a recommendation of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy with buspirone is initiated. This medication is associated with which of the following properties?",

    "en": "This patient's chronic anxiety about multiple issues and associated symptoms of muscle tension, impaired concentration, and fatigue are consistent with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Buspirone is a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic used in the treatment of GAD that has no risk of dependence in contrast to the substantial risk associated with benzodiazepines.\n(Choices A, B, and D) Buspirone acts as a partial agonist of the 5HT1A receptor. In contrast to benzodiazepines, which act at GABA-A receptors, buspirone primarily affects serotonin and has no muscle relaxant or anticonvulsant properties. Buspirone is also not effective in treating panic disorder.\n(Choice C) Buspirone has fewer sedative and hypnotic effects compared to benzodiazepines and does not cause euphoria.\n(Choice F) Buspirone is not useful in the acute setting because it requires up to 2 weeks for the anxiolytic effect to begin.\nEducational objective:\nBuspirone is a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic used to treat generalized anxiety disorder. It has a slow onset of action, lacks muscle relaxant or anticonvulsant properties, and carries no risk of dependence.",
    "zh": "该患者对多个问题的慢性焦虑以及相关的肌肉紧张、注意力不集中和疲劳症状，与广泛性焦虑症（GAD）的诊断一致。布斯哌隆是一种用于治疗 GAD 的非苯二氮卓类抗焦虑药，与苯二氮卓类药物相关的巨大风险相比，它没有依赖风险。\n（选项 A、B 和 D）布斯哌隆作为 5HT1A 受体的部分激动剂。与作用于 GABA-A 受体的苯二氮卓类药物相比，布斯哌隆主要影响血清素，没有肌肉松弛或抗惊厥特性。布斯哌隆对治疗惊恐障碍也无效。\n（选项 C）与苯二氮卓类药物相比，布斯哌隆的镇静和催眠作用较少，不会引起欣快感。\n（选项 F）布斯哌隆在急性情况下无用，因为其抗焦虑作用需要长达 2 周的时间才能开始。\n教育目标：\n布斯哌隆是一种用于治疗广泛性焦虑症的非苯二氮卓类抗焦虑药。它起效缓慢，缺乏肌肉松弛或抗惊厥特性，且无依赖风险。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pharmacological properties of buspirone, a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic, and its role in the management of generalized anxiety disorder. It specifically assesses the knowledge of its mechanism of action, therapeutic uses, and side effect profile, particularly in comparison to other anxiolytic medications like benzodiazepines.\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the patient's likely diagnosis based on the clinical vignette. Then, recall the known properties of buspirone, including its efficacy, onset of action, and potential for dependence, and compare these to the options provided. Understanding the differences between buspirone and other anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines, is crucial for correctly identifying its unique characteristics.",
