The most severe form occurs in the first 24-72 hours following birth, after feeding begins and milk proteins start to be broken down in the liver. If left untreated, affected neonates often die due to severe metabolic derangements; survivors often develop permanent neurologic injury. The estimated incidence of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency is about 1 in 800,000 newborns. If a decision is made to test all newborns for this disease, then this initial test should be designed to have a high:",

    "en": "Carbamoyl Phosphate synthetase I deficiency is a rare disorder (incidence 1 in 800,000 newborns) with serious and possible irreversible consequences if not detected and treated early. Therefore, it is important to identify all individuals who potentially have the disease using a SCREENING TEST that can be performed on a large number of newborns.\n\nAlthough an ideal screening test would be highly sensitive and specific, developing a test that has both of these properties is often not possible, and so a compromise must be made. The sensitivity of a test refers to its ability to correctly identify those with the disease: it is the probability of the test returning a positive result in a person with the disease. A HIGHLY SENSITIVE test will ensure that most patients with the disease will have a positive test result (leading to few false negative results); therefore, FEWER CASES OF DISEASE ARE MISSED. Given a test with high sensitivity, a negative result would help to rule out a diagnosis (SnNout). This is important during screening for LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES, even if obtaining a high sensitivity causes an increased numbers of false positives (ie, reduced specificity).\n\n(Choice A) Setting a high cutoff value typically (but not always) produces higher specificity and lower sensitivity.\n\n(Choices B and E) Specificity represents the ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease. A very specific test has a low rate of false positives, so most healthy patients will have a negative test result (true negative). Given a test with high specificity, a positive result would help to rule IN a diagnosis (SpPin). CONFIRMATORY TESTS with high specificity are often used on patients who test positive on a screening test to ensure that a patient actually has the disease.\n\n(Choice C) Positive predictive value refers to the probability that a disease is present given a positive test result. Positive predictive value depends on disease prevalence. When screening patients for a rare disorder, positive predictive value will often be low due to a high number of false positives.",
