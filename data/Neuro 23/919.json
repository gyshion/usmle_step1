    "en": "A 34-year-old woman comes to the office due to a 2-day history of reduced sensation in her legs. Lately, the patient has also had significant fatigue, especially with exercise. Six months ago, she had an episode of visual blurring that resolved spontaneously after a few days. Medical history is significant for psoriasis, for which she uses a topical glucocorticoid ointment. The patient does not use tobacco or illicit drugs. Vital signs are normal. Examination indicates decreased pain and light touch perception in both legs below the level of the umbilicus. Mild bilateral spasticity is noted.",

    "en": "Reduced sensation and spasticity in the lower extremities suggest a lesion in the spinal cord. This, in conjunction with this patient's prior episode of blurred vision and her severe fatigue with exercise (Uhthoff's phenomenon), makes MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) a likely diagnosis. MS is an immune-mediated disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by focal lesions of demyelination. Patients have various neurologic deficits that wax and wane (symptoms are disseminated across time and space).\n\nHistologically, active MS plaques are characterized by PERIVENULAR INFLAMMATES made up primarily of autoreactive T lymphocytes and macrophages, directed against myelin components. Extensive inflammation damages the blood-brain barrier, increasing inflammatory cell recruitment into the CNS (with the vessel wall remaining intact). Infiltrating macrophages containing myelin debris are seen throughout the lesion, and recruitment of B lymphocytes to the perivascular spaces leads to the formation of myelin-specific antibodies. PATCHY DEMYELINATION occurs, and while axons are typically spared, significant or prolonged disease may result in neuron death. Residual chronic findings include hypertrophy and hyperplasia of astrocytes (glial scarring).\n\n(Choice A) Microglial nodules are nonspecific findings that can be seen in patients with MS, as well as in those with HIV encephalopathy and other viral infections. They are thought to be reactive lesions that occur in the setting of inflammation, rather than a specific pathologic finding.\n\n(Choice B) Neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (tau protein) are characteristic findings in ALZHEIMER DISEASE, which presents with memory impairment, not focal neurologic deficits, and is rare in young patients.\n\n(Choice D) SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY is seen in prion diseases (eg, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). Patients present with rapid-onset dementia, myoclonus, and ataxia. Episodic or waxing and waning symptoms are more consistent with MS.\n\n(Choice E) Negri bodies are viral inclusions in the cytoplasm of nerve cells in patients with RABIES. Rabies occurs after a bite from an infected animal and presents with tingling or irritation at the inoculation site followed by hydrophobia, delirium, coma, and death. This disease is typically fatal within days of symptom presentation and would not be expected to cause focal abnormalities over a period of months.\n\nKey clinical pearls: MS is a demyelinating disease of the CNS. Symptoms are disseminated in time and space. Uhthoff's phenomenon (worsening of symptoms with heat) and Lhermitte's sign (electric shock-like sensation down the spine with neck flexion) are characteristic. The hallmark lesion is the perivenular inflammatory infiltrate.",
    "zh": "下肢感觉减退和痉挛提示脊髓损伤。结合该患者之前的视力模糊发作以及运动时出现严重疲劳（Uhthoff现象），多发性硬化症（MS）的可能性很大。MS是一种免疫介导的中枢神经系统（CNS）疾病，其特征是局灶性脱髓鞘病变。患者会出现各种神经功能缺损，症状反复发作（症状随时间和空间而播散）。\n\n组织学上，活动性MS斑块的特征是血管周围炎性浸润，主要由针对髓磷脂成分的自身反应性T淋巴细胞和巨噬细胞组成。广泛的炎症会损害血脑屏障，增加炎性细胞向CNS的募集（血管壁保持完整）。在病灶中可以看到含有髓磷脂碎片的浸润巨噬细胞，并且B淋巴细胞向血管周围空间的募集导致髓磷脂特异性抗体的形成。出现斑片状脱髓鞘，虽然轴突通常得以保留，但严重的或长期的疾病可能会导致神经元死亡。残留的慢性发现包括星形胶质细胞的肥大和增生（神经胶质瘢痕）。\n\n(选项A) 小胶质细胞结节是非特异性发现，可在MS患者以及HIV脑病和其他病毒感染患者中观察到。它们被认为是发生在炎症环境中的反应性病变，而不是特定的病理发现。\n\n(选项B) 神经斑和神经原纤维缠结（tau蛋白）是阿尔茨海默病（Alzheimer's disease）的特征性发现，其表现为记忆障碍，而不是局灶性神经功能缺损，并且在年轻患者中很少见。\n\n(选项D) 海绵状脑病见于朊病毒病（例如，牛海绵状脑病、克雅氏病）。患者表现为快速起病的痴呆、肌阵挛和共济失调。阵发性或时轻时重的症状更符合MS。\n\n(选项E) 内格里小体是狂犬病患者神经细胞细胞质中的病毒包涵体。狂犬病发生在被感染动物咬伤后，表现为接种部位的刺痛或刺激，随后出现恐水症、谵妄、昏迷和死亡。这种疾病通常在症状出现后的几天内致命，并且预计不会在数月内引起局灶性异常。\n\n关键临床要点：MS是CNS的脱髓鞘疾病。症状在时间和空间上播散。Uhthoff现象（症状因热而加重）和Lhermitte征（颈部屈曲时沿脊柱出现电击样感觉）是其特征。标志性病变是血管周围炎性浸润。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the histopathological hallmarks of multiple sclerosis (MS) and the ability to differentiate them from findings in other neurological diseases. It assesses knowledge of the characteristic lesions found in active MS plaques and their association with the clinical presentation of the disease.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical vignette, which points towards multiple sclerosis due to the disseminated neurological deficits in time and space, including visual disturbances and sensory/motor symptoms in the lower extremities. Then, recall the specific histopathological findings associated with MS, particularly the characteristic perivenular inflammatory cells, and contrast these with the pathological features of other neurological conditions presented in the options.",
