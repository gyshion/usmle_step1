    "en": "A 24-year-old healthy college student enrolls into a research study investigating the factors affecting blood oxygen content. The study is performed at sea level, on room air with no additional oxygen. A technique is devised to measure the accurate partial pressure of oxygen in the blood as it flows through the circulation. Blood samples are obtained from the vena cavae, alveolar capillaries, and the aorta. All data are plotted, and the curve obtained is shown in the graph below {{exhibit_1}}.",

    "en": "The graph illustrates the pO₂ of blood as it moves through the lungs and into the systemic circulation. Blood in the pulmonary arteries comes from the systemic venous system and is normally deoxygenated. As blood moves through the pulmonary capillaries, it becomes progressively more oxygenated until it equilibrates with the alveolar pO₂ (~104 mm Hg when breathing room air). This is represented by the curve's first upward deflection and subsequent plateau. However, blood in the left atrium and ventricle has a slightly lower pO₂ (~100 mm Hg) than blood in the pulmonary capillaries. This is due to the **mixing of deoxygenated blood** with oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins and is represented by the downward deflection identified by the arrow. This deoxygenated blood comes from the following sources:\n\n1.  The **bronchial arteries** carry blood to the bronchi and bronchioles and, together with the pulmonary artery, form the dual blood supply to the lungs. The **bronchial veins** return only a portion of this blood to the right heart via the azygos and hemi-azygos veins; most of the blood supplied by the bronchial arteries returns to the left heart via the **pulmonary veins**.\n2.  Small cardiac (**thebesian**) veins that drain into the left atrium and ventricle also contribute to normal anatomic shunting.\n\n(Choice A) Hypoxia due to a diffusion limitation frequently results from PULMONARY FIBROSIS, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME, emphysema, or hyaline membrane disease of the infant. In diffusion-limited gas exchange, the blood pO₂ does not equilibrate with the alveolar pO₂ by the end of its traversal through the alveolar capillaries.\n\n(Choice B) Dead space ventilation (wasted ventilation) refers to the volume of inspired air that does not participate in gas exchange. Anatomic dead space refers to the volume of air that remains in the conducting parts of the airways, such as the bronchi and bronchioles. Alveolar dead space refers to the volume of air in the alveoli that cannot participate in gas exchange due to poor perfusion.\n\n(Choice D) Perfusion-limited gas exchange occurs in the normal physiologic resting state, as equilibration of the blood with the alveolar gas is complete by the time the blood traverses one-third of the total pulmonary capillary length.\n\n(Choice E) The hemoglobin dissociation curve shifts to the right in the systemic capillaries to increase oxygen delivery to the body tissues. Increases in pCO₂, temperature, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration cause right-shifting of the curve; the opposite conditions cause a left shift and favor oxygen loading in the lungs.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe pO₂ in the left atrium and ventricle is lower than that in the pulmonary capillaries due to mixing of oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins with deoxygenated blood from the bronchial circulation and thebesian veins.",
    "zh": "该图说明了血液流经肺部并进入体循环时的pO₂。肺动脉中的血液来自体静脉系统，通常是脱氧的。当血液流经肺毛细血管时，会逐渐氧合，直到与肺泡pO₂达到平衡（在呼吸室内空气时约为104 mmHg）。这由曲线的第一个向上偏转和随后的平台期表示。然而，左心房和左心室中的血液比肺毛细血管中的血液具有略低的pO₂（约100 mmHg）。这是由于**脱氧血**与来自肺静脉的含氧血混合，并通过箭头指示的向下偏转来表示。这种脱氧血来自以下来源：\n\n1.  **支气管动脉**将血液输送到支气管和小支气管，并与肺动脉一起形成肺部的双重血液供应。**支气管静脉**仅将部分血液通过奇静脉和半奇静脉返回到右心；大多数由支气管动脉供应的血液通过**肺静脉**返回到左心。\n2.  排入左心房和左心室的小心脏（**Thebesian**）静脉也促成了正常的解剖分流。\n\n（选项 A）由于弥散受限引起的低氧血症通常由肺纤维化、急性呼吸窘迫综合征、肺气肿或婴儿透明膜病引起。在弥散受限的气体交换中，血液pO₂在穿过肺泡毛细血管的末端时，不会与肺泡pO₂达到平衡。\n\n（选项 B）无效腔通气（无效通气）是指未参与气体交换的吸入空气的量。解剖无效腔是指残留在气道传导部分（如支气管和小支气管）中的空气量。肺泡无效腔是指由于灌注不良而无法参与气体交换的肺泡中的空气量。\n\n（选项 D）灌注受限的气体交换发生在正常的生理静息状态，因为血液与肺泡气体的平衡在血液穿过总肺毛细血管长度的三分之一时完成。\n\n（选项 E）血红蛋白解离曲线在体循环毛细血管中向右移动，以增加向身体组织的氧气输送。pCO₂、温度和2,3-二磷酸甘油酸盐浓度的增加导致曲线右移；相反的条件会导致左移，并有利于肺中的氧气装载。\n\n教育目标：\n左心房和左心室中的pO₂低于肺毛细血管中的pO₂，这是由于来自肺静脉的含氧血与来自支气管循环和Thebesian静脉的脱氧血混合所致。"
