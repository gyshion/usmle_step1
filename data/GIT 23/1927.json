    "en": "A 34-year-old man is evaluated due to elevated liver aminotransferases. The patient has no chronic medical conditions but has a history of injection drug use. Family history is notable for liver cirrhosis in his mother. Ultrasonography-guided liver biopsy is performed. Histopathology demonstrates marked panlobular mononuclear cell infiltration that spans adjacent lobules. Intensely eosinophilic round bodies are occasionally seen scattered among the hepatic parenchyma. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the latter histopathologic finding in this patient?",
    "zh": "一名 34 岁男性因肝转氨酶升高而接受评估。患者无慢性病史，但有注射毒品史。家族史显示其母亲患有肝硬化。进行了超声引导下肝活检。组织病理学显示明显的弥漫性单核细胞浸润，跨越相邻小叶。肝实质中偶尔可见散在的强嗜酸性圆形小体。以下哪项最可能是该患者后一种组织病理学发现的原因？"

    "en": "This patient with a history of intravenous drug use likely has elevated aminotransferases due to ACUTE VIRAL HEPATITIS, which is characterized by hepatocyte damage (eg, cell injury, cell death) and inflammation.\n\nMost cases are marked by significant PANLOBULAR LYMPHOCYTIC INFLAMMATION (ie, involving the entire lobule), which develops in response to the viral antigens. To control the infection, CYTOTOXIC T CELLS trigger apoptosis of infected hepatocytes by binding death receptors (eg, Fas) on the plasma membrane and by secreting cytotoxic mediators (eg, perforins, granzymes). As a result, a cascade of caspase enzymes breaks down hepatocyte proteins and DNA, leading to cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation and fragmentation, and budding apoptotic bodies (ie, membrane-bound cellular fragments).\n\nIn liver biopsy, these apoptotic hepatocytes (ie, Councilman bodies, acidophil bodies) have a small, round, intensely pink (ie, eosinophilic) appearance on hematoxylin and eosin staining and may contain pyknotic nuclei or nuclear fragments. They are typically promptly phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Toxin-mediated hepatic injury (eg, due to acetaminophen) often results in centrilobular hepatocyte necrosis (ie, centered around central veins) due to oxidative damage.\n\n(Choice C) Hemochromatosis is characterized by the deposition of iron within hepatocytes, which appears as yellow to brown granules that can be highlighted with Prussian blue stain. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice D) Mallory bodies, damaged cytokeratin filaments that appear as eosinophilic hepatocellular inclusions, often arise in alcoholic liver disease. Alcohol-mediated liver injury is associated with fat deposition in hepatocytes, particularly in the centrilobular region. {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(Choice E) Aschoff bodies, seen in the myocardium of patients with rheumatic heart disease, are small areas of granulomatous inflammation that may contain central fibrinoid necrosis. They are not seen in the liver. {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choice F) Stellate cells, which reside in the hepatic perisinusoidal space, can transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts in response to hepatocyte injury and deposit collagen, resulting in liver fibrosis. Fibrotic bands may develop in chronic viral hepatitis, which is characterized by persistent hepatocyte injury and predominantly portal tract-based lymphocytic inflammation. {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者有静脉注射毒品史，很可能因急性病毒性肝炎而导致转氨酶升高，其特征是肝细胞损伤（例如，细胞损伤、细胞死亡）和炎症。\n\n大多数病例的特征是明显的弥漫性淋巴细胞性炎症（即，涉及整个小叶），这种炎症是对病毒抗原的反应。为了控制感染，细胞毒性 T 细胞通过结合质膜上的死亡受体（例如，Fas）和分泌细胞毒性介质（例如，穿孔素、颗粒酶）来触发感染的肝细胞凋亡。结果，半胱天冬酶级联反应分解肝细胞蛋白和 DNA，导致细胞收缩、染色质凝集和片段化，以及出芽的凋亡小体（即，膜结合的细胞碎片）。\n\n在肝活检中，这些凋亡的肝细胞（即，Councilman 小体、嗜酸性小体）在苏木精和伊红染色下呈小的、圆形的、强烈的粉红色（即，嗜酸性）外观，并且可能含有固缩的核或核碎片。它们通常被 Kupffer 细胞迅速吞噬。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项 A）毒素介导的肝损伤（例如，由于对乙酰氨基酚）通常会导致肝细胞中央小叶坏死（即，围绕中央静脉），这是由于氧化损伤所致。\n\n（选项 C）血色病以肝细胞内铁的沉积为特征，表现为黄色至棕色颗粒，可用普鲁士蓝染色突出显示。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n（选项 D）Mallory 小体，受损的细胞角蛋白细丝，表现为嗜酸性肝细胞内包涵体，通常见于酒精性肝病。酒精介导的肝损伤与肝细胞脂肪沉积有关，尤其是在中央小叶区域。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n（选项 E）Aschoff 小体，见于患有风湿性心脏病的患者的心肌中，是可含有中央纤维素样坏死的小灶性肉芽肿性炎症。它们在肝脏中不可见。{{exhibit_4}}\n\n（选项 F）星形细胞存在于肝脏的肝窦周围间隙中，可响应肝细胞损伤而转分化为肌成纤维细胞并沉积胶原，导致肝纤维化。纤维化带可能发生在慢性病毒性肝炎中，其特征是持续的肝细胞损伤和主要基于门管区的淋巴细胞性炎症。{{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of acute viral hepatitis and the histological findings associated with cytotoxic T-cell mediated apoptosis of hepatocytes, specifically the appearance of Councilman bodies. It also tests the ability to differentiate these findings from other liver pathologies.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key findings of panlobular inflammation and eosinophilic round bodies (Councilman bodies) in the context of a patient with a history of intravenous drug use, which is a risk factor for viral hepatitis. Rule out other causes of liver injury based on their distinct histological features and clinical associations.",
