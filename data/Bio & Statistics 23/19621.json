    "en": "A study is conducted examining the effect of a low-carbohydrate diet compared to a low-fat diet on body weight. Researchers enroll 150 overweight but otherwise healthy adults from a large city in the study and randomly assign them in a 1:1 ratio to either the low-carbohydrate (40 g/d) or the low-fat (<7% saturated fat) diet. At 12 months, a greater body weight change was reported in the low-carbohydrate diet group compared to the low-fat diet group, with a mean difference in body weight change of -3.5 kg (p = 0.01, predetermined significance level = 0.05). Which of the following is the most accurate interpretation of the results of this study?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Statistical tests contrast a null hypothesis (H₀) and an alternative hypothesis (H₁), in this case:\n\n*   H₀ is a claim of **no difference** between populations (eg, no difference in mean body weight between the low-carbohydrate population and the low-fat population).\n*   H₁ is a claim of a **difference** between populations (eg, difference in mean body weight between the 2 populations).\n\nStatistical inference uses data from **samples** (eg, 75 adults in the low-carbohydrate sample, 75 adults in the low-fat sample) to draw conclusions about underlying **populations**. Sample estimates or differences (eg, sample mean, difference in mean between 2 samples) generally vary with distinct samples (eg, if a different sample of 75 adults was chosen for each group) and may be close but not equal to the underlying population value.\n\nOne way to account for **sampling variation** is to calculate the **p-value**, which is the **probability of obtaining a sample value at least as large as the one observed** when the population value claimed in **H₀ is assumed to be true**. The magnitude of the p-value compared to a predetermined significance level (eg, 0.05 [or 5%]) commonly used as the threshold) determines whether there is convincing evidence against H₀.\n\n*   A low p-value (eg, <0.05) occurs when the sample value significantly disagrees with the population value claimed in H₀ and provides convincing evidence against H₀ (ie, H₀ is probably wrong). Results are considered statistically significant.\n*   A high p-value (eg, ≥0.05) occurs when the sample value is close to the population value claimed in H₀ and provides convincing evidence in favor of H₀ (ie, H₀ might be correct). Results are considered not statistically significant.\n\nIn this case, the given **p-value = 0.01**; therefore, there is a **1% chance** (ie, 0.01) of observing a mean difference in body weight change (ie, sample estimate) of **at least -3.5 kg** between the low-fat and the low-carbohydrate samples when **no difference between populations is assumed** (ie, H₀ is assumed to be true) (Choice B).\n\n(Choices A, D, and E) The p-value of 0.01 is less than 0.05; therefore, the observed mean difference is statistically significant at the 5% level. The p-value is not associated with individual observations in a sample. It accounts for sampling variation (ie, random variation) not bias (ie, systematic variation).\n\nEducational objective:\nThe p-value is the probability of obtaining a result (ie, sample estimate) at least as large as the one observed when the population value claimed in the null hypothesis is assumed to be true. A p-value <0.05 typically indicates that results are statistically significant.",
    "zh": "统计检验对比了零假设（H₀）和备择假设（H₁），在本例中：\n\n*   H₀是关于人群之间**没有差异**的主张（例如，低碳水化合物人群和低脂人群的平均体重没有差异）。\n*   H₁是关于人群之间存在**差异**的主张（例如，两组人群的平均体重存在差异）。\n\n统计推断使用来自**样本**的数据（例如，低碳水化合物样本中有75名成年人，低脂样本中有75名成年人）来得出关于潜在**人群**的结论。样本估计值或差异（例如，样本均值，两样本均值之差）通常随不同的样本而变化（例如，如果为每组选择了不同的75名成年人样本），并且可能接近但不等于潜在的人群值。\n\n考虑**抽样变异**的一种方法是计算**p值**，即在**假设H₀中声称的人群值成立时，获得至少与观测值一样大的样本值的概率**。p值的大小与预先确定的显著性水平（例如，0.05 [或5%]，通常用作阈值）的比较，决定了是否有令人信服的证据反对H₀。\n\n*   当样本值与H₀中声称的人群值显着不一致时，会出现较低的p值（例如，<0.05），这提供了反对H₀的令人信服的证据（即，H₀可能错误）。结果被认为具有统计学意义。\n*   当样本值接近H₀中声称的人群值时，会出现较高的p值（例如，≥0.05），这提供了支持H₀的令人信服的证据（即，H₀可能是正确的）。结果被认为不具有统计学意义。\n\n在本例中，给定的**p值=0.01**；因此，在**假设人群之间没有差异**（即，假设H₀为真）的情况下，观察到低脂样本和低碳水化合物样本之间体重变化平均差异（即，样本估计值）**至少为-3.5公斤**的**概率为1%**（即0.01）（选项B）。\n\n（选项A、D和E）p值为0.01，小于0.05；因此，观察到的平均差异在5%水平上具有统计学意义。p值与样本中的个体观察无关。它考虑了抽样变异（即，随机变异）而不是偏倚（即，系统变异）。\n\n教育目标：\np值是在假设零假设中声称的人群值成立时，获得至少与观测值一样大的结果（即，样本估计值）的概率。p值<0.05通常表示结果具有统计学意义。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of p-value interpretation in statistical hypothesis testing. It assesses the ability to relate the p-value to the probability of observing a certain result under the null hypothesis.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the p-value represents the probability of observing the given result (or a more extreme result) if the null hypothesis is true. A low p-value suggests that the observed result is unlikely under the null hypothesis, leading to its rejection.",
