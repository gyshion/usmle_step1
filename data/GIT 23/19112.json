    "en": "A 63-year-old man comes to the office due to intermittent rectal bleeding. The bleeding worsens with defecation and is associated with itchiness. Ten years ago, he had a kidney transplant for diabetic nephropathy and reports compliance with posttransplant immunosuppression medications. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination reveals a 2-cm ulcerated mass extending from the anal verge into the rectum. Biopsy shows large, eosinophilic squamous epithelial cells arranged in islands; cells have hyperchromatic, irregular nuclei, and scant cytoplasm. Significant keratinization is present.",

    "en": "This patient with a history of chronic immunosuppression has perianal bleeding and an ulcerated anal mass. In association with the classic histologic findings, this presentation suggests anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Most patients have rectal bleeding, pain, or pruritus, and examination demonstrates an ulcerated or a nodular, exophytic anal lesion. On histology, SCCs are characterized by large, eosinophilic, hyperchromatic squamous cells with scant cytoplasm arranged in islands. Nuclear atypia and prominent keratinization and/or keratin pearls are usually observed.\n\nAnal SCC, as well as multiple other anogenital (eg, cervical, penile, vaginal) and oropharyngeal SCCs, is strongly associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that infects cutaneous and mucosal tissues. HPV types 16 and 18 are particularly associated with the development of malignancies. Immunocompromised states (eg, HIV, organ transplant) increase susceptibility to HPV infection and malignant transformation. Other risk factors include smoking, receptive anal intercourse, and female sex.\n\n(Choice A) BRAF is a protooncogene, and mutations are associated with multiple malignancies (eg, melanoma, colon cancer, papillary thyroid cancer) but are not typically associated with anal SCC.\n\n(Choice B) Human herpesvirus 8 causes Kaposi sarcoma, an angiogenic tumor that typically occurs in patients with severe immunosuppression (usually AIDS) but can occur in organ transplant recipients. However, it typically involves the extremities, face, or genitalia and results in painless purple or brown lesions. Histologic evaluation demonstrates whorls of spindle cells and neovascularization.\n\n(Choice D) Mutations of DNA mismatch repair genes are associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (ie, Lynch syndrome), an autosomal dominant disease that results in colonic, endometrial, and ovarian cancer. It is not associated with anal SCC.\n\n(Choice E) Poxvirus causes molluscum contagiosum, which is characterized by umbilicated, flesh-colored papules with histologic findings of epidermal hyperplasia and eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic viral inclusions. Although immunocompromised patients are at increased risk of larger lesions, molluscum contagiosum is not associated with malignant transformation.\n\n(Choice F) Primary syphilis (caused by Treponema pallidum) can result in a painless, ulcerated anogenital lesion (eg, chancre); however, bleeding is atypical, and dark-field microscopy is used to reveal the presence of spirochetes.\n\nEducational objective:\nAnal squamous cell carcinoma is strongly associated with human papillomavirus and typically presents with rectal bleeding, pruritus, and/or pain; examination demonstrates an ulcerated or nodular, exophytic anal lesion. Histology reveals large, eosinophilic, hyperchromatic squamous cells arranged in islands with nuclear atypia and prominent keratinization.",
    "zh": "该患者有慢性免疫抑制病史，出现肛周出血和肛门溃疡性肿块。结合典型的组织学发现，该表现提示肛门鳞状细胞癌（SCC）。大多数患者会出现直肠出血、疼痛或瘙痒，检查可见溃疡或结节状外生性肛门病变。在组织学上，SCC的特征是大的、嗜酸性、染色质浓染的鳞状细胞，细胞质稀少，呈岛状排列。通常观察到核异型性和明显的角质化和/或角蛋白珠。\n\n肛门SCC以及其他多种生殖肛门（例如，宫颈、阴茎、阴道）和口咽SCC与人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）密切相关。HPV是一种无包膜的双链DNA病毒，可感染皮肤和粘膜组织。HPV 16型和18型与恶性肿瘤的发生尤其相关。免疫功能低下状态（例如，HIV、器官移植）会增加对HPV感染和恶性转化的易感性。其他危险因素包括吸烟、接受性肛交和女性。\n\n（选项A）BRAF是一种原癌基因，其突变与多种恶性肿瘤（例如，黑色素瘤、结肠癌、乳头状甲状腺癌）相关，但通常与肛门SCC无关。\n\n（选项B）人疱疹病毒8型可引起卡波西肉瘤，这是一种血管性肿瘤，通常发生在严重免疫抑制的患者（通常是艾滋病）中，但也可能发生在器官移植受者中。然而，它通常涉及四肢、面部或生殖器，并导致无痛的紫色或棕色病变。组织学评估显示梭形细胞的漩涡和新生血管形成。\n\n（选项D）DNA错配修复基因的突变与遗传性非息肉病性结肠癌（即，Lynch综合征）相关，这是一种常染色体显性遗传病，可导致结肠癌、子宫内膜癌和卵巢癌。它与肛门SCC无关。\n\n（选项E）痘病毒引起传染性软疣，其特征是脐凹状、肤色丘疹，组织学发现为表皮增生和嗜酸性胞质内病毒包涵体。尽管免疫功能低下的患者发生较大病变的风险增加，但传染性软疣与恶性转化无关。\n\n（选项F）原发性梅毒（由梅毒螺旋体引起）可导致无痛的、溃疡性生殖器肛门病变（例如，下疳）；然而，出血是不典型的，并且使用暗视野显微镜来揭示螺旋体的存在。\n\n教育目标：\n肛门鳞状细胞癌与人乳头瘤病毒密切相关，通常表现为直肠出血、瘙痒和/或疼痛；检查显示溃疡或结节状外生性肛门病变。组织学显示大的、嗜酸性、染色质浓染的鳞状细胞，呈岛状排列，有核异型性和明显的角质化。"
