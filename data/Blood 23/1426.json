    "en": "An 18-year-old man comes to the office due to progressively worsening fatigue. He returned yesterday from a week-long international trip, during which he provided aid in a rural region of a resource-limited country. While there, the patient developed frequent diarrhea that contained blood and mucus. He took ciprofloxacin for several days, and the diarrhea resolved. Yesterday, the patient noted fatigue and shortness of breath with exertion. Temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F), blood pressure is 116/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 112/min. Physical examination is remarkable for scleral icterus. Mucous membranes are pale but moist. Cardiopulmonary examination demonstrates mild tachycardia. The abdomen is soft and nontender without organomegaly. Laboratory results are as follows:{{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's infectious colitis (ie, bloody stool with mucus) was treated with ciprofloxacin, which resolved the diarrhea. However, subsequent signs of HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA (eg, low hemoglobin, jaundice, reticulocytosis) suggest underlying glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, a common X-linked recessive disorder.\n\nG6PD is an enzyme that catalyzes production of NADPH. Loss of G6PD limits production of reduced glutathione (an antioxidant), which impairs the ability of erythrocytes to handle oxidative stressors. Therefore, patients with G6PD deficiency are at risk for acute hemolysis following exposure to oxidative insults (eg, acute infection, oxidizing foods such as fava beans) or medications (eg, fluoroquinolones).\n\nManifestations of G6PD deficiency begin 2-5 days after exposure to oxidative insults and frequently include signs of anemia (eg, dyspnea on exertion, pallor, fatigue) and hemolysis (eg, jaundice). Laboratory assessment usually reveals an acute drop in hemoglobin and signs of increased circulating erythrocytic products such as elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated bilirubin, and low haptoglobin (protein that binds free heme). The drop in hemoglobin causes the bone marrow to release young erythrocytes, which results in reticulocytosis. Peripheral smear shows hemoglobin precipitation (eg, Heinz bodies) and bite cells.\n\n(Choice A) Antibiotics (eg, chloramphenicol) can injure hematopoietic stem cells and impair erythropoiesis, leading to acute anemia. However, the reticulocyte count would be low and jaundice is not usually seen.\n\n(Choice C) Aplastic anemia, a rare complication of acute viral hepatitis, would result in anemia, but the reticulocyte count would be low due to ineffective erythropoiesis: multiple cytopenias would be expected. In addition, the diarrhea from infectious hepatitis is typically noninflammatory, unlike this patient's history of bloody, mucoid stools.\n\n(Choice D) Patients with infectious colitis due to Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infection are at risk for hemolytic uremic syndrome, a thrombotic microangiopathy. Toxin-mediated damage to glomerular endothelium would cause impaired kidney function (eg, increased creatinine). Endothelial damage leads to platelet consumption (thrombocytopenia) with hemolysis from erythrocyte shearing in the microvasculature (schistocytes).\n\n(Choice E) Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency can cause anemia due to impaired nucleic acid synthesis, which prevents proper growth of nuclei during hematopoiesis. However, the reticulocyte count would be low because new erythrocytes would not be produced efficiently.",
    "zh": "该患者的感染性结肠炎（即，带有血液和粘液的血便）使用环丙沙星治疗，腹泻得以缓解。然而，随后的溶血性贫血迹象（例如，血红蛋白低、黄疸、网织红细胞增多）提示潜在的葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶（G6PD）缺乏症，这是一种常见的X连锁隐性遗传病。\n\nG6PD是一种催化NADPH产生的酶。G6PD的缺失限制了还原型谷胱甘肽（一种抗氧化剂）的产生，从而损害了红细胞处理氧化应激原的能力。因此，G6PD缺乏症患者在暴露于氧化性损伤（例如，急性感染、蚕豆等氧化性食物）或药物（例如，氟喹诺酮类）后，有发生急性溶血的风险。\n\nG6PD缺乏症的临床表现始于暴露于氧化性损伤后2-5天，并且经常包括贫血的体征（例如，劳力性呼吸困难、苍白、疲劳）和溶血（例如，黄疸）。实验室评估通常显示血红蛋白急剧下降和循环红细胞产物增加的迹象，例如乳酸脱氢酶升高、胆红素升高和结合游离血红素的触珠蛋白降低。血红蛋白的下降导致骨髓释放年轻红细胞，从而导致网织红细胞增多。外周血涂片显示血红蛋白沉淀（例如，Heinz小体）和咬细胞。\n\n（选项A）抗生素（例如，氯霉素）会损伤造血干细胞并损害红细胞生成，从而导致急性贫血。然而，网织红细胞计数会很低，并且通常不会出现黄疸。\n\n（选项C）再生障碍性贫血，一种急性病毒性肝炎的罕见并发症，会导致贫血，但由于无效的红细胞生成，网织红细胞计数会很低：预计会出现多种血细胞减少。此外，感染性肝炎引起的腹泻通常是非炎症性的，这与该患者的血性、粘液性粪便病史不同。\n\n（选项D）由产志贺毒素大肠杆菌感染引起的感染性结肠炎患者，有发生溶血性尿毒症综合征（一种血栓性微血管病）的风险。毒素介导的对肾小球内皮细胞的损伤会导致肾功能受损（例如，肌酐升高）。内皮损伤导致血小板消耗（血小板减少症），红细胞在微血管中剪切后发生溶血（裂细胞）。\n\n（选项E）维生素B12或叶酸缺乏症可由于核酸合成受损而引起贫血，这会阻止血细胞生成过程中细胞核的正常生长。然而，网织红细胞计数会很低，因为新的红细胞不会被有效产生。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, its pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings. It also assesses the ability to differentiate G6PD deficiency from other causes of anemia. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the signs of hemolytic anemia (low hemoglobin, jaundice, reticulocytosis) in a patient who recently took ciprofloxacin. This combination strongly suggests G6PD deficiency, especially given the patient's international travel history.",
