    "en": "A 45-year-old woman calls 911 due to severe chest pain and dyspnea. The emergency medical team finds the patient unresponsive with no pulse, and she does not revive despite extensive cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts. She had a prolonged history of systemic lupus erythematosus treated with multiple medications and was recently evaluated for progressive muscle weakness. Records from the patient's most recent office visit show an elevated blood pressure and examination findings of facial plethora, truncal obesity, and skin ecchymoses. She was also found to have mild hyperglycemia. Medical history included a left hip replacement for osteonecrosis of the femoral head 1 year ago. At autopsy, she is found to have an occluding thrombus in the left main coronary artery, which likely led to sudden cardiac death. Examination of this patient's adrenal glands is most likely to reveal which of the following findings?",

    "en": "This patient has features of hypercortisolism, including hypertension, central obesity, muscular weakness, ecchymoses, and hyperglycemia. She most likely developed IATROGENIC CUSHING SYNDROME due to prolonged administration of glucocorticoids for management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Chronic glucocorticoid use can also cause osteonecrosis, and both Cushing syndrome and SLE itself can increase the risk for atherosclerosis and acute coronary events (as in this patient). \n\nExogenous glucocorticoid use inhibits the entire hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to low levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), ACTH, and endogenous cortisol. ACTH exerts a potent trophic (ie, growth promoting) effect on the adrenal zona fasciculata and reticularis; long-term suppression leads to adrenocortical atrophy (the zona glomerulosa is spared as angiotensin II is its primary trophic hormone). Sudden cessation of glucocorticoids after prolonged use can precipitate adrenocortical insufficiency and adrenal crisis. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Endogenous Cushing syndrome can be caused by an autonomous cortisol-producing adrenal tumor. However, this patient's history is more suggestive of exogenous glucocorticoid use.\n\n(Choices C, D, and E) Bilateral cortical hyperplasia and hypertrophy occur in patients with ACTH excess (eg, pituitary corticotroph adenoma [Cushing disease]). Varying degrees of adrenocortical nodularity can also be seen. However, this patient was likely taking exogenous glucocorticoids, which would suppress ACTH release and lead to adrenocortical atrophy.",
    "zh": "该患者具有高皮质醇血症的特征，包括高血压、中心性肥胖、肌无力、瘀斑和高血糖。她很可能由于长期使用糖皮质激素治疗系统性红斑狼疮（SLE）而患上医源性库欣综合征。长期使用糖皮质激素也会导致骨坏死，并且库欣综合征和SLE本身都会增加动脉粥样硬化和急性冠状动脉事件（如本例患者）的风险。\n\n外源性糖皮质激素的使用会抑制整个下丘脑-垂体-肾上腺轴，导致促肾上腺皮质激素释放激素(CRH)、促肾上腺皮质激素(ACTH)和内源性皮质醇水平降低。ACTH对肾上腺束状带和网状带发挥强大的营养（即促进生长）作用；长期抑制导致肾上腺皮质萎缩（肾小球带得以保留，因为血管紧张素II是其主要的营养激素）。长期使用糖皮质激素后突然停药可引起肾上腺皮质功能不全和肾上腺危象。 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项A）内源性库欣综合征可由自主分泌皮质醇的肾上腺肿瘤引起。然而，该患者的病史更提示外源性糖皮质激素的使用。\n\n（选项C、D和E）双侧皮质增生和肥大发生于ACTH过多的患者（例如，垂体促皮质素腺瘤[库欣病]）。也可观察到不同程度的肾上腺皮质结节。然而，该患者可能正在服用外源性糖皮质激素，这会抑制ACTH释放并导致肾上腺皮质萎缩。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Cushing's syndrome, specifically the adrenal gland changes associated with exogenous glucocorticoid use. The key to solving this question is recognizing the clinical features of Cushing's syndrome and understanding the suppressive effect of exogenous steroids on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.\n\nTo answer correctly, identify the signs of Cushing's syndrome in the patient's presentation. Then, recall that long-term exogenous steroid use leads to bilateral cortical atrophy of the adrenal glands due to ACTH suppression.",
