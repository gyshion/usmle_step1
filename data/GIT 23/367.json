    "en": "A 32-year-old man comes to the clinic due to several months of fatigue and weight loss. The patient has no significant medical history. He drinks 1 or 2 alcoholic beverages daily and has used intravenous recreational drugs in the past. He is sexually active with his girlfriend. The patient has a maternal aunt with hypothyroidism, but his family history is otherwise unremarkable. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination is normal. A liver biopsy is obtained, and light microscopy reveals large hepatocytes filled with finely granular, homogeneous, pale pink cytoplasm {{exhibit_1}}. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "zh": "一名32岁的男性因数月疲劳和体重下降前来就诊。患者无重要病史。他每天饮用1到2份酒精饮料，过去曾静脉注射娱乐性毒品。他与女友有性生活。患者有一位患有甲状腺功能减退的姨妈，但其家族史无其他异常。体温为36.7摄氏度（98华氏度），血压为110/70毫米汞柱，脉搏为65次/分钟，呼吸为18次/分钟。体格检查正常。进行了肝活检，光镜显示大的肝细胞充满细颗粒状、均匀的、淡粉色细胞质 {{exhibit_1}}。以下哪项是最可能的诊断？"

    "en": "Hepatitis B infection, one of the most common causes of hepatic injury in the United States, is frequently transmitted sexually or via percutaneous inoculation (eg, intravenous drug use). A distinct histopathologic manifestation of chronic infection is the accumulation of hepatitis B surface antigen within infected hepatocytes. This results in the appearance of a finely granular, homogeneous, pale eosinophilic cytoplasm (ground-glass hepatocytes) {{exhibit_2}}. \n\nOther nonspecific morphologic changes include hepatocyte necrosis, apoptosis, steatosis, and mononuclear portal inflammation (lymphocytes, macrophages). Acidophil (Councilman) bodies, deeply eosinophilic globules that represent shrunken apoptotic hepatocytes, can be seen in a variety of liver diseases.\n\n(Choices A and E) Hepatic steatosis is characterized by the accumulation of large and small vesicles of fat within hepatocytes. It can be due to significant alcohol ingestion (>15 drinks/week for men, >10 drinks/week for women) or obesity (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis). Mallory bodies may be seen in alcohol-induced steatohepatitis; they are characterized by clumped, amorphous, eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions made up of tangled intermediate filaments.\n\n(Choice B) Hemochromatosis is characterized by the deposition of iron in the liver, which appears as yellow-brown hemosiderin granules in the cytoplasm. Cirrhosis and portal hypertension can result if the condition is left untreated.\n\n(Choice D) A liver infected with hepatitis C virus commonly has lymphoid aggregates within the portal tracts and focal areas of macrovesicular steatosis; however, ground-glass hepatocytes are more specific for hepatitis B infection. {{exhibit_3}}\n\nEducational objective:\nHepatitis B infection causes the hepatocellular cytoplasm to fill with hepatitis B surface antigen. These inclusions are highly specific for hepatitis B infection and have a finely granular, pale eosinophilic, ground-glass appearance. {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "乙型肝炎感染是美国肝损伤最常见的原因之一，常通过性传播或经皮接种（如静脉注射毒品）传播。慢性感染的一个独特的组织病理学表现是受感染肝细胞内乙型肝炎表面抗原的积累。这导致出现细颗粒状、均匀、淡嗜酸性细胞质（磨玻璃样肝细胞） {{exhibit_2}}。\n\n其他非特异性形态学改变包括肝细胞坏死、凋亡、脂肪变性和单核细胞门脉炎症（淋巴细胞、巨噬细胞）。在多种肝病中可见嗜酸性小体（Councilman 小体），它们是代表萎缩的凋亡肝细胞的深嗜酸性小球。\n\n（选项 A 和 E）肝脂肪变性的特征是肝细胞内积累大小脂肪小泡。这可能由于大量饮酒（男性每周饮酒量>15份，女性每周饮酒量>10份）或肥胖（非酒精性脂肪性肝炎）引起。在酒精性脂肪性肝炎中可见 Mallory 小体；其特征是由缠结的中间丝组成的团块状、无定形、嗜酸性细胞质内包涵体。\n\n（选项 B）血色病的特征是肝脏中铁的沉积，在细胞质中表现为黄棕色血铁黄素颗粒。如果病情未得到治疗，可导致肝硬化和门脉高压。\n\n（选项 D）感染丙型肝炎病毒的肝脏通常在门脉管内有淋巴样聚集物和局灶性大泡性脂肪变性区域；然而，磨玻璃样肝细胞对乙型肝炎感染更具特异性。 {{exhibit_3}}\n\n教育目标：\n乙型肝炎感染导致肝细胞细胞质充满乙型肝炎表面抗原。这些包涵体对乙型肝炎感染具有高度特异性，并具有细颗粒状、淡嗜酸性、磨玻璃样外观。 {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the histopathological findings associated with Hepatitis B infection. Specifically, it assesses the ability to recognize ground-glass hepatocytes, which are characteristic of Hepatitis B due to the accumulation of hepatitis B surface antigen.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key finding of finely granular, homogeneous, pale pink cytoplasm (ground-glass hepatocytes) in the liver biopsy. Consider the patient's risk factors for viral hepatitis, such as intravenous drug use, and then select the answer choice that aligns with these findings.",
