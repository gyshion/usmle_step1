  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient developed anemia and hyperbilirubinemia during treatment with ceftriaxone, raising strong suspicion for drug-induced hemolytic anemia. The most common triggers of drug-induced hemolysis are anti-inflammatory medications, penicillins, and cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone). Although the mechanism of erythrocyte injury (eg, oxidative, complement mediated) varies depending on the medication, penicillins and cephalosporins typically cause hemolysis by binding to the erythrocyte surface, which creates a hapten for IgG attachment. Antibody-coated erythrocytes are then partially or wholly phagocytized by splenic macrophages, leading to extravascular hemolysis.\n\nHemolysis is often associated with symptomatic anemia (eg, fatigue, pallor) and signs of hyperbilirubinemia (eg, jaundice, dark urine). Laboratory evaluation will typically reveal elevated indirect bilirubin (heme breakdown product), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (intracellular enzyme), reticulocytosis (increased immature RBCs), and lowered haptoglobin (binds free hemoglobin). The diagnosis is confirmed with the direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test, which detects IgG or C3 (a complement fragment) on the erythrocyte surface. Because hemolysis is triggered by the direct binding of the penicillin or cephalosporin to the erythrocyte membrane, cessation of the offending drug eliminates the antibody target and generally leads to complete resolution of symptoms within days.\n\n(Choice B) Anemia of chronic disease is caused by cytokine-mediated iron dysregulation. Although chronic infection (eg, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis) is a common trigger, anemia of chronic disease is gradual in onset and is not associated with hyperbilirubinemia (no RBC lysis).\n\n(Choice C) Certain antibiotics (eg, sulfa medications, chloramphenicol) are associated with myelosuppression. However, these medications generally cause pancytopenia, not isolated anemia; in addition, hyperbilirubinemia is not seen.\n\n(Choice D) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is marked by hemolysis in the setting of oxidative stress due to infection, oxidizing medication, or oxidative foods. Although this patient has an infection, ceftriaxone is not an oxidizing medication. In addition, G6PD deficiency is X-linked; therefore, symptoms are less common in women.\n\n(Choice E) Severe infections can trigger disseminated intravascular coagulation, a consumptive coagulopathy associated with anemia due to erythrocyte injury from microvascular thrombi. However, these patients have prolonged coagulation times and thrombocytopenia.\n\nEducational objective:\nPenicillins and cephalosporins are common triggers for drug-induced hemolytic anemia because they can bind to the erythrocyte surface and act as haptens for IgG attachment. Subsequent clearance of IgG-coated erythrocytes by splenic macrophages leads to hemolytic anemia. Withdrawal of the offending drug usually leads to complete resolution of symptoms.",
    "zh": "该患者在使用头孢曲松治疗期间出现贫血和高胆红素血症，强烈提示药物引起的溶血性贫血。药物引起的溶血最常见的诱因是抗炎药、青霉素和头孢菌素（如头孢曲松）。虽然红细胞损伤的机制（例如，氧化、补体介导）因药物而异，但青霉素和头孢菌素通常通过与红细胞表面结合导致溶血，从而为IgG结合创造一个半抗原。然后，被抗体包被的红细胞部分或全部被脾巨噬细胞吞噬，导致血管外溶血。\n\n溶血通常与有症状的贫血（例如，疲劳、苍白）和高胆红素血症的体征（例如，黄疸、深色尿液）相关。实验室评估通常会显示间接胆红素升高（血红素分解产物）、乳酸脱氢酶升高（细胞内酶）、网织红细胞增多（未成熟红细胞增加）和结合珠蛋白降低（结合游离血红蛋白）。通过直接抗球蛋白（Coombs）试验证实诊断，该试验检测红细胞表面的IgG或C3（补体片段）。由于溶血是由青霉素或头孢菌素直接与红细胞膜结合引起的，因此停止使用致病药物可消除抗体靶标，通常在几天内即可完全缓解症状。\n\n（选项B）慢性病贫血是由细胞因子介导的铁调节失常引起的。虽然慢性感染（例如，病毒性肝炎、结核病）是常见的诱因，但慢性病贫血的发生是渐进的，并且与高胆红素血症无关（无红细胞溶解）。\n\n（选项C）某些抗生素（例如，磺胺类药物、氯霉素）与骨髓抑制有关。然而，这些药物通常会导致全血细胞减少，而不是孤立性贫血；此外，未见高胆红素血症。\n\n（选项D）葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶（G6PD）缺乏症的特征是在感染、氧化药物或氧化性食物引起的氧化应激的情况下发生溶血。尽管该患者有感染，但头孢曲松不是氧化性药物。此外，G6PD缺乏症是X连锁的；因此，女性的症状较少见。\n\n（选项E）严重感染可触发弥漫性血管内凝血，这是一种消耗性凝血病，与微血管血栓引起的红细胞损伤相关的贫血有关。然而，这些患者的凝血时间延长和血小板减少。\n\n教学目标：\n青霉素和头孢菌素是药物引起的溶血性贫血的常见诱因，因为它们可以与红细胞表面结合并充当IgG结合的半抗原。随后，脾巨噬细胞清除被IgG包被的红细胞会导致溶血性贫血。停用致病药物通常会导致症状完全缓解。"
