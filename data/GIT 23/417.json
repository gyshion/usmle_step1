    "en": "A 65-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain that began about 6 hours ago. She has also had vague pelvic pain over the last few months but says her pain has never been this severe. Temperature is 38.4 C (101 F), blood pressure is 141/90 mm Hg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination shows a moderately distended abdomen. There is a tender bulge below the inguinal ligament, lateral to the pubic tubercle. The overlying skin is erythematous.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a femoral hernia, which characteristically presents with upper thigh, groin, or pelvic discomfort and a tender bulge below the inguinal ligament, lateral to the pubic tubercle and lacunar ligament. Femoral hernias are more common in women and tend to occur on the right side. Advanced age is the most important risk factor. Over time, the femoral ring becomes lax and can widen, allowing bowel to protrude into the femoral canal, the medial most compartment within the femoral sheath. The femoral vessels travel within other compartments of the femoral sheath, with the femoral vein running immediately lateral to the hernia. Because the femoral canal is small, femoral hernias are prone to incarceration. Incarcerated hernias cannot be reduced; if a segment of bowel is present in the hernia sac, incarceration can cause bowel obstruction (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and distension). Incarceration can also cause impaired blood flow to contents trapped in the hernia sac, resulting in strangulation (ischemia and necrosis) with potential systemic complications such as sepsis.\n\n(Choice B) Direct inguinal hernias protrude through weakened transversalis fascia, medial to the inferior epigastric vessels, and emerge into the Hesselbach triangle. Indirect inguinal hernias protrude lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels before running through the deep (internal) inguinal ring and into the inguinal canal.\n\n(Choice C) The pectineal ligament (inguinal ligament of Cooper) is a thickened part of the pectineal fascia. It overlies the pectineal ridge of the pubic bone and is located posterior to the femoral canal.\n\n(Choice D) The rectus muscle sheath forms the medial border of the Hesselbach triangle. Direct inguinal hernias are located just lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle sheath.\n\n(Choice E) The round ligament in women is homologous to the spermatic cord in men. It leaves the pelvis through the deep inguinal ring and passes through the inguinal canal.\n\n(Choice F) The transversalis fascia is found between the transversalis muscle and the extraperitoneal fat. It forms the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. The deep (internal) inguinal ring is an opening in the transversalis fascia and is the site of protrusion of indirect inguinal hernias.\n\nEducational objective:\nFemoral hernias can present with groin discomfort and a tender bulge on the upper thigh inferior to the inguinal ligament, lateral to the pubic tubercle and lacunar ligament. The structure that lies immediately lateral to the hernia within the femoral sheath is the femoral vein. Incarceration and strangulation are common complications of femoral hernias. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有股疝，其特征表现为大腿上部、腹股沟或骨盆不适，以及腹股沟韧带下方、耻骨结节和腔隙韧带外侧的触痛性隆起。股疝在女性中更常见，且倾向于发生在右侧。高龄是最重要的危险因素。随着时间的推移，股环变得松弛并可能扩大，从而使肠管突出到股管中，股管是股鞘内最内侧的间室。股血管走行于股鞘的其他间室中，股静脉紧邻疝外侧。由于股管很小，股疝易发生嵌顿。嵌顿性疝无法复位；如果肠段存在于疝囊中，嵌顿可导致肠梗阻（如恶心、呕吐、腹痛和腹胀）。嵌顿还会导致流向滞留在疝囊中的内容物的血流受损，导致绞窄（缺血和坏死），并可能出现全身并发症，如脓毒症。\n\n（选项 B）直接腹股沟疝穿过薄弱的腹横筋膜突出，位于腹下动脉内侧，并进入 Hesselbach 三角。间接腹股沟疝在穿过深（内）腹股沟环并进入腹股沟管之前，先于腹下动脉外侧突出。\n\n（选项 C）耻骨梳韧带（Cooper 腹股沟韧带）是耻骨筋膜的增厚部分。它位于耻骨的耻骨嵴上方，位于股管后方。\n\n（选项 D）腹直肌鞘形成 Hesselbach 三角的内侧缘。直接腹股沟疝位于腹直肌鞘外侧。\n\n（选项 E）女性的子宫圆韧带与男性的精索同源。它通过深腹股沟环离开骨盆，并穿过腹股沟管。\n\n（选项 F）腹横筋膜位于腹横肌和腹膜外脂肪之间。它形成腹股沟管的后壁。深（内）腹股沟环是腹横筋膜上的一个开口，是间接腹股沟疝突出的部位。\n\n教学目标：\n股疝可表现为腹股沟不适，以及腹股沟韧带下方、耻骨结节和腔隙韧带外侧的大腿上部触痛性隆起。在股鞘内紧邻疝外侧的结构是股静脉。嵌顿和绞窄是股疝常见的并发症。{{exhibit_1}}"
