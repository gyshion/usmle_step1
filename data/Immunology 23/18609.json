    "en": "A 19-year-old man comes to the office due to eye pain and blurry vision in both eyes for the last several days. He sustained an open globe injury to the right eye 3 months ago after being struck during an altercation and was treated with surgical repair and prophylactic antibiotics. The left eye was unaffected. At the patient's last follow-up appointment, visual acuity in the right eye had improved from 20/400 to 20/80. He is otherwise healthy. Temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F). Examination is unremarkable apart from bilateral conjunctival injection and decreased visual acuity in both eyes. Analysis of vitreous samples from both eyes demonstrates multinucleated giant cells.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with a traumatic injury to the right eye has developed granulomatous inflammation of both the injured and noninjured eye, a condition known as sympathetic ophthalmia. This occurs when there is a robust T-cell response to previously sequestered antigens in the eye, an area that displays immune privilege.\n\nCertain anatomic sites (eg, eyes, testes) have inherent immune privilege, in which inflammation is inhibited to limit consequent organ dysfunction. Self-antigens located in sites with immune privilege can be recognized by T cells that escape negative selection in the thymus. Therefore, if these antigens are released into the lymphatic system through trauma, T cells may recognize these antigens as foreign and mount a response that can occur in both the injured eye and the contralateral eye.\n\nBecause of this potential sight-threatening condition, if an eye is severely injured with no prognosis for recovery of vision, it is surgically removed (ie, enucleated) to prevent blindness in the uninjured eye. However, in patients whose vision is likely to recover, treatment is focused on decreasing inflammation (eg, corticosteroids) should the condition develop.\n\n(Choice A) Herpes zoster reactivation can cause granulomatous keratouveitis (ie, anterior chamber inflammation). However, herpes zoster typically reactivates in a single ganglion, leading to unilateral symptoms.\n\n(Choice B) Spondyloarthritis may be triggered by a gastrointestinal pathogen and result in a mixed inflammatory reaction that leads to reactive arthritis and uveitis. However, it is not triggered by previous ocular trauma.\n\n(Choice C) Infectious agents can be introduced during trauma or surgery, which can result in an acute intraocular infection that prompts a neutrophilic response. However, this would not affect the contralateral eye.\n\n(Choice E) Although rare, a type IV hypersensitivity reaction to an antibiotic may cause bilateral uveitis. However, this would occur near the time of antibiotic administration, not 3 months later.\n\nEducational objective:\nTraumatic injury to the eye, a site that displays immune privilege, can lead to the release of previously sequestered antigens that T cells recognize as foreign. This can lead to sight-threatening inflammation in both the injured and uninjured eye.",
    "zh": "这名右眼有外伤的患者已经发展为受伤和未受伤眼睛的肉芽肿性炎症，这种情况被称为交感性眼炎。当对眼睛中先前隔离的抗原产生强大的T细胞反应时，就会发生这种情况，眼睛是一个表现出免疫豁免的区域。\n\n某些解剖部位（例如，眼睛、睾丸）具有固有的免疫豁免，其中炎症受到抑制以限制随后的器官功能障碍。位于具有免疫豁免部位的自身抗原可以被逃避胸腺阴性选择的T细胞识别。因此，如果这些抗原通过外伤释放到淋巴系统中，T细胞可能会将这些抗原识别为异物，并引发反应，这种反应可能发生在受伤的眼睛和对侧眼睛中。\n\n由于这种潜在的威胁视力的状况，如果一只眼睛严重受伤且无法恢复视力，则通过手术切除（即，摘除眼球）以防止未受伤的眼睛失明。但是，对于视力可能恢复的患者，治疗重点是减少炎症（例如，皮质类固醇），以防病情发展。\n\n（选项A）带状疱疹再激活可引起肉芽肿性角膜葡萄膜炎（即，前房炎症）。但是，带状疱疹通常在单个神经节中再激活，导致单侧症状。\n\n（选项B）脊柱关节病可能由胃肠道病原体触发，并导致混合性炎症反应，进而导致反应性关节炎和葡萄膜炎。但是，它不是由以前的眼外伤触发的。\n\n（选项C）感染原可以在外伤或手术期间引入，这可能导致急性眼内感染，并引起中性粒细胞反应。但是，这不会影响对侧眼睛。\n\n（选项E）虽然罕见，但对一种抗生素的IV型超敏反应可能导致双侧葡萄膜炎。但是，这种情况会发生在抗生素给药附近，而不是3个月后。\n\n教育目标：\n眼睛的外伤，一个表现出免疫豁免的部位，可能导致先前隔离的抗原释放，T细胞将其识别为异物。这可能导致受伤和未受伤眼睛的威胁视力的炎症。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of sympathetic ophthalmia, a rare bilateral granulomatous inflammation of the eye that can occur after penetrating ocular trauma. It assesses understanding of immune privilege and the role of T-cell response to previously sequestered antigens in the pathogenesis of this condition.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the history of penetrating eye trauma followed by bilateral eye inflammation. Consider the concept of immune privilege and the potential for T-cell mediated response to previously sequestered antigens as the underlying mechanism.",
