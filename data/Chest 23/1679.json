    "en": "Health authorities are investigating an outbreak of respiratory infections among a group of military recruits. Fifteen recruits reported persistent cough, low-grade fever, and malaise. Apart from the low-grade fever, physical examination was largely unremarkable. Chest x-rays were all notable for pulmonary infiltrates that appeared more severe than what would have been expected based on assessment of the patients' clinical status. Sputum specimens were obtained, and the causative organism required a complex acellular medium enriched with cholesterol to grow.",

    "en": "These patients have \"walking pneumonia,\" an infection generally caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Patients experience a low-grade fever, malaise, and a chronic, dry nagging cough. A classic sign is a chest x-ray revealing findings that are much worse than the clinical appearance of the patient. Another clue for M pneumoniae is that the organism requires cholesterol to grow because their cell membrane is composed of a single cholesterol-rich phospholipid bilayer. They completely lack a peptidoglycan cell wall, cell envelope, or capsule. (Fungi also incorporate sterols into their cell membranes; however, fungi use ergosterol, a target for antifungal therapy.)\n\n(Choices A and D) The fungus Coccidioides immitis causes San Joaquin Valley fever (known as \"valley fever\"). It is most common in the Southwest United States and Northern Mexico. Histoplasma capsulatum causes a similar illness, but it is typically localized to the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys. Both organisms grow on standard fungal culture media.\n\n(Choice B) Coxiella burnetii causes Q-fever, a pneumonia-like illness resulting from inhalation of C burnetii spores that commonly contaminate animal hides. C burnetii is an obligate intracellular parasite that must be provided a cell culture to grow.\n\n(Choice C) Haemophilus influenzae requires chocolate agar (heat lysed blood agar), supplemented with factor X (hematin) and factor V (NAD+).\n\n(Choice E) Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia classically presents with cough productive of red jelly-like sputum (\"currant jelly sputum\") in patients with alcohol use disorder. K pneumoniae can be grown on standard agar, but MacConkey agar is often preferred because it contains bile, which will inhibit the growth of contaminant organisms.\n\n(Choice F) Legionella pneumophila requires an L-cysteine-supplemented agar to grow.\n\n(Choice H) The fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii can cause severe pneumonia in HIV+ patients with CD4 cell counts <200/mm³. Patients often have characteristic \"ground glass\" infiltrates on chest x-ray. P jirovecii pneumonia is diagnosed by silver staining the fluid collected during bronchoscopy.\n\n(Choice I) Streptococcus pneumoniae would cause lobar consolidation on chest x-ray. This organism can grow well on standard unenriched blood agar, but it is bile-soluble and cannot grow in the presence of optochin.\n\nEducational objective:\nMycoplasma pneumoniae is the causative agent of \"walking pneumonia,\" an infection typically characterized by a nagging nonproductive cough, low-grade fever, and malaise. Often, the chest x-ray suggests a severe pneumonia even though the patient appears relatively well. Mycoplasma species require cholesterol supplementation to grow on artificial media.",
    "zh": "这些患者患有“游走性肺炎”，这是一种通常由肺炎支原体引起的感染。 患者会出现低烧、不适和慢性、干咳。一个典型的迹象是胸部 X 光片显示的结果比患者的临床表现更糟。 肺炎支原体的另一个线索是，该病原体需要胆固醇才能生长，因为它们的细胞膜由单一的富含胆固醇的磷脂双层组成。它们完全缺乏肽聚糖细胞壁、细胞包膜或荚膜。（真菌也会将甾醇掺入其细胞膜中；然而，真菌使用麦角甾醇，它是抗真菌治疗的靶标。）\n\n（选项 A 和 D）真菌粗球孢子菌引起圣华金谷热（也称为“山谷热”）。它在美国西南部和墨西哥北部最为常见。荚膜组织胞浆菌引起类似的疾病，但它通常局限于密西西比河和俄亥俄河流域。 这两种病原体都可以在标准的真菌培养基上生长。\n\n（选项 B）伯氏考克斯体引起 Q 热，这是一种类似肺炎的疾病，是吸入通常污染动物皮毛的伯氏考克斯体孢子引起的。伯氏考克斯体是一种专性细胞内寄生虫，必须提供细胞培养才能生长。\n\n（选项 C）流感嗜血杆菌需要巧克力琼脂（热裂解血琼脂），并补充因子 X（血红素）和因子 V（NAD+）。\n\n（选项 E）肺炎克雷伯菌肺炎的典型表现是患有酒精使用障碍的患者咳嗽，并产生红果冻状痰（“醋栗果冻痰”）。 肺炎克雷伯菌可以在标准琼脂上生长，但通常更喜欢麦康凯琼脂，因为它含有胆汁，这将抑制污染病原体的生长。\n\n（选项 F）嗜肺军团菌需要 L-半胱氨酸补充琼脂才能生长。\n\n（选项 H）真菌肺孢子虫可引起 HIV+ 患者的严重肺炎，其 CD4 细胞计数 <200/mm³。 患者通常在胸部 X 光片上出现特征性的“毛玻璃”浸润。 肺孢子虫肺炎通过银染在支气管镜检查期间收集的液体来诊断。\n\n（选项 I）肺炎链球菌会在胸部 X 光片上引起肺叶实变。 这种病原体可以在标准的不富集血琼脂上良好生长，但它可溶于胆汁，并且在存在奥托菌素的情况下无法生长。\n\n教育目标：\n肺炎支原体是“游走性肺炎”的病原体，这是一种典型的特征是烦人的无产咳嗽、低烧和不适的感染。 通常，胸部 X 光片提示有严重的肺炎，即使患者看起来相对健康。 支原体物种需要在人工培养基上生长时补充胆固醇。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of atypical pneumonia, specifically Mycoplasma pneumoniae, including its clinical presentation, diagnostic clues, and unique growth requirements. It also requires differentiating it from other common causes of pneumonia based on clinical features and culture requirements.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the discrepancy between the patient's mild symptoms and the more severe findings on chest X-ray, along with the specific culture requirement for cholesterol. This points towards Mycoplasma pneumoniae as the most likely causative agent.",
