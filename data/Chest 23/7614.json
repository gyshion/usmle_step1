    "en": "A 53-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to progressive shortness of breath and nonproductive cough. Medical history is significant for long-standing hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, for which he takes lisinopril and metformin. The patient has no drug allergies. Blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 20/min. On physical examination, heart sounds are regular. Lung examination reveals decreased tactile fremitus over the lower right lung along with dullness to percussion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient most likely has a right-sided pleural effusion. Excess fluid within the pleural space acts to insulate vibrations and breath sounds that originate in the airways of the lungs. Consequently, tactile fremitus, the transmission of vibration from vocalized sound (eg, saying “ninety-nine”), is decreased over a pleural effusion. Breath sounds are also decreased or absent. The high density of pleural fluid compared to normal lung (alveolus-air composite) causes dullness to percussion over the effusion.\n\n(Choice A) Bronchospasm is likely to have minimal effect on tactile fremitus and dullness to percussion.\n\n(Choice B) The hyperinflated alveoli in emphysema should demonstrate hyperresonance to percussion and decreased tactile fremitus.\n\n(Choices C and G) Because sound vibrations travel faster and more efficiently through liquids than through gases, alveolar filling processes such as lobar consolidation (alveoli filled with pus) and pulmonary edema (alveoli filled with transudate) create increased breath sound intensity and increased tactile fremitus.\n\n(Choice D) A large pericardial effusion might cause dullness to percussion with decreased tactile fremitus over the precordium, but not over the lower lung.\n\n(Choice F) Like pleural effusion, pneumothorax (air in the pleural space) acts to insulate sound originating in the airways; therefore, tactile fremitus and breath sounds are decreased. However, the low density of air compared to normal lung creates hyperresonance to percussion.\n\nEducational objective:\nFluid in the pleural space acts to insulate sound vibrations that originate in the airways; therefore, pleural effusion causes decreased tactile fremitus and decreased intensity of breath sounds. The high density of pleural fluid compared to normal lung tissue also causes dullness to percussion.",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有右侧胸腔积液。胸膜腔内的过量液体起到隔离肺部气道产生的振动和呼吸音的作用。因此，触觉语颤，即由发声（例如说“九十九”）传递的振动，在胸腔积液上方减弱。呼吸音也减弱或消失。与正常肺（肺泡-空气复合体）相比，胸腔积液的高密度导致叩诊呈浊音。\n\n（选项A）支气管痉挛可能对触觉语颤和叩诊浊音影响甚微。\n\n（选项B）肺气肿的过度膨胀的肺泡应表现为叩诊呈过清音和触觉语颤减弱。\n\n（选项C和G）由于声音振动在液体中比在气体中传播得更快、更有效，肺泡充盈过程，如叶性实变（肺泡充满脓液）和肺水肿（肺泡充满漏出液），会产生增强的呼吸音强度和增强的触觉语颤。\n\n（选项D）大量心包积液可能导致心脏前区叩诊呈浊音，触觉语颤减弱，但不会在下肺出现这种情况。\n\n（选项F）与胸腔积液一样，气胸（胸膜腔内有空气）起到隔离气道产生的声音的作用；因此，触觉语颤和呼吸音减弱。然而，与正常肺相比，空气的低密度会产生叩诊的过清音。\n\n教学目标：\n胸膜腔内的液体起到隔离气道产生的声音振动的作用；因此，胸腔积液会导致触觉语颤减弱和呼吸音强度减弱。与正常肺组织相比，胸腔积液的高密度也会导致叩诊浊音。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the clinical presentation and physical exam findings associated with pleural effusion. It requires differentiating pleural effusion from other pulmonary conditions based on percussion and tactile fremitus findings.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key physical exam findings: decreased tactile fremitus and dullness to percussion. These findings are characteristic of fluid accumulation in the pleural space, pointing towards pleural effusion as the most likely diagnosis.",
