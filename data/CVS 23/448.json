    "en": "A 64-year-old man has had difficulty walking for 6 months, experiencing muscle cramps in his right thigh after walking a block on level ground. The cramps subside quickly with rest. He has also had decreased sexual performance. Medical history is significant for hypercholesterolemia and myocardial infarction. The patient smokes a pack of cigarettes daily but does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. He is afebrile. Blood pressure is 128/78 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 16/min. Cardiac auscultation reveals normal S1 and S2, and equal vesicular breath sounds are heard over the bilateral lungs. The abdomen is soft and without masses. There is no peripheral edema, muscle tenderness, or muscle weakness.",

    "en": "This patient's muscle pain, which occurs with exercise and remits with rest, is consistent with INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION; smoking is an important risk factor. Claudication is usually due to atherosclerosis of the large arteries, specifically resulting from fixed stenoses caused by lipid-filled intimal plaques that bulge into the arterial lumen (atheromas). These stenoses prevent a sufficient increase in blood flow to muscles during exercise, leading to ischemic muscle pain. The pain is rapidly relieved by rest, as residual blood flow is adequate to meet the metabolic demands of resting, but not exercising, muscle.\n\nThigh claudication is suggestive of occlusive disease of the ipsilateral EXTERNAL ILIAC artery or its more distal branches (ie, common femoral, superficial femoral, profunda femoris arteries). Accompanying impotence and/or gluteal claudication suggests more proximal aortoiliac occlusion (so-called Leriche syndrome), which, in addition to affecting the external iliac artery, also diminishes blood flow to the internal pudendal and gluteal branches of the internal iliac artery.\n\n(Choice A) Granulomatous inflammation of the arterial media occurs in temporal (giant cell) arteritis, the most common form of systemic vasculitis in adults. This condition typically affects patients age >50 and causes headache, facial pain, jaw claudication, and visual loss.\n\n(Choice B) Hyaline arteriolosclerosis involves homogeneous deposition of hyaline material in the intima and media of small arteries and arterioles, typically in patients with hypertension or diabetes mellitus (both absent in this patient). The underlying structure of the vessel wall is maintained, but the intima is thickened and the arterial lumen narrowed.\n\n(Choice D) Medial band-like calcifications occur in medial calcific sclerosis (Mönckeberg arteriosclerosis). The condition is characterized by calcified deposits in muscular arteries and typically affects individuals age >50. Although visible radiologically and often palpable on physical examination, these calcifications are clinically asymptomatic because they do not narrow the vessel lumen.\n\n(Choice E) Onion-like concentric thickening of arteriolar walls due to layers of smooth muscle cells and reduplicated basement membrane is seen in hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis, which can occur in severe chronic hypertension (eg, blood pressure >180/120 mm Hg). Although arterioles in all tissues may be affected, those in the kidneys, retinas, and intestines are most common; skeletal muscle is less likely to be symptomatically involved.\n\nEducational objective:\nIntermittent claudication describes muscle pain that is reproducibly caused by exercise and relieved by rest; it occurs due to atherosclerotic stenoses (lipid-filled intimal plaques) in the large arteries that prevent sufficient blood flow to exercising muscle. The lower extremities are most commonly affected; however, proximal lesions (ie, aortoiliac occlusion) can cause gluteal claudication and/or impotence.",
    "zh": "该患者的肌肉疼痛，在运动时发生，休息时缓解，与间歇性跛行一致；吸烟是一个重要的危险因素。跛行通常是由于大动脉的动脉粥样硬化，特别是由于富含脂质的内膜斑块突入动脉腔（粥样硬化斑）引起的固定性狭窄。这些狭窄阻止了运动期间流向肌肉的血流量的充分增加，导致缺血性肌肉疼痛。疼痛通过休息迅速缓解，因为残余血流足以满足静止肌肉的代谢需求，但不能满足运动肌肉的需求。\n\n大腿跛行提示同侧髂外动脉或其远端分支（即股总动脉、股浅动脉、股深动脉）的闭塞性疾病。伴随的阳痿和/或臀部跛行提示更近端的主动脉髂动脉闭塞（所谓的Leriche综合征），除了影响髂外动脉外，还减少了流向髂内动脉的阴部和臀部支的血流。\n\n(选项A) 动脉中层的肉芽肿性炎症发生在颞动脉炎（巨细胞动脉炎）中，后者是成人中最常见的全身性血管炎。这种情况通常影响年龄>50岁的患者，并引起头痛、面部疼痛、下颌跛行和视力丧失。\n\n(选项B) 玻璃样变性小动脉硬化涉及小动脉和微动脉内膜和中膜中玻璃样物质的均匀沉积，通常发生在患有高血压或糖尿病的患者中（该患者两者均未出现）。血管壁的潜在结构保持不变，但内膜增厚，动脉腔变窄。\n\n(选项D) 动脉中层带状钙化发生在动脉中层钙化硬化（ Mönckeberg 动脉硬化）中。该病症的特征是肌肉动脉中的钙化沉积，通常影响年龄>50岁的个体。虽然在影像学上可见，并且通常可以在体格检查中触及，但这些钙化在临床上是无症状的，因为它们不会使血管腔变窄。\n\n(选项E) 由于平滑肌细胞层和重复的基底膜，小动脉壁的洋葱皮样同心性增厚见于增生性小动脉硬化，这可能发生在严重慢性高血压（例如，血压>180/120 mm Hg）中。虽然所有组织的微动脉都可能受到影响，但肾脏、视网膜和肠道的微动脉最为常见；骨骼肌不太可能出现症状性受累。\n\n教学目标：\n间歇性跛行描述的是由运动可重复引起的、休息后缓解的肌肉疼痛；它发生在由于大动脉中的动脉粥样硬化性狭窄（富含脂质的内膜斑块）而导致运动肌肉的血流不足的情况下。下肢最常受影响；然而，近端病变（即主动脉髂动脉闭塞）可引起臀部跛行和/或阳痿。"
