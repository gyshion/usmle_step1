    "en": "42-year-old woman comes to the clinic due to a lesion on the left side of her chest. The lesion first appeared several months ago and is slowly enlarging and occasionally oozing blood. The patient underwent a living-donor kidney transplant 5 years ago for end-stage renal disease due to IgA nephropathy. She also has hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto thyroiditis. Medications include tacrolimus, mycophenolate, low-dose prednisone, and levothyroxine. Vital signs are normal. On physical examination, a 1 x 2 cm crusted lesion is noted over the midsternal area. Biopsy of the lesion is performed; histopathology findings are shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}.",

    "en": "Microscopy of this patient's enlarging, crusted skin lesion reveals invasive nests of atypical cells surrounding keratin pearls, which is consistent with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Although risk of cutaneous SCC is increased by solar damage, chronic inflammation, and ionizing radiation, the primary driver of malignancy in this patient is likely the use of IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE medications (eg, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, prednisone). The innate and adaptive immune responses play a crucial role in the control of neoplasms, as follows:\n\n- Natural killer cells, a component of the innate immune system, destroy host cells with surface markers signaling damage or distress and cells deficient in self markers such as class I major histocompatibility complexes (MHC).\n- Cytotoxic T-cells identify tumor neoantigens on the surface of cancer cells and destroy the cell with cytotoxic granules.\n- Helper T-cells identify tumor neoantigens on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and secrete effector cytokines (eg, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha) that promote anti-tumor immune activity.\n\nPatients who are immunosuppressed from medications or infections (eg, HIV) are at increased risk for malignancy due to reduced immunosurveillance by natural killer cells and the cell-mediated immune response. Reduced immunosurveillance allows malignant cells to avoid immunologic identification with fewer evasive adaptations; it also allows oncogenic viruses to replicate in an unchecked fashion, which can trigger malignancy.\n\n(Choice B) Peripheral T-cell tolerance (anergy) occurs when a T-cell binds to its complementary antigen on surface MHC molecules but does not undergo costimulation. Cancer cells often overexpress molecules (eg, CTLA-4) that bind up surface proteins (CD80/86) required for T-cell costimulation, which increases (not decreases) peripheral T-cell tolerance.\n\n(Choice C) Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences at the end of chromosomes that shorten progressively with cellular division, leading to chromosomal instability. Most tumors increase (not decrease) the activity of telomerase, an enzyme that adds nucleotides to the telomere in order to counteract shortening.\n\n(Choice D) Tumors produce cytokines that impede the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages in the tumor microenvironment, which helps prevent phagocytosis and destruction of tumor cells.\n\n(Choice E) Tumor cells typically decrease (not increase) expression of class I MHC in order to reduce display of neoantigens on their surface; this limits the ability of cytotoxic T-cells to identify tumor antigens on the cell surface.\n\nEducational objective:\nNatural killer cells and the cell mediated immune response play a major role in cancer cell detection and destruction. Therefore, patients who are immunocompromised from medication or infection are at much higher risk for cancer. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者不断增大的、结痂的皮肤病变的显微镜检查显示，非典型细胞的浸润巢包绕着角蛋白珍珠，这与皮肤鳞状细胞癌（SCC）一致。虽然皮肤SCC的风险会因日晒损伤、慢性炎症和电离辐射而增加，但该患者恶性肿瘤的主要驱动因素可能是使用免疫抑制药物（如他克莫司、霉酚酸酯、泼尼松）。 固有免疫反应和适应性免疫反应在控制肿瘤中起关键作用，如下所示：\n\n- 固有免疫系统的一个组成部分——自然杀伤细胞（NK细胞），会破坏具有表面标记（表明损伤或窘迫）和缺乏自身标记（如I类主要组织相容性复合物（MHC））的宿主细胞。\n- 细胞毒性T细胞识别癌细胞表面的肿瘤新抗原，并通过细胞毒性颗粒破坏细胞。\n- 辅助T细胞识别抗原呈递细胞表面的肿瘤新抗原，并分泌效应细胞因子（如干扰素γ、肿瘤坏死因子α），从而促进抗肿瘤免疫活性。\n\n由于NK细胞和细胞介导的免疫反应的免疫监视降低，使用药物或感染（如HIV）而免疫抑制的患者发生恶性肿瘤的风险增加。免疫监视降低使恶性细胞能够避免免疫识别，减少规避性适应；它还允许致癌病毒以不受控制的方式复制，这可能触发恶性肿瘤。\n\n（选项B）当T细胞与其在表面MHC分子上的互补抗原结合，但未发生共刺激时，就会发生外周T细胞耐受（无反应）。癌细胞通常过度表达与T细胞共刺激所需的表面蛋白（CD80/86）结合的分子（如CTLA-4），这会增加（而不是降低）外周T细胞耐受。\n\n（选项C）端粒是染色体末端的重复DNA序列，会随着细胞分裂而逐渐缩短，从而导致染色体不稳定。大多数肿瘤会增加（而不是减少）端粒酶的活性，端粒酶是一种将核苷酸添加到端粒中以抵消缩短的酶。\n\n（选项D）肿瘤会产生细胞因子，从而阻碍单核细胞在肿瘤微环境中分化为巨噬细胞，这有助于阻止肿瘤细胞的吞噬和破坏。\n\n（选项E）肿瘤细胞通常会降低（而不是增加）I类MHC的表达，以减少其表面新抗原的显示；这限制了细胞毒性T细胞识别细胞表面肿瘤抗原的能力。\n\n教育目标：\nNK细胞和细胞介导的免疫反应在癌细胞检测和破坏中起主要作用。因此，因药物或感染而免疫功能低下的患者患癌症的风险要高得多。{{exhibit_2}}"
