    "en": "A 64-year-old man is evaluated for persistent fever and weakness. He has a history of aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis. Physical examination reveals a new cardiac murmur with scattered petechiae and splinter hemorrhages seen on his extremities. Echocardiogram shows a vegetation involving one of the aortic valve leaflets, and blood cultures grow enterococci. As part of the patient's treatment, 240 mg of intravenous gentamicin is started. The pharmacy calculates that, in this patient, gentamicin has a volume of distribution of 30 L, a half-life of 4 hours, and demonstrates first-order and one-compartment kinetics.",

    "en": "Optimal antibiotic therapy often requires monitoring of serum drug concentrations to ensure adequate dosing, which is necessary to achieve therapeutic levels while avoiding toxicity (eg, nephrotoxicity due to aminoglycosides). The highest level (peak) of drug concentration is usually ½ hour after intravenous or 1 hour after intramuscular dosing, whereas the lowest drug concentration (trough) occurs during the last ½ hour before the next dose.\n\nThe drug concentration (mg/L) can be calculated by dividing the drug dose (mg) by the volume of distribution (Vd). Vd refers to the theoretically required volume (in liters) if the drug were contained completely in the plasma. It can vary depending on how well the drug distributes into tissues; the higher the Vd, the greater the drug binds to the tissues. When drug metabolism occurs via first-order kinetics, the half-life (t½) represents the amount of time required to lower the drug concentration by 50%.\n\nIn this example, the first dose of the drug is 240 mg, Vd is 30 L, and t½ is 4 hours. The initial drug concentration is the dose (240 mg) divided by the Vd (30 L), which equals 8 mg/L. After the first half-life (4 hours), the drug concentration will decrease by half to 4 mg/L. After the next half-life (4 hours later, or 8 hours after the initial dose), the drug concentration will decrease by half again to 2 mg/L (Choices A, B, C, and E).\n\nEducational objective: The half-life (t½) of a drug is the time required to lower its concentration by 50%. The volume of distribution (Vd) refers to how well the drug distributes into tissues compared to plasma; the higher the Vd, the greater the drug distribution into the tissues. The drug concentration (mg/L) is equal to drug dose (mg) divided by Vd (L).",
    "zh": "最佳的抗生素治疗通常需要监测血清药物浓度，以确保适当的剂量，这对于达到治疗水平同时避免毒性（例如，由于氨基糖苷类药物引起的肾毒性）是必要的。药物浓度最高水平（峰值）通常在静脉注射后半小时或肌内注射后1小时，而最低药物浓度（谷浓度）发生在下次给药前的最后半小时。\n\n药物浓度（mg/L）可以通过将药物剂量（mg）除以分布容积（Vd）来计算。Vd是指如果药物完全包含在血浆中，理论上所需的体积（升）。它可以根据药物在组织中的分布情况而变化；Vd越高，药物与组织的结合越多。当药物代谢通过一级动力学发生时，半衰期（t½）代表将药物浓度降低50%所需的时间。\n\n在本例中，第一剂药物为240 mg，Vd为30 L，t½为4小时。初始药物浓度为剂量（240 mg）除以Vd（30 L），等于8 mg/L。在第一个半衰期（4小时）后，药物浓度将减半至4 mg/L。在下一个半衰期（4小时后，或初始剂量后8小时）后，药物浓度将再次减半至2 mg/L（选项A、B、C和E）。\n\n教学目标：药物的半衰期（t½）是将药物浓度降低50%所需的时间。分布容积（Vd）是指药物在组织中与血浆相比的分布情况；Vd越高，药物在组织中的分布越大。药物浓度（mg/L）等于药物剂量（mg）除以Vd（L）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of pharmacokinetic principles, specifically the calculation of drug concentration at a given time point based on dose, volume of distribution, and half-life, as well as the concept of first-order kinetics and one-compartment models. It assesses the ability to apply these principles to determine the trough concentration of an aminoglycoside antibiotic.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first calculate the initial peak drug concentration using the provided dose and volume of distribution. Then, using the drug's half-life and the time elapsed until the next dose, the concentration can be progressively halved to determine the trough concentration. Understanding the relationship between half-life and drug elimination is crucial for accurate calculation.",
