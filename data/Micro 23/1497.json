Physical examination of the children shows bilateral conjunctival injection and an erythematous oropharynx. Auscultation of one child also reveals crackles in the left lower lung field. All the children's symptoms improve over 7 days with supportive care. {{exhibit_1}}",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Adenovirus infection is a common, usually self-limiting, disease caused by a double-stranded DNA genome that is transmitted via direct contact, fecal-oral route, or respiratory droplets. Adenovirus infection occurs year-round and in outbreaks in crowded quarters (eg, day care centers, camp dormitories, military barracks).\n\nViral replication in epithelial cells can give rise to varying manifestations of disease based on serotype, with upper respiratory involvement as the most common. PHARYNGOCONJUNCTIVAL FEVER is characterized by the acute onset of fever, cough, congestion, pharyngitis, and conjunctivitis. Physical examination usually reveals an erythematous oropharynx with bilateral, conjunctival injection (ie, conjunctival blood vessel enlargement) and serous discharge. Pneumonia occurs in a small percentage of patients, such as the child with focal crackles.\n\n(Choice B) In young children, hand-foot-and-mouth disease is caused by coxsackievirus. Painful vesicles develop in the oropharynx and on the hands (eg, palms, dorsal fingers) and feet (eg, soles, sides). Coxsackievirus can also cause herpangina, an illness characterized by fever with posterior pharyngeal vesicles and without a rash.\n\n(Choice C) Influenza viruses cause acute onset of high fever, cough, muscle aches, and malaise with a peak incidence during the winter. In children, infection can be complicated by febrile seizures, vomiting, acute otitis media, and pneumonia.\n\n(Choice D) Norovirus causes rapid-onset, self-limiting gastroenteritis in outbreak settings (eg, restaurants, child care facilities, cruise ships). In addition to vomiting and diarrhea, fever, headache, and malaise are common.\n\n(Choice E) Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) in school-aged children and presents with fever, malaise, and a classic \"slapped cheek\" rash.\n\n(Choice F) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) classically causes lower respiratory tract disease (eg, bronchiolitis, pneumonia) in infants. Although older children and adults can develop respiratory infection and outbreaks can occur in close quarters, RSV is a seasonal virus that peaks in the winter months.\n\nEducational objective: Adenovirus is a self-limiting, year-round infection that causes the acute onset of fever, cough, congestion, pharyngitis, and conjunctivitis. This pharyngoconjunctival disease can occur in outbreaks among those living in close quarters (eg, camp dormitories, military barracks). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "腺病毒感染是一种常见的、通常为自限性的疾病，由双链DNA基因组引起，通过直接接触、粪口途径或呼吸道飞沫传播。腺病毒感染全年发生，并在拥挤的场所（例如，日托中心、营地宿舍、军营）中爆发。\n\n病毒在上皮细胞中的复制可根据血清型引起不同的疾病表现，以上呼吸道受累最为常见。咽结膜热的特征是急性起病，发烧、咳嗽、充血、咽炎和结膜炎。体格检查通常显示咽部发红，双侧结膜充血（即，结膜血管扩张）和浆液性分泌物。少数患者会发生肺炎，例如出现局灶性爆裂音的儿童。\n\n(选项 B) 在年幼的儿童中，手足口病由柯萨奇病毒引起。疼痛性水疱会在咽部和手（例如，手掌、手背）和足部（例如，足底、侧面）出现。柯萨奇病毒也可引起疱疹性咽峡炎，这是一种以发烧伴后咽水疱为特征的疾病，并且没有皮疹。\n\n(选项 C) 流感病毒引起高烧、咳嗽、肌肉酸痛和不适，高峰发生在冬季。在儿童中，感染可能并发热性惊厥、呕吐、急性中耳炎和肺炎。\n\n(选项 D) 诺如病毒可在爆发环境中（例如，餐馆、儿童保育机构、游轮）引起快速发病、自限性胃肠炎。除了呕吐和腹泻外，发烧、头痛和不适也很常见。\n\n(选项 E) B19细小病毒在学龄儿童中引起传染性红斑（第五病），表现为发烧、不适和经典的“拍打脸颊”皮疹。\n\n(选项 F) 呼吸道合胞病毒 (RSV) 典型地引起婴儿的下呼吸道疾病（例如，细支气管炎、肺炎）。虽然年龄较大的儿童和成人可能会发生呼吸道感染，并且可以在封闭场所发生爆发，但 RSV 是一种季节性病毒，在冬季达到高峰。\n\n教育目标：腺病毒是一种自限性、全年感染，可引起急性起病，发烧、咳嗽、充血、咽炎和结膜炎。这种咽结膜疾病可在居住在拥挤场所（例如，营地宿舍、军营）的人群中爆发。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of common viral infections presenting with upper respiratory symptoms and conjunctivitis, particularly in outbreak settings like summer camps. The key is to recognize the constellation of fever, cough, congestion, sore throat, red eyes, and crackles in the lung field as suggestive of adenovirus infection. \n\nTo solve this question, consider the epidemiological context (summer camp outbreak), the specific symptoms (pharyngoconjunctival fever), and the typical seasonality of other viral infections. Rule out options based on their distinct clinical presentations (e.g., hand-foot-and-mouth disease, gastroenteritis, slapped cheek rash).",
