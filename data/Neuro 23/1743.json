    "en": "A 53-year-old man is evaluated for right hand discomfort. A month ago, the patient started to experience an intermittent pins-and-needles sensation in his right hand that is worse at night. He has no neck pain or history of trauma. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years and has worked as an accountant for the past 30 years. On physical examination, there is loss of sensation over the right fifth digit. There is no swelling, redness, or warmth of the hand. ",

    "en": "The ulnar nerve {{exhibit_1}} originates from the medial cord of the brachial plexus, courses with the brachial artery in the upper arm, and enters the forearm after passing posterior to the medial epicondyle of the humerus (cubital tunnel). It innervates the flexor carpi ulnaris (wrist flexion and adduction) and the medial portion of the flexor digitorum profundus before entering the wrist through Guyon canal (between the hook of the hamate and pisiform). In the hand, the superficial branch of the ulnar nerve provides cutaneous innervation to the fifth digit, medial half of the fourth digit, and the hypothenar eminence. The deep motor branch supplies most of the intrinsic muscles of the hand.\n\nThe ulnar nerve is most commonly injured at the elbow due to chronic compression (eg, working for prolonged periods at a desk) or trauma (eg, medial epicondyle fracture). Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow usually presents with discomfort and loss of sensation and/or paresthesia in the ulnar distribution. Severe injury can also result in impaired flexion and adduction of the wrist along with finger weakness or clumsiness. The nerve can also be injured more distally at the wrist as it runs through Guyon canal; injury at this level results in more pronounced clawing of the fourth and fifth digits (ulnar claw) due to sparing of the flexor digitorum profundus.\n\n(Choices A and E) Radial nerve injury (eg, crutch palsy, midshaft humerus fracture) can result in weakness in elbow and/or wrist extension in addition to sensory loss over the posterior arm, dorsolateral hand, and dorsal thumb.\n\n(Choice B) Axillary nerve injury (eg, anterior shoulder dislocation, surgical neck of humerus fracture) can present with loss of sensation over the lateral upper arm and weakness in shoulder abduction (eg, deltoid weakness).\n\n(Choice C) Proximal median nerve injury (eg, subcondylar humerus fracture) can result in impaired flexion and abduction of the wrist, flexion of the second and/or third digit, and flexion or opposition of the thumb along with palmar sensory loss involving the first 3 digits.\n\nEducational objective:\nUlnar nerve injury most commonly occurs at the elbow (eg, compression due to resting arm on a hard surface for prolonged periods) and usually presents with discomfort and sensory loss and/or paresthesia in the fifth digit, medial half of the fourth digit, and the hypothenar eminence. In severe injury, patients can also have impaired wrist flexion and adduction along with finger weakness or clumsiness. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of ulnar nerve anatomy, function, and common injury patterns leading to specific motor and sensory deficits. It requires correlating the patient's symptoms (paresthesia in the fifth digit) with the expected motor weakness (wrist adduction) associated with ulnar nerve damage. \n\nTo solve this question, recall the ulnar nerve's innervation pattern and the muscles it controls. Recognize that sensory loss in the fifth digit and impaired wrist adduction are characteristic of ulnar nerve pathology, often due to compression at the elbow.",
