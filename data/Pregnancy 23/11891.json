    "en": "A 36-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, at 38 weeks gestation comes to the hospital in active labor, dilated to 10 cm. She has received no prenatal care this pregnancy. Her prior pregnancy resulted in an uncomplicated cesarean delivery. On admission, temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg, and pulse is 94/min. The patient precipitously delivers an infant weighing 4.1 kg (9 lb 2 oz). After delivery of the infant, small placental fragments are removed in pieces via manual extraction. Profuse vaginal bleeding occurs, and intravenous lines are placed. Uterotonic medications are administered and vigorous uterine massage is performed. The uterine fundus is firm, but the bleeding continues. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ongoing vaginal bleeding?",
    "zh": "一名36岁的女性，孕2产1，孕38周，因活跃的产程来到医院，宫口开10厘米。她本次怀孕没有接受产前护理。她之前的怀孕结果为一次无并发症的剖腹产。入院时，体温36.7摄氏度（98.1华氏度），血压132/84毫米汞柱，脉搏94次/分钟。患者迅速分娩出一个体重4.1千克（9磅2盎司）的婴儿。婴儿分娩后，通过手动取出方式分批移除小块胎盘碎片。出现大量阴道出血，并放置静脉输液管。给予宫缩剂并进行积极的子宫按摩。子宫底部坚硬，但出血仍在继续。以下哪项最可能是该患者持续阴道出血的原因？"

    "en": "This patient's POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE (PPH) is likely due to PLACENTAL INVASION INTO THE MYOMETRIUM, which characterizes PLACENTA ACCRETA spectrum. The disease range is defined by depth of placental invasion: placenta accreta (attachment to the myometrium), placenta increta (invasion into the myometrium), and placenta percreta (invasion through the myometrium and serosa). Placenta accreta disorders occur due to placental invasion through defects in the DECIDUA BASALIS of the endometrium, which are commonly caused by uterine scarring from prior uterine surgery (eg, CESAREAN DELIVERY, dilation and curettage). The absence of an intact decidual layer and subsequent direct placental attachment to the myometrium makes for a difficult placental delivery. Usually, manual placental extraction is attempted but yields only SMALL PLACENTAL FRAGMENTS due to dense adhesions between the placenta and the uterus that BLEED PROFUSELY if injured.\n(Choice A) Uterine rupture, a full-thickness myometrial disruption, can cause vaginal bleeding; however, patients typically have antepartum (not postpartum) bleeding and intense abdominal pain. It would not cause difficulty with placental detachment.\n(Choice B) Abruptio placentae is premature placental separation from the uterus; it can occur secondary to hypertension-induced placental vessel rupture. Unlike placenta accreta, abruptio placentae causes antepartum bleeding and promotes, rather than delays, placental detachment.\n(Choice C) Uterine atony (ie, poor uterine contractility) is the most common cause of PPH and typically presents with a soft, boggy uterine fundus. This patient's firm uterine fundus and unresponsiveness to uterotonic medications (which contract the uterus) make this diagnosis less likely.\n(Choice D) Intraamniotic infection can cause vaginal bleeding and an inflamed, adherent placenta. However, the anatomic plane between the placenta and uterus remains intact and therefore does not cause placental fragmentation. In addition, this patient has no fever or purulent amniotic fluid, making this diagnosis unlikely.\nEducational objective:\nPlacenta accreta spectrum occurs due to placental invasion into the myometrium through defects in the decidua basalis. This creates a morbidly adherent placenta that does not detach after fetal delivery, leading to postpartum hemorrhage. Manual placental extraction typically yields small placental fragments and increases bleeding.",
    "zh": "该患者的产后出血（PPH）很可能由于胎盘侵入子宫肌层，这概括了前置胎盘附着异常的范围。疾病范围由胎盘侵入的深度定义：胎盘植入（附着于子宫肌层），胎盘侵入（侵入子宫肌层）和胎盘穿透（侵入子宫肌层和浆膜层）。胎盘植入异常是由于胎盘通过子宫内膜的基底蜕膜的缺陷侵入引起的，通常由先前子宫手术（例如，剖腹产，扩张和刮宫术）引起的子宫瘢痕形成引起。缺少完整的蜕膜层以及随后胎盘直接附着于子宫肌层，使得胎盘分娩变得困难。通常，尝试手动胎盘取出，但由于胎盘和子宫之间的致密粘连，仅产生小的胎盘碎片，如果受损，会大量出血。\n（选项A）子宫破裂，全层子宫肌层破裂，可引起阴道出血；然而，患者通常有产前（而非产后）出血和剧烈腹痛。它不会导致胎盘分离困难。\n（选项B）胎盘早剥是胎盘过早与子宫分离；它可能继发于高血压引起的胎盘血管破裂。与胎盘植入不同，胎盘早剥会导致产前出血并促进而非延迟胎盘分离。\n（选项C）子宫收缩乏力（即，子宫收缩不良）是PPH最常见的原因，通常表现为柔软、水肿的子宫底部。该患者的子宫底部坚硬且对宫缩剂（收缩子宫）无反应，使得该诊断不太可能。\n（选项D）羊膜腔内感染可导致阴道出血和发炎、粘连的胎盘。然而，胎盘和子宫之间的解剖平面保持完整，因此不会导致胎盘碎片形成。此外，该患者没有发烧或脓性羊水，使得该诊断不太可能。\n教育目标：\n前置胎盘附着异常是由于胎盘通过基底蜕膜的缺陷侵入子宫肌层引起的。这会产生一种病态粘连的胎盘，分娩后不会分离，导致产后出血。手动胎盘取出通常会产生小的胎盘碎片并增加出血。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the causes of postpartum hemorrhage, specifically focusing on the differential diagnosis when the uterus is firm but bleeding persists after manual removal of placental fragments. It assesses the ability to differentiate between uterine atony, retained placental fragments, uterine rupture, and placental invasion disorders.\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the key clinical features: postpartum hemorrhage, firm uterine fundus, and bleeding despite uterotonics and manual extraction of placental fragments. This pattern points away from uterine atony and retained fragments. Considering the history of a prior cesarean delivery and the difficulty with placental separation, placental invasion (placenta accreta spectrum) becomes the most likely diagnosis.",
