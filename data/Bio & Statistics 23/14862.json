    "en": "Researchers want to estimate the association between environmental lead exposure and cognitive deficits in children. Among all children who received preventive care at 5 local pediatric clinics over the last 5 years, they identify 20 children diagnosed with cognitive deficits and 40 without the diagnosis. The researchers then review the patients' medical records and calculate the distance between the patients' residence and known lead-contaminated geographic areas.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "A CASE-CONTROL study is an analytical observational design in which potential participants are initially identified as \"CASES\" or \"CONTROLS\" according to an OUTCOME STATUS (i.e. disease of interest). In this example, children diagnosed with cognitive deficits are cases and children without cognitive deficits are controls. Once identified, cases and controls are then ASSESSED RETROSPECTIVELY for exposure to RISK FACTORS of interest. In this case, the risk factor of interest is environmental lead exposure, as measured by the distance between the patients' residence and known lead-contaminated areas. Finally, the PREVALENCE OF EXPOSURE to the risk factors (i.e. frequency of exposure) is compared between cases and controls to estimate the ASSOCIATION between the risk factors and the outcomes.",
    "zh": "病例对照研究是一种分析性观察性设计，其中潜在参与者最初根据结果状态（即感兴趣的疾病）被确定为“病例”或“对照”。在本例中，被诊断患有认知缺陷的儿童是病例，而没有认知缺陷的儿童是对照。一旦确定，就会对病例和对照进行回顾性评估，以了解感兴趣的危险因素的暴露情况。在本例中，感兴趣的危险因素是环境铅暴露，通过患者居住地与已知铅污染区域之间的距离来衡量。最后，比较病例和对照之间对危险因素的暴露（即暴露频率）的流行率，以估计危险因素与结果之间的关联。"
