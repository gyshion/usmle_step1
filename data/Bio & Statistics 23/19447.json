    "en": "Researchers at an academic trauma center conducted a randomized clinical trial comparing 2 surgical techniques (Technique A and Technique B) for repairing a mandible fracture. They examined rates of infectious complications and rates of malocclusion (defined as misaligned dental arches on visual examination when the jaw is closed). A total of 100 patients were enrolled in the study. Outcome assessments of each patient were conducted at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after surgery. Results showed that the relative rate of infection with Technique A compared with Technique B was 0.86 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.57-1.28; the 2 techniques had similar malocclusion rates at 8 weeks after surgery.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The **relative risk (RR)** is commonly used in cohort and experimental studies as a measure of **association** between a risk factor or **treatment** and a disease or **outcome**. RR is equal to the risk of an outcome or disease (eg, infection) in a group exposed to a treatment (eg, Treatment A) divided by the risk of the same outcome or disease in a group exposed to a different treatment (eg, Treatment B).\n\nRR = (risk of disease in Treatment A) / (risk of disease in Treatment B)\n\nThe RR may be interpreted as follows:\n\n*   RR < 1.0 indicates that exposure to Treatment A is associated with a decrease in risk of disease with respect to Treatment B.\n*   RR = 1.0 (**null value**) indicates that there is no association between the treatments and risk of disease.\n*   RR > 1.0 indicates that exposure to Treatment A is associated with an increase of risk of disease with respect to Treatment B.\n\nThe **confidence interval (CI)** of a RR indicates, with a certain confidence level, whether a given RR is statistically different from the null value (ie, RR = 1). A CI that **includes the null value** (ie, RR = 1) is **not statistically significant**, and a CI that **excludes** the null value (ie, RR = 1) is **statistically significant** (at that confidence level).\n\nIn this study, the RR for infection among those assigned to surgery Technique A compared to those assigned to surgery Technique B is 0.86 with a 95% CI of 0.57-1.28. An RR = 0.86 indicates that exposure to surgery Technique A decreases the risk of infection. However, because the CI includes the null value (ie, RR = 1), the decrease in risk is **not statistically significant**. Therefore, neither surgery technique is superior at reducing infection (**Choices B and C**).\n\n**(Choice D)** The study results show that the surgery techniques have similar rates of infectious complications and malocclusion. Assuming these rates are acceptable and there are no other major complications, there is no reason to determine the surgical techniques should not be used in a clinical care setting, but further information may be useful.\n\nEducational objective:\n\n*   The relative risk (RR) is a measure of association: RR < 1.0 indicates a lower risk of disease in the exposed group relative to the nonexposed group; RR = 1.0 indicates no association between exposure and disease; and RR > 1.0 indicates a greater risk of disease in the exposed group relative to the nonexposed group.\n*   A confidence interval (CI) that includes the null value for an RR (ie, RR = 1) is not statistically significant, and a CI that excludes the null value (ie, RR = 1) is statistically significant.",
    "zh": "**相对风险 (RR)** 常用于队列研究和实验研究中，作为风险因素或**治疗**与疾病或**结果**之间**关联**的衡量指标。RR 等于暴露于某种治疗（例如，治疗 A）的组中出现某种结果或疾病（例如，感染）的风险，除以暴露于另一种不同治疗（例如，治疗 B）的组中出现相同结果或疾病的风险。\n\nRR = （治疗 A 的疾病风险）/（治疗 B 的疾病风险）\n\nRR 可以解释如下：\n\n*   RR < 1.0 表明，接触治疗 A 与相对于治疗 B 的疾病风险降低有关。\n*   RR = 1.0（**零值**）表明治疗与疾病风险之间没有关联。\n*   RR > 1.0 表明，接触治疗 A 与相对于治疗 B 的疾病风险增加有关。\n\nRR 的**置信区间 (CI)** 以一定的置信水平表明，给定的 RR 在统计学上是否与零值（即，RR = 1）不同。一个**包含零值**（即，RR = 1）的 CI **不具有统计学意义**，而一个**排除**零值（即，RR = 1）的 CI **具有统计学意义**（在该置信水平下）。\n\n在这项研究中，分配到手术技术 A 的患者与分配到手术技术 B 的患者相比，感染的 RR 为 0.86，95% CI 为 0.57-1.28。RR = 0.86 表明，接触手术技术 A 会降低感染风险。然而，由于 CI 包含零值（即，RR = 1），因此风险降低**不具有统计学意义**。因此，两种手术技术在降低感染方面均不占优势（**选项 B 和 C**）。\n\n（**选项 D**）研究结果表明，这些手术技术具有相似的感染并发症和咬合不正发生率。假设这些发生率是可以接受的，并且没有其他主要并发症，则没有理由确定不应在临床护理环境中使用这些手术技术，但可能需要更多信息。\n\n教育目标：\n\n*   相对风险 (RR) 是一种关联衡量指标：RR < 1.0 表明暴露组的疾病风险低于未暴露组；RR = 1.0 表明暴露与疾病之间没有关联；RR > 1.0 表明暴露组的疾病风险更大。\n*   一个包含 RR 零值（即，RR = 1）的置信区间 (CI) 不具有统计学意义，而一个排除 RR 零值（即，RR = 1）的 CI 具有统计学意义。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of relative risk and confidence intervals in the context of a clinical trial comparing two surgical techniques. It assesses the ability to interpret the statistical significance of the results based on whether the confidence interval includes the null value. \n\nThe key to solving this question is to recognize that a confidence interval including 1.0 (the null value for relative risk) indicates that the difference between the two techniques is not statistically significant. Therefore, neither technique can be considered superior based on the given data.",
