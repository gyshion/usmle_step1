    "en": "A 38-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 0, at 32 weeks gestation comes to the office due to a progressively worsening headache. The patient also reports increased leg swelling and a 4.54-kg (10-lb) weight gain since her last visit 2 weeks ago. She has no chronic medical conditions, and her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Review of medical records shows that blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg at 30 weeks gestation. Today, blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. There is 2+ pitting edema to the knees. Serum creatinine is 0.9 mg/dL. Which of the following findings would most likely be present in this patient's urinalysis?",

    "en": "This patient with a worsening headache and NEW-ONSET HYPERTENSION (ie, systolic ≥ 140 or diastolic ≥ 90 mm Hg) after 20 weeks gestation has preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is most likely caused by narrowed uteroplacental spiral artery formation and abnormal placentation, which lead to placental hypoperfusion and ischemia. These changes trigger the release of antiangiogenic factors that cause widespread maternal vasoconstriction (eg, hypertension), endothelial cell damage (eg, third spacing with edema and weight gain), and END-ORGAN DAMAGE (eg, headache).\n\nThe kidneys are commonly affected by preeclampsia, and URINALYSIS can support the diagnosis:\n\n*   Third spacing (ie, intravascular volume depletion) and vasoconstriction of the renal vessels result in decreased urine production (ie, oliguria) and concentrated urine (ie, INCREASED SPECIFIC GRAVITY) because the kidneys attempt to retain sodium and water.\n*   Damage to the renal endothelium increases glomerular permeability and allows for leakage of large molecules, as evidenced by PROTEINURIA, which is classic for preeclampsia.\n*   Renal vasoconstriction causes a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and an INCREASED SERUM CREATININE LEVEL (above baseline). Healthy pregnant patients have decreased baseline serum creatinine levels due to blood volume expansion and increased GFR; therefore, a normal-appearing creatinine level (0.7-0.9 mg/dL) during pregnancy, as seen in this patient, typically indicates renal compromise.\n\nDefinitive management of preeclampsia is with delivery, and renal function typically recovers postpartum.\n\n(Choices A and B) Decreased urine specific gravity (ie, decreased concentration of urine solutes) is associated with excessive fluid intake (eg, primary polydipsia) or diabetes insipidus. It is not associated with hypertension in pregnancy.\n\n(Choices C, E, and F) Microscopic hematuria (ie, red blood cells on urinalysis) is typically associated with urinary tract disease, such as infection, kidney or bladder cancer, and renal calculus. Hematuria is not associated with hypertension in pregnancy.\n\nEducational objective:\nPreeclampsia is new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks gestation with signs of end-organ damage (eg, headache). Renal effects of preeclampsia include oliguria with increased specific gravity, proteinuria, and serum creatinine levels.",
    "zh": "这位患者出现头痛加重和新发高血压（即，收缩压 ≥ 140 mmHg 或舒张压 ≥ 90 mmHg），发生在妊娠 20 周后，提示子痫前期。子痫前期最可能由子宫胎盘螺旋动脉形成狭窄和胎盘异常所致，这会导致胎盘灌注不足和缺血。这些变化会触发抗血管生成因子的释放，导致广泛的母体血管收缩（如高血压）、内皮细胞损伤（如水肿和体重增加引起的第三间隙积液）和终末器官损伤（如头痛）。\n\n肾脏通常会受到子痫前期的影响，尿液分析可以支持诊断：\n\n*   第三间隙积液（即，血管内血容量减少）和肾血管收缩导致尿量减少（即，少尿）和尿液浓缩（即，比重增加），因为肾脏试图保留钠和水。\n*   肾脏内皮损伤增加了肾小球通透性，并允许大分子渗漏，这可以通过蛋白尿来证明，而蛋白尿是子痫前期的典型表现。\n*   肾血管收缩导致肾小球滤过率 (GFR) 降低和血清肌酐水平升高（高于基线）。健康的孕妇由于血容量扩张和 GFR 增加，其基线血清肌酐水平会降低；因此，在妊娠期间，出现正常的肌酐水平（0.7-0.9 mg/dL）（如该患者所示），通常表明肾功能受损。\n\n子痫前期的明确治疗方法是分娩，肾功能通常在产后恢复。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）尿比重降低（即，尿液溶质浓度降低）与过量饮水（如原发性烦渴症）或尿崩症有关。它与妊娠高血压无关。\n\n（选项 C、E 和 F）镜下血尿（即，尿液分析中的红细胞）通常与尿路疾病有关，如感染、肾癌或膀胱癌以及肾结石。血尿与妊娠高血压无关。\n\n教育目标：\n子痫前期是指妊娠 20 周后出现新发高血压，伴有终末器官损伤的体征（如头痛）。子痫前期的肾脏影响包括少尿伴尿比重升高、蛋白尿和血清肌酐水平升高。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of preeclampsia, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, and its associated clinical findings, particularly those found on urinalysis. It requires integrating patient presentation with diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia and recognizing how renal involvement manifests in this condition.\n\nTo solve this question, first identify the signs and symptoms suggestive of preeclampsia, such as new-onset hypertension, headache, edema, and weight gain in the third trimester. Then, recall the typical urinalysis findings in preeclampsia, which include increased specific gravity (due to oliguria and concentrated urine) and proteinuria (due to glomerular damage). Evaluate each option based on these expected findings.",
