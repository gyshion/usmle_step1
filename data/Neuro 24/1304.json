    "en": "Schwannomas are tumors of the peripheral nervous system that arise from Schwann cells. Microscopically, they appear biphasic with highly cellular areas (Antoni A pattern) intermixed with myxoid regions of low cellularity (Antoni B pattern). The Antoni A areas are composed of spindle cells with elongated, wavy nuclei that form palisading patterns with interspersing nuclear-free zones called Verocay bodies. Schwannomas are universally S-100 positive due to their neural crest cell origin. Another important S-100 positive tumor is melanoma (also derived from the neural crest).\n\nSchwann cells are to the peripheral nervous system as oligodendrocytes are to the central nervous system: both protect and insulate axons. The transition from oligodendrocytes to Schwann cells occurs within a few millimeters from the surface of the brain and spinal cord. Therefore, schwannomas can occur within the cranial vault and spinal canal. Schwannomas may arise from any cranial nerve except the optic nerve (CN II) and olfactory nerve (CN I), which are not covered by Schwann cells.\n\nThe most common site of intracranial schwannomas is the cerebellopontine angle at CN VIII. Schwannomas in this particular location are also called acoustic neuromas, and can present with tinnitus, vertigo, and sensorineural hearing loss.\n\n(Choice A) Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor that consists of bizarre-looking glial cells with multiple mitotic figures, pseudopalisading necrosis, and abundant neovascularization and hemorrhage. It commonly occurs in the frontotemporalporietal white matter and grows along the white matter tracts across the corpus callosum to affect the opposite hemisphere.\n\n(Choice B) Meningiomas are typically slow-growing extra-axial tumors that arise from the meningothelial cells of the arachnoid. Meningiomas most commonly appear as cells arranged in lobules or whorls with or without psammoma bodies (laminar calcifications).\n\n(Choice C) Brain metastases are the most common cause of intracranial tumors in adults. Lung, breast, skin (melanoma), and renal cancer are particularly likely to metastasize to the brain. Metastatic brain lesions typically form well-circumscribed masses along the grey-white junction. Histologically, there is often necrosis with surrounding areas of reactive gliosis and edema.\n\n(Choice D) Optic glioma is a form of glioma that affects the optic nerve. It is often found in association with Neurofibromatosis type 1. Histologic findings are usually consistent with pilocytic astrocytoma and include tumor cells with hairlike processes, microcystic areas, and Rosenthal fibers (elongated or corkscrew intracytoplasmic eosinophilic bundles).\n\nEducational objective:\nSchwannomas present histologically with a biphasic pattern of cellularity (Antoni A and B areas) and S-100 positivity (indicating neural crest origin). Schwannomas can arise from the peripheral nerves, nerve roots, and cranial nerves (except CN II and CN I). Acoustic neuromas are the most common type of intracranial schwannoma and are located at the cerebellopontine angle at CN VIII.",
    "zh": "神经鞘瘤是起源于雪旺细胞的周围神经系统肿瘤。在显微镜下，它们呈双相性，具有高细胞区域（Antoni A型）与低细胞性的黏液样区域（Antoni B型）混合。Antoni A区域由梭形细胞组成，这些细胞具有细长、波浪状的核，形成栅栏状模式，并穿插着称为Verocay小体的无核区。神经鞘瘤因其神经嵴细胞起源而普遍呈S-100阳性。另一种重要的S-100阳性肿瘤是黑色素瘤（也源自神经嵴）。\n\n雪旺细胞之于周围神经系统，就像少突胶质细胞之于中枢神经系统：两者都保护和绝缘轴突。从少突胶质细胞到雪旺细胞的转变发生在距离大脑和脊髓表面几毫米之内。因此，神经鞘瘤可以发生在颅腔和脊髓管内。神经鞘瘤可能起源于任何脑神经，除了视神经（CN II）和嗅神经（CN I），它们未被雪旺细胞覆盖。\n\n颅内神经鞘瘤最常见的部位是CN VIII处的脑桥小脑角。在这个特定位置的神经鞘瘤也被称为听神经瘤，可表现为耳鸣、眩晕和感觉神经性听力损失。\n\n（选项A）胶质母细胞瘤是一种高度侵袭性的原发性脑肿瘤，由具有多个有丝分裂像、假栅栏状坏死以及丰富的血管新生和出血的奇形怪状的胶质细胞组成。它通常发生在额颞顶叶白质中，并沿白质束穿过胼胝体生长，影响对侧半球。\n\n（选项B）脑膜瘤通常是生长缓慢的幕外肿瘤，起源于蛛网膜的脑膜内皮细胞。脑膜瘤最常见表现为细胞排列成小叶或涡旋状，伴有或不伴有砂粒体（层状钙化）。\n\n（选项C）脑转移是成人颅内肿瘤最常见的原因。肺癌、乳腺癌、皮肤癌（黑色素瘤）和肾癌特别容易转移到大脑。转移性脑病灶通常沿灰质-白质交界处形成边界清楚的肿块。组织学上，通常有坏死，周围有反应性神经胶质增生和水肿。\n\n（选项D）视神经胶质瘤是一种影响视神经的胶质瘤。它通常与1型神经纤维瘤病相关。组织学发现通常与毛细胞型星形细胞瘤一致，包括具有毛发状突起、微囊性区域和罗森塔尔纤维（细长或螺旋状胞质内嗜酸性束）的肿瘤细胞。\n\n教育目标：\n神经鞘瘤在组织学上表现为双相性细胞模式（Antoni A和B区）和S-100阳性（表明神经嵴起源）。神经鞘瘤可起源于周围神经、神经根和脑神经（CN II和CN I除外）。听神经瘤是最常见的颅内神经鞘瘤，位于CN VIII处的脑桥小脑角。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to diagnose intracranial tumors based on histological features and immunohistochemical staining. Specifically, it assesses knowledge of the characteristic morphology of schwannomas, including their biphasic pattern, cell morphology, and S-100 immunoreactivity, and how these features differentiate them from other common intracranial neoplasms.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully analyze the provided histological description: \"elongated, wavy nuclei,\" \"biphasic pattern of growth,\" \"areas of dense cellularity interspersed with less dense myxoid regions,\" and \"diffuse S-100 immunoreactivity.\" These findings are highly suggestive of a schwannoma. The options provided represent common intracranial tumors, and the correct answer is identified by matching the histological description to the known characteristics of each tumor type.",
