    "en": "A 20-year-old man is evaluated in the clinic for right arm weakness and numbness. He pitches for his college baseball team and threw more than usual last week due to a postseason tournament. Since then, the patient has had difficulty using his right arm, particularly when lifting objects. He has no history of head, neck, or upper extremity trauma. On physical examination, there is diminished strength on right elbow flexion and an absent biceps reflex. This patient is most likely to have sensory loss over which of the following areas?",

    "en": "This patient likely has a MUSCULOCUTANEOUS NERVE injury, which most commonly occurs in the setting of trauma (shoulder dislocation) and can also occur with strenuous upper extremity activity (eg, baseball pitching). The musculocutaneous nerve is derived from the C5-C7 spinal nerve roots and arises from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus. It innervates the coracobrachialis (flexes and adducts the arm) and major elbow flexors (eg, biceps brachii, brachialis). After innervating these muscles, the remaining fibers become the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm and provide SENSORY INNERVATION to the skin of the lateral forearm. In addition to having weakness of elbow flexion and numbness of the lateral forearm, patients with musculocutaneous nerve injury have an absent or weak biceps reflex. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice B) The medial forearm receives sensory innervation from a branch of the medial cord of the brachial plexus, the musculocutaneous nerve of the forearm (also called the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve).\n\n(Choices C and D) The posterior arm and forearm receive sensory innervation from branches of the radial nerve.\n\n(Choice E) The thenar eminence receives sensory innervation from the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve, which arises proximal to the carpal tunnel.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe musculocutaneous nerve innervates the coracobrachialis (flexes and adducts the arm) and the major elbow flexors (eg, biceps brachii, brachialis) and then continues distally to provide sensory innervation to the lateral forearm. It is derived from the upper trunk of the brachial plexus (C5-C7) and can be injured by trauma or strenuous upper extremity exercise.\n\nReferences\n• Peripheral nerve entrapment and injury in the upper extremity.",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the anatomy and function of the musculocutaneous nerve, including its motor and sensory distributions, and common causes of injury. It requires correlating clinical findings such as weakness in elbow flexion, absent biceps reflex, and sensory loss in a specific distribution with a particular nerve injury.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the affected nerve based on the motor deficits (elbow flexion weakness) and reflex changes (absent biceps reflex). Then, recall the sensory distribution of that nerve to determine the area of sensory loss. Considering the mechanism of injury (strenuous pitching) can also help narrow down the possibilities.",
