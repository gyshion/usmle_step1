  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Hospice care is usually provided to terminally ill patients with a prognosis of ≤6 months, when aggressive, curative treatments are no longer beneficial or desired. The largest population receiving hospice care consists of cancer patients, but also includes those with other terminal medical conditions (eg, end-stage cardiomyopathy, end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis). The physician must substantiate a prognosis of ≤6 months with documentation of irreversible decline in clinical and functional status.\n\nHospice care is based on the principle of providing compassionate care that focuses on comfort and quality of life. It is provided by a multidisciplinary team that includes nurses, social workers, chaplains, and a hospice physician who closely coordinates with the patient's attending physician. It can be provided in the patient's own home (home hospice care), a nursing home, or dedicated hospice facility. Hospice services include comfort measures (eg, control of pain and dyspnea) and psychological, spiritual, and bereavement counseling for patients and families.\n\n(Choices A and E) Hospice care is appropriate for patients with any terminal illness provided they have a prognosis of ≤6 months.\n\n(Choice B) Although most patients in hospice care have directives to decline heroic life-sustaining measures, a do-not-resuscitate order is not a prerequisite for receiving hospice services.\n\n(Choice C) Patients who still possess decision-making capacity should participate in decisions regarding hospice care. However, advance directives or surrogate decision makers may handle issues related to hospice care for patients who lack capacity.",
    "zh": "临终关怀通常提供给预后≤6个月的终末期疾病患者，当积极的、治愈性的治疗不再有益或不再被需要时。接受临终关怀的最大人群包括癌症患者，但也包括其他终末期疾病患者（例如，终末期心肌病、终末期慢性阻塞性肺病、肺纤维化）。医生必须通过记录临床和功能状态不可逆转的下降来证实≤6个月的预后。\n\n临终关怀基于提供同情关怀的原则，侧重于舒适度和生活质量。它由一个多学科团队提供，包括护士、社工、牧师和临终关怀医生，他们与患者的主治医生密切协调。它可以在患者家中（家庭临终关怀）、疗养院或专门的临终关怀机构中提供。临终关怀服务包括舒适措施（例如，控制疼痛和呼吸困难）以及针对患者和家属的心理、精神和丧亲咨询。\n\n（选项 A 和 E）临终关怀适用于任何患有终末期疾病的患者，前提是他们的预后≤6个月。\n\n（选项 B）尽管大多数接受临终关怀的患者都指示拒绝英雄主义的生命维持措施，但“不施行复苏”医嘱并不是接受临终关怀服务的先决条件。\n\n（选项 C）仍具有决策能力的患者应参与有关临终关怀的决策。然而，对于缺乏能力的患者，预先指示或替代决策者可以处理与临终关怀相关的问题。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the requirements for hospice referral, specifically the prognosis criteria. Hospice care focuses on quality of life for patients with a limited life expectancy.\n\nThe key to answering this question is recognizing that a prognosis of ≤6 months is a requirement for hospice eligibility. Other factors, such as having a DNR or decision-making capacity, are not mandatory.",
