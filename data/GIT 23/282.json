    "en": "A 49-year-old man comes to the office for evaluation of a dry cough that occurs mainly at night. His symptoms have been present on and off for several years, but he has not been previously evaluated. The patient also reports a frequent sore throat and occasional epigastric discomfort. He has tried a variety of antihistamines and over-the-counter cough medications without relief. Past medical history is notable for obesity and diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. Chest x-ray reveals no abnormalities, and pulmonary function testing is normal. The patient undergoes upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with mucosal biopsies. Microscopic findings on lower esophageal biopsy are shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}.",

    "en": "This patient's persistent dry cough, sore throat, and epigastric discomfort is suggestive of GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE. His esophageal biopsy shows intestinal-type columnar epithelium with goblet cells where a normal esophagus would be lined by stratified squamous epithelium. This finding is diagnostic of BARRETT ESOPHAGUS, which is seen when acidic gastric contents enter the esophagus, causing inflammation and subsequent epithelial necrosis.\n\nSustained epithelial damage promotes metaplastic replacement of the normal stratified squamous epithelium with intestinal-type columnar cells. The transition to columnar epithelium may be seen grossly on endoscopy as tongues of beefy red mucosa extending above the lower esophageal sphincter into areas of normal pale pink squamous mucosa.\n\nPeople with severe and long-standing acid reflux are most prone to Barrett esophagus. This metaplasia is hypothesized to be adaptive at first, as intestinal-type epithelium is more resistant to gastric acid. However, it is a major risk factor for ESOPHAGEAL ADENOCARCINOMA, which typically develops from the metaplastic intestinal epithelium in the distal part of the esophagus.\n\n(Choices A and D) The major risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus are cigarette smoking and alcohol use. Achalasia, an esophageal motility disorder caused by the loss of ganglion cells in the lower esophagus, also carries an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n(Choices C and E) Crohn disease can affect the esophagus, typically causing patchy inflammation, erosions, ulcers, strictures, and fistulas. Esophageal varices develop in the context of high portal venous pressure, most often due to alcohol-induced or post-viral liver cirrhosis. These conditions are not associated with Barrett esophagus.\n\nEducational objective:\nBarrett esophagus is a metaplastic condition in which the normal squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus is replaced by intestinal-type columnar epithelium. It occurs most often in longstanding acid reflux and is associated with an increased risk of adenocarcinoma.",
    "zh": "该患者持续的干咳、咽喉疼痛和上腹部不适提示胃食管反流病。他的食管活检显示，在正常食管会被复层鳞状上皮覆盖的位置，出现了含有杯状细胞的肠型柱状上皮。这一发现诊断为巴雷特食管，这通常见于酸性胃内容物进入食管，引起炎症和随后的上皮坏死。\n\n持续的上皮损伤促进了正常复层鳞状上皮被肠型柱状细胞的化生性替代。在内镜下，柱状上皮的转变可见为呈舌状的鲜红色黏膜延伸到食管下括约肌上方，进入正常淡粉色鳞状黏膜区域。\n\n患有严重和长期酸反流的患者最容易发生巴雷特食管。这种化生最初被认为具有适应性，因为肠型上皮对胃酸更具抵抗力。然而，它是食管腺癌的主要危险因素，腺癌通常由食管远端化生的肠上皮发展而来。\n\n（选项A和D）食管鳞状细胞癌的主要危险因素是吸烟和饮酒。贲门失弛缓症是一种食管动力障碍，由食管下部神经节细胞的丢失引起，也增加了鳞状细胞癌的风险。\n\n（选项C和E）克罗恩病可影响食管，通常引起斑片状炎症、糜烂、溃疡、狭窄和瘘管。食管静脉曲张是在高门静脉压的背景下发生的，通常由于酒精引起的或病毒感染后的肝硬化。这些情况与巴雷特食管无关。\n\n教育目标：\n巴雷特食管是一种化生性疾病，其中远端食管的正常鳞状上皮被肠型柱状上皮取代。它最常发生在长期的酸反流中，并与腺癌的风险增加相关。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Barrett's esophagus, a metaplastic condition caused by chronic acid reflux, and its association with an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The question requires recognizing the histological features of Barrett's esophagus and understanding its clinical implications.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key findings in the patient's history (chronic reflux symptoms) and the biopsy results (intestinal-type columnar epithelium).
