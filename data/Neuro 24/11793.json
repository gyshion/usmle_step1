    "en": "A 56-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to several days of progressive dyspnea, productive cough, and fever. Today, her son found her very short of breath and obtunded. The patient has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and long-standing rheumatoid arthritis. Examination reveals bilateral pneumonia and severe respiratory distress. The patient is lethargic without focal neurologic deficits. Urgent endotracheal intubation is performed for mechanical ventilation, and the patient is started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Repeat examination 2 hours later shows that she has developed areflexia, flaccid paralysis of all extremities.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with rheumatoid arthritis underwent urgent endotracheal intubation due to severe pneumonia and subsequently developed sudden-onset quadriparesis. Long-standing rheumatoid arthritis frequently involves the CERVICAL SPINE and causes joint destruction with vertebral malalignment (subluxation). The atlantoaxial joint is most often involved as the atlas (C1) has a high degree of mobility relative to the axis (C2 odontoid and body).\n\nChronic symptoms of cervical subluxation include neck pain, stiffness, and neurologic findings (eg, sensory loss, muscle weakness). Endotracheal intubation can ACUTELY WORSEN the subluxation and cause COMPRESSION of the spinal cord and/or vertebral arteries. Acute spinal cord injury results in flaccid paralysis with decreased or absent reflexes below the level of the compression due to spinal shock; the paralysis eventually becomes spastic as spinal shock resolves over the ensuing days to weeks.\n\n(Choice A) Cerebral septic emboli are usually due to infective endocarditis of the left-sided heart valves. Patients can develop neurologic findings including unilateral paralysis; quadriparesis would be less likely. This patient also has no cardiac murmur or other stigmata (eg, petechiae, splinter hemorrhages) to suggest endocarditis.\n\n(Choice B) Diabetic neuropathy presents with a slowly progressive decrease in vibratory sensation, proprioception, and temperature sensation. Early neuropathy can cause decreased ankle reflexes, whereas later disease can cause widespread loss of reflexes with motor weakness.\n\n(Choice C) Guillain-Barré syndrome presents with progressively worsening, symmetrical, flaccid muscle weakness with absent or decreased reflexes. The abnormalities typically start in the lower extremities and ascend upward over the course of days to weeks.\n\n(Choice D) Malignant hyperthermia is usually due to anesthesia exposure (eg, halothane, succinylcholine), causing increased and sustained muscle contraction with myocyte breakdown. Patients typically develop diffuse muscle rigidity followed by hyperthermia and possible myoglobinuria.\n\nEducational objective:\nLong-standing rheumatoid arthritis can affect the cervical spine, causing vertebral malalignment (subluxation) that can affect the atlantoaxial joint. Extension of the neck during endotracheal intubation can worsen the subluxation, leading to acute compression of the spinal cord and/or vertebral arteries.",
    "zh": "该类风湿性关节炎患者因严重肺炎接受紧急气管插管，随后出现突发性四肢瘫痪。长期类风湿性关节炎常累及颈椎，引起关节破坏和椎骨错位（半脱位）。寰枢关节最常受累，因为寰椎（C1）相对于枢椎（C2齿状突和椎体）具有高度的活动性。\n\n颈椎半脱位的慢性症状包括颈部疼痛、僵硬和神经系统表现（如感觉丧失、肌无力）。气管插管可急性加重半脱位，引起脊髓和/或椎动脉受压。急性脊髓损伤导致在压缩水平以下的弛缓性瘫痪，伴随反射减弱或消失，这是由于脊髓休克；随着脊髓休克在随后的几天到几周内消退，瘫痪最终会变得痉挛。\n\n(选项A) 脑脓毒性栓子通常由左侧心脏瓣膜的感染性心内膜炎引起。患者可出现神经系统表现，包括单侧瘫痪；四肢瘫痪不太可能出现。该患者也没有心脏杂音或其他体征（如瘀点、刺状出血）提示心内膜炎。\n\n(选项B) 糖尿病神经病变表现为振动觉、本体感觉和温度觉缓慢进行性下降。早期神经病变可引起踝反射减弱，而晚期疾病可引起反射广泛丧失，伴有肌无力。\n\n(选项C) 格林-巴利综合征表现为进行性加重的、对称性的、弛缓性肌无力，伴有反射消失或减弱。异常通常从下肢开始，并在几天到几周内向上发展。\n\n(选项D) 恶性高热通常由于麻醉暴露（如氟烷、琥珀酰胆碱）引起，导致肌肉收缩增加并持续，伴有肌细胞破坏。患者通常出现弥漫性肌肉僵硬，随后出现高热和可能的肌红蛋白尿。\n\n教学目标：\n长期类风湿性关节炎可影响颈椎，引起椎骨错位（半脱位），进而影响寰枢关节。气管插管期间颈部伸展可加重半脱位，导致脊髓和/或椎动脉急性受压。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of potential complications arising from endotracheal intubation in patients with underlying rheumatologic conditions affecting the cervical spine. Specifically, it assesses the recognition of vertebral subluxation as a cause of acute neurologic deficits following intubation.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the patient's risk factors for cervical spine instability (rheumatoid arthritis) and considering how a procedure like endotracheal intubation could precipitate or worsen a pre-existing condition, leading to acute neurological compromise. Evaluating the differential diagnoses based on the presentation of areflexia and flaccid paralysis is crucial.",
