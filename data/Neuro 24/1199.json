    "en": "A 64-year-old man comes to the office with 2 months of episodic facial pain. He describes sudden-onset, severe, electric shock-like pain over the right cheek and ear lasting several seconds. The patient reports that activities like shaving and washing his face can trigger the pain and it is becoming more frequent. He is a retired veteran and has a history of posttraumatic stress disorder. Physical examination, including neurologic examination, is normal. Laboratory studies for blood cell counts, electrolytes, and hepatic and renal function are normal. The patient is started on a single drug therapy. On a follow-up visit 3 months later, he reports symptom improvement but is found to have the following blood counts:\n\nHemoglobin 9.0 g/dL\nReticulocytes 0.1%\nPlatelets 80,000/mm³\nLeukocytes 2,500/mm³",

    "en": "This patient has TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA (tic douloureux), a neuropathic disorder that typically presents with episodic, severe, unilateral, electric shock-like pain in the distribution of CN V. Symptoms are often triggered by innocuous stimuli such as shaving or washing the face. The first-line treatment of trigeminal neuralgia is CARBAMAZEPINE, a medication that inhibits neuronal high-frequency firing by reducing the ability of SODIUM CHANNELS to recover from inactivation (ie, sodium channel blockade).\n\nCarbamazepine may cause the following important adverse effects:\n1. BONE MARROW SUPPRESSION, which may lead to anemia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia (complete blood cell counts should be monitored periodically)\n2. HYPONATREMIA, due to increased sensitivity to antidiuretic hormone\n\n(Choice A) Ketamine, felbamate, and memantine are examples of medications that block NMDA receptors. Ketamine is used as a general anesthetic agent, felbamate is an anticonvulsant, and memantine may be effective in the treatment of Alzheimer dementia.\n\n(Choice B) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, fluoxetine, sertraline) are typically used to treat depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Side effects may include headache, worsening anxiety/agitation, and insomnia.\n\n(Choice C) Ethosuximide blocks T-type Ca²⁺ channels and decreases calcium current in thalamic neurons. This anticonvulsant is the agent of choice for absence seizures. Major side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms and drowsiness.\n\n(Choice E) Various antiseizure medications (eg, benzodiazepines, barbiturates) act on the GABA-A receptor to increase chloride conductance; however, carbamazepine does not significantly affect chloride channels.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe first-line treatment for trigeminal neuralgia is carbamazepine, a medication that inhibits neuronal high-frequency firing by blocking sodium channels. Carbamazepine can cause bone marrow suppression; therefore, complete blood cell counts should be monitored periodically.",
    "zh": "该患者患有三叉神经痛 (tic douloureux)，这是一种神经性疾病，通常表现为CN V分布区域的阵发性、严重、单侧、电击样疼痛。症状常由剃须或洗脸等无害刺激引发。三叉神经痛的一线治疗药物是卡马西平，该药物通过降低钠离子通道从失活中恢复的能力（即钠离子通道阻滞）来抑制神经元高频放电。\n\n卡马西平可能引起以下重要不良反应：\n1. 骨髓抑制，可能导致贫血、粒细胞缺乏症和血小板减少症（应定期监测全血细胞计数）\n2. 低钠血症，由于对抗利尿激素的敏感性增加\n\n(选项A) 氯胺酮、非巴mate和美金刚是阻断NMDA受体的药物的例子。氯胺酮用作全身麻醉剂，非巴mate是抗惊厥药，美金刚可能对治疗阿尔茨海默病有效。\n\n(选项B) 选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（如氟西汀、舍曲林）通常用于治疗抑郁症、焦虑症和创伤后应激障碍。副作用可能包括头痛、焦虑/激动加重和失眠。\n\n(选项C) 乙琥胺阻断T型Ca²⁺通道并减少丘脑神经元中的钙离子电流。这种抗惊厥药是失神发作的首选药物。主要副作用包括胃肠道症状和嗜睡。\n\n(选项E) 各种抗癫痫药物（例如，苯二氮卓类药物，巴比妥酸盐）作用于GABA-A受体以增加氯离子电导；然而，卡马西平对氯离子通道没有显着影响。\n\n教学目标：\n三叉神经痛的一线治疗药物是卡马西平，该药物通过阻断钠离子通道来抑制神经元高频放电。卡马西平可引起骨髓抑制；因此，应定期监测全血细胞计数。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of trigeminal neuralgia, its typical presentation, and the mechanism of action of its first-line treatment, carbamazepine. It also assesses knowledge of potential adverse effects of carbamazepine, such as bone marrow suppression, and the ability to differentiate its mechanism from other anticonvulsant medications.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the clinical presentation as trigeminal neuralgia. Recall or deduce that carbamazepine is the first-line treatment and understand its primary mechanism of action, which involves blocking voltage-gated sodium channels. Evaluate the provided options to select the one that accurately describes this mechanism, while also considering the patient's laboratory findings which are consistent with a potential side effect of carbamazepine.",
    "zh": "本题考察对三叉神经痛的理解，包括其典型表现以及一线治疗药物卡马西平的作用机制。同时也评估了对卡马西平潜在不良反应（如骨髓抑制）的了解，以及区分其与其他抗惊厥药物机制的能力。\n\n要解决这个问题，首先要将临床表现识别为三叉神经痛。回忆或推断卡马西平是一线治疗药物，并了解其主要作用机制，即阻断电压门控钠离子通道。评估所提供的选项，选择一个准确描述该机制的选项，同时也要考虑患者的实验室检查结果，这些结果与卡马西平的潜在副作用一致。"
