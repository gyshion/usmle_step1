    "en": "This patient's travel history, chronic intestinal symptoms, eosinophilia, and biopsy findings suggest schistosomiasis, a parasitic blood fluke infection primarily seen in rural parts of sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia. Exposure occurs when humans swim or bathe in freshwater that contains contaminated snails (the intermediate host). Cercariae from the snails penetrate human skin and migrate to the liver, where they mature into adult worms. Adult worms then travel through the portal circulation to the mesenteric venules (S mansoni and S japonicum) or the venous plexus of the bladder (S haematobium). {{exhibit_2}}\n\nAdult worms release eggs through host tissue to be excreted in feces or urine. Although most patients are asymptomatic, eggs can trigger a significant granulomatous inflammatory response, leading to manifestations in the gastrointestinal tract (eg, diarrhea, weight loss, anorexia, anemia), bladder (eg, terminal hematuria), or periportal system (eg, portal hypertension, splenomegaly). Eosinophilia is commonly early in the disease course as eosinophils release granules that are toxic to adult worms.\n\nDiagnostic confirmation requires the identification of round/oval eggs with a characteristic terminal (S. haematobium) or lateral (S. mansoni) spine on stool/urinary testing or tissue biopsy. Treatment with praziquantel, which alters parasite digestion and calcium transport, is generally curative.\n\n(Choice A) Artemisinin-based combination therapy is used for chloroquine resistant malaria. Malaria can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, but patients are usually acutely ill (eg, fever, chills, myalgia, headache). Giemsa-stained blood smear generally reveals intraerythrocytic ring-shaped trophozoites, not eggs with a spine.\n\n(Choice B) Bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal tract is common when traveling to countries with poor sanitation and water control systems. Ciprofloxacin is sometimes used for treatment. However, most cases are brief in duration, eosinophilia is not generally seen, and eggs would not be present.\n\n(Choice C) Ganciclovir can treat cytomegalovirus colitis, which frequently causes diarrhea and abdominal pain. However, most cases arise in patients that are severely immunocompromised. Furthermore, fever is usually present and biopsy would show intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions, not eggs.\n\n(Choice D) Metronidazole plus paromomycin is used to treat Entamoeba histolytica, which is a common cause of dysentery (eg, diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain) in travelers. However, the presence of several months of symptoms, eosinophilia, and eggs on biopsy make this diagnosis unlikely.\n\nEducational objective:\nSchistosomiasis is a blood fluke infection that occurs when humans bathe or swim in freshwater that contains contaminated snails. Adult worms mature in the liver, lodge in the mesenteric venules or vesicular venous plexus, and secrete eggs into feces or urine. Eggs can trigger granulomatous inflammation, leading to symptoms in the gastrointestinal, urinary, or periportal tract. Diagnosis is typically made when round or oval eggs with a terminal or lateral spine are identified in urine, feces, or biopsy. {{exhibit_3}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of schistosomiasis, including its etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. The key to answering correctly is recognizing the patient's travel history to Central Africa, chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, eosinophilia, and the likely presence of parasitic eggs on biopsy. \n\nThe best approach is to consider the patient's risk factors and symptoms to narrow the differential diagnosis. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection common in sub-Saharan Africa, and praziquantel is the treatment of choice. Eliminate other options based on their association with different clinical scenarios or lack of supporting evidence.",
