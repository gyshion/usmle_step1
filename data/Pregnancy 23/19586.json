    "en": "A 24-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 0, at 28 weeks gestation comes to the office for a routine prenatal visit. She feels well and has had no vaginal bleeding, contractions, or leakage of fluid. Fetal movement is normal. The patient has no chronic medical conditions and her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. She previously had heavy menstrual periods that were managed with oral contraceptives. Blood pressure is 126/84 mm Hg and pulse is 78/min. Fundal height and fetal heart tones are normal. Today's third-trimester complete blood count is as follows:\n\nHemoglobin 11.2 g/dL\nPlatelets 120,000/mm³\nLeukocytes 8,200/mm³\n\nCoagulation studies and peripheral smear are within normal limits. The patient's first-trimester platelet count was 160,000/mm³. Urine dipstick today is negative for protein. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's thrombocytopenia?",

    "en": "This patient at 28 weeks gestation has mild, asymptomatic thrombocytopenia most consistent with GESTATIONAL THROMBOCYTOPENIA (GT), a benign, self-limited condition that can occur during pregnancy. GT is thought to arise due to the following:\n\n*   Plasma volume expansion: Maternal plasma volume expands approximately 30% during pregnancy to facilitate optimal fetal nutrient delivery and protect against maternal hemorrhage during delivery. Platelet production, however, does not typically increase during pregnancy; therefore, there is HEMODILUTION and resultant thrombocytopenia.\n*   Sequestration/consumption of platelets in the placenta: The placenta is a highly vascular organ with similarities to the spleen, a major site of normal platelet sequestration. Platelets pool in the placental circulation and undergo accelerated consumption within the intervillous space, thereby reducing the serum platelet count.\n\nGT is commonly diagnosed in the THIRD TRIMESTER when plasma volume peaks; it is often an incidental finding on routine bloodwork. Patients with GT have mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count usually ≥100,000/mm³), no symptoms (eg, no bruising or bleeding), normal coagulation studies, and normal peripheral blood smear.\n\n(Choice A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is characterized by widespread activation of the coagulation cascade with thrombocytopenia due to platelet consumption. However, DIC is associated with bleeding and abnormal coagulation studies, which are not seen in this patient.\n\n(Choice B) Aspirin decreases the production of thromboxane A2 and inhibits platelet aggregation. Patients taking aspirin usually have normal or elevated platelet counts and decreased platelet clotting function.\n\n(Choice D) Immune complex–mediated complement activation occurs in inflammatory rheumatologic diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus). Although these conditions are often associated with thrombocytopenia, patients typically have other symptoms.\n\n(Choice E) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) causes thrombocytopenia due to the formation of platelet clots in the microvasculature. However, TTP typically involves fever, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and neurologic abnormalities.",
    "zh": "这位孕28周的患者有轻度、无症状的血小板减少症，与妊娠血小板减少症 (GT) 最为一致，这是一种妊娠期间可能发生的良性、自限性疾病。GT的发生被认为是由以下原因引起的：\n\n*   血浆容量扩张：孕期母体血浆容量增加约30%，以促进最佳的胎儿营养输送并防止分娩期间母体出血。然而，血小板生成在妊娠期间通常不会增加；因此，存在血液稀释，导致血小板减少。\n*   胎盘中血小板的隔离/消耗：胎盘是一个高度血管化的器官，与脾脏（正常血小板隔离的主要部位）相似。血小板聚集在胎盘循环中，并在绒毛间隙内加速消耗，从而降低血清血小板计数。\n\nGT通常在第三孕期被诊断出来，此时血浆容量达到峰值；它通常是常规血液检查中的偶然发现。GT患者有轻度血小板减少症（血小板计数通常≥100,000/mm³），无症状（例如，无瘀伤或出血），凝血功能检查正常，外周血涂片正常。\n\n（选项A）弥散性血管内凝血（DIC）的特征是凝血级联反应的广泛激活，血小板减少是由于血小板消耗所致。然而，DIC与出血和凝血功能检查异常有关，而这些在该患者中未见。\n\n（选项B）阿司匹林可减少血栓素A2的产生并抑制血小板聚集。服用阿司匹林的患者通常血小板计数正常或升高，并且血小板凝血功能降低。\n\n（选项D）免疫复合物介导的补体激活发生在炎症性风湿性疾病中（例如，系统性红斑狼疮）。虽然这些疾病通常与血小板减少症相关，但患者通常有其他症状。\n\n（选项E）血栓性血小板减少性紫癜（TTP）由于微血管中血小板凝块的形成而导致血小板减少症。然而，TTP通常涉及发热、微血管病性溶血性贫血和神经系统异常。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of gestational thrombocytopenia, a common and benign condition occurring during pregnancy. It assesses the ability to differentiate it from other causes of thrombocytopenia based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and gestational timing.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recognize the typical features of gestational thrombocytopenia, including mild, asymptomatic thrombocytopenia in the third trimester, normal coagulation studies, and a history of a higher platelet count in the first trimester. The pathophysiology involves plasma volume expansion and increased platelet sequestration in the placenta.",
