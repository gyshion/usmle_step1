    "en": "A 45-year-old man comes to clinic for routine follow-up. He has a history of end-stage renal disease due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and he underwent a deceased-donor kidney transplant 4 years ago. The patient has hypertension that initially resolved following the transplant but redeveloped 6 months ago. Review of his recent laboratory studies reveals a progressive increase in serum creatinine levels over the last few months. Urinalysis is within normal limits. On ultrasonography, the transplanted kidney is reduced in size. A biopsy of the graft is most likely to show which of the following?",
    "zh": "一名45岁男性前来诊所进行例行复诊。他有因常染色体显性遗传性多囊肾病引起的终末期肾病的病史，4年前接受了来自已故捐赠者的肾脏移植。该患者有高血压病史，高血压最初在移植后得到缓解，但在6个月前复发。对其近期实验室研究的回顾显示，过去几个月中血清肌酐水平逐渐升高。尿液分析结果在正常范围内。超声检查显示，移植肾体积缩小。移植肾活检最有可能显示以下哪一项？"

    "en": "This kidney transplant recipient with progressive decline in renal function most likely has chronic allograft rejection. The process is a mixed cell-mediated and antibody-mediated response and can occur anytime from several months to years posttransplantation.\n\nFollowing transplant, T cells are activated and recipient antibodies are created against graft HLA and other antigens. The activated T cells can initially cause cell-mediated acute rejection, which is generally reversible via an increase in immunosuppression (eg, high-dose glucocorticoids). Chronic rejection represents progression of cell-mediated and antibody-mediated inflammation (eg, via activation of complement and recruitment of neutrophils) to the point that irreversible renal damage takes place: the kidney grossly decreases in size, and histopathology shows obliterative vascular wall thickening with tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis.\n\nDue to increased sodium retention, declining renal function in chronic rejection is also commonly accompanied by new or worsening hypertension. Chronic rejection is the most common cause of renal graft failure following transplant.\n\n(Choice A) A dense, interstitial, mononuclear (lymphocytic) infiltrate is characteristic of acute allograft rejection, which is most often a primarily T cell-mediated process. Acute rejection typically occurs <6 months after transplant but can occur later in a patient in whom posttransplant immunosuppression has been stopped.\n\n(Choice B) Glomerular injury in chronic rejection is predominantly ischemic, and crescent formation is not typically observed. Crescents develop mainly in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody-mediated, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated, or immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis.\n\n(Choice D) Muddy brown casts can be seen with ACUTE TUBULAR NECROSIS, which usually manifests as acute (rather than gradual) kidney injury. Tubular hypertrophy may be present during the recovery phase. These findings are not typical of chronic rejection.\n\n(Choice E) Vascular fibrinoid necrosis with capillary thrombotic occlusion occurs in hyperacute rejection, which is a rapid and profound form of antibody-mediated rejection caused by preformed antibodies to graft antigens. Chronic rejection is a more gradual antibody-mediated process resulting from sensitization that occurs after a transplant has taken place.\n\nEducational objective:\nChronic renal allograft rejection manifests months to years after a transplant and presents with worsening hypertension and a gradual decline in renal function. It involves a chronic cell-mediated and antibody-mediated response against donor antigens and leads to obliterative vascular wall thickening, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. The process is usually irreversible and eventually leads to graft failure.",
    "zh": "这位肾移植受者，肾功能进行性下降，最有可能患有慢性同种异体移植排斥反应。该过程是细胞介导和抗体介导的混合反应，可在移植后数月至数年内的任何时间发生。\n\n移植后，T细胞被激活，受者的抗体产生针对移植物的HLA和其他抗原。激活的T细胞最初可引起细胞介导的急性排斥反应，这通常可以通过增加免疫抑制（例如，大剂量糖皮质激素）来逆转。慢性排斥反应代表了细胞介导和抗体介导的炎症的进展（例如，通过补体激活和中性粒细胞募集），直至发生不可逆的肾脏损害：肾脏体积明显缩小，组织病理学显示闭塞性血管壁增厚伴肾小管萎缩和间质纤维化。\n\n由于钠潴留增加，慢性排斥反应中肾功能的下降通常伴有新的或恶化的高血压。慢性排斥反应是移植后肾移植失败的最常见原因。\n\n（选项 A） 密集的间质性单核细胞（淋巴细胞性）浸润是急性同种异体移植排斥反应的特征，这通常是一个主要的T细胞介导的过程。急性排斥反应通常发生在移植后<6个月，但也可发生在停止移植后免疫抑制的患者身上。\n\n（选项 B） 慢性排斥反应中的肾小球损伤主要是缺血性的，通常不观察到新月体形成。新月体主要在抗肾小球基底膜抗体介导的、抗中性粒细胞胞质自身抗体相关的或免疫复合物介导的肾小球肾炎中形成。\n\n（选项 D） 可在急性肾小管坏死中看到泥棕色管型，这通常表现为急性（而非逐渐）的肾损伤。在恢复期可能存在肾小管肥大。这些发现不是慢性排斥反应的典型表现。\n\n（选项 E） 血管纤维蛋白样坏死伴毛细血管血栓性闭塞发生在超急性排斥反应中，这是一种由预先形成的针对移植物抗原的抗体引起的快速而严重的抗体介导的排斥反应。慢性排斥反应是一个更渐进的抗体介导的过程，由移植后发生的敏化引起。\n\n教育目标：\n慢性肾同种异体移植排斥反应在移植后数月至数年内表现出来，表现为高血压恶化和肾功能逐渐下降。它涉及针对供者抗原的慢性细胞介导和抗体介导的反应，并导致闭塞性血管壁增厚、肾小管萎缩和间质纤维化。这个过程通常是不可逆转的，最终导致移植物衰竭。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of chronic allograft rejection, its clinical presentation, and characteristic histopathological findings. Chronic rejection is a mixed cell-mediated and antibody-mediated process occurring months to years post-transplant, leading to obliterative vascular wall thickening, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the chronic nature of the presentation (years post-transplant, gradual decline), the presence of hypertension, and the ultrasonography findings. This points towards chronic allograft rejection, making obliterative vascular fibrosis the most likely biopsy finding.",
