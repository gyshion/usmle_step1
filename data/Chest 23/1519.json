  "explanation": {
    "en": "Intrapleural pressures are not represented on the lung pressure-volume curve. The expanding force of the chest wall working in opposition to the collapsing force of the lungs creates negative intrapleural pressure throughout the respiratory cycle. Inspiration is driven by active expansion of the chest wall, which generates even greater intrapleural negative pressure and pulls the lungs outward. Intrapleural negative pressure peaks at maximal inspiration at a value of approximately -8 cm H₂O. During passive expiration the chest wall relaxes and the respiratory system returns to its equilibrium position, in which intrapleural pressure is approximately -5 cm H₂O.",
    "zh": "胸腔内压力未在肺压力-容积曲线上表示。胸壁的扩张力与肺的收缩力相反，在整个呼吸周期内产生负的胸腔内压力。吸气由胸壁的主动扩张驱动，这会产生更大的胸腔内负压，并将肺向外拉。胸腔内负压在最大吸气时达到峰值，约为-8 cm H₂O。在被动呼气期间，胸壁放松，呼吸系统恢复到其平衡位置，胸腔内压力约为-5 cm H₂O。"
