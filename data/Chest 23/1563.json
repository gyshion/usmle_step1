Temperature is 36.1 C (97 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 62/min, and respiratory rate is 8/min. On physical examination, the patient is unconscious with pinpoint pupils. Endotracheal intubation is performed, and mechanical ventilation is begun. The ventilator settings are adjusted to provide a minute ventilation of 6.0 L/min. Calculated alveolar ventilation is 4.2 L/min. {{exhibit_1}} Which of the following most likely accounts for the difference between these 2 parameters?",

    "en": "Minute ventilation is the total volume of new air that enters the respiratory pathways per minute. It can be calculated by multiplying the average tidal volume by the number of breaths per minute (minute ventilation [L/min] = tidal volume [L] x breaths/min).\n\nAlveolar ventilation refers only to the volume of new air reaching the gas exchange areas (ie, alveoli and respiratory bronchioles) per minute. It can be calculated by subtracting dead space volume (which does not participate in gas exchange) from the tidal volume. \n\nAlveolar ventilation (L/min) = (tidal volume – dead space volume) × breaths/min\n\nThe total volume of dead space in the lungs is known as physiologic dead space. It consists of both the anatomic dead space of the conducting airways (ie, nose, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles; normally ~150 mL) and alveolar dead space due to well-ventilated but poorly perfused alveoli. Because it is difficult to directly measure physiologic dead space, it is often estimated in mechanically ventilated patients by comparing arterial (a) and expiratory (E) pCO2 levels.\n\nPhysiologic dead space = tidal volume × [(PᵢCO₂ – PₑCO₂)/PᵢCO₂]\n\n(Choices B and C) Functional residual capacity is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a normal exhalation. It is the sum of residual volume (the volume of air remaining in the lungs after maximal exhalation) and expiratory reserve volume (the volume difference between normal end-expiration and maximal end-expiration).\n\n(Choice D) Respiratory rate is the number of breaths taken per minute and is a factor in calculating both minute ventilation and alveolar ventilation.\n\n(Choice E) Tidal volume is the volume of new air that enters the lungs with each normal, unforced breath. It is a factor in calculating both minute ventilation and alveolar ventilation.\n\nEducational objective:\nMinute ventilation is equal to the product of tidal volume and respiratory rate and includes dead space ventilation. Alveolar ventilation is equal to the product of respiratory rate and the difference between tidal volume and dead space volume. {{exhibit_2}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of minute ventilation and alveolar ventilation, specifically the concept of dead space volume and its impact on the difference between these two parameters. It requires knowledge of respiratory physiology and the components of dead space (anatomic and alveolar). \n\nTo solve this question, recall the definitions of minute and alveolar ventilation. Understand that alveolar ventilation accounts for the air that participates in gas exchange, while minute ventilation includes all air moved in and out of the lungs. The difference is due to dead space, which is ventilated but not perfused.",
