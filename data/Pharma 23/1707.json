    "en": "Efficacy and potency are terms that are commonly used and often confused. In pharmacology, efficacy refers to the intrinsic ability of a drug to elicit an effect, such as receptor activation or dilation of a vessel as described in the question stem. It is a measure of the maximum ceiling of activity ([Emax]) of a drug with respect to a particular pharmacodynamic end point. For example, loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide will cause greater diuresis or natriuresis than any thiazide diuretic, irrespective of their dose.\n\nPotency, on the other hand, refers to the dose of drug that is required to produce a given effect. The potency of a drug is primarily affected by the affinity of the drug for its receptor and the amount of drug that is able to reach the target tissues. Therefore, drugs that bind their receptors with a higher affinity or are better able to gain access to their target tissues will have greater potency. The potency of different agents can be compared by determining the dose of drug that is required to produce one-half (50%) of the maximum biological response. This dose is known as the ED50. The lower the ED50 of a drug, the more potent it is. For example, among the thiazide diuretics, 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 5mg chlorthalidone produce similar drops in blood pressure (similar efficacy), but chlorthalidone requires a lower dose, or lower ED50, than HCTZ to cause a similar effect (higher potency).\n\nWith respect to the question, drug 2 and drug 3 have similar maximum effects (efficacy). A much lower dose of drug 2 is required to produce the same effect as that seen with drug 3; therefore, drug 2 is more potent than drug 3 and has a lower ED50. To achieve this higher potency, the binding of drug 2 to its receptors (affinity) must be higher than that of drug 3 (Choice B), or drug 2 must be better able to reach its target (penetration) than drug 3.\n\n(Choice A) Drug 1 has higher potency than Drug 2 because at low biological activity, it can cause the same effect with much lower concentrations of drug. However, it does not reach the same maximum effect as Drug 2.\n\n(Choice C) Drug 1 demonstrates the lowest efficacy (ceiling of biological effect) of the three drugs graphed. Lower efficacy may be a result of partial agonism and other factors.\n\n(Choice D) Drugs 2 and 3 exhibit a parallel shift in their relative biological effects exhibiting similar efficacy but different potency (The shapes of their graphs are identical, but at different dose ranges). Drug 3 may contain the same basic pharmacologic agent as Drug 2 but with a competitive antagonist mixed in; thus, the Emax is the same but the ED50 is higher. A competitive antagonist would bind to the same location as the original substance.\n\n(Choice E) Drug 2 has a lower ED50 (greater potency) than drug 3. Both have equal efficacy.\n\nEducational Objective:\nEfficacy is a measure of the maximum pharmacodynamic effect achievable with a drug. Potency refers to the dose of drug that is required to produce a given effect. Drugs that bind their receptors with a higher affinity or are better able to gain access to their target tissues will have greater potency (lower ED50).",
    "zh": "效能和效力是常用且常被混淆的术语。在药理学中，效能是指药物引起效应的内在能力，例如受体激活或血管舒张，如题干中所述。它是药物相对于特定药效学终点的最大活性上限 ([Emax]) 的一种度量。例如，袢利尿剂如呋塞米或布美他尼将比任何噻嗪类利尿剂引起更大的利尿或钠尿，与剂量无关。\n\n另一方面，效力是指产生给定效应所需的药物剂量。药物的效力主要受药物与其受体的亲和力以及能够到达靶组织的药物量影响。因此，与其受体结合亲和力更高或能够更好地进入靶组织的药物将具有更大的效力。可以通过确定产生最大生物反应一半（50％）所需的药物剂量来比较不同药物的效力。该剂量被称为 ED50。药物的 ED50 越低，其效力越高。例如，在噻嗪类利尿剂中，25mg 氢氯噻嗪和 5mg 氯噻酮产生相似的血压下降（相似的效能），但氯噻酮需要比 HCTZ 更低的剂量或更低的 ED50 才能产生相似的效应（更高的效力）。\n\n关于本题，药物 2 和药物 3 具有相似的最大效应（效能）。需要更低剂量的药物 2 才能产生与药物 3 相同的效应；因此，药物 2 比药物 3 更有效，并且具有更低的 ED50。为了实现这种更高的效力，药物 2 与其受体（亲和力）的结合必须高于药物 3（选项 B），或者药物 2 必须比药物 3 更好地到达其靶标（渗透）。\n\n（选项 A）药物 1 的效力高于药物 2，因为在低生物活性下，它可以用更低的药物浓度引起相同的效应。然而，它没有达到与药物 2 相同的最大效应。\n\n（选项 C）药物 1 在三个药物的曲线图中显示出最低的效能（生物学效应的上限）。较低的效能可能是部分激动剂和其他因素的结果。\n\n（选项 D）药物 2 和药物 3 在其相对生物学效应中表现出平行转移，表现出相似的效能但不同的效力（它们的曲线形状相同，但在不同的剂量范围内）。药物 3 可能包含与药物 2 相同的基本药理剂，但混入了竞争性拮抗剂；因此，Emax 相同，但 ED50 较高。竞争性拮抗剂将与原始物质的相同位置结合。\n\n（选项 E）药物 2 的 ED50 较低（效力更高）于药物 3。两者具有相等的效能。\n\n教学目标：\n效能是衡量药物可实现的最大药效学效应的指标。效力是指产生给定效应所需的药物剂量。与其受体结合亲和力更高或能够更好地进入靶组织的药物将具有更大的效力（更低的 ED50）。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pharmacological concepts of drug efficacy and potency, and how these are represented graphically in dose-response curves. It requires the interpretation of these curves to compare the effects of different drugs on a biological system.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first differentiate between efficacy (maximum effect) and potency (dose required for a given effect). Efficacy is represented by the maximum height of the dose-response curve, while potency is indicated by the position of the curve along the x-axis (log drug concentration). By analyzing the relative positions and heights of the curves for Drugs 1, 2, and 3, one can determine which drug has higher potency and efficacy.",
