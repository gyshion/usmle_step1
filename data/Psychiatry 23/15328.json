    "en": "A 39-year-old man is brought to the office by his wife who is concerned about his behavior over the past year. She says, \"He used to be outgoing and upbeat, but now he seems uncharacteristically depressed and distant from the family. He has lost interest in his work and has difficulty making decisions.\" Over the past month, he has become increasingly paranoid and believes that his business partner is trying to kill him. The patient has no psychiatric history. Both his father and grandfather were hospitalized in long-term care facilities and died in their 50s. Physical examination shows random, abrupt, uncoordinated movements of the left leg. On mental status examination the patient is restless and irritable. He is convinced that not only his business partner but also the government is out to harm him.",

    "en": "This patient's development of psychiatric symptoms in his late-30s, abnormal choreiform movements (rapid and uncoordinated contractions affecting mostly distal limbs), and family history are suggestive of HUNTINGTON DISEASE (HD). HD is an autosomal dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by chorea, psychiatric symptoms, and subsequent dementia. ONSET IN MID-LIFE is most common. There is no known cure and treatment is symptomatic.\n\nPsychiatric symptoms are highly prevalent in HD and may occur prior to the onset of chorea. They may include irritability, anxiety, apathy, depression, and psychosis (eg, delusions, hallucinations). Dementia develops later in the disease course and is characterized by prominent executive dysfunction. The diagnosis of HD is confirmed by testing for trinucleotide (cytosine-adenine-guanine [CAG]) repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene.\n\n(Choices A, B, and H) These are primary psychotic disorders that would not be diagnosed when psychosis is due to a medical condition. Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by ≥1 psychotic symptoms lasting ≥1 days and ≤1 month with full return to the previous level of functioning. Delusional disorder is characterized ≥1 delusions lasting ≥1 month. Schizophrenia typically has onset in young adulthood and is characterized by psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations, disorganization, negative symptoms) lasting ≥ 6 months.\n\n(Choice C) Friedreich ataxia, the most common hereditary ataxia, is characterized by neurologic dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes mellitus.\n\n(Choices E and G) Although this patient has both mood and psychotic symptoms, they are more likely manifestations of HD given his movement abnormalities. In major depression with psychotic features, psychosis occurs exclusively during the depression. In schizoaffective disorder, patients show evidence of psychosis when they are not depressed.\n\n(Choice F) Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Psychosis can also occur in PD but typically presents later in the disease course. PD is less likely in this patient with early psychiatric findings, choreiform movements, and absence of other neurological findings of PD (eg, tremor, bradykinesia).",
    "zh": "这位患者在30多岁后期出现精神症状、异常的舞蹈病样运动（快速且不协调的收缩，主要影响远端肢体）以及家族史提示亨廷顿病（HD）。 HD 是一种常染色体显性遗传的进行性神经退行性疾病，其特征是舞蹈病、精神症状和随后的痴呆。中年起病最为常见。目前尚无已知治愈方法，治疗以对症治疗为主。\n\n精神症状在 HD 中非常普遍，并且可能在舞蹈病发病前出现。 它们可能包括易怒、焦虑、冷漠、抑郁和精神病（例如，妄想、幻觉）。痴呆发生在疾病的晚期，其特征是明显的执行功能障碍。 HD 的诊断通过检测亨廷廷蛋白 (HTT) 基因中的三核苷酸（胞嘧啶-腺嘌呤-鸟嘌呤 [CAG]）重复扩增来确认。\n\n（选项 A、B 和 H）当精神病是由于医疗状况引起的时，这些是不会被诊断为原发性精神病性障碍的。短暂性精神病性障碍的特征是 ≥1 个精神病症状，持续 ≥1 天且 ≤1 个月，并完全恢复到之前的机能水平。 妄想症的特征是 ≥1 个妄想，持续 ≥1 个月。精神分裂症通常在青年时期起病，其特征是精神病症状（例如，妄想、幻觉、思维紊乱、阴性症状）持续 ≥ 6 个月。\n\n（选项 C）Friedreich 共济失调是最常见的遗传性共济失调，其特征是神经功能障碍、心肌病和糖尿病。\n\n（选项 E 和 G）尽管该患者同时存在情绪和精神病症状，但考虑到他的运动异常，这些更有可能是 HD 的表现。 在伴有精神病特征的重度抑郁症中，精神病仅在抑郁期间发生。 在分裂情感性障碍中，患者在未抑郁时出现精神病的证据。\n\n（选项 F）帕金森病（PD）是一种进行性神经退行性疾病，其特征是震颤、运动迟缓和强直。 精神病也可能发生在 PD 中，但通常在疾病后期出现。 对于该患者而言，出现早期精神病学发现、舞蹈病样运动，并且没有 PD 的其他神经系统发现（例如，震颤、运动迟缓），则 PD 发生的可能性较小。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of Huntington disease, specifically its presentation with psychiatric symptoms, choreiform movements, and family history. It requires differentiating Huntington disease from other psychiatric disorders and neurological conditions that can present with similar symptoms.\n\nTo solve this question, one should carefully analyze the patient's age of onset, psychiatric symptoms (paranoia, depression), motor findings (abrupt, uncoordinated movements), and family history. The combination of these features strongly points towards Huntington disease, and the explanation helps differentiate it from other conditions in the differential diagnosis.",
