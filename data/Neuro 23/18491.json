    "en": "A 58-year-old man comes to the office due to lower extremity pain. The patient began experiencing tingly discomfort in his toes a year ago, especially at night when the sheets touched his skin. Since then, the symptoms have progressed to a burning and stabbing pain in his feet and lower legs. He was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 8 years ago and hypertension 3 years ago. The patient quit smoking 20 years ago and does not use alcohol. Blood pressure is 126/70 mm Hg and pulse is 68/min. Lower extremity examination shows normal-appearing skin. Touching the feet elicits a sensation of burning pain. There is loss of vibration sensation in the toes, and the ankle reflex is absent bilaterally.",

    "en": "This patient with long-standing diabetes mellitus has tingling/burning pain in the feet, loss of vibration sensation, and loss of ankle reflexes, indicating distal symmetric polyneuropathy (diabetic neuropathy). Long-standing diabetes mellitus is often associated with damage to the distal axons of sensory neurons due to the accumulation of cross-linked glycosylated serum proteins in the vaso nervorum, which causes inflammation, vasoconstriction, and neuronal oxidative stress. Initial symptoms include tingling, numbness, and burning pain in the toes and/or feet. Sensation to pain, light touch, temperature, vibration, and proprioception are generally diminished in the affected area. Babinski and ankle reflex are often absent.\n\nTreatment includes glycemic control and foot care to limit the development of ulcers and need for amputation. Patients with painful neuropathy also typically receive a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (eg, duloxetine, venlafaxine), a gabapentinoid (eg, pregabalin, gabapentin), or a tricyclic antidepressant such as amitriptyline. Amitriptyline modulates pain transmission by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels in sensory nerves, blocking NMDA (excitatory) receptors in the spinal cord, and altering norepinephrine signaling in the brain.\n\n(Choice B) Benzodiazepines (eg, clonazepam) are often used for anxiety, muscle relaxation, or nausea. They are not typically used for neuropathic pain.\n\n(Choice C) Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, fluoxetine) are often used for depression and anxiety, they are not often employed for neuropathic pain. In contrast, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (eg, duloxetine, venlafaxine) are often used as first-line treatment to manage painful diabetic neuropathy; these agents alter central transmission of pain by increasing norepinephrine in the central synapses.\n\n(Choice D) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen are prescribed for acute painful conditions such as back pain, muscle strain, or bone fracture. However, they have limited efficacy for neuropathic pain.\n\n(Choice E) Opioid pain medications (eg, oxycodone) are not recommended for most patients with neuropathic pain due to their questionable efficacy and risk of dependence. Patients with neuropathic pain should first be given a trial of an antidepressant or gabapentinoid.\n\n(Choice F) Certain patients taking isoniazid require pyridoxine supplementation to prevent the development of drug-induced peripheral neuropathy. This patient is not taking isoniazid; therefore, pyridoxine supplementation would not be helpful.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients with long-standing, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus are at high risk for developing distal symmetric polyneuropathy (diabetic neuropathy). Symptoms generally include progressive numbness, tingling, and burning/stabbing pain in the feet and/or toes that progresses proximally. Painful neuropathy is treated with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentinoids, or tricyclic antidepressants.",
    "zh": "该患者患有长期糖尿病，出现足部麻木/烧灼痛、振动觉丧失和踝反射消失，表明存在远端对称性多发性神经病变（糖尿病性神经病）。长期糖尿病通常与感觉神经元远端轴突受损有关，这是由于血管神经中交联的糖基化血清蛋白积累，导致炎症、血管收缩和神经元氧化应激。最初症状包括脚趾和/或足部麻木、麻刺感和烧灼痛。疼痛、轻触、温度、振动和本体感觉通常在受影响区域减弱。巴宾斯基征和踝反射通常缺失。\n\n治疗包括血糖控制和足部护理，以限制溃疡的发生和截肢的需求。有疼痛性神经病变的患者通常还会接受5-羟色胺-去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂（如度洛西汀、文拉法辛）、加巴喷丁类药物（如普瑞巴林、加巴喷丁）或三环类抗抑郁药（如阿米替林）。阿米替林通过抑制感觉神经中的电压门控钠通道、阻断脊髓中的NMDA（兴奋性）受体以及改变大脑中的去甲肾上腺素信号传导来调节疼痛的传递。\n\n（选项B）苯二氮卓类药物（如氯硝西泮）常用于治疗焦虑、肌肉松弛或恶心。它们通常不用于治疗神经性疼痛。\n\n（选项C）尽管选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（如氟西汀）常用于治疗抑郁症和焦虑症，但它们通常不用于神经性疼痛。相比之下，5-羟色胺-去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂（如度洛西汀、文拉法辛）通常用作一线治疗，以控制疼痛性糖尿病性神经病；这些药物通过增加中枢突触中的去甲肾上腺素来改变疼痛的中枢传递。\n\n（选项D）非甾体抗炎药，如萘普生，用于治疗急性疼痛疾病，如背痛、肌肉拉伤或骨折。然而，它们对神经性疼痛的疗效有限。\n\n（选项E）对于大多数神经性疼痛患者，不推荐使用阿片类止痛药（如羟考酮），因为其疗效存疑且存在依赖风险。神经性疼痛患者应首先试用抗抑郁药或加巴喷丁类药物。\n\n（选项F）某些服用异烟肼的患者需要补充吡哆醇以预防药物引起的周围神经病变。该患者未服用异烟肼；因此，补充吡哆醇无益。\n\n教育目标：\n患有长期、控制不佳的糖尿病的患者发生远端对称性多发性神经病变（糖尿病性神经病）的风险很高。症状通常包括足部和/或脚趾进行性麻木、麻刺感和烧灼/刺痛，并逐渐向近端发展。疼痛性神经病变用5-羟色胺-去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂、加巴喷丁类药物或三环类抗抑郁药治疗。"
