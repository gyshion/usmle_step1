    "en": "A 20-year-old man is evaluated in the clinic for right arm weakness and numbness. He pitches for his college baseball team and threw more than usual last week due to a postseason tournament. Since then, the patient has had difficulty using his right arm, particularly when lifting objects. He has no history of head, neck, or upper extremity trauma. On physical examination, there is diminished strength on right elbow flexion and an absent biceps reflex. This patient is most likely to have sensory loss over which of the following areas?",

    "en": "This patient likely has musculocutaneous nerve injury, which most commonly occurs in the setting of trauma (eg, shoulder dislocation) and can also occur with strenuous upper extremity activity (eg, baseball pitching). The musculocutaneous nerve is derived from the C5-C7 spinal nerve roots and arises from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus. It innervates the coracobrachialis (flexes and adducts the arm) and major elbow flexors (eg, biceps brachii, brachialis). After innervating these muscles, the remaining fibers become the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm and provide sensory innervation to the skin of the lateral forearm. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nIn addition to having weakness of elbow flexion and numbness of the lateral forearm, patients with musculocutaneous nerve injury have an absent or weak biceps reflex.\n\n(Choice B) The medial forearm receives sensory innervation from a branch of the medial cord of the brachial plexus, the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm (also called the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve).\n\n(Choices C and D) The posterior arm and forearm receive sensory innervation from the posterior cutaneous branches of the radial nerve.\n\n(Choice E) The thenar eminence receives sensory innervation from the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve, which arises proximal to the carpal tunnel.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe musculocutaneous nerve innervates the coracobrachialis (flexes and adducts the arm) and the major elbow flexors (eg, biceps brachii, brachialis) and then continues distally to provide sensory innervation to the lateral forearm. It is derived from the upper trunk of the brachial plexus (C5-C7) and can be injured by trauma or strenuous upper extremity exercise. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "该患者可能患有肌皮神经损伤，这种损伤最常发生在创伤（如肩关节脱位）的情况下，也可能发生在剧烈上肢活动（如棒球投掷）中。肌皮神经源自C5-C7脊神经根，并从臂丛神经的外侧束发出。它支配喙肱肌（屈曲和内收手臂）和主要的肘屈肌（例如，肱二头肌、肱肌）。在支配这些肌肉后，剩余的纤维成为前臂外侧皮神经，并为外侧前臂的皮肤提供感觉支配。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n除了肘屈曲无力和外侧前臂麻木外，肌皮神经损伤的患者还可能出现肱二头肌反射消失或减弱。\n\n（选项B）内侧前臂接受来自臂丛神经内侧束的一个分支，即前臂内侧皮神经（也称为前臂内侧皮神经）的感觉支配。\n\n（选项C和D）后臂和前臂接受来自桡神经的后皮支的感觉支配。\n\n（选项E）鱼际隆起接受来自正中神经的掌皮支的感觉支配，该神经起源于腕管近端。\n\n教育目标：\n肌皮神经支配喙肱肌（屈曲和内收手臂）和主要的肘屈肌（例如，肱二头肌、肱肌），然后继续向远端延伸，为外侧前臂提供感觉支配。它源自臂丛神经的上干（C5-C7），并可能因外伤或剧烈的上肢运动而受损。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"
