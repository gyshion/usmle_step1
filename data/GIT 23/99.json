    "en": "Broadly speaking, laboratory tests used in the evaluation of hepatobiliary disease either assess liver functionality (eg, prothrombin time, bilirubin, albumin, cholesterol) or the structural integrity and cellular intactness of the liver (eg, transaminases) or the biliary tract (eg, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transferase).\n\nAlkaline phosphatase represents a group of enzymes associated with metabolic activity in a number of tissues, including liver, bone, intestine, kidney, placenta, leukocytes, and some neoplasms. Bone and liver are the primary sources of alkaline phosphatase, with threefold elevations considered a relatively nonspecific finding for many liver diseases. To clarify the importance of a moderately elevated alkaline phosphatase, the hepatic γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) should be evaluated.\n\nγ-glutamyl transpeptidase is an enzyme predominantly present in hepatocytes and biliary epithelia. While it too can be found in various extrahepatic tissues (organs such as kidney, spleen, pancreas, heart, lung, and brain), GGTP is not present to a significant extent in bone. It is therefore particularly useful in determining whether an elevated alkaline phosphatase is of hepatic or bony origin.\n\n(Choice A) Measurement of unconjugated bilirubin (especially in contrast to conjugated bilirubin) can be of assistance in distinguishing hemolytic conditions from hepatic dysfunction or bile duct obstruction. This test is not particularly helpful in following up an elevated alkaline phosphatase.\n\n(Choice B) Lactate dehydrogenase is a relatively nonspecific test that can be of some assistance in the evaluation of tissue injury or death. It is not the most helpful test in following up an elevated alkaline phosphatase.\n\n(Choice C) Serum ammonia levels can be of assistance in determining the extent of liver failure or gastrointestinal bleeding, among other conditions. It is not the most helpful test in following up an elevated alkaline phosphatase.\n\n(Choice D) Prothrombin time is of assistance in assessing coagulable ability and liver functionality, especially in the acute setting. It is not the most helpful test in following up an elevated alkaline phosphatase.\n\n(Choice F) Aspartate aminotransferase is of assistance in assessing and monitoring hepatic damage. It is not the most helpful test in following up an elevated alkaline phosphatase.\n\nEducational Objective: A moderately elevated alkaline phosphatase of unclear etiology should be followed up with γ-glutamyl transpeptidase.",
    "zh": "一般来说，用于评估肝胆疾病的实验室检查要么评估肝功能（例如，凝血酶原时间、胆红素、白蛋白、胆固醇），要么评估肝脏的结构完整性和细胞完整性（例如，转氨酶）或胆道（例如，碱性磷酸酶、γ-谷氨酰转移酶）。\n\n碱性磷酸酶代表一组与许多组织中的代谢活动相关的酶，包括肝脏、骨骼、肠道、肾脏、胎盘、白细胞和一些肿瘤。骨骼和肝脏是碱性磷酸酶的主要来源，三倍升高被认为是许多肝病的相对非特异性发现。为了阐明中度升高的碱性磷酸酶的重要性，应评估肝γ-谷氨酰转肽酶 (GGTP)。\n\nγ-谷氨酰转肽酶是一种主要存在于肝细胞和胆道上皮细胞中的酶。虽然它也可以在各种肝外组织（如肾脏、脾脏、胰腺、心脏、肺和大脑等器官）中找到，但GGTP在骨骼中不存在，因此对于确定碱性磷酸酶升高是肝源性还是骨源性特别有用。\n\n（选项 A）测量未结合胆红素（特别是与结合胆红素相比）可以帮助区分溶血性疾病与肝功能障碍或胆管梗阻。这项检查对于随访碱性磷酸酶升高没有特别的帮助。\n\n（选项 B）乳酸脱氢酶是一种相对非特异性的检查，可对组织损伤或死亡的评估提供一些帮助。对于随访碱性磷酸酶升高，它不是最有用的检查。\n\n（选项 C）血氨水平可以帮助确定肝功能衰竭或胃肠道出血的程度，以及其他情况。对于随访碱性磷酸酶升高，它不是最有用的检查。\n\n（选项 D）凝血酶原时间有助于评估凝血能力和肝功能，尤其是在急性情况下。对于随访碱性磷酸酶升高，它不是最有用的检查。\n\n（选项 F）天冬氨酸氨基转移酶有助于评估和监测肝损伤。对于随访碱性磷酸酶升高，它不是最有用的检查。\n\n教育目标：对于病因不明的中度升高的碱性磷酸酶，应随访γ-谷氨酰转肽酶。"

    "en": "This question tests the appropriate next step in evaluating an elevated alkaline phosphatase level. Specifically, it assesses the understanding of how to differentiate between hepatic and non-hepatic sources of alkaline phosphatase elevation.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that a moderately elevated alkaline phosphatase requires further investigation to determine its origin. Measuring γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) is the most appropriate next step to differentiate between liver and bone sources.",
