    "en": "A surveillance study is conducted to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of a drug currently being used to treat patients with heart failure. Researchers enroll 8,300 patients with heart failure. The patients receive the drug once daily for 6 months. The results show significant clinical improvement, but severe hypernatremia is observed in 23 patients. The study publication recommends a lower dose of the drug in patients with baseline normonatremia and hypokalemia to prevent hypernatremia.",

    "en": "Efficacy and safety of new drugs are established during the clinical trials process. New drugs are approved by a regulatory body (ie, Food and Drug Administration) following review of phase I-III trials. Phases differ in size, objective, and participant selection.\n\n*   Phase I: Assesses safety and pharmacokinetics. Phase I is usually conducted with a small number (eg, 20-80) of healthy participants. It often is performed in a strictly controlled environment with extensive biochemical and physiologic monitoring.\n*   Phase II: Assesses preliminary efficacy and optimal dosing. Phase II is conducted with a small number of participants who have the condition of interest, and patient outcomes are often compared to historical controls. It sometimes is called a pilot study.\n*   Phase III: Compares treatment to standard of care. Phase III is conducted as a large, randomized, controlled trial (in contrast to this study, which is a surveillance study with no control group) to better assess treatment response and safety. It may include analysis of treatment effects in selected subsets of the target patient population.\n\nThe description of this study of a currently available drug is most consistent with a phase IV (postmarketing) study, which is conducted after regulatory approval of the drug. Phase IV assesses long-term safety and effectiveness and characterizes uncommon or delayed adverse effects. It typically involves surveillance of a large number of treated participants to detect small effects and variability in diverse patient populations. The results are often used to refine the use of the drug in clinical practice. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice E) Preclinical studies are typically conducted without human subjects (ie, bench research) largely to determine the mechanism of action and/or make a preliminary estimation of safety and efficacy.\n\nEducational objective:\nPhase IV (postmarketing) trials are conducted with drugs that have already been approved for use in order to study long-term effectiveness and better characterize uncommon or delayed adverse effects. They are typically designed to identify small treatment effects (ie, a high power study with large numbers of participants) in diverse patient populations, and the results may be used to refine the use of drugs in clinical practice.",
    "zh": "新药的疗效和安全性是在临床试验过程中确立的。在审查了 I-III 期试验后，新药会获得监管机构（即食品药品监督管理局）的批准。各阶段在规模、目标和参与者选择上有所不同。\n\n*   I 期：评估安全性和药代动力学。I 期通常与少数（例如，20-80 人）健康参与者一起进行。它通常在严格控制的环境中进行，并进行广泛的生化和生理监测。\n*   II 期：评估初步疗效和最佳剂量。II 期与少数患有相关疾病的参与者一起进行，并且患者的结局通常与历史对照组进行比较。它有时被称为试点研究。\n*   III 期：将治疗方法与标准护理进行比较。III 期作为一项大型、随机、对照试验（与本研究形成对比，本研究是一项没有对照组的监测研究）进行，以更好地评估治疗反应和安全性。它可能包括对目标患者人群的选定亚组的治疗效果进行分析。\n\n对目前可用药物的这项研究的描述与 IV 期（上市后）研究最为一致，该研究在药物获得监管部门批准后进行。IV 期评估长期安全性和有效性，并描述不常见或延迟的不良反应。它通常涉及对大量接受治疗的参与者进行监测，以检测不同患者人群中的微小影响和变异性。结果通常用于完善药物在临床实践中的使用。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项 E）临床前研究通常在没有人类受试者的情况下进行（即，实验室研究），主要用于确定作用机制和/或对安全性及有效性进行初步估计。\n\n教育目标：\nIV 期（上市后）试验使用已获批准使用的药物进行，以研究长期有效性并更好地描述不常见或延迟的不良反应。它们通常旨在识别不同患者人群中的微小治疗效果（即，具有大量参与者的高效研究），并且结果可用于完善药物在临床实践中的使用。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the different phases of clinical trials, specifically the characteristics of a Phase IV (post-marketing) surveillance study. It assesses the ability to differentiate between the objectives and methodologies of each phase.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the study involves a drug already in use, focuses on long-term effects and rare adverse events, and includes a large patient population. These are hallmarks of Phase IV clinical trials.",
