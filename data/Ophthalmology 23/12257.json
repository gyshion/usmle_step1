During the last 3 months, she has had persistent headaches that she attributes to migraines. The patient takes over-the-counter analgesics as needed. Blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg and pulse is 72/min and regular. BMI is 32.4 kg/m². Funduscopic findings of the left eye are shown in the image below, with similar findings in the right eye. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION (pseudotumor cerebri). This condition typically presents in young obese women with daily headache, bilaterally symmetric papilledema, and TRANSIENT VISUAL DISTURBANCES related to impaired cerebral venous outflow and ELEVATED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE. Symptoms characteristically worsen during the Valsalva maneuver (eg, bending down, coughing) because intracranial pressure increases.\n\nIncreased intracranial pressure is transmitted through the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space, which is continuous with the optic nerve sheath. This buildup of pressure compresses the optic nerves externally, which in turn IMPAIRS AXOPLASMIC FLOW within the OPTIC NERVES, causing bilateral optic disc edema (papilledema). Funduscopy shows elevation of the optic disc with blurred disc margins. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) Choroidal inflammation is characteristic of posterior uveitis, which typically presents with painless vision loss and floaters. Ophthalmic examination may show inflammation/leukocytes in the vitreous humor. Uveitis is often associated with systemic inflammatory disorders (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis).\n\n(Choice C) An acute increase in intraocular pressure is characteristic of angle-closure glaucoma, which typically presents with painful monocular vision loss, headache, vomiting, and conjunctival injection with a poorly reactive middilated pupil. Chronic increases in intraocular pressure can cause optic disc cupping due to atrophy of the optic nerve head. Glaucoma usually affects older individuals.\n\n(Choice D) Optic neuritis is frequently associated with multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating CNS disease that typically affects women age 15-50. Although swelling of the optic disc can be present on funduscopy, optic neuritis usually causes sustained monocular vision loss over several weeks with painful eye movement rather than daily headaches with transient bilateral vision loss.\n\n(Choice E) Retinal ischemia can manifest with painless transient monocular vision loss (amaurosis fugax) and is most commonly caused by atherosclerotic emboli originating from the ipsilateral carotid artery. Funduscopy may show embolic plaques and retinal whitening caused by ischemia. This condition typically affects older patients with vascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus). {{exhibit_3}}\n\nEducational objective:\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) presents in young obese women with daily headache (which worsens during the Valsalva maneuver), bilaterally symmetric papilledema, and transient visual disturbances. Increased intracranial pressure compresses the optic nerves, resulting in impaired axoplasmic flow and optic disc edema.",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现与特发性颅内高压（假性脑肿瘤）一致。这种情况通常表现为年轻肥胖女性的每日头痛、双侧对称性视乳头水肿和与脑静脉回流受损及颅内压升高相关的短暂性视觉障碍。症状在Valsalva动作期间（例如，弯腰、咳嗽）通常会恶化，因为颅内压会升高。\n\n颅内压升高通过蛛网膜下腔的脑脊液传递，后者与视神经鞘相连。这种压力积聚会从外部压迫视神经，进而损害视神经内的轴浆流动，导致双侧视盘水肿（视乳头水肿）。眼底镜检查显示视盘隆起，边界模糊。 {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(选项A) 脉络膜炎症是后葡萄膜炎的特征，后者通常表现为无痛性视力丧失和飞蚊症。眼科检查可能会显示玻璃体液中的炎症/白细胞。葡萄膜炎 thường与全身性炎症性疾病（如炎症性肠病、强直性脊柱炎）有关。\n\n(选项C) 眼内压的急剧升高是闭角型青光眼的特征，其通常表现为单眼视力丧失、头痛、呕吐和结膜充血，伴有反应迟钝的瞳孔散大。眼内压的慢性升高会导致视盘凹陷，这是由于视神经头萎缩所致。青光眼通常影响老年人。\n\n(选项D) 视神经炎 thường与多发性硬化症相关，后者是一种脱髓鞘中枢神经系统疾病，通常影响15-50岁的女性。虽然视盘肿胀可在眼底镜检查中出现，但视神经炎通常导致持续数周的单眼视力丧失，伴有眼球运动疼痛，而不是每日头痛，伴有短暂的双侧视力丧失。\n\n(选项E) 视网膜缺血可表现为无痛性短暂性单眼视力丧失（一过性黑蒙），最常见的原因是源自同侧颈动脉的动脉粥样硬化栓子。眼底镜检查可能会显示栓塞斑块和缺血引起的视网膜变白。这种情况通常影响有血管危险因素的年长患者（例如，高血压、高脂血症、糖尿病）。 {{exhibit_3}}\n\n教育目标：\n特发性颅内高压（假性脑肿瘤）在年轻肥胖女性中表现为每日头痛（在Valsalva动作期间恶化）、双侧对称性视乳头水肿和短暂性视觉障碍。颅内压升高压迫视神经，导致轴浆流动受损和视盘水肿。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), its typical presentation, pathophysiology, and characteristic funduscopic findings. It requires differentiating this condition from other causes of visual disturbances and optic disc abnormalities.\n\nTo solve this question, one must correlate the patient's demographic profile (young, obese woman), symptoms (headache, transient visual changes exacerbated by Valsalva), and funduscopic findings (papilledema) with the underlying pathophysiology of elevated intracranial pressure affecting the optic nerve. A systematic approach to differential diagnosis for visual disturbances and optic disc edema is crucial.",
