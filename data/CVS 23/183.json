  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The blood flow curve shows a cyclical variation in flow during the cardiac cycle, with maximum flow occurring during diastole and minimal flow occurring during ventricular systole. This pattern is unique for the left ventricular myocardium. The great majority of blood flows through the vascular beds of the left ventricle during diastole, when the coronary vessels are not compressed by the high ventricular wall pressures created by myocardial contraction. This systolic reduction in blood flow is greatest in the subendocardial myocardium (where wall pressures are the highest), making it the region most prone to ischemia and myocardial infarction.\n\n(Choices A, B, D, E, and G) In all other organs, blood flows continuously throughout the cardiac cycle down the pressure gradient from the arterial source into the venous circulation.\n\n(Choice F) During systole, pressures in the right ventricle are much lower than in the left ventricle (only ~25 mm Hg compared to ~120 mm Hg). As a result, coronary perfusion pressure is able to overcome right ventricular wall pressure throughout the cardiac cycle, leading to relatively constant blood flow to the right ventricular myocardium.\n\nEducational objective:\nDuring ventricular systole, the coronary vessels supplying the left ventricle are compressed by the surrounding muscle. As a result, the majority of left ventricular blood flow occurs during diastole. The systolic reduction in coronary blood flow is greatest in the subendocardial region, making this portion of the left ventricle most prone to ischemia and infarction.",
    "zh": "血流曲线显示在心脏周期内血流呈周期性变化，最大血流发生在舒张期，最小血流发生在心室收缩期。这种模式对于左心室心肌是独一无二的。在舒张期，大部分血液流经左心室的血管床，此时冠状动脉血管未受到心肌收缩产生的高心室壁压力的压迫。这种收缩期血流减少在心内膜下心肌（壁压最高的地方）中最大，这使其成为最容易发生缺血和心肌梗死（梗塞）的区域。\n\n（选项A、B、D、E和G）在所有其他器官中，血液在整个心脏周期内持续流动，沿着压力梯度从动脉来源流向静脉循环。\n\n（选项F）在收缩期，右心室的压力远低于左心室（仅约25 mmHg，而左心室约为120 mmHg）。因此，冠状动脉灌注压力能够在整个心脏周期内克服右心室壁压力，从而导致右心室心肌的血流相对恒定。\n\n教学目标：\n在心室收缩期，为左心室供血的冠状动脉血管受到周围肌肉的压迫。因此，左心室的大部分血流发生在舒张期。收缩期冠状动脉血流的减少在心内膜下区域最大，这使得左心室的这部分区域最容易发生缺血和梗死。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of blood flow patterns in different tissues, specifically the unique pattern observed in the left ventricular myocardium due to compression of coronary vessels during systole. The key to solving this question is recognizing the cyclical variation in blood flow, with maximum flow during diastole and minimal flow during systole, which is characteristic of the left ventricle.",
