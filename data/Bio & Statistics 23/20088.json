  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "In this question, the population pyramid has a narrow bottom, which represents a LOW BIRTH RATE, and a wide top, which represents a low mortality rate (Choices A and B). The percentage of people in each age cohort increases with age, with the greatest proportion of people in the age 70+ cohort (Choice E). This means that the population has a LONG LIFE EXPECTANCY—a characteristic of OLD POPULATIONS (Choice D).\n\nBecause the percentage of people in the age 0-9 cohort (about 10% for both men and women) is lower than the percentage of people in the age 70+ cohort (about 20% for both men and women), the younger cohorts are not able to replace the older cohorts as they die off, leading to a reduction in the population (ie, POPULATION SHRINKS). This is a classic example of a constrictive pyramid {{exhibit_2}}.",
    "zh": "在本题中，人口金字塔底部狭窄，代表着低出生率，顶部宽阔，代表着低死亡率（选项 A 和 B）。每个年龄组的人口比例随着年龄的增长而增加，70 岁以上年龄组的人口比例最高（选项 E）。这意味着该人口具有长寿命——这是老龄人口的特征（选项 D）。\n\n由于 0-9 岁年龄组的人口比例（男性和女性均约为 10%）低于 70 岁以上年龄组的人口比例（男性和女性均约为 20%），因此年轻人群无法替代年老人群的死亡，导致人口减少（即，人口萎缩）。这是一个收缩型金字塔的典型例子 {{exhibit_2}}。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the interpretation of population pyramids and their relationship to birth rates, death rates, life expectancy, and population growth. Understanding the shape of the pyramid and its implications for the age structure of the population is crucial.\n\nTo solve this question, analyze the shape of the population pyramid. A narrow base indicates low birth rates, while a wide top suggests a high proportion of older individuals and longer life expectancy. This combination is characteristic of an aging population.",
