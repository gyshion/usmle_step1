    "en": "A 20-year-old college student comes to the office due to falling asleep at inappropriate times. He has an irresistible urge to sleep during the day, and these \"naps\" occur unpredictably, sometimes at the start of class or during examinations. He sleeps 6-7 hours per night and feels refreshed when he awakens. He also experiences frightening auditory hallucinations before falling asleep. He was recently in a motor vehicle collision after falling asleep at the wheel, which resulted in only a minor sprain of his wrist. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Physical examination is unremarkable.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's presentation of excessive daytime sleepiness, irresistible urges to sleep, and hypnagogic hallucinations is highly suggestive of NARCOLEPSY. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy include recurrent lapses into sleep or naps (>=3 times/week for 3 months) and at least one of the following: cataplexy (brief loss of muscle tone precipitated by strong emotion), low cerebrospinal fluid levels of hypocretin-1, or shortened REM sleep latency. Associated features include hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. The etiology of narcolepsy is believed to be due to low levels of the stimulatory neurotransmitter orexin (ie, hypocretin), which is involved in maintaining wakefulness and suppressing REM sleep-related phenomena.\n\nTreatment involves the use of agents that promote wakefulness (psychostimulants). MODAFINIL, a nonamphetamine stimulant, has become the first-line agent because it is effective and well tolerated and its misuse is rare. The mechanism of action is not well described, but modafinil may enhance dopaminergic signaling. Amphetamines are second-line agents due to their sympathomimetic side effects (eg, hypertension, arrhythmia, psychosis) and risk for misuse and dependency.\n\n(Choice A) Carbamazepine is used to treat seizures, bipolar disorder, and trigeminal neuralgia, not narcolepsy.\n(Choices B and E) Zolpidem is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic used for insomnia. The use of zolpidem or a benzodiazepine (eg, clonazepam) in patients with narcolepsy is relatively contraindicated due to the risk of worsening daytime sedation.\n(Choice C) Melatonin is used for treating jet lag and delayed sleep-wake phase syndrome, not narcolepsy.",
    "zh": "患者出现过度白天嗜睡、无法抗拒的睡意和入睡幻觉，高度提示为发作性睡病。发作性睡病的DSM-5诊断标准包括反复入睡或小睡（每周>=3次，持续3个月）以及以下至少一项：猝倒（由强烈情绪引发的短暂肌肉张力丧失）、脑脊液中下丘脑素-1水平低或REM睡眠潜伏期缩短。相关特征包括入睡或睡醒幻觉和睡眠麻痹。发作性睡病病因被认为与兴奋性神经递质orexin（即，下丘脑素）水平低有关，该物质参与维持清醒和抑制REM睡眠相关现象。\n\n治疗包括使用促进清醒的药物（精神兴奋剂）。莫达非尼，一种非苯丙胺类兴奋剂，已成为一线用药，因为它有效且耐受性好，且误用情况罕见。其作用机制尚不明确，但莫达非尼可能增强多巴胺能信号传导。苯丙胺类药物是二线药物，因为它们具有拟交感神经作用副作用（例如，高血压、心律失常、精神病）以及误用和依赖的风险。\n\n（选项A）卡马西平用于治疗癫痫、双相情感障碍和三叉神经痛，而非发作性睡病。\n（选项B和E）佐匹克隆是一种用于失眠的非苯二氮卓类催眠药。由于存在加重白天镇静的风险，在发作性睡病患者中使用佐匹克隆或苯二氮卓类药物（例如，氯硝西泮）相对禁忌。\n（选项C）褪黑激素用于治疗时差反应和睡眠-觉醒时相延迟综合征，而非发作性睡病。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the diagnosis and pharmacologic management of narcolepsy, a chronic neurologic disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and other sleep-related phenomena.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the classic symptoms of narcolepsy, understanding its pathophysiology related to hypocretin deficiency, and identifying the first-line pharmacologic treatment, which is a wakefulness-promoting agent like modafinil.",
