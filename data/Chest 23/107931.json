    "en": "A 52-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance visit. The patient feels well. He is a former cigarette smoker of 15 pack-years but quit 10 years ago. The patient no longer has cravings or an interest in smoking. He enjoys restoring and preserving antique paintings, spending considerable time in his basement studio. The patient has an African gray parrot and lives with his wife in a home built in the 1950s. Cardiovascular and pulmonary examinations are normal. He expresses concern about his risk for lung cancer.",

    "en": "This former smoker has an elevated lifetime risk for lung cancer. He quit smoking, which is the single most important intervention for decreasing his risk. In addition to combustible tobacco, several ENVIRONMENTAL CARCINOGENS have been definitively linked to lung cancer. The most significant of these is RADON (²²²Rn), a colorless, odorless, RADIOACTIVE gas produced from the decay of uranium, found throughout the earth. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nRadon enters structures through subterranean cracks and contaminated groundwater and accumulates in the lower levels of the home (eg, BASEMENTS). Radon is unstable and undergoes nuclear decay, emitting radiation in the form of alpha particles. Although they have minimal penetration in human tissue (< 50 microns), alpha particles are the most potent form of DNA-damaging ionizing radiation. Because radon gas is INHALED, the respiratory tract epithelium is most susceptible to mutagenesis.\n\nRadon is the second-leading cause of lung cancer in the US and the leading environmental risk factor for lung cancer in NONSMOKERS. The risk is multiplied in current or previous smokers. Radon testing and mitigation (eg, negative soil depressurization to prevent upward gas seepage) are recommended by multiple federal agencies and medical societies.\n\n(Choice A) Reactive metabolites of benzene (benzoquinones) cause oxidative DNA damage; benzene is a carcinogen implicated in hematologic neoplasms (eg, acute leukemias). The main domestic source of benzene exposure is cigarette smoke. Organic solvents (eg, paint thinners, lacquers) contain low levels of benzene and can irritate the mucosae (eg, conjunctivitis, nonspecific respiratory tract inflammation) but are not clearly linked to lung cancer.\n\n(Choices B and D) Bird ownership (eg, parrots) and mold spores (eg, *Penicillium* spp., *Aspergillus* spp.) can predispose to hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a type IV inflammatory lung disease (granulomatous, T-lymphocyte–driven) that can transition into pulmonary fibrosis if untreated. However, it does not cause oncogenic DNA damage.\n\n(Choice C) Bisphenol A is a polycarbonate compound that is ubiquitous in consumer goods (eg, plastic containers). It is classified as an endocrine-disrupting chemical, functioning as mixed estrogen agonist-antagonist and has been linked to an array of reproductive (eg, decreased spermatogenesis, decreased ovarian follicle mass) and cardiometabolic (eg, insulin resistance) disorders.",
    "zh": "这位前吸烟者患肺癌的终生风险升高。他戒烟了，这是降低其风险的最重要的干预措施。除了可燃性烟草外，几种环境致癌物也已明确与肺癌相关。其中最重要的是氡(²²²Rn)，这是一种无色、无味、具有放射性的气体，由铀衰变产生，存在于整个地球中。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n氡通过地下裂缝和受污染的地下水进入建筑物，并在房屋的较低楼层（例如，地下室）积聚。氡不稳定并发生核衰变，以α粒子的形式发射辐射。尽管它们在人体组织中的穿透力极小（< 50微米），但α粒子是DNA损伤电离辐射的最有效形式。由于吸入氡气，呼吸道上皮最容易发生突变。\n\n氡是美国肺癌的第二大原因，也是非吸烟者肺癌的主要环境危险因素。吸烟者或曾吸烟者的风险会增加。多个联邦机构和医学协会建议进行氡气检测和缓解（例如，负压土壤减压以防止气体向上渗漏）。\n\n(选项A) 苯的反应性代谢物（苯醌）会导致氧化性DNA损伤；苯是一种与血液系统肿瘤（例如，急性白血病）相关的致癌物。苯的主要家庭来源是香烟烟雾。有机溶剂（例如，油漆稀释剂、清漆）含有低水平的苯，可刺激粘膜（例如，结膜炎、非特异性呼吸道炎症），但与肺癌没有明确联系。\n\n(选项B和D) 养鸟（例如，鹦鹉）和霉菌孢子（例如，青霉菌属、曲霉属）可能易患超敏性肺炎，这是一种IV型炎症性肺病（肉芽肿性、T淋巴细胞驱动），如果未经治疗，可发展为肺纤维化。然而，它不会引起致癌性DNA损伤。\n\n(选项C) 双酚A是一种聚碳酸酯化合物，广泛存在于消费品中（例如，塑料容器）。它被归类为内分泌干扰化学物质，发挥混合的雌激素激动剂-拮抗剂作用，并与一系列生殖（例如，精子发生减少、卵巢卵泡量减少）和心代谢（例如，胰岛素抵抗）疾病相关。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of environmental risk factors for lung cancer, specifically radon exposure. The question also assesses understanding of other potential environmental exposures and their association with lung disease.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's history and lifestyle, focusing on potential environmental exposures in his home and hobbies. Recognize that radon is a significant risk factor for lung cancer, especially in smokers and former smokers, and is commonly found in basements.",
