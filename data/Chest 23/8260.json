    "en": "Work of breathing (WOB) is the energy expended during respiration, and comprises the work required to overcome both elastic and airflow resistance:\n\n*   Elastic resistance is the opposition to lung expansion caused by the intrinsic elastic properties of the lungs and chest wall; it is increased at higher tidal volumes (elastic recoil increases at high lung volumes).\n\n    Restrictive lung diseases (eg, pulmonary fibrosis, severe obesity) are characterized by higher than normal elastic resistance. Interstitial fibrosis increases lung stiffness whereas severe obesity increases chest wall stiffness.\n*   Airflow resistance is the opposition to airflow created by limited airway diameter and turbulent airflow; it is increased at higher respiratory rates (due to faster airflow with increased turbulence) and at low lung volumes (due to reduced airway diameter). Obstructive lung diseases (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) increase airflow resistance due to bronchoconstriction and/or airway collapse.\n\nTo reduce the WOB, the tidal volume and respiratory rate are optimized by the respiratory control centers. In patients with restrictive lung disease, the WOB is minimized when the tidal volume is low. Therefore, to compensate for low lung volumes, rapid, shallow breathing is favored (as in this patient). In contrast, in patients who have obstructive lung disease, the WOB is minimized with lower respiratory rates and higher tidal volumes (ie, relatively slow, deep breathing) (Choice C).\n\n(Choice A) Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency causes panacinar emphysema, a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This causes increased airflow resistance, and slow, deep breaths will be favored to minimize the WOB.\n\n(Choice B) Anxiety disorders (eg, panic attacks) are occasionally associated with rapid, shallow breathing; however, the lungs function normally and, therefore, the WOB versus the respiratory rate curve is normal. Because the breathing rate is higher than the normal optimal rate, the work done against airflow resistance (and total work) is increased.\n\n(Choice D) A fixed upper airway obstruction (eg, caused by a large goiter) leads to increased air flow resistance and favors slow, deep breaths to minimize the WOB.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe work of breathing is minimized in patients with increased elastic resistance (eg, pulmonary fibrosis) when their respiratory rate is high and tidal volume is low (fast, shallow breaths). In contrast, patients with diseases that increase airflow resistance (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) breathe at a lower respiratory rate and higher tidal volume (slow, deep breaths) to minimize the work of breathing.",
    "zh": "呼吸功 (WOB) 是呼吸过程中消耗的能量，包括克服弹性和气流阻力所需的工作：\n\n*   弹性阻力是由于肺和胸壁的固有弹性特性引起的对肺扩张的阻力；它在高潮气量时增加（弹性回缩在高肺容量时增加）。\n\n    限制性肺病（如肺纤维化、重度肥胖）的特征是弹性阻力高于正常水平。间质纤维化增加肺刚度，而重度肥胖增加胸壁刚度。\n*   气流阻力是由于气道直径受限和气流湍流引起的对气流的阻力；它在较高的呼吸频率下（由于气流加快，湍流增加）和较低的肺容量下（由于气道直径减小）增加。阻塞性肺病（如哮喘、慢性阻塞性肺病）由于支气管收缩和/或气道塌陷而增加气流阻力。\n\n为了减少 WOB，呼吸控制中心优化了潮气量和呼吸频率。在患有限制性肺病的患者中，当潮气量较低时，WOB 最小化。因此，为了补偿低肺容量，倾向于快速、浅的呼吸（如本患者）。相反，在患有阻塞性肺病的患者中，WOB 通过较低的呼吸频率和较高的潮气量（即，相对缓慢、深呼吸）而最小化（选择 C）。\n\n（选择 A） α-1 抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症导致全小叶肺气肿，这是一种慢性阻塞性肺病。这会导致气流阻力增加，并且倾向于缓慢、深呼吸以最大限度地减少 WOB。\n\n（选择 B）焦虑症（如惊恐发作）有时与快速、浅呼吸有关；然而，肺功能正常，因此 WOB 与呼吸频率的曲线是正常的。由于呼吸频率高于正常的最佳速率，对抗气流阻力（和总功）所做的工作增加。\n\n（选择 D）固定的上气道阻塞（例如，由大的甲状腺肿引起）导致气流阻力增加，并倾向于缓慢、深呼吸以最大限度地减少 WOB。\n\n教育目标：\n当患有弹性阻力增加的患者（例如，肺纤维化）的呼吸频率高且潮气量低（快速、浅呼吸）时，呼吸功最小化。相反，患有增加气流阻力的疾病的患者（例如，哮喘、慢性阻塞性肺病）以较低的呼吸频率和较高的潮气量（缓慢、深呼吸）进行呼吸，以最大限度地减少呼吸功。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of work of breathing (WOB) in the context of restrictive and obstructive lung diseases. It requires interpreting a graph showing the relationship between respiratory rate and WOB in a patient compared to a normal individual.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that patients with restrictive lung diseases tend to have rapid, shallow breathing to minimize WOB due to low tidal volumes. The graph shows increased WOB at normal respiratory rates, suggesting a restrictive process.",
