    "en": "A 65-year-old woman comes to the office after finding blood in her stool. She is physically active and exercises regularly. She does not use tobacco or alcohol. She has no history of peptic ulcer disease. Her physical examination is unremarkable. Colonoscopy reveals several large adenomatous polyps with severe dysplasia in the sigmoid colon. She undergoes resection of the sigmoid colon, and her carcinoembryonic antigen level is normal. The patient is interested in decreasing her chances of developing new polyps and colon cancer. The physician discusses exercise, healthy weight, and dietary factors associated with reduction of colon cancer risk, including increased fiber intake and reduced consumption of refined sugars and fat. Which of the following enzymes could be inhibited with medication to further reduce this patient's risk of developing recurrent adenoma?",
    "zh": "一位65岁女性因发现便血前来就诊。她身体活跃， নিয়মিত 锻炼。她不吸烟，不饮酒。她没有消化性溃疡病史。体格检查无特殊发现。结肠镜检查显示乙状结肠内有几个大的腺瘤性息肉，伴有重度异型增生。她接受了乙状结肠切除术，她的癌胚抗原水平正常。患者有兴趣降低其发生新息肉和结肠癌的几率。医生讨论了运动、健康体重和与降低结肠癌风险相关的饮食因素，包括增加纤维摄入量和减少精制糖和脂肪的摄入。以下哪种酶可以用药物抑制，以进一步降低该患者复发性腺瘤的风险？"

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Adenomatous polyps {{exhibit_1}} contain dysplastic mucosa and are premalignant. They tend to develop in patients age >50 as a result of mutations in the APC tumor suppressor gene, which regulates cell growth and adhesion. Progression to adenocarcinoma proceeds as other mutations occur in genes such as KRAS and TP53. This accumulation of gene mutations is called the \"adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence.\"\n\nIncreased activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been found in many forms of colon adenocarcinoma and in inherited polyposes syndromes. This may be due to the need for COX-induced prostaglandin production, which leads to epithelial proliferation. Regular aspirin (a COX inhibitor) intake has been associated with lower rates of colonic adenoma and adenocarcinoma, although this must be balanced against bleeding risk.\n\n(Choice A) Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which plays an important role in hypertension and congestive heart failure. ACE inhibitors are widely used to treat these conditions.\n\n(Choice B) Caspases are cysteine proteases that are an essential component in cellular apoptosis. Inhibition of caspase activity would lead to cells that are resistant to apoptosis; this is one of the mechanisms involved in the progression of the adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence.\n\n(Choices D and E) Glutamate dehydrogenase (produces ammonia for use in the urea cycle) and phenylalanine hydroxylase (converts phenylalanine to tyrosine) have not been implicated in the development of adenomatous polyps.\n\n(Choice F) Xanthine oxidase is an enzyme that participates in uric acid synthesis. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor used to lower serum levels of uric acid in gout and tumor lysis syndrome.\n\nEducational objective:\nAdenomatous polyps contain dysplastic mucosa and are premalignant. Regular screening with timely excision of polyps is effective for prevention of colon adenocarcinoma. Studies have linked increased activity of cyclooxygenase-2 to some forms of colon adenocarcinoma and suggest that regular aspirin use decreases adenomatous polyp formation.",
    "zh": "腺瘤性息肉 {{exhibit_1}} 含有异型增生的粘膜，是癌前病变。它们往往发生在年龄 >50 岁的患者中，是APC肿瘤抑制基因突变的结果，该基因调节细胞生长和粘附。进展为腺癌是由于其他基因（如KRAS和TP53）发生突变。这种基因突变的积累被称为“腺瘤-癌变序列”。\n\n在多种形式的结肠腺癌和遗传性息肉病综合征中，已发现环氧化酶-2 (COX-2) 的活性增加。这可能是由于需要 COX 诱导的前列腺素生成，从而导致上皮增殖。定期服用阿司匹林（一种 COX 抑制剂）与较低的结肠腺瘤和腺癌发生率相关，尽管这必须与出血风险相权衡。\n\n(选项 A) 血管紧张素转换酶 (ACE) 将血管紧张素 I 转化为血管紧张素 II，后者在高血压和充血性心力衰竭中起重要作用。ACE 抑制剂被广泛用于治疗这些疾病。\n\n(选项 B) 半胱天冬酶是细胞凋亡中的必需组成部分，属于半胱氨酸蛋白酶。抑制半胱天冬酶活性会导致细胞对凋亡产生抵抗力；这是腺瘤-癌变序列进展中涉及的机制之一。\n\n(选项 D 和 E) 谷氨酸脱氢酶（产生氨用于尿素循环）和苯丙氨酸羟化酶（将苯丙氨酸转化为酪氨酸）与腺瘤性息肉的发生无关。\n\n(选项 F) 黄嘌呤氧化酶是一种参与尿酸合成的酶。别嘌呤醇是一种黄嘌呤氧化酶抑制剂，用于降低痛风和肿瘤溶解综合征患者的血清尿酸水平。\n\n教育目标：\n腺瘤性息肉含有异型增生粘膜，是癌前病变。定期筛查，及时切除息肉可有效预防结肠腺癌。研究表明，环氧化酶-2 活性增加与某些形式的结肠腺癌有关，并提示定期服用阿司匹林可减少腺瘤性息肉的形成。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence in colorectal cancer and the role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in promoting epithelial proliferation. It also assesses understanding of potential chemopreventive strategies, such as aspirin use, to reduce the risk of adenomatous polyp formation.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the link between COX-2 activity and colon cancer development. Understanding that aspirin, a COX inhibitor, can decrease adenomatous polyp formation helps identify the correct answer. Eliminating options based on their unrelatedness to colon cancer or polyp formation is also crucial.",
