    "en": "A research scientist injects hepatocellular carcinoma cells into the liver parenchyma of an experimental guinea pig. Serial observations show that the tumor cells progressively proliferate and invade the liver parenchyma to form a large mass. After some time, malignant cells begin to penetrate the vascular basement membrane to gain access to the circulation. During the process of basement membrane invasion, expression of which of the following substances is most likely to be increased in the tumor cells?",

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Metalloproteinases are zinc-containing enzymes that degrade components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membrane, which are composed primarily of laminin and collagens IV and VII. These enzymes participate in many physiologic processes, such as tissue remodeling and embryogenesis. They also facilitate basement membrane penetration, which distinguishes an invasive tumor from carcinoma in situ and includes the following steps:\n\n1. Tumor cells detach from surrounding cells in a process commonly determined by decreased (rather than increased) expression of adhesion molecules, including E-cadherins (Choice D).\n2. Tumor cells adhere to the basement membrane; this is facilitated by increased expression of laminin and other adhesion molecules.\n3. Tumor cells invade the basement membrane via enhanced secretion of proteolytic enzymes (eg, metalloproteinases, cathepsin D protease).\n\n(Choice A) Acid hydrolases, which function at acidic pH, are primarily degradative lysosomal enzymes.\n(Choice B) In humans, alkaline phosphatase is concentrated in liver cells; elevated levels suggest an obstructive biliary process.\n(Choice C) Carboxypeptidases cleave peptide bonds at the carboxy-terminal; some participate in the synthesis of insulin and neuropeptides.\n(Choice E) Hyaluronic acid is an ECM component.\n\nEducational objective:\nMetalloproteinases are zinc-containing enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix. They participate in normal tissue remodeling and in tumor invasion through the basement membrane and connective tissue.",
    "zh": "金属蛋白酶是含锌酶，可降解细胞外基质 (ECM) 和基底膜的成分，基底膜主要由层粘连蛋白和 IV 型和 VII 型胶原组成。这些酶参与许多生理过程，例如组织重塑和胚胎发生。它们还有助于基底膜穿透，这区别于原位癌的浸润性肿瘤，包括以下步骤：\n\n1. 肿瘤细胞从周围细胞脱离，此过程通常由粘附分子的表达减少（而不是增加）决定，包括 E-钙粘蛋白 (选项 D)。\n2. 肿瘤细胞粘附到基底膜；这通过层粘连蛋白和其他粘附分子的表达增加来促进。\n3. 肿瘤细胞通过增强分泌蛋白水解酶（例如，金属蛋白酶、组织蛋白酶 D 蛋白酶）来侵入基底膜。\n\n(选项 A) 酸性水解酶在酸性 pH 值下发挥作用，主要为降解性溶酶体酶。\n(选项 B) 在人类中，碱性磷酸酶集中在肝细胞中；水平升高提示胆道梗阻过程。\n(选项 C) 羧肽酶在羧基末端切割肽键；一些参与胰岛素和神经肽的合成。\n(选项 E) 透明质酸是 ECM 成分。\n\n教育目标：\n金属蛋白酶是含锌酶，可降解细胞外基质。它们参与正常的组织重塑和肿瘤通过基底膜和结缔组织的侵袭。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor invasion, specifically the role of enzymes in degrading the basement membrane. It assesses knowledge of the enzymes responsible for extracellular matrix breakdown and their significance in cancer metastasis.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the key process described (basement membrane invasion) and recall the enzymes that facilitate this process. Understanding the function of metalloproteinases in degrading ECM components is crucial for selecting the correct answer and differentiating it from other enzymes or molecules listed.",
    "zh": "本题考察对肿瘤侵袭相关分子机制的理解，特别是酶在降解基底膜中的作用。它评估了对负责细胞外基质分解的酶及其在癌症转移中的意义的知识。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须确定所描述的关键过程（基底膜侵袭），并回忆促进该过程的酶。了解金属蛋白酶在降解 ECM 成分中的功能对于选择正确答案并将其与其他列出的酶或分子区分开来至关重要。"
