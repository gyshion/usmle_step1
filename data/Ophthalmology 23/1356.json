  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has yellow deposits (ie, drusen) clustered around the macula, which are strongly suspicious for AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD). Lesions that impact the macula can lead to loss of a portion of the central visual field, which is called a CENTRAL SCOTOMA. A scotoma is any visual defect surrounded by a relatively unimpaired field of vision. They most often occur due to pathology involving parts of the retina or optic nerve.\n\nThe macula is located near the center of the retina. It is characterized histologically by the presence of densely packed cones, few overlying cells, and no blood vessels. Each macular cone synapses to a single bipolar cell, which synapses to a single ganglion cell (in contrast to the peripheral retina, where multiple cones converge onto a single ganglion cell). Because of this arrangement, visual acuity in the macula, and particularly the fovea, is greater than in any other area of the retina. Loss of vision in this area is particularly debilitating, and AMD is the most common cause of blindness in patients >age 50 in the United States.\n\n(Choice A) An arcuate scotoma is an arc-shaped visual field defect extending from the blind spot (the area of the optic nerve head that does not process visual information) that follows the bending course of the retinal nerve fibers. It most classically occurs due to glaucoma; funduscopic examination often shows an increased cup/disc ratio.\n\n(Choice B) Binasal hemianopia is a loss of vision in the nasal fields of both eyes. This information does not cross at the optic chiasm but travels at its lateral edge. For a lesion to produce binasal hemianopia, it would have to impact the lateral optic chiasm on both sides.\n\n(Choice C) Bitemporal hemianopia is a loss of vision in the temporal fields of both eyes. Fibers from the nasal retina cross the midline at the optic chiasm, so lesions that compress the center of the optic chiasm (eg, pituitary adenoma) can cause bitemporal hemianopia.\n\n(Choice E) Homonymous hemianopia is a loss of vision in the same side of the visual field in both eyes. It occurs with lesions posterior to the optic chiasm, which would not lead to changes in the funduscopic examination.\n\nEducational objective: A scotoma is a discrete visual field defect. Central scotomas are often caused by age-related macular degeneration that leads to the deposition of drusen clustered around the macula.",
    "zh": "该患者的黄白色沉积物（即玻璃疣）聚集在黄斑周围，高度疑似年龄相关性黄斑变性（AMD）。影响黄斑的病变可导致部分中心视野的丧失，这被称为中心暗点。暗点是指被相对未受损视野包围的任何视觉缺陷。它们最常发生于涉及视网膜或视神经部分的病变。\n\n黄斑位于视网膜的中心附近。其组织学特征是存在密集排列的视锥细胞、少量覆盖细胞和无血管。每个黄斑视锥细胞与单个双极细胞突触，双极细胞再与单个神经节细胞突触（与周围视网膜相比，多个视锥细胞会聚到一个神经节细胞上）。由于这种排列，黄斑，特别是中央凹的视力敏锐度高于视网膜的任何其他区域。该区域的视力丧失特别令人衰弱，并且 AMD 是美国 50 岁以上患者失明的最常见原因。\n\n（选项 A）弓形暗点是从盲点（不处理视觉信息的视神经盘区域）延伸出来的弧形视野缺损，它遵循视网膜神经纤维的弯曲走向。它最典型地发生于青光眼；眼底镜检查通常显示杯/盘比增加。\n\n（选项 B）双鼻侧偏盲是双眼鼻侧视野的视力丧失。该信息不会在视交叉处交叉，而是在其外侧边缘传播。为了产生双鼻侧偏盲，病变必须影响两侧的视交叉外侧。\n\n（选项 C）双颞侧偏盲是双眼颞侧视野的视力丧失。来自鼻侧视网膜的纤维在视交叉处越过中线，因此压迫视交叉中心（例如，垂体腺瘤）的病变可导致双颞侧偏盲。\n\n（选项 E）同侧偏盲是双眼视野同一侧的视力丧失。它发生在视交叉后方的病变中，这不会导致眼底镜检查的变化。\n\n教育目标：暗点是一种离散的视野缺损。中心暗点通常由年龄相关性黄斑变性引起，导致玻璃疣沉积在黄斑周围。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of visual field defects associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), specifically the characteristic central scotoma resulting from macular pathology.\n\nTo solve this question, one must correlate funduscopic findings suggestive of AMD (drusen) with the corresponding visual field deficit. Understanding the anatomy of the visual pathway and the specific locations of lesions that cause different types of visual field defects is crucial for differentiating between the options.",
