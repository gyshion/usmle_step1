    "en": "A 65-year-old man is evaluated for hypotension and increasing shortness of breath shortly after placement of a right-sided subclavian central venous catheter. The patient was recently diagnosed with colon cancer without metastasis and is scheduled for surgical resection. Blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 24/min. Examination shows jugular venous distension. Breath sounds are decreased on the right and the trachea is deviated to the left. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's hypotension?",

    "en": "This patient with shortness of breath, hypotension, unilaterally decreased breath sounds, and tracheal deviation shortly after subclavian catheter placement likely has a TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX. Because of the close proximity of the subclavian vein to the apex of the lung, there is risk of lung puncture during the procedure.\n\nLung puncture allows air to pass into the pleural space. If the puncture is small, the patient may remain asymptomatic. With a large puncture, air rushes into the pleural space, leading to pressure equalization and loss of intrapleural negative pressure, which causes shortness of breath due to inability to expand the affected lung. Intrapleural and lung pressures usually remain nearly equivalent (ie, simple pneumothorax), and symptoms are limited to chest pain and respiratory difficulty.\n\nSometimes lung puncture results in formation of a one-way tissue valve that opens during inspiration to allow air into the pleural space and closes during expiration to trap that air, causing intrapleural pressure to progressively increase with each breath (ie, tension pathophysiology). The increasing pressure leads to contralateral mediastinal shifting (eg, tracheal deviation) and vena cava collapse, resulting in decreased venous return to the heart. Cardiac output is reduced, leading to hypotension and tachycardia (ie, obstructive shock). Treatment requires emergency decompression of the pleural space with needle insertion or chest-tube placement to prevent cardiac arrest.\n\n(Choices A and B) Decreased intravascular volume is the cause of hypovolemic shock (eg, due to massive hemorrhage), and decreased systemic vascular resistance is the primary disturbance in distributive shock (eg, due to sepsis). The jugular veins are flat with these conditions, and unilaterally decreased breath sounds and tracheal deviation are not expected.\n\n(Choice D) An impaired baroreceptor reflex can cause or worsen hypotension due to failure of reflex-mediated vasoconstriction and increased heart rate. This patient's tachycardia suggests that the baroreceptor reflex is intact.\n\n(Choice E) Increased intrapericardial pressure occurs in cardiac tamponade. The increased pressure impairs diastolic filling of the right ventricle, leading to obstructive shock. Although jugular venous distension is expected, cardiac tamponade does not explain this patient's unilaterally decreased breath sounds and tracheal deviation.\n\nEducational objective:\nTension pneumothorax involves progressively increasing intrapleural pressure that leads to contralateral mediastinal shifting (eg, tracheal deviation) and vena cava collapse. Hypotension, tachycardia, and obstructive shock develop due to decreased venous return to the heart. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者在放置锁骨下导管后不久出现呼吸困难、低血压、单侧呼吸音减弱和气管移位，可能患有张力性气胸。由于锁骨下静脉与肺尖非常接近，因此在此过程中存在肺部穿刺的风险。\n\n肺部穿刺允许空气进入胸膜腔。如果穿刺孔较小，患者可能保持无症状。如果穿刺孔较大，空气会冲入胸膜腔，导致压力均衡和胸膜内负压丧失，这会导致呼吸困难，因为无法扩张受影响的肺。胸膜内压力和肺内压力通常保持大致相等（即，单纯性气胸），症状仅限于胸痛和呼吸困难。\n\n有时，肺部穿刺会导致形成单向组织瓣膜，该瓣膜在吸气期间打开，允许空气进入胸膜腔，并在呼气期间关闭以 trapping 气，导致胸膜内压力随着每次呼吸逐渐增加（即，张力性病理生理学）。不断增加的压力导致对侧纵隔移位（例如，气管移位）和腔静脉塌陷，导致静脉回流减少到心脏。心输出量减少，导致低血压和心动过速（即，阻塞性休克）。治疗需要通过针头插入或胸管放置紧急减压胸膜腔，以防止心脏骤停。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）血管内容量减少是血容量性休克（例如，由于大出血）的原因，而全身血管阻力降低是分布性休克（例如，由于脓毒症）的主要紊乱。在这些情况下，颈静脉是扁平的，并且不期望出现单侧呼吸音减弱和气管移位。\n\n（选项 D）受损的压力感受器反射可能由于反射介导的血管收缩和心率增加的失败而导致或加重低血压。该患者的心动过速表明压力感受器反射完好。\n\n（选项 E）心包内压力增高发生于心脏压塞。压力增加会损害右心室的舒张充盈，导致阻塞性休克。尽管预计会出现颈静脉扩张，但心脏压塞无法解释该患者的单侧呼吸音减弱和气管移位。\n\n教育目标：\n张力性气胸涉及进行性增加的胸膜内压力，导致对侧纵隔移位（例如，气管移位）和腔静脉塌陷。由于静脉回流减少到心脏，发生低血压、心动过速和阻塞性休克。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"
