    "en": "A 27-year-old woman comes to the office due to severe, unilateral, throbbing headaches that occur several times a month. The headaches are associated with photophobia, nausea, and occasional vomiting. Over-the-counter analgesics do not provide significant symptom relief. Her mother has a history of similar headaches. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities. A medication is prescribed to treat her condition and the patient is instructed to take it immediately at the onset of a headache. This medication most likely decreases the severity and duration of this patient's headache through which of the following mechanisms?",

    "en": "Migraines are recurrent, debilitating, unilateral headaches with a pulsating or throbbing quality lasting between 4-72 hours, often with photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea. They can be associated with an aura and are more common in younger women.\n\nAlthough the pathogenesis of migraines is multifactorial and not fully understood, it is associated with cortical spreading depression (ie, self-propagating neurotransmission across the cortex). Subsequent stimulation of TRIGEMINAL AFFERENTS in the meninges causes the release of VASOACTIVE NEUROPEPTIDES, including substance P and CALCITONIN GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE (CGRP), leading to neurogenic inflammation, vasodilation, and plasma protein extravasation. These substances may also contribute to the increased sensitivity of nociceptive pathways to stimuli (ie, neuronal sensitization).\n\nTriptans (eg, sumatriptan) are serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D agonists that directly counter migraine headaches by binding to TRIGEMINAL SEROTONIN RECEPTORS and INHIBITING CGRP release from the trigeminal neurons. In addition, triptans bind serotonin receptors on the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels, resulting in intracranial vasoconstriction. Triptans are commonly prescribed as ABORTIVE THERAPY for acute migraines, particularly in patients who are not responsive to analgesics. Significant adverse effects include dizziness, chest tightness, and HYPERTENSION.\n\n(Choice A) Antipsychotic medications (eg, haloperidol, risperidone) block the dopamine receptors in the mesolimbic tract and are used in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. They are not indicated in the treatment of migraine.\n\n(Choice B) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, sertraline, citalopram) block serotonin reuptake in cortico-amygdala pathways. These drugs are used to treat depression and anxiety, not to abort migraines.\n\n(Choice C) Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (eg, rivastigmine, galantamine) increase the availability of acetylcholine at cortical synapses and are indicated in the treatment of dementia (eg, Alzheimer disease).\n\n(Choice D) Opioid medications (eg, morphine, oxycodone) stimulate mu receptors in the periaqueductal gray area, resulting in modulation of pain. Opioids are not indicated in the treatment of migraines because they increase the risk of chronic migraine, carry a risk of dependence, and are less effective than triptans.",
    "zh": "偏头痛是复发性、使人衰弱的单侧头痛，具有搏动性或跳痛的性质，持续时间为4-72小时，常伴有畏光、畏声和恶心。它们可能与先兆有关，并且在年轻女性中更常见。\n\n尽管偏头痛的发病机制是多因素的，并且尚未完全了解，但它与皮质扩散性抑制（即，跨皮质的自传播神经传递）有关。随后，刺激脑膜中的三叉神经传入神经会导致血管活性神经肽的释放，包括P物质和降钙素基因相关肽 (CGRP)，从而导致神经源性炎症、血管舒张和血浆蛋白外渗。这些物质也可能导致伤害性通路对刺激的敏感性增加（即，神经元敏化）。\n\n曲坦类药物（例如，舒马曲坦）是血清素5-羟色胺1B/1D受体激动剂，通过与三叉神经血清素受体结合并抑制三叉神经元释放CGRP来直接对抗偏头痛。此外，曲坦类药物与血管平滑肌细胞上的血清素受体结合，导致颅内血管收缩。曲坦类药物通常被开作急性偏头痛的终止治疗，尤其是在对止痛药无反应的患者中。显著的不良反应包括头晕、胸闷和高血压。\n\n（选项 A）抗精神病药物（例如，氟哌啶醇、利培酮）阻断中脑边缘束中的多巴胺受体，用于治疗精神分裂症或双相情感障碍。它们不适用于治疗偏头痛。\n\n（选项 B）选择性血清素再摄取抑制剂（例如，舍曲林、西酞普兰）阻断皮质-杏仁体通路中的血清素再摄取。这些药物用于治疗抑郁症和焦虑症，而不是终止偏头痛。\n\n（选项 C）胆碱酯酶抑制剂（例如，利伐斯的明、加兰他敏）增加皮质突触处乙酰胆碱的可用性，并用于治疗痴呆症（例如，阿尔茨海默病）。\n\n（选项 D）阿片类药物（例如，吗啡、羟考酮）刺激导水管周围灰质中的μ受体，从而调节疼痛。阿片类药物不适用于治疗偏头痛，因为它们会增加慢性偏头痛的风险，具有依赖性风险，并且不如曲坦类药物有效。"
