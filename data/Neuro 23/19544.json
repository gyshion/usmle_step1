    "en": "A 28-year-old woman comes to the office due to right hand tremors for the past several weeks. The patient has difficulty performing daily activities and feels embarrassed in social gatherings. She has a history of the remitting-relapsing form of multiple sclerosis. There is no family history of tremors. On physical examination, no abnormal hand movement is observed at rest. When the patient is instructed to touch an object on the table, a coarse tremor is observed that gradually increases as the hand moves closer to its target.",

    "en": "This patient has developed a large-amplitude (ie, coarse) tremor that worsens as the hand approaches the target, suggesting a cerebellar tremor. Cerebellar tremor can result from multiple pathologies that affect the cerebellum, most commonly multiple sclerosis, as in this patient. Other common causes include stroke, fragile X syndrome, and cerebellar degeneration.\n\nTremors due to cerebellar lesions are classically low frequency (ie, \"slow,\" <5 Hz) and high amplitude (ie, coarse) because they involve the proximal, as well as the distal, muscles. The tremor classically increases in amplitude as an action approaches a target (ie, INTENTION TREMOR). It is often accompanied by other cerebellar signs, including ataxia, dysmetria, and/or impaired rapidly alternating movements.\n\n(Choice A) Parkinson disease occurs due to loss of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia (substantia nigra). In contrast to this patient, patients with Parkinson disease classically have a resting tremor that improves with intentional movement. In addition, tremor would be accompanied by rigidity (increased resistance to passive movements), bradykinesia (slowing of voluntary movements), and gait disturbances.\n\n(Choice C) The motor cortex controls voluntary muscle activity. Damage to this area causes a combination of spastic paralysis, clasp-knife rigidity, hyperreflexia, and pathologic reflexes but does not typically cause a rhythmic tremor.\n\n(Choice D) The premotor frontal cortex is responsible for the selection of movements in response to internal and external cues. A lesion affecting this part of the brain can result in abnormal posturing or repetitive movements but not an action tremor.\n\n(Choice E) Lesions affecting the thalamus typically result in contralateral hemiplegia or contralateral hemisensory loss rather than tremor.\n\nEducational objective:\nCerebellar tremors are classically low frequency (<5 Hz) and high amplitude and increase as an action approaches a target. They are often accompanied by other cerebellar signs, including ataxia, dysmetria, and impaired rapidly alternating movements.",
    "zh": "该患者出现了大振幅（即粗大）震颤，且随着手部接近目标而加重，提示为小脑性震颤。小脑性震颤可能由多种影响小脑的病理状况引起，最常见的是多发性硬化，如该患者。其他常见原因包括中风、脆性X染色体综合征和小脑变性。\n\n由于小脑病变引起的震颤通常为低频（即“慢”，<5 Hz）和高振幅（即粗大），因为它们涉及近端和远端肌肉。震颤的振幅通常随着动作接近目标而增加（即意向性震颤）。它通常伴有其他小脑体征，包括共济失调、辨距不良和/或快速交替运动受损。\n\n(选项 A) 帕金森病是由于基底节（黑质）多巴胺能神经元的丧失所致。与该患者相反，帕金森病患者通常表现为静止性震颤，而该震颤随着有目的的运动而改善。此外，震颤会伴有僵硬（被动运动阻力增加）、运动迟缓（自主运动减慢）和步态障碍。\n\n(选项 C) 运动皮层控制自主肌肉活动。该区域的损伤会导致痉挛性麻痹、折刀样强直、反射亢进和病理反射，但通常不会引起节律性震颤。\n\n(选项 D) 前运动额叶皮层负责响应内部和外部提示选择运动。影响大脑这一部分的病变可导致异常姿势或重复运动，但不会引起动作性震颤。\n\n(选项 E) 影响丘脑的病变通常会导致对侧偏瘫或对侧感觉缺失，而不是震颤。\n\n教育目的：\n小脑性震颤通常为低频（<5 Hz）和高振幅，且随着动作接近目标而增加。它们通常伴有其他小脑体征，包括共济失调、辨距不良和快速交替运动受损。"
