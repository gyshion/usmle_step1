    "en": "A 24-year-old man is being evaluated for a nerve block procedure. The patient has had intermittent burning and stabbing pain in the left groin since undergoing mesh repair of an inguinal hernia a year ago. The pain is often brought on by physical activity and coughing. He has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, there is no weakness of anterior abdominal or lower extremity muscles. Lightly touching the upper medial thigh {{exhibit_1}} or upper part of the scrotum elicits burning pain. Cremasteric reflex is normal. The clinical diagnosis is entrapment of a nerve traversing the superficial inguinal ring {{exhibit_2}} with the spermatic cord {{exhibit_3}}. Blockade of which of the following nerves with a local anesthetic injection is most likely to relieve this patient's symptoms?",
    "zh": "一名24岁男性正在接受神经阻滞手术的评估。该患者自一年前接受腹股沟疝气补片修复术后，左侧腹股沟出现间歇性烧灼和刺痛。这种疼痛常因体力活动和咳嗽而加重。他没有其他疾病，也没有服用任何药物。生命体征在正常范围内。体格检查显示，腹部前部或下肢肌肉无力。轻触大腿内上侧 {{exhibit_1}} 或阴囊上部会引起烧灼痛。提睾反射正常。临床诊断为神经穿过浅腹股沟环 {{exhibit_2}} 并与精索 {{exhibit_3}} 发生卡压。通过局部麻醉剂注射阻滞以下哪条神经最有可能缓解该患者的症状？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Postheriorrhaphy neuropathy refers to groin pain following hernia repair due to injury involving the cutaneous nerves of the lower abdomen/groin. Neuropathy of the ilioinguinal nerve presents with pain and allodynia in the anterior scrotum (labia majora in women), base of the penis (mons pubis), and medial thigh. The ilioinguinal nerve enters the inguinal canal anterior to the internal ring and follows the spermatic cord (round ligament in women) to the superficial ring; it gives off sensory branches to the anterior scrotum, base of the penis, and medial thigh. The femoral nerve courses deep to the inguinal ligament; injury during inguinal hernia repair is possible but less common than ilioinguinal injury. Femoral nerve injury causes sensory symptoms in the anterior thigh and motor weakness of the quadriceps. The genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve passes through the inguinal canal; injury may cause pain at the anterior scrotum. However, the cremasteric reflex is mediated primarily by the genitofemoral nerve and is typically diminished when the nerve is injured. The anterior branch of the iliohypogastric nerve is vulnerable to injury where it pierces the anterior abdominal musculature superior to the superficial inguinal ring. However, it does not follow the spermatic cord, and sensory symptoms involve the skin overlying the suprapubic/hypogastric region, not the groin. The obturator nerve innervates the medial compartment of the thigh. Injury presents with weakness of hip adduction and decreased sensation at the medial thigh; it may be injured in pelvic (eg, bladder) surgery but is not at risk in hernia repair.",
    "zh": "疝修补术后神经病变是指疝修补术后因损伤下腹部/腹股沟的皮神经而引起的腹股沟疼痛。髂腹股沟神经病变的表现为前阴囊（女性大阴唇）、阴茎根部（阴阜）和大腿内侧疼痛和异常性疼痛。髂腹股沟神经从腹股沟内环前方进入腹股沟管，并沿精索（女性的子宫圆韧带）到达浅环；它向阴囊前部、阴茎根部和大腿内侧发出感觉分支。股神经走行于腹股沟韧带深处；腹股沟疝修补术中可能发生损伤，但不如髂腹股沟神经损伤常见。股神经损伤导致大腿前侧感觉症状和股四头肌运动无力。生殖股神经的生殖支穿过腹股沟管；损伤可能导致阴囊前部疼痛。然而，提睾反射主要由生殖股神经介导，当神经受损时通常会减弱。髂腹下神经的前支在穿过浅腹股沟环上方的腹前肌时容易受到损伤。然而，它不沿精索走行，感觉症状涉及覆盖耻骨上/腹下区域的皮肤，而不是腹股沟。闭孔神经支配大腿内侧间室。损伤表现为髋内收无力和大腿内侧感觉减退；它可能在盆腔（如膀胱）手术中受损，但在疝修补术中没有风险。"

    "en": "The patient presents with burning and stabbing pain in the groin after inguinal hernia repair, exacerbated by activity and coughing. Physical examination reveals pain on touching the medial thigh or scrotum. The clinical diagnosis is nerve entrapment involving the superficial inguinal ring and spermatic cord.
