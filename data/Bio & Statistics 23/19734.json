    "en": "A physician is conducting a double-blind randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of a new cream in reducing the risk of relapse in chronic recurrent atopic dermatitis. A total of 30 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who were experiencing a flare are randomly divided into 2 groups: 15 patients will receive the new cream, and 15 patients will receive emollient alone. The rate of relapse after 2 weeks of treatment is 25% in the group who received the new cream and 50% in the group who received emollient alone. However, the difference is found to be not statistically significant (p = 0.14). The physician concludes that use of the new cream does not reduce the risk of relapse in chronic recurrent atopic dermatitis. Which of the following is most likely to explain the results of the study?",

    "en": "Statistical power represents a study's strength to detect a difference (ie, effect size) between treatment groups when one truly exists. It depends on sample size (among other factors): studies with greater sample sizes have greater power than studies with smaller sample sizes. An excessively large sample size may determine that a clinically irrelevant difference between groups is statistically significant (ie, p < 0.05), while an inappropriately small sample may fail to determine that a clinically relevant difference between groups is statistically significant (ie, p > 0.05).\n\nIn this case, the rate of relapse in the group receiving the new cream is 25% and the rate in the group receiving the emollient alone is 50%. This represents a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 50% (ie, [50% - 25%] / 50%); therefore, the new cream reduced the risk of relapse by 50% (ie, effect size) compared to emollient alone. A 50% risk reduction may be considered clinically relevant; however, it was not statistically significant (p = 0.14 > 0.05) in the study.\n\nThe most likely explanation is that the sample size (ie, 15 per group) provided insufficient power to detect the observed difference between groups (ie, effect size, RRR = 50%). A larger sample size would increase the power of the study (ie, its ability to detect the difference), and the p-value would reach statistical significance (ie, p < 0.05).\n\n(Choice A) Ascertainment bias occurs when the results of a study are distorted by awareness of treatment assignment, as in an unblind study. This study is double-blinded, thereby minimizing potential ascertainment bias.\n\n(Choice B) Confounding distorts the relationship between exposures (eg, treatments) and the outcome (eg, disease) of interest, and can wholly or partially account for observed effects. This study is a randomized trial, thereby minimizing potential confounding bias by generating groups that are comparable with respect to known and unknown confounding variables.\n\n(Choice C) Ecological fallacy occurs when conclusions are made about individuals based on studies where the unit of analysis is a group (ie, the conclusions of a study assessing population groups do not necessarily apply to individuals). In this study, the unit of analysis is the individual, not the group.\n\n(Choice E) Recall bias results from the inaccurate recollection of past exposure status. It is a potential problem for case-control studies, particularly when questionnaires are used to inquire about distant past exposure. However, this study is an experiment in which patients are exposed to treatments and then assessed for the outcome.\n\nEducational objective:\nAn inappropriately small sample will fail to identify important clinically significant differences as statistically significant because of a lack of sufficient statistical power.",
    "zh": "统计学效力代表一项研究在真正存在差异（即，效应大小）时检测治疗组之间差异的强度。它取决于样本量（以及其他因素）：样本量较大的研究比样本量较小的研究具有更大的效力。过大的样本量可能确定组间临床上无关紧要的差异具有统计学意义（即，p < 0.05），而不适当的小样本可能无法确定组间临床相关的差异具有统计学意义（即，p > 0.05）。\n\n在本例中，接受新药膏组的复发率为25%，而单独接受润肤剂组的复发率为50%。这代表相对危险度降低 (RRR) 50%（即，[50% - 25%] / 50%）；因此，与单独使用润肤剂相比，新药膏使复发风险降低了50%（即，效应大小）。50%的风险降低可能被认为是临床相关的；然而，在研究中它不具有统计学意义（p = 0.14 > 0.05）。\n\n最有可能的解释是样本量（即，每组15例）提供的效力不足以检测组间观察到的差异（即，效应大小，RRR = 50%）。更大的样本量将增加研究的效力（即，其检测差异的能力），并且p值将达到统计学意义（即，p < 0.05）。\n\n（选项A）检出偏倚发生在由于对治疗分配的了解而扭曲研究结果时，例如在未设盲研究中。本研究是双盲的，从而最大限度地减少了潜在的检出偏倚。\n\n（选项B）混杂会扭曲暴露（例如，治疗）与感兴趣的结果（例如，疾病）之间的关系，并且可以完全或部分地解释观察到的效应。本研究是一项随机试验，从而通过生成在已知和未知混杂变量方面具有可比性的组来最大限度地减少潜在的混杂偏倚。\n\n（选项C）当根据分析单位为组的研究对个体做出结论时，就会发生生态谬误（即，评估人群组的研究的结论不一定适用于个体）。在本研究中，分析单位是个人，而不是组。\n\n（选项E）回忆偏倚是由于对过去暴露状态的不准确回忆造成的。对于病例对照研究来说，这是一个潜在的问题，尤其是在使用问卷调查询问遥远的过去暴露时。然而，这项研究是一项实验，其中患者暴露于治疗，然后评估结果。\n\n教育目标：\n由于缺乏足够的统计学效力，不适当的小样本将无法将重要的临床显着差异识别为具有统计学意义。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of statistical power in clinical trials and how sample size affects the ability to detect a statistically significant difference between treatment groups. It also assesses knowledge of various biases that can affect study results.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that a non-significant p-value despite a clinically relevant difference often indicates insufficient statistical power due to a small sample size.
