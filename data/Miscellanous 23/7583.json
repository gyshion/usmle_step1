    "en": "An 8-year-old boy is brought to the clinic due to behavioral problems. The patient has a history of intellectual disability and is in special education classes. For the last few months, his teachers have reported that he has had increasing difficulty following directions and maintaining his attention. The parents have recently noticed that the child seems to have muscle weakness in his hands. The patient's mother developed a similar weakness several years ago. Vital signs are normal. Eye examination shows bilateral lenticular opacities. Firm percussion over the thenar eminence results in prolonged thumb abduction with slow muscle relaxation.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This child with intellectual disability has weakness and slow muscle relaxation, findings suggestive of myotonic dystrophy (DM). DM is an autosomal dominant muscular dystrophy due to an EXPANSION OF CTG TRINUCLEOTIDE REPEATS within the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene. Increased repeat length occurs with successive generations and is associated with earlier onset of more severe disease (ie, anticipation); this patient's parent with mild muscle weakness is most likely due to adult-onset DM.\n\nIn the childhood form of DM, INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY and BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS are often the predominant features. Other key findings characteristic of classic DM may be present or develop over time:\n\n* Weakness, atrophy, and pain of facial and distal limb musculature\n* MYOTONIA, or delay in muscle relaxation, such as sustained hand contraction after attempted grip release or sustained thumb abduction after THENAR EMINENCE percussion (as seen here)\n* Cardiac abnormalities (eg, conduction disturbances, cardiomyopathy)\n* Gastrointestinal tract disturbances (eg, dysphagia, constipation)\n* Nonmuscular involvement such as frontal hair loss, CATARACTS (lens opacities), insulin resistance, and daytime somnolence\n\n(Choice B) Mitochondrial myopathies are often maternally inherited and characterized by muscle weakness (eg, exercise intolerance) and lactic acidosis in more severe cases. Cataracts may be present, but myotonia does not occur.\n\n(Choice C) Partial chromosome deletion can be seen with inherited causes of intellectual disability (eg, cri-du-chat syndrome) but would not explain this patient's myotonia or cataracts.\n\n(Choice D) Uniparental disomy is the mode of inheritance for Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, which are associated with cognitive dysfunction and behavioral disturbances but not myotonia.\n\n(Choice E) X-linked frameshift mutation in dystrophin gene can cause both Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. These conditions present with muscle weakness, but the proximal lower extremities are typically affected first and cataracts and myotonia are not seen.\n\nEducational objective:\nMyotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion; successive generations typically have an increased number of repeats, resulting in earlier and more severe disease (ie, anticipation). In children, cognitive/behavioral issues may be the initial findings before development of muscle weakness and myotonia.",
    "zh": "这个患有智力障碍的孩子有无力和肌肉松弛缓慢的症状，提示肌强直性营养不良（DM）。DM是一种常染色体显性遗传性肌营养不良，由肌强直蛋白激酶（DMPK）基因内CTG三核苷酸重复序列扩增引起。重复序列长度在连续几代人中增加，并与更早发病和更严重的疾病相关（即，预期）；该患者的父母有轻度肌无力，很可能是由于成人发病的DM。\n\n在儿童型DM中，智力障碍和行为问题通常是主要特征。其他经典DM的特征性关键发现可能存在或随着时间的推移而发展：\n\n* 面部和肢体远端肌肉的无力、萎缩和疼痛\n* 肌强直，或肌肉松弛延迟，例如在尝试松开握力后持续的手部收缩，或在鱼际肌叩诊后拇指持续外展（如此处所示）\n* 心脏异常（例如，传导障碍，心肌病）\n* 胃肠道紊乱（例如，吞咽困难，便秘）\n* 非肌肉受累，如额部脱发、白内障（晶状体混浊）、胰岛素抵抗和白天嗜睡\n\n（选项B）线粒体肌病通常是母系遗传，其特征是肌无力（例如，运动耐受不良）和更严重病例中的乳酸酸中毒。可能存在白内障，但不会发生肌强直。\n\n（选项C）部分染色体缺失可见于智力障碍的遗传病因（例如，猫叫综合征），但不能解释该患者的肌强直或白内障。\n\n（选项D）单亲二倍体是Prader-Willi综合征和Angelman综合征的遗传模式，这些综合征与认知功能障碍和行为障碍有关，但与肌强直无关。\n\n（选项E）肌营养不良蛋白基因的X连锁移码突变可导致Duchenne和Becker型肌营养不良。这些疾病表现为肌无力，但近端下肢通常首先受到影响，并且看不到白内障和肌强直。\n\n教育目标：\n肌强直性营养不良是一种常染色体显性遗传病，由三核苷酸重复序列扩增引起；连续几代人通常具有增加的重复序列数量，导致更早和更严重的疾病（即，预期）。在儿童中，认知/行为问题可能是最初的发现，然后才会出现肌无力和肌强直。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of Myotonic Dystrophy, specifically its genetic basis (CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion), clinical presentation in children (intellectual disability, behavioral problems, weakness, myotonia), and characteristic physical findings (cataracts). It also requires differentiating it from other genetic and neuromuscular disorders.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the constellation of symptoms including intellectual disability, behavioral issues, muscle weakness, and delayed muscle relaxation (myotonia) in the context of a family history suggestive of anticipation. Recognizing these features points towards Myotonic Dystrophy, prompting consideration of its underlying genetic cause, which is an expanded trinucleotide repeat.",
