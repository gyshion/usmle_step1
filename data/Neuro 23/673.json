  "explanation": {
    "en": "Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive disorder. Cerebellar atrophy leads to the ataxia that occurs in the first years of life. (Oculocutaneous telangiectasias) is another manifestation, but is usually delayed. Telangiectasias are abnormal dilatations of capillary vessels. Patients with ataxia-telangiectasia also have severe immunodeficiency with repeated sinopulmonary infections. The risk of cancer in these patients is increased significantly because of inefficient DNA repair.\nDNA damage and repair is an ongoing process. A lot of naturally-occurring agents cause DNA damage: sunlight, UV light, ionizing radiation (gamma and X-ray), and free oxygen radicals are produced during the cell cycle. Some chemicals (hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke, aflatoxins produced by moldy peanuts) are also harmful to DNA. DNA repair occurs continuously by means of direct reversal of damage, base and nucleotide excision repair, and mismatch repair.\nA number of inherited disorders are caused by deficient DNA-repair enzymes:\n1. Ataxia-telangiectasia is characterized by DNA hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation.\n2. In xeroderma pigmentosum, DNA is hypersensitive to UV radiation, causing premature skin aging and increased risk of skin cancer (malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma).\n3. Fanconi anemia is caused by hypersensitivity of DNA to cross-linking agents.\n4. Bloom syndrome is characterized by generalized chromosomal instability. Increased susceptibility to neoplasms is present.\n5. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) occurs due to a defect in DNA mismatch-repair enzymes. It leads to increased susceptibility to colon cancer.\n(Choice A) Neurofibrillary tangles in the neocortex are seen in Alzheimer disease.\n(Choice C) Loss of neurons in the substantia nigra is characteristic of Parkinson disease.\n(Choice D) Atrophy of caudate nucleus is seen in Huntington disease.\n(Choice E) Posterior column involvement is seen with both vitamin B 12 deficiency and syphilis.\n(Choice F) The presence of Lewy bodies is characteristic of Parkinsonism.\nEducational Objective: Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal-recessive disorder resulting from a defect in DNA-repair genes. The DNA of these patients is hypersensitive to ionizing radiation. Manifestations include cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, repeated sinopulmonary infections, and an increased incidence of malignancy.",

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of genetic disorders affecting DNA repair mechanisms and their associated clinical manifestations. Specifically, it assesses the knowledge of Ataxia-Telangiectasia, its genetic basis, and its characteristic neurological and immunological findings.\nTo solve this question, one must identify the underlying genetic defect suggested by the patient's presentation (high rate of radiation-induced genetic mutation) and link it to the specific disorder, Ataxia-Telangiectasia. Then, recall or deduce the primary neurological consequence of this disorder, which is cerebellar atrophy leading to ataxia.",
