    "en": "A 22-year-old woman comes to the office for a routine prenatal visit. She is 16 weeks pregnant with her first child. Two months ago, she had a mononucleosis-like illness with fever, myalgia, and fatigue, and she was diagnosed with cytomegalovirus infection. The patient recovered with symptomatic treatment and is currently asymptomatic. Her other medical problems include episodic migraine headaches and benign choroidal nevus. She takes prenatal vitamins and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. The patient has a family history of hypertension and glaucoma. Physical examination findings and prenatal ultrasound are unremarkable. This patient's unborn infant is at greatest risk for which of the following eye conditions?",

    "en": "Up to 5% of women develop a primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (typically a mononucleosis-like illness with fever and mild hepatitis) during pregnancy. Vertical transmission to the fetus occurs in approximately one-third of cases, with the highest risk of transmission occurring in the first trimester. CMV-related complications observed in infants exposed to the virus in utero include chorioretinitis (most common eye-related problem), sensorineural deafness, seizures, jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and microcephaly.\n(Choice B) Choroidal nevus (eye freckle) is a nonhereditary, usually benign pigmented area underneath the retina and is not associated with in-utero CMV infection.\n(Choice C) Congenital cataract can be seen with in-utero rubella infection.\n(Choice D) Glaucoma can be present at birth and may be primary or secondary (eg, tumor). However, it is not a known complication of CMV infection.\n(Choice E) Inclusion conjunctivitis is seen with Chlamydia trachomatis infection of the newborn.\n(Choice F) Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited degenerative eye disease that leads to severe vision impairment and is not a complication of in-utero CMV infection.\n(Choice G) Retinoblastoma is the most common malignant eye cancer in children and is caused by a chromosomal mutation that is hereditary or sporadic. CMV infection in utero is not associated with causing retinoblastoma.\nEducational objective:\nThe most common eye-related complication of congenital cytomegalovirus infection is chorioretinitis.\nReferences\n• Ocular abnormalities in congenital cytomegalovirus infection.",
    "zh": "高达5%的女性在怀孕期间会发生原发性巨细胞病毒(CMV)感染（通常是类似单核细胞增多症的疾病，伴有发热和轻度肝炎）。垂直传播给胎儿的病例约占三分之一，其中最高风险的传播发生在妊娠早期。在子宫内暴露于该病毒的婴儿中观察到的CMV相关并发症包括脉络膜视网膜炎（最常见的眼部相关问题）、感觉神经性耳聋、癫痫发作、黄疸、肝肿大、脾肿大和小头畸形。\n(选项 B) 脉络膜痣（眼部雀斑）是视网膜下方的非遗传性、通常为良性的色素沉着区域，与子宫内CMV感染无关。\n(选项 C) 先天性白内障可见于宫内风疹感染。\n(选项 D) 青光眼可在出生时出现，可以是原发性的或继发性的（如肿瘤）。然而，这并不是CMV感染的已知并发症。\n(选项 E) 包涵体性结膜炎可见于新生儿沙眼衣原体感染。\n(选项 F) 色素性视网膜炎是一种遗传性退行性眼病，会导致严重的视力损害，并且不是子宫内CMV感染的并发症。\n(选项 G) 视网膜母细胞瘤是儿童中最常见的恶性眼癌，由遗传或散发的染色体突变引起。子宫内CMV感染与引起视网膜母细胞瘤无关。\n教学目标：\n先天性巨细胞病毒感染最常见的眼部相关并发症是脉络膜视网膜炎。\n参考文献\n• 先天性巨细胞病毒感染的眼部异常。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of congenital infections and their potential complications, specifically focusing on the ocular manifestations of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in newborns. It requires knowledge of the risks associated with maternal CMV infection during pregnancy and the specific eye conditions that can arise in the affected infant.\nTo solve this question, identify the key clinical information: a pregnant woman with a recent mononucleosis-like illness diagnosed as CMV infection. Recall the known complications of congenital CMV, particularly those affecting the eyes. Evaluate each option based on its association with CMV or other congenital infections, and select the condition most strongly linked to in-utero CMV exposure.",
