    "en": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to sudden-onset, severe headache. On arrival, the patient is alert and oriented and has no focal neurological deficits. CT scan of the head reveals subarachnoid hemorrhage, and she is admitted to the critical care unit. Over the next several hours, the patient gradually becomes somnolent and less responsive. She opens her eyes to painful stimuli only and does not follow commands. Repeat imaging of the brain shows no new hemorrhage, but there is enlargement of the entire ventricular system compared to the previous CT scan {{exhibit_1}}. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's neurologic deterioration in the hospital?",

    "en": "This patient with a worsening neurologic status has enlargement of the ventricles on CT scan, consistent with hydrocephalus, a common complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Blood in the subarachnoid space can acutely obstruct and impair absorption of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) by the arachnoid granulations. Later, blood-induced inflammation can cause fibrosis of the arachnoid granulations that perpetuates the absorption impairment and leads to chronic hydrocephalus.\n\nImpaired CSF absorption creates a communicating hydrocephalus. Because the blockage to flow is distal to the entire ventricular system, enlargement of all 4 ventricles occurs. The ventricular enlargement stretches adjacent nerve fibers and, in the acute setting, leads to deteriorating mental status (eg, somnolence, unresponsiveness). Treatment involves the placement of an external ventricular drain to relieve pressure in the ventricular system and subarachnoid space.\n\n(Choice A) Blockage of the cerebral aqueduct (aqueduct of Sylvius) is less common with SAH and more typically occurs with intracerebral hemorrhage complicated by intraventricular bleeding. The resulting hydrocephalus is noncommunicating because there is no free passage of CSF from the ventricular space into the subarachnoid space. Enlargement of only the lateral and third ventricles is expected; the fourth ventricle is distal to the obstruction and remains normal in size.\n\n(Choice B) Cerebral vasospasm is a common complication of SAH; however, it is typically delayed, occurring 4-14 days following the initial bleed, and leads to localized stroke with focal neurologic deficits rather than deteriorating mental status. Dilated ventricles are not seen.\n\n(Choice C) Edema that occurs due to disruption of the blood-brain barrier (vasogenic cerebral edema) collects within the brain parenchyma and can result from stroke or trauma. It is not expected following SAH.\n\n(Choice D) Excessive CSF production is a rare cause of communicating hydrocephalus that may result from a choroid plexus papilloma. Enlargement of all 4 ventricles is expected, but this patient's SAH makes impaired absorption of CSF far more likely.\n\nEducational objective:\nCommunicating hydrocephalus is a common complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage that presents with deteriorating mental status. It typically results from blood-induced impairment of absorption of cerebrospinal fluid by the arachnoid granulations. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者神经功能恶化，CT扫描显示脑室扩大，与脑积水一致，而脑积水是蛛网膜下腔出血 (SAH) 的常见并发症。蛛网膜下腔内的血液可急性阻塞并损害脑脊液 (CSF) 被蛛网膜颗粒吸收。随后，血液诱发的炎症可导致蛛网膜颗粒纤维化，从而加剧吸收障碍，并导致慢性脑积水。\n\nCSF吸收受损会产生交通性脑积水。由于血流阻塞位于整个脑室系统的远端，因此所有4个脑室都会扩大。脑室扩大拉伸相邻的神经纤维，在急性情况下，导致精神状态恶化（例如，嗜睡、无反应）。治疗包括放置脑室外引流管以缓解脑室系统和蛛网膜下腔的压力。\n\n(选项A) 脑导水管（西尔维斯导水管）阻塞在SAH中不常见，更常见于伴有脑室内出血的脑内出血。由此产生的脑积水为非交通性脑积水，因为CSF无法从脑室空间自由进入蛛网膜下腔。预计只有侧脑室和第三脑室扩大；第四脑室位于阻塞的远端，其大小保持正常。\n\n(选项B) 脑血管痉挛是SAH的常见并发症；然而，它通常会延迟，在最初出血后的4-14天发生，并导致局部卒中，出现局灶性神经功能缺损，而不是精神状态恶化。未见脑室扩张。\n\n(选项C) 由于血脑屏障破坏（血管源性脑水肿）而发生的水肿积聚在脑实质内，可由卒中或外伤引起。SAH后预计不会发生这种情况。\n\n(选项D) CSF过度产生是交通性脑积水的罕见原因，可能由脉络丛乳头状瘤引起。预计所有4个脑室都会扩大，但该患者的SAH使得CSF吸收受损的可能性更大。\n\n教育目标：\n交通性脑积水是蛛网膜下腔出血的常见并发症，表现为精神状态恶化。它通常是由血液引起的脑脊液被蛛网膜颗粒吸收受损所致。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage, specifically communicating hydrocephalus due to impaired CSF absorption by arachnoid granulations. It assesses the ability to recognize the clinical presentation and imaging findings associated with this condition.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the timeline of the patient's deterioration following the subarachnoid hemorrhage. Acute hydrocephalus is a common early complication, and the enlargement of all ventricles suggests a communicating hydrocephalus due to impaired CSF absorption.",
