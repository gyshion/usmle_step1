    "en": "A 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of dysuria and blood in his urine at the end of urination. He returned to the United States 2 weeks ago after several months touring Africa. While there, he went spelunking, bathed in the beaches and lakes, and ate the local street food. Physical examination is unremarkable. Ultrasonography reveals mild bilateral hydronephrosis and bladder wall thickening.",

    "en": "This patient most likely has schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma haematobium. Humans acquire schistosomiasis via contact with infected freshwater. Infection is not possible in the United States due to absence of the specific freshwater snails that incubate the infectious larvae.\n\nOnce released into the environment, the larvae can penetrate intact human skin and subsequently travel to the liver where they mature into adults over a period of several weeks. After maturation, the adult worms migrate to specific destinations: the mesenteric venules of the intestine (S japonicum and S mansoni) or the urinary bladder venous plexus (S haematobium). The adult worms remain in these blood vessels for life (5-30 years), adhering to the vessel wall with suckers and releasing eggs into circulation. Eggs released by S japonicum and S mansoni have a tendency to penetrate the bowel wall and be excreted in the feces. They also frequently traverse the portal venous system and lodge in the liver. S haematobium eggs tend to pierce the vesical and ureteral walls and be expelled in the urine. On exposure to freshwater, these eggs release larvae that can infect snails and perpetuate the life cycle.\n\nThe clinical manifestations of schistosomiasis result from a T-2-mediated granulomatous response directed against the eggs that is composed of infiltrating T-2 cells, eosinophils, and M2 macrophages. This ultimately leads to the development of marked fibrosis and ulceration and scarring of the bowel or bladder/ureters (depending on the species). Eggs that settle into the presinusoidal radicals of the portal vein can cause periportal \"pipestem\" fibrosis (pathognomonic for hepatic schistosomiasis).\n\n(Choice A) Bats are a major reservoir for the rabies virus.\n\n(Choices B and E) The dog tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus is the most common cause of hydatid cysts in humans. Disease can occur following ingestion of foods contaminated with dog feces. Sheep are an intermediate host in this parasite's life cycle.\n\n(Choice C) Infection with the human tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum occurs due to the ingestion of larvae from raw freshwater fish. Disease classically results in vitamin B12 deficiency and megaloblastic anemia.\n\n(Choice D) Human tapeworm infections caused by Taenia solium occur following consumption of larvae in infected undercooked pork. Cysticercosis is a disease caused by the larval stage of the organism following ingestion of eggs found in the excrement of T solium tapeworm carriers.\n\nEducational objective:\nHumans acquire schistosomiasis via contact with freshwater sources that contain snails infected with Schistosoma larvae. S japonicum and S mansoni cause intestinal and hepatic schistosomiasis, and S haematobium causes urinary schistosomiasis.",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有血吸虫病，由埃及血吸虫（Schistosoma haematobium）引起。人类通过接触受感染的淡水获得血吸虫病。由于美国缺乏孵化感染性幼虫的特定淡水蜗牛，因此在美国不可能发生感染。\n\n一旦释放到环境中，幼虫可以穿透完整的人类皮肤，随后进入肝脏，在那里它们在几周内成熟为成虫。成熟后，成虫会迁移到特定的目的地：肠系膜静脉（日本血吸虫和曼氏血吸虫）或膀胱静脉丛（埃及血吸虫）。成虫终生停留在这些血管中（5-30年），用吸盘附着在血管壁上，并将虫卵释放到循环中。日本血吸虫和曼氏血吸虫释放的虫卵倾向于穿透肠壁并在粪便中排出。它们也经常穿过门静脉系统并滞留在肝脏中。埃及血吸虫虫卵倾向于穿透膀胱壁和输尿管壁，并随尿液排出。当接触淡水时，这些虫卵会释放幼虫，这些幼虫可以感染蜗牛并延续生命周期。\n\n血吸虫病的临床表现是由针对虫卵的T-2介导的肉芽肿反应引起的，该反应由浸润的T-2细胞、嗜酸性粒细胞和M2巨噬细胞组成。这最终导致肠道或膀胱/输尿管（取决于物种）出现明显的纤维化、溃疡和瘢痕形成。沉降到门静脉前窦根部的虫卵可引起门周“管状”纤维化（肝血吸虫病的特征性病理表现）。\n\n（选项A）蝙蝠是狂犬病毒的主要宿主。\n\n（选项B和E）犬绦虫细粒棘球绦虫是人类包虫病囊肿最常见的原因。疾病可能发生在摄入被狗粪污染的食物后。绵羊是该寄生虫生命周期中的中间宿主。\n\n（选项C）人类绦虫阔节裂头绦虫感染是由于摄入来自生淡水鱼的幼虫引起的。该病症典型地导致维生素B12缺乏症和巨幼细胞性贫血。\n\n（选项D）由猪带绦虫引起的​​人类绦虫感染发生在食用受感染的未煮熟的猪肉中的幼虫后。囊虫病是由该生物的幼虫期引起的疾病，发生在摄入在猪带绦虫携带者的排泄物中发现的虫卵后。\n\n教育目标：\n人类通过接触含有感染血吸虫幼虫的蜗牛的淡水源获得血吸虫病。日本血吸虫和曼氏血吸虫引起肠道和肝血吸虫病，而埃及血吸虫引起尿路血吸虫病。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of schistosomiasis, specifically the causative agent, transmission route, and association with freshwater snails. It also requires understanding of the geographic distribution and clinical manifestations of different Schistosoma species.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the patient's travel history to Africa and the symptoms of dysuria and hematuria, which are suggestive of urinary schistosomiasis. Recall that Schistosoma haematobium is transmitted through contact with freshwater containing infected snails.",
