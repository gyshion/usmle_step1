  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient developed signs of ACUTE RADIATION ENTERITIS (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea, inflammation and denudation of intestinal mucosa) 3 weeks after starting radiotherapy for PROSTATE CANCER. Therapeutic IONIZING RADIATION is commonly used to treat or palliate many types of cancer (eg, prostate, breast) and causes cell damage through 2 primary mechanisms:\n\n* DNA double-strand breakage: Breakage of both strands is required; single-strand breaks can be repaired by polymerases.\n* GENERATION OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES: Unstable molecules formed by the ionization of water; oxygen free radicals can cause cellular and DNA damage. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nRadiation-induced DNA damage impairs mitosis and initiates APOPTOSIS of susceptible cells, including INTESTINAL CRYPT STEM CELLS and other highly proliferative cells (eg, cancer cells, hematogenous precursors). Cellular damage also induces an immune response characterized by increased expression of PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES (eg, IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and migration of leukocytes (eg, neutrophils) to the affected tissue, processes that produce additional reactive oxygen species and contribute to the radiation-induced tissue damage.\n\nIn the gastrointestinal tract, these changes result in progressive inflammation, edema, and MUCOSAL DENUDATION that decrease the absorptive area. Abdominal pain and diarrhea typically manifest several weeks after radiotherapy is started. In some cases, the effects of radiation exposure can be delayed until years after radiation exposure and present as complications of intestinal fibrosis (eg, strictures, adhesions, bowel obstruction).\n\n(Choice B) The ubiquitin-proteasome system has an integral role in maintaining normal cell function by degrading damaged proteins and contributing to cell cycle control. Although proteasome activity normally increases in response to oxidative stress, this system is inhibited by ionizing radiation, potentiating the apoptotic effects of radiotherapy.\n\n(Choices C, D, and E) Many chemotherapeutic agents impair essential steps in the DNA and cellular repair processes and can potentiate the effects of ionizing radiation. Although inhibition of DNA polymerase (eg, nucleoside analogues), inhibition of thymidylate synthesis (eg, 5-fluorouracil), and prevention of microtubule assembly (eg, vinblastine) would contribute to the cytotoxic effects of radiation, radiation-induced tissue damage occurs primarily through the generation of free radicals.\n\nEducational objective:\nIONIZING RADIATION causes cellular and DNA damage primarily through generation of reactive oxygen species, which can trigger progressive inflammation and tissue damage. In the gastrointestinal tract, the acute effects of radiation exposure typically occur several weeks after radiotherapy is initiated and manifest as abdominal pain and diarrhea due to mucosal denudation, inflammation, and edema.",
    "zh": "该患者在开始前列腺癌放射治疗3周后出现急性放射性肠炎的征象（如腹痛、腹泻、肠粘膜炎症和脱落）。治疗性电离辐射常用于治疗或缓解多种类型的癌症（如前列腺癌、乳腺癌），并通过两种主要机制引起细胞损伤：\n\n* DNA双链断裂：需要两条链都断裂；单链断裂可以被聚合酶修复。\n* 活性氧的产生：由水电离形成的的不稳定分子；氧自由基可引起细胞和DNA损伤。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n放射线引起的DNA损伤会损害有丝分裂并启动易感细胞的凋亡，包括肠隐窝干细胞和其他高度增殖的细胞（例如癌细胞、造血前体细胞）。细胞损伤也会诱导免疫反应，其特征是促炎细胞因子（如IL-1、IL-6、肿瘤坏死因子-α）的表达增加以及白细胞（如中性粒细胞）向受影响组织的迁移，这些过程会产生额外的活性氧并促进放射线引起的组织损伤。\n\n在胃肠道中，这些变化导致进行性炎症、水肿和黏膜脱落，从而减少吸收面积。腹痛和腹泻通常在放射治疗开始几周后出现。在某些情况下，放射线照射的影响可能会延迟到放射线照射后数年，并表现为肠纤维化并发症（如狭窄、粘连、肠梗阻）。\n\n（选项B）泛素-蛋白酶体系统通过降解受损蛋白质和有助于细胞周期控制在维持正常细胞功能中起着重要作用。虽然蛋白酶体活性通常会因氧化应激而增加，但该系统会被电离辐射抑制，从而增强放疗的凋亡作用。\n\n（选项C、D和E）许多化疗药物会损害DNA和细胞修复过程中的关键步骤，并能增强电离辐射的作用。尽管抑制DNA聚合酶（如核苷类似物）、抑制胸苷酸合成（如5-氟尿嘧啶）和阻止微管组装（如长春花碱）会促进辐射的细胞毒性作用，但放射线引起的组织损伤主要通过产生自由基而发生。\n\n教育目标：\n电离辐射主要通过产生活性氧引起细胞和DNA损伤，从而引发进行性炎症和组织损伤。在胃肠道中，放射线照射的急性影响通常在放射治疗开始几周后发生，并表现为由于黏膜脱落、炎症和水肿引起的腹痛和腹泻。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology of radiation enteritis, specifically the primary cellular mechanisms by which ionizing radiation causes damage to the intestinal mucosa. It requires knowledge of how radiation affects cells and leads to inflammation and tissue injury.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the clinical presentation as consistent with radiation enteritis and recall the main mechanisms of radiation-induced cellular damage. The options provided represent various cellular processes that can be affected by radiation or chemotherapy, and the key is to differentiate the primary mechanism of radiation injury from other potential mechanisms or effects of radiation.",
