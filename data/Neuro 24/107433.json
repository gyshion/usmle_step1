    "en": "This patient's headaches, nausea/vomiting, and papilledema are consistent with increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Headaches are nearly always present in patients with increased ICP. They can be of variable patterns but classically worsen during recumbent positioning (eg, at night, on waking in the morning) or while straining (eg, during bowel movements or heavy lifting), which increases ICP.\n\nAlthough the underlying cause of this patient's elevated ICP has yet to be proved, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is likely, given her young age, obesity, lack of additional comorbidities, and normal CT scan of the head. Alternately, her presentation can be explained by a clot in the cerebral venous system (ie, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis [CVST]), which can also present with signs of increased ICP without obvious head CT findings.\n\nIIH and CVST are thought to share a similar pathophysiology. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) normally flows through the ventricular system until it is reabsorbed by the arachnoid granulations, after which it drains into the cerebral venous sinuses. Congestion of the venous system (ie, cerebral venous hypertension) due to either a clot (in CVST) or a primary increase in intracranial venous pressure (in IIH) leads to decreased CSF resorption, resulting in increased ICP.\n\n(Choices A and D) Aqueeductal stenosis blocks CSF flow from the lateral and third ventricles into the fourth ventricle. It could present with increased ICP, but CT scan would show enlarged lateral and third ventricles. Increased CSF production, which can be caused by choroid plexus papilloma (CPP), would also present with ventriculomegaly (and an intraventricular mass in the case of CPP) on CT scan.\n\n(Choice B) Astrocyte swelling (cytotoxic cerebral edema) can present with increased ICP. However, cerebral edema is usually appreciated on CT scan, revealing flattening of the ventricles, effaced gyri, and a decrease in gray-white differentiation.\n\n(Choice E) Neurodegenerative diseases (eg, Alzheimer) can lead to decreased brain volume, which may allow the CSF spaces to expand (hydrocephalus ex vacuo). This tends to occur slowly, so the ICP has time to equilibrate and remain in the normal range.\n\nEducational objective:\nElevated intracranial pressure in the absence of an intracranial mass lesion or ventriculomegaly is suggestive of decreased resorption of cerebrospinal fluid. This often occurs when the cerebral venous sinus system drainage is impaired due to either idiopathic intracranial hypertension or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.",
    "zh": "该患者的头痛、恶心/呕吐和视乳头水肿与颅内压(ICP)升高一致。头痛几乎总是存在于ICP升高的患者中。它们的模式可能有所不同，但通常在卧位（例如，夜间、早上醒来）或用力时（例如，排便或举重时）会加重，这会增加ICP。\n\n尽管该患者ICP升高的根本原因尚未得到证实，但考虑到她年轻、肥胖、缺乏其他合并症以及头部CT扫描正常，特发性颅内高压(IIH)的可能性很大。或者，她的表现可以用脑静脉系统血栓（即，脑静脉窦血栓形成[CVST]）来解释，这也可能表现为ICP升高的迹象，而没有明显的头部CT发现。\n\nIIH和CVST被认为具有相似的病理生理学。脑脊液(CSF)通常流经脑室系统，直到被蛛网膜颗粒吸收，然后引流入脑静脉窦。静脉系统充血（即，脑静脉高压），是由于血栓（在CVST中）或颅内静脉压力的原发性升高（在IIH中）导致CSF吸收减少，从而导致ICP升高。\n\n（选项A和D）导水管狭窄阻断CSF从侧脑室和第三脑室流入第四脑室。它可能表现为ICP升高，但CT扫描会显示侧脑室和第三脑室扩大。CSF产生增加（可由脉络丛乳头状瘤(CPP)引起）也会在CT扫描上表现为脑室扩大（在CPP的情况下，还有脑室内肿块）。\n\n（选项B）星形胶质细胞肿胀（细胞毒性脑水肿）可表现为ICP升高。然而，脑水肿通常在CT扫描上可见，显示脑室扁平、脑回变平以及灰质-白质分化减少。\n\n（选项E）神经退行性疾病（例如，阿尔茨海默病）可导致脑容量减少，这可能允许CSF空间扩大（真空性脑积水）。这种情况往往发生缓慢，因此ICP有时间达到平衡并保持在正常范围内。\n\n教育目标：\n在没有颅内占位性病变或脑室扩大的情况下，ICP升高提示脑脊液的吸收减少。这通常发生在由于特发性颅内高压或脑静脉窦血栓形成而导致脑静脉窦系统引流受损时。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), particularly in young, obese women. It requires differentiating between various causes of elevated ICP based on clinical findings and the interpretation of imaging results.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the signs and symptoms suggestive of increased ICP, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and papilledema. Then, consider the differential diagnoses for elevated ICP in the absence of a mass lesion or hydrocephalus, focusing on conditions affecting CSF dynamics and venous drainage. Finally, evaluate how each option relates to the patient's presentation and the typical findings on neuroimaging.",
