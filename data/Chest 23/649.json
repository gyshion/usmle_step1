    "en": "A 64-year-old man comes to the office due to 4 weeks of progressive dyspnea. For the past several months, he has had a nonproductive cough and fatigue. The patient's medical conditions include degenerative joint disease and peptic ulcer disease. He smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 38 years but quit 4 years ago. On examination, there are decreased breath sounds and percussive dullness at the base of {{exhibit_1}} the right lung. Chest CT scan reveals a right-sided pleural effusion and diffuse nodular thickening of the pleura. On {{exhibit_2}} thoracentesis, bloody fluid is obtained. Pleural biopsy shows proliferation of epithelioid-type cells that are joined by {{exhibit_3}} desmosomes, contain abundant {{exhibit_4}} tonofilaments, and are studded with very long {{exhibit_5}} microvilli. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with progressive dyspnea and cough has nodular pleural thickening and a pleural effusion. This presentation, in conjunction with characteristic pathology findings, suggests mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a rare, malignant neoplasm arising from mesothelial cells that line body cavities (eg, pleural, peritoneal, pericardial) and are characterized by numerous long, slender microvilli and abundant tonofilaments. Histopathology of the tumor cells can show an epithelioid (ie, epithelium-like) and/or sarcomatoid (ie, spindle-shaped) appearance. Immunohistochemical markers (eg, cytokeratin, calretinin) are useful in diagnosis. Mesothelioma typically presents with slowly progressive dyspnea, cough, and chest pain. Pleural effusions are common and are often hemorrhagic. Radiography may demonstrate nodular or smooth, unilateral pleural thickening and plaque formation; the lung parenchyma is typically uninvolved. Asbestos exposure is the primary risk factor; individuals involved in asbestos mining and industrial applications (eg, insulation, shipbuilding) are at risk for mesothelioma. (Choice A) Adenocarcinoma cells (which typically form glands and/or produce mucin) have short, plump microvilli that distinguish them from mesothelioma cells. Adenocarcinoma tends to involve peripheral lung parenchyma. (Choice B) Pulmonary carcinoid tumors are neuroendocrine neoplasms that tend to involve the large bronchi. Histopathology typically shows uniform tumor cells with a \"salt and pepper\" chromatin pattern (ie, with fine and coarse clumps). (Choice D) Small cell carcinoma is associated with smoking but usually arises from the major bronchi. On chest imaging, it is seen as a hilar mass. Histopathology shows small, blue, oval-shaped tumor cells with scant cytoplasm. Neuroendocrine markers (eg, chromogranin, synaptophysin) are usually positive. (Choice E) Squamous cell carcinoma is associated with smoking but arises from the major bronchi; a hilar mass would be expected on imaging. Although desmosomes (intercellular bridges) can be seen in squamous cell carcinoma, imaging usually shows a central hilar mass (not pleural thickening).",
    "zh": "该患者出现进行性呼吸困难和咳嗽，伴有结节性胸膜增厚和胸腔积液。这种表现，结合特征性的病理学发现，提示间皮瘤。间皮瘤是一种罕见的恶性肿瘤，起源于覆盖体腔（如胸膜腔、腹膜腔、心包腔）的间皮细胞，其特征是具有大量长而细的微绒毛和丰富的张力丝。肿瘤细胞的组织病理学检查可显示上皮样（即，类似上皮）和/或肉瘤样（即，梭形）外观。免疫组织化学标记物（如，角蛋白、钙网蛋白）对诊断很有帮助。间皮瘤通常表现为缓慢进展的呼吸困难、咳嗽和胸痛。胸腔积液常见，并且常常是出血性的。放射学检查可能会显示结节性或光滑的单侧胸膜增厚和斑块形成；肺实质通常未受累。石棉暴露是主要的危险因素；参与石棉开采和工业应用（例如，绝缘、造船）的个体有患间皮瘤的风险。（选项A）腺癌细胞（通常形成腺体和/或产生粘蛋白）具有短而肥厚的微绒毛，这与间皮瘤细胞不同。腺癌倾向于累及肺外周实质。（选项B）肺类癌肿瘤是神经内分泌肿瘤，倾向于累及大的支气管。组织病理学检查通常显示均匀的肿瘤细胞，具有“盐和胡椒”染色质模式（即，具有细而粗的团块）。（选项D）小细胞癌与吸烟有关，但通常起源于主要的支气管。在胸部影像学检查中，它被视为肺门肿块。组织病理学检查显示小的、蓝色的、卵圆形的肿瘤细胞，胞质稀少。神经内分泌标记物（例如，嗜铬蛋白、突触结合蛋白）通常呈阳性。（选项E）鳞状细胞癌与吸烟有关，但起源于主要的支气管；影像学检查中预计会出现肺门肿块。虽然在鳞状细胞癌中可以看到桥粒（细胞间桥），但影像学检查通常显示中央肺门肿块（而不是胸膜增厚）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "The patient's presentation of progressive dyspnea, cough, pleural effusion, diffuse nodular pleural thickening, and biopsy findings of epithelioid cells with abundant tonofilaments and long microvilli, in the absence of parenchymal lung involvement, is most consistent with mesothelioma. The history of smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer, but the specific findings point away from primary lung malignancies and towards a pleural-based tumor. Asbestos exposure is a known risk factor for mesothelioma, although not explicitly stated in the vignette, it is a common association.",
    "zh": "患者出现进行性呼吸困难、咳嗽、胸腔积液、弥漫性结节性胸膜增厚以及活检结果显示上皮样细胞，细胞内有丰富的张力丝和长微绒毛，并且没有肺实质受累，这些最符合间皮瘤。吸烟史是肺癌的危险因素，但具体发现指向非原发性肺恶性肿瘤，而是胸膜相关的肿瘤。石棉暴露是间皮瘤的已知危险因素，尽管在短文描述中没有明确说明，但这是一个常见的关联。"
