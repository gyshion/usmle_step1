    "en": "A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with new-onset confusion, suprapubic discomfort, and lack of urine output. His past medical history is significant for benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by neuropathy. The patient also has a history of chronic insomnia and has been treated with several medications with little benefit. He does not know his current medications. On examination, the patient is afebrile, confused, and oriented only to self. Suprapubic fullness is present, but abdominal examination is otherwise unremarkable. A urinary catheter is placed and immediately drains 1000 mL of urine. Which of the following medications most likely has contributed to this patient's current condition?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as amitriptyline, are commonly used for insomnia or adjunctive pain management when other medications are not effective. However, TCAs have strong ANTICHOLINERGIC properties that can lead to significant adverse effects such as CONFUSION, constipation, and ACUTE URINARY RETENTION. Elderly patients are at increased risk for side effects due to comorbid conditions (eg, dementia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, decreased hepatic and renal clearance of medications, and a higher burden of concurrent medications that can interact with TCAs and contribute to adverse effects). As a result, TCAs are relatively contraindicated in elderly patients.\n\n(Choice B) Metformin can cause lactic acidosis, and atorvastatin can cause hepatitis and myositis. These drugs do not have significant anticholinergic side effects.\n\n(Choice C) Duloxetine is a dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and a variety of chronic pain disorders. Duloxetine can cause confusion, but only rarely causes obstructive voiding symptoms.\n\n(Choices D and G) Finasteride and tamsulosin are used for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and should not cause urinary obstruction or retention.\n\n(Choice E) Gabapentin is useful for painful diabetic neuropathy. It can cause sedation, confusion, and incoordination, but it does not have significant anticholinergic side effects.\n\nKey clinical pearls:\n\nElderly patients are particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of TCAs, which can manifest as confusion, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and blurred vision. TCAs should be used with extreme caution or avoided in this population, especially those with pre-existing cognitive impairment or prostatic hyperplasia.",
    "zh": "三环类抗抑郁药（TCAs），例如阿米替林，通常用于失眠或辅助性疼痛管理，当其他药物无效时。然而，三环类抗抑郁药具有很强的抗胆碱能特性，可导致严重的副作用，如意识模糊、便秘和急性尿潴留。老年患者由于合并症（如痴呆、良性前列腺增生、药物肝肾清除率降低以及可能与三环类抗抑郁药相互作用并导致不良反应的并发药物负担较高）而具有更高的副作用风险。因此，三环类抗抑郁药在老年患者中相对禁忌。\n\n（选项B）二甲双胍可导致乳酸酸中毒，而阿托伐他汀可导致肝炎和肌炎。这些药物没有明显的抗胆碱能副作用。\n\n（选项C）度洛西汀是一种双重血清素和去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂，用于治疗抑郁症、焦虑症和各种慢性疼痛疾病。度洛西汀可引起意识模糊，但很少引起梗阻性排尿症状。\n\n（选项D和G）非那雄胺和坦索罗辛用于治疗良性前列腺增生，不应引起尿路梗阻或尿潴留。\n\n（选项E）加巴喷丁对疼痛性糖尿病神经病变有效。它可引起镇静、意识模糊和共济失调，但没有明显的抗胆碱能副作用。\n\n关键临床要点：\n\n老年患者特别容易受到三环类抗抑郁药的抗胆碱能作用的影响，这些作用可表现为意识模糊、口干、便秘、尿潴留和视力模糊。在这一人群中应谨慎使用或避免使用三环类抗抑郁药，尤其是那些已有认知障碍或前列腺增生的人。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the adverse effects of common medications, particularly in elderly patients, and the recognition of anticholinergic toxicity leading to urinary retention and confusion.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the patient's symptoms (confusion, suprapubic discomfort, lack of urine output) and considering which of the listed medications is most likely to cause these specific symptoms, especially given the patient's age and medical history. Evaluating the known side effect profiles of each medication is crucial.",
    "zh": "此题考察对常见药物不良反应的理解，尤其是在老年患者中，以及对导致尿潴留和意识模糊的抗胆碱能毒性的认识。\n\n解决此问题的方法涉及识别患者的症状（意识模糊、耻骨上不适、无尿）并考虑所列药物中最有可能导致这些特定症状的药物，尤其是考虑到患者的年龄和病史。评估每种药物已知的副作用概况至关重要。"
