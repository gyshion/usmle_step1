Physical examination shows signs of meningeal irritation. The patient rapidly becomes comatose and dies 48 hours later despite aggressive medical care. Autopsy examination shows congested leptomeninges with fibrinopurulent exudate (not shown).

    "en": "Primary amebic meningoencephalitis is a rare, highly fatal condition caused by the free-living, flagellated protozoan *Naegleria fowleri*. This pathogen resides in warm fresh water (30-45 C) and moist soil. Humans are primarily exposed when the organism comes into contact with nasal mucosa during recreational water activities (eg, swimming, diving, water skiing, unchlorinated hot tub bathing). Although serologic evidence of exposure is widespread, only a small number of individuals develop invasive disease (~300 known cases).\n\nPatients typically have rapidly progressive meningeal signs, cranial nerve deficits, and confusion. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis with wet mount can usually identify motile trophozoites. Although treatment should be attempted, almost all patients die within 2-3 days.\n\n(Choice A) Rabies migrates centrally through peripheral nerves to the spinal cord and then rapidly ascends to the brain. Patients with rabies usually have preceding history of animal bite; furthermore, rabies is a virus, not an ameba, and it generally presents with several days of constitutional symptoms followed by fever, hydrophobia, and pharyngeal spasm.\n\n(Choice B) Most bacterial and fungal causes of meningitis enter the brain via the hematologic dissemination (eg, basilar artery). Although meningeal signs, vomiting, and headache frequently occur, amebas would not be seen in the cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n(Choices C and D) The oculomotor and optic nerve do not generally transmit infections into the brain; the herpes virus can travel via the trigeminal nerve (not labeled) into the brain, leading to temporal lobe encephalitis.\n\nEducational objective: Primary amebic encephalitis occurs when the free-living, motile protozoan *Naegleria fowleri* penetrates the olfactory mucosa and migrates in a retrograde fashion through the olfactory nerve to the brain. This rare, deadly infection primarily occurs after exposure to warm, fresh water during recreational activities. {{exhibit_2}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology and route of infection for primary amebic meningoencephalitis caused by *Naegleria fowleri*. It requires knowledge of the organism's habitat, mode of transmission, and the specific anatomical pathway it takes to reach the central nervous system.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the causative agent (*Naegleria fowleri*) and recall its typical mode of entry into the human body, which is through the nasal passages during exposure to contaminated warm fresh water. The provided image, depicting a cross-section of the brain with labeled structures, serves to illustrate the affected organ, but the key to answering lies in understanding the clinical vignette and the known epidemiology of the disease.",
