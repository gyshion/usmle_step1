    "en": "This patient's CT scan shows thickening and calcification of the pericardium, which are suggestive of constrictive pericarditis. Although the pericardium is normally only 1-2 mm thick, its thickness can increase to up to 20 mm in patients with constrictive pericarditis. The symptomatic presentation mimics that of right-sided heart failure, with patients experiencing slowly progressive dyspnea, lower extremity edema, ascites, and weight gain. A rapid y descent (Friedreich sign) on the jugular venous pulsation waveform (as seen in this patient) is a characteristic finding of constrictive pericarditis; the constrictive pressure on the right atrium accentuates early filling of the right ventricle while the stiff pericardial wall restricts late diastolic filling. Possible causes of constrictive pericarditis include radiation therapy to the chest, cardiac surgery, and tuberculosis, which may be the case in this patient, who emigrated from an endemic region. The patient is admitted to the hospital for further work-up and treatment. After initial evaluation, CT scan of the chest is obtained and is shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}:",

    "en": "(Choice A) Aortic dissection causes sudden chest pain that radiates to the back. Chest radiographs often reveal widening of the mediastinum, and a double aortic lumen would be seen on CT scan of the chest.\n\n(Choice C) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy also presents with dyspnea and changes in the jugular venous pressure, specifically a prominent A wave (due to decreased right ventricular compliance). CT scan may reveal thickening of the interventricular septum but not thickening or calcification of the pericardium.\n\n(Choice D) Ischemic heart disease classically causes pressure-like substernal chest pain that radiates to the left shoulder; calcifications in the coronary arteries and aorta are often seen on CT scan.\n\n(Choice E) Patients with viral myocarditis have a variable clinical presentation ranging from asymptomatic to severe chest pain and cardiogenic shock. Pericardial thickening is not a feature of this condition.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe symptomatic presentation of constrictive pericarditis mimics that of right-sided heart failure, with patients experiencing slowly progressive dyspnea, lower extremity edema, ascites, and weight gain. Calcification and thickening of the pericardium are typical features of constrictive pericarditis on CT scan. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
