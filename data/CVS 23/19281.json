    "en": "This patient with sudden-onset chest pain and ST-segment elevation in contiguous ECG leads has an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI). Hypotension, pulmonary crackles, and an audible S3 might MI-induced acute left ventricular (LV) failure and cardiogenic shock. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nIn cardiogenic shock, LV systolic failure causes increased LV end-diastolic pressure, which is transmitted backward to cause increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) (an estimate of left atrial pressure) and pulmonary edema. The increased pressure also impairs right ventricular function, resulting in increased central venous pressure (CVP). Markedly decreased cardiac output leads to hypotension with decreased coronary perfusion pressure (as coronary perfusion pressure is driven by aortic diastolic pressure) (Choices C and E). In response to the reduced cardiac output, compensatory peripheral vasoconstriction occurs to increase systemic vascular resistance in an effort to maintain organ and tissue perfusion.\n\n(Choice A) Decreased CVP, PCWP, and coronary perfusion pressure are expected with hypovolemic and septic shock.\n\n(Choice B) Increased CVP with decreased PCWP and coronary perfusion pressure are expected with obstructive shock due to pulmonary embolism (ie, blood flow blocked at the pulmonary arteries) or tension pneumothorax (ie, blood flow blocked at the right atrium due to thoracic pressure-induced vena cava collapse).\n\nEducational objective:\nMyocardial infarction may be complicated by acute left ventricular failure (LV) and cardiogenic shock. In cardiogenic shock, increased LV end-diastolic pressure is transmitted backward to cause increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (evidenced by pulmonary edema) and increased central venous pressure. There is markedly decreased cardiac output, which causes hypotension and decreased coronary perfusion pressure. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hemodynamic changes in cardiogenic shock following myocardial infarction, specifically focusing on pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, central venous pressure, and coronary perfusion pressure. The key to solving this question is to recognize the signs and symptoms of cardiogenic shock (hypotension, pulmonary edema, S3) and understand how LV failure affects preload and afterload, ultimately impacting hemodynamic parameters.",
