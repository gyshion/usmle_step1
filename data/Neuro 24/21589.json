    "en": "A 58-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to a 3-hour history of abrupt-onset weakness and numbness of the right lower extremity, as well as urinary incontinence. Two months ago, the patient was hospitalized due to left-sided weakness that resolved spontaneously after several hours. At that time, MRI of the head and MR angiography of the head and neck were normal, but the patient was found to have atrial fibrillation. An oral anticoagulant was prescribed at discharge, but the patient has been nonadherent with therapy. Blood pressure is 162/94 mm Hg and pulse is 102/min and irregularly irregular. Physical examination shows weakness and sensory loss in the right lower extremity. Babinski sign is present on the right. Speech is normal, and there is no facial weakness. Examination of the right upper extremity and the left extremities is unremarkable. An embolic occlusion affecting which of the following vascular regions is the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms?",
    "zh": "一名58岁男性因右下肢突发性无力和麻木，伴有尿失禁，来到急诊科就诊，病程3小时。两个月前，该患者曾因左侧肢体无力而住院，数小时后自发缓解。当时头部MRI和头颈部MR血管造影正常，但发现患者患有房颤。出院时处方了口服抗凝药，但患者未按医嘱服药。血压162/94 mmHg，脉搏102/min，不规则。体格检查显示右下肢无力和感觉缺失。右侧存在Babinski征。言语正常，无面部无力。右上肢和左侧肢体检查无异常。影响以下哪个血管区域的栓塞最可能是导致该患者目前症状的原因？"

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a stroke, resulting in motor and sensory deficits of the right leg (sparing the left leg and arm). Based on the somatotopic organization of the brain (ie, homunculus), this is suggestive of a lesion affecting the medial portions of the left primary motor and somatosensory cortices. The patient's urinary incontinence is further suggestive of a lack of cortical inhibition of the micturition reflex, which occurs primarily in the frontal micturition center (medial frontal lobe). These areas are all supplied by the ANTERIOR CEREBRAL ARTERY.\n\nThe Circle of Willis is somewhat protective against ischemic injury because it provides a potential alternate pathway for cerebral arterial blood flow. The anterior communicating artery (ACom) provides an anastomotic pathway between the bilateral anterior cerebral arteries, which may limit the severity of infarction if occlusion occurs proximal to the ACom (Choice B). Therefore, in a symptomatic anterior cerebral artery stroke, it is more likely that the obstruction is located DISTAL to the origin of the ACom, where collateral blood flow does not occur.\n\n(Choice C) The inferior division of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) supplies the lateral portions parietal and temporal cortices. Occlusion typically causes sensory deficits of the arm and face, with sparing of motor function. In addition, visual field defects, Wernicke aphasia (dominant hemisphere), and profound hemineglect (nondominant hemisphere) often occur.\n\n(Choice D) The superior division of the MCA impacts the frontal lateral cortex, resulting in motor and, sometimes, sensory deficits that impact the face and arm. Broca aphasia (dominant hemisphere) is common. Hemineglect (nondominant hemisphere) is variable.\n\n(Choice E) Occlusion of the proximal MCA (ie, MCA stem infarct) results in profound deficits due to the large area impacted. Deficits include hemiparesis, hemianesthesia, global aphasia (dominant hemisphere), hemineglect (nondominant hemisphere), gaze preference, and visual deficits (homonymous hemianopia).\n\nEducational objective:\nThe anterior cerebral artery supplies the medial aspects of the frontal and parietal lobes. Occlusion can lead to sensory and motor deficits of the contralateral leg. Occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery distal to the anterior communicating artery can lead to more severe symptoms because there is no collateral blood flow from the Circle of Willis.",
    "zh": "该患者患有卒中，导致右腿的运动和感觉功能障碍（左腿和手臂未受影响）。根据大脑的躯体感觉定位（即，体感图），这提示病灶影响左侧初级运动皮质和体感皮质的内侧部分。患者的尿失禁进一步提示缺乏对排尿反射的皮质抑制，而这种抑制主要发生在额叶排尿中枢（内侧额叶）。这些区域都由大脑前动脉供血。\n\nWillis环在某种程度上可以预防缺血性损伤，因为它提供了脑动脉血流的潜在替代途径。前交通动脉（ACom）提供双侧大脑前动脉之间的吻合途径，如果闭塞发生在ACom近端（选项B），则可以限制梗死的严重程度。因此，在有症状的大脑前动脉卒中中，梗阻更可能位于ACom起始部的远端，在那里不会发生侧支血流。\n\n（选项C）大脑中动脉（MCA）的下分支供应顶叶和颞叶的外侧部分。闭塞通常会导致手臂和面部的感觉功能障碍，而运动功能不受影响。此外，还会发生视野缺损、韦尼克失语（优势半球）和严重的半侧忽略（非优势半球）。\n\n（选项D）MCA的上分支影响额叶外侧皮质，导致影响面部和手臂的运动，有时也影响感觉功能障碍。Broca失语（优势半球）很常见。半侧忽略（非优势半球）是可变的。\n\n（选项E）近端MCA的闭塞（即，MCA干梗死）由于受影响的区域较大，会导致严重的缺陷。缺陷包括偏瘫、偏身感觉缺失、全面性失语（优势半球）、半侧忽略（非优势半球）、凝视偏向和视觉缺陷（同侧偏盲）。\n\n教学目标：\n大脑前动脉供应额叶和顶叶的内侧部分。闭塞可导致对侧腿的感觉和运动功能障碍。大脑前动脉在越过前交通动脉后闭塞，可导致更严重的症状，因为Willis环中没有侧支血流。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of cerebral stroke patterns and the localization of neurological deficits based on the vascular supply of the brain. It requires correlating the patient's specific symptoms, such as weakness and sensory loss in the right leg and urinary incontinence, with the anatomical territories supplied by different cerebral arteries.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the neurological deficits and their likely location within the brain based on the homunculus. Then, consider the vascular supply to that brain region, paying attention to the role of collateral circulation, such as the Circle of Willis, in determining the severity and pattern of symptoms following an occlusion.",
