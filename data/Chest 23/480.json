    "en": "Fourth-year medical students are recruited for a research study assessing their ability to interpret biopsy samples obtained during routine clinical practice. As part of the study, they are given samples of normal respiratory mucosa and asked to identify the cell types present after staining with hematoxylin and eosin. The students observe that the respiratory epithelium changes in composition as the airways continue distally from the trachea to the alveolar ducts.",

  "correct_answer": "B",

    "en": "Ciliated mucosal epithelium lines the pulmonary airways from the trachea to the respiratory bronchioles. The airway epithelium gradually changes from pseudostratified ciliated columnar to ciliated simple cuboidal by the level of the terminal bronchioles. Ciliated cells continue to be present through the proximal portions of the respiratory bronchioles, but are not present in the alveolar ducts or in the alveoli themselves. This arrangement is important because cilia function to propel mucus toward the pharynx. The presence of cilia beyond the most distal mucus-producing cells (goblet cells end before the terminal bronchioles) prevents bronchiolar mucus accumulation and airflow obstruction. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) The rings of hyaline cartilage that encircle the trachea are replaced by cartilaginous plates in the bronchi. These rings and plates help keep the larger airways open and end at the termination of the smallest bronchi (they are not found in bronchioles).\n\n(Choice C) Goblet cells are mucus-secreting cells that are present from the trachea down to the larger bronchioles. They are not found in the terminal bronchioles, which are lined by club cells.\n\n(Choices D and E) The submucosal mucous glands and serous glands are found from the trachea to the distal-most bronchi and produce mucinous components that help trap inhaled particles. They are not present within the bronchioles.",
    "zh": "纤毛柱状上皮覆盖从气管到呼吸性细支气管的肺部气道。气道上皮从假复层纤毛柱状上皮逐渐变为纤毛单层立方上皮，到末端细支气管的水平。纤毛细胞继续存在于呼吸性细支气管的近端部分，但不存在于肺泡导管或肺泡本身。这种排列很重要，因为纤毛的功能是将粘液推向咽部。纤毛的存在超过最远端的产粘液细胞（杯状细胞在末端细支气管之前结束），可防止细支气管粘液积聚和气流阻塞。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项 A）包围气管的透明软骨环在支气管中被软骨板取代。这些环和板有助于保持较大的气道开放，并在最小支气管的末端结束（它们不在细支气管中）。\n\n（选项 C）杯状细胞是产粘液细胞，从气管到较大的细支气管都存在。它们不存在于被Clara细胞覆盖的末端细支气管中。\n\n（选项 D 和 E）粘膜下粘液腺和浆液腺从气管到最远端的支气管都有，并产生有助于捕获吸入颗粒的粘蛋白成分。它们不存在于细支气管内。"
