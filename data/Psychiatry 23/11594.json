    "en": "A 38-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance due to severe abdominal pain and undergoes an emergency appendectomy. Following a successful operation and recovery, the patient questions whether the appendectomy was absolutely necessary. He doubts the surgeon's explanation that the surgery was potentially lifesaving, angrily suggests that the hospital is taking advantage of his excellent medical insurance, and makes vague threats to sue the hospital. He asks to be discharged immediately, and explains, \"I've earned everything I have on my own, and this hospital isn't getting any of it.\" When asked if he has any relatives or friends the team can speak with, he says, \"I haven't talked to my family in 20 years, and I wouldn't call anyone my friend. Even if I did, that's none of your business.\"",

    "en": "This patient's distrust, suspicion about the surgeon's motives, and lack of sustained relationships are suggestive of PARANOID PERSONALITY DISORDER. Patients with this disorder exhibit a pattern of pervasive distrust of others beginning in early adulthood. These individuals tend to have minimal interpersonal relationships due to doubts about others' intentions and concerns that personal information will be used against them.\n\nAlthough paranoid personality disorder involves paranoid interpretations of benign comments and events, it can be differentiated from psychotic disorders by the lack of persistent, well-developed delusions and other psychotic symptoms (eg, hallucinations, disorganized speech or behavior).\n\n(Choice A) Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others.\n\n(Choice B) Although onset of brief psychotic disorder (≥1 psychotic symptoms lasting ≥1 day and <1 month) is usually sudden and in the context of a stressor, this patient's pattern of pervasive distrust of others started well before his appendectomy and is more consistent with paranoid personality disorder.\n\n(Choice C) This patient does not have persistent, fixed, false beliefs as found in delusional disorder, which is characterized by ≥1 delusions lasting ≥1 months in the absence of other psychotic symptoms.\n\n(Choice D) Narcissistic personality disorder consists of a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, sense of entitlement, and lack of empathy. Behaviors and interactions are often motivated by a need for attention and praise.\n\n(Choice F) Individuals with schizoid personality disorder are aloof and socially detached but do not have overt paranoid ideation.\n\n(Choice G) Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by magical beliefs, social anxiety, eccentric behavior, and odd perceptual experiences.\n\nEducational objective: Individuals with paranoid personality disorder exhibit a lifelong pattern of pervasive suspicion and distrust. Unlike patients with psychotic disorders, they do not have fixed delusions and other psychotic symptoms.",
    "zh": "该患者的不信任、对外科医生动机的怀疑以及缺乏持续的人际关系表明其患有偏执型人格障碍。患有这种疾病的患者表现出一种普遍的不信任他人的模式，这种模式始于成年早期。由于对他人意图的怀疑以及担心个人信息会被利用，这些人往往人际关系极少。\n\n尽管偏执型人格障碍涉及对良性评论和事件的偏执解释，但它可以通过缺乏持续的、完善的妄想症和其他精神病症状（例如幻觉、言语或行为紊乱）来与精神病性障碍区分开来。\n\n（选项A）反社会型人格障碍的特征是无视和侵犯他人权利的模式。\n\n（选项B）尽管短暂性精神病性障碍的发病（≥1个精神病性症状持续≥1天且<1个月）通常是突然发生的，并且发生在应激源的背景下，但该患者普遍不信任他人的模式早在阑尾切除术之前就开始了，这更符合偏执型人格障碍。\n\n（选项C）该患者没有如妄想症中存在的持续、固定的、错误的信念，妄想症的特征是在没有其他精神病症状的情况下，存在≥1个持续≥1个月的妄想。\n\n（选项D）自恋型人格障碍包括一种普遍的自大、对赞赏的需要、权利感和缺乏同情心的模式。行为和互动通常由对关注和赞扬的需要驱动。\n\n（选项F）分裂样人格障碍患者孤僻、社会脱离，但没有明显的偏执观念。\n\n（选项G）分裂型人格障碍的特征是存在奇异的信念、社交焦虑、古怪的行为和奇怪的知觉体验。\n\n教育目标：偏执型人格障碍患者表现出一种终生的普遍怀疑和不信任模式。与精神病性障碍患者不同，他们没有固定的妄想和其他精神病症状。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of personality disorders, specifically differentiating between paranoid personality disorder and other related conditions based on clinical presentation. It assesses the ability to interpret patient behavior, including suspicion, distrust, and interpersonal difficulties, within the context of diagnostic criteria for various personality disorders.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully analyzing the patient's statements and behaviors described in the vignette. Key elements to consider are the pervasive distrust, suspicion of motives, lack of close relationships, and the specific nature of their complaints (e.g., feeling taken advantage of). This information should then be compared against the diagnostic features of each personality disorder listed in the options to identify the most fitting diagnosis.",
