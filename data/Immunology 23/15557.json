    "en": "A 42-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to worsening jaw pain over the past week. She is unable to chew solid foods on the left side because of severe throbbing pain. The patient has had several \"tooth infections\" over the last year despite meticulous oral hygiene. Physical examination shows facial edema over the left mandible. Multiple teeth have decay and gingival recession, and gentle tapping of the left second molar elicits pain. This patient's current disease process is most likely to develop secondary to which of the following underlying conditions?",
    "zh": "一名42岁的女性因过去一周加重的颌部疼痛来到急诊科。由于剧烈的搏动性疼痛，她无法用左侧咀嚼固体食物。尽管口腔卫生非常细致，但患者在过去一年中患有数次“牙齿感染”。体格检查显示左侧下颌骨水肿。多颗牙齿出现龋齿和牙龈萎缩，轻敲左侧第二磨牙会引起疼痛。该患者目前的疾病进程最有可能继发于以下哪种潜在疾病？"

    "en": "Sjögren syndrome\n\nPathogenesis\n\nImmune-mediated destruction of the lacrimal & salivary glands\nCan occur as primary disease or secondary with other autoimmune disorders (eg, SLE, RA)\n\nClinical features\n\nDry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca)\nDry mouth (xerostomia), salivary hypertrophy\nDry skin (xerosis)\nRaynaud phenomenon\nCutaneous vasculitis\nPositive anti-Ro (SSA) &/or anti-La (SSB)\n\nComplications\n\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nCorneal damage, dental caries\n\nRA = rheumatoid arthritis; SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus; SSA/SSB = Sjögren syndrome (antibody) A+B\n\nSjögren syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disorder that is most common in middle-age women and is characterized by inflammation of exocrine glands (eg, salivary, lacrimal, vaginal). It can occur as an isolated disorder or in association with another autoimmune syndrome (eg, rheumatoid arthritis). Patients typically have severe dry mouth (xerostomia) due to insufficient saliva production. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nSaliva has numerous antibacterial and antifungal proteins, along with organic and inorganic components which protect tooth enamel. Patients with SS have a higher rate of thrush, dental caries, and other complications of odontogenic infections (eg, osteomyelitis of the mandible) because of the loss of these protective factors in saliva.\n\nReduction in tear production from the lacrimal glands can cause corneal dryness and damage, and loss of vaginal lubrication in female patients is associated with dyspareunia (painful intercourse) and frequent infections (eg, candidal, bacterial). Biopsy of the salivary glands is diagnostic and shows a lymphocytic infiltrate, often with germinal centers.\n\n(Choice A) Acromegaly is characterized by overproduction of growth hormone, typically due to a somatotroph pituitary adenoma. Cranial effects include enlarged facial features, prognathism, and increased spacing between the teeth.\n\n(Choice B) Crohn disease can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. Aphthous ulcers are the most common oral manifestation of this disease.\n\n(Choice C) Oral manifestations of riboflavin (vitamin B₂) deficiency include angular cheilosis, stomatitis, and glossitis.\n\n(Choice D) Selective IgA deficiency is usually asymptomatic, although it is associated with an increased risk for giardiasis and recurrent sinopulmonary infections caused by encapsulated bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae).\n\nEducational objective:\n\nSjögren syndrome is characterized by autoimmune inflammation of exocrine glands (eg, salivary, lacrimal, vaginal). Patients typically have severe dry mouth (xerostomia) due to reduced saliva production, which can lead to an increased rate of dental caries and other oral infections in saliva. Biopsy of the salivary glands shows a lymphocytic infiltrate, often with germinal centers. {{exhibit_2}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Sjögren syndrome, its pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and complications, particularly focusing on the oral manifestations and increased susceptibility to dental issues. It also requires differentiating Sjögren syndrome from other conditions with overlapping symptoms.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the patient's symptoms of dry mouth leading to dental problems despite good oral hygiene. Recognize that Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disorder affecting exocrine glands, leading to dryness and increased risk of infections. Rule out other conditions based on their distinct clinical features.",
