    "en": "A 67-year-old man comes to the emergency department with low-grade fevers and fatigue. He has no history of heart disease. His temperature is 38.4 C (101.1 F), blood pressure is 117/76 mm Hg, pulse is 82/min, and respirations are 14/min. On examination, there is a diastolic murmur at the left sternal border. He has nontender erythematous macules on his hands and feet. Blood cultures show gram-positive cocci that are catalase-negative and able to grow in hypertonic (6.5%) saline and bile. This patient's medical history is most likely to include which of the following procedures within the past month?",

    "en": "Enterococcal endocarditis (representing up to 30% of nosocomial endocarditis cases) usually occurs in elderly men who have recently undergone manipulation of areas colonized by this organism. The genitourinary tract (eg, cystoscopy) is the most common portal of entry; gastrointestinal (eg, colonoscopy) or obstetric procedures are also risk factors. Enterococci can also cause urinary tract infections (most common), intraabdominal and pelvic infections, and wound infections. Enterococci are typically gamma-hemolytic (no hemolysis on agar), CATALASE-NEGATIVE, pyrrolidonyl arylamidase-positive, Lancefield Group D GRAM-POSITIVE cocci that can grow in HYPERTONIC (6.5%) saline and bile. The most common species of enterococci (formerly classified under the genus *Streptococcus*) are *Enterococcus faecalis* (80%-90%) and *Enterococcus faecium* (10%-15%).\n\nEnterococci are resistant to many antibiotics and can be very difficult to treat. A cell wall-active agent (such as ampicillin) is often combined with an aminoglycoside for synergistic effect, but increasingly bacteria resistant to both aminoglycosides and β-lactams (including penicillinase-resistant types) are emerging. Strains with vancomycin or linezolid resistance have also appeared.\n\n(Choice B) Dental extraction is associated with endocarditis caused by viridans group streptococci (VGS). In most cases, VGS cause subacute bacterial endocarditis in already abnormal heart valves (eg, congenital valvular abnormalities, valves damaged by rheumatic fever). VGS do not grow on hypertonic saline. In addition, almost all VGS species do not grow on bile (VGS are also considered bile-insoluble as they exhibit no cell lysis in the presence of bile, in contrast to the bile-soluble *S pneumoniae*).\n\n(Choice C) Removal of a nasal polyp can cause transient bacteremia. Organisms that colonize the nose include *Corynebacterium* species, *Haemophilus* species, staphylococci, streptococci, and *Neisseria* species. Of these, staphylococci and streptococci may cause endocarditis, but the organism described displays characteristics of *Enterococcus*.\n\n(Choice D) Sinus infections are usually caused by *S pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, or *Moraxella catarrhalis*. *S pneumoniae* would be a very rare cause of endocarditis and is usually identified by being bile-soluble and optochin-sensitive.\n\n(Choice E) Skin biopsy is a benign procedure that would be unlikely to cause endocarditis. Skin is colonized with many bacteria, including *Staphylococcus* and *Streptococcus* species, *Corynebacterium* species, and *Bacillus* species.\n\nEducational objective:\n*Enterococcus* is a component of the normal colonic and urogenital flora and is capable of growing in hypertonic saline and bile. It is gamma-hemolytic, catalase-negative, and pyrrolidonyl arylamidase-positive. Genitourinary instrumentation or catheterization has been associated with enterococcal endocarditis.",
    "zh": "肠球菌性心内膜炎（占医院获得性心内膜炎病例的30%）通常发生在最近接受过该细菌定植区域操作的老年男性中。泌尿生殖道（如膀胱镜检查）是最常见的侵入门户；胃肠道（如结肠镜检查）或产科手术也是危险因素。肠球菌也可引起尿路感染（最常见）、腹腔内和盆腔感染以及伤口感染。肠球菌通常为γ溶血（琼脂上无溶血）、过氧化氢酶阴性、吡咯烷酮芳酰胺酶阳性、Lancefield D组革兰氏阳性球菌，可在高渗（6.5%）盐水和胆汁中生长。最常见的肠球菌物种（以前归类于链球菌属）是粪肠球菌（80%-90%）和屎肠球菌（10%-15%）。\n\n肠球菌对许多抗生素具有耐药性，且很难治疗。通常将细胞壁活性药物（如氨苄青霉素）与氨基糖苷类药物联合使用以产生协同作用，但越来越多的细菌对氨基糖苷类药物和β-内酰胺类药物（包括耐青霉素酶的类型）均具有耐药性。也出现了对万古霉素或利奈唑胺耐药的菌株。\n\n（选项B）拔牙与草绿色链球菌（VGS）引起的心内膜炎相关。在大多数情况下，VGS在已有异常的心脏瓣膜（例如，先天性瓣膜异常，风湿热损伤的瓣膜）中引起亚急性细菌性心内膜炎。VGS不在高渗盐水中生长。此外，几乎所有VGS物种均不在胆汁中生长（VGS也被认为是不溶于胆汁的，因为它们在胆汁存在下不表现出细胞溶解，这与胆汁可溶的肺炎链球菌相反）。\n\n（选项C）鼻息肉切除术可引起短暂的菌血症。定植于鼻腔的生物包括棒状杆菌属、嗜血杆菌属、葡萄球菌、链球菌和奈瑟菌属。其中，葡萄球菌和链球菌可能引起心内膜炎，但所描述的生物表现出肠球菌的特征。\n\n（选项D）鼻窦感染通常由肺炎链球菌、流感嗜血杆菌或卡他莫拉菌引起。肺炎链球菌是心内膜炎的非常罕见的原因，通常通过胆汁溶解和对抑菌素敏感来鉴定。\n\n（选项E）皮肤活检是一种良性操作，不太可能引起心内膜炎。皮肤上定植有许多细菌，包括葡萄球菌属、链球菌属、棒状杆菌属和芽孢杆菌属。\n\n教育目标：\n肠球菌是正常的结肠和泌尿生殖道菌群的组成部分，能够在高渗盐水和胆汁中生长。它呈γ溶血、过氧化氢酶阴性、吡咯烷酮芳酰胺酶阳性。泌尿生殖系统器械或导管插入术与肠球菌性心内膜炎有关。"

It requires recognizing the association between genitourinary procedures like cystoscopy and Enterococcus as a cause of endocarditis.\n\nThe key to solving this question is identifying the gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci that grow in hypertonic saline and bile as Enterococcus.
