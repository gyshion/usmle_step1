    "en": "This girl with ambiguous genitalia, hypertension, and hypokalemia most likely has 11β-hydroxylase deficiency, the second-most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia after 21-hydroxylase deficiency. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n11β-hydroxylase is responsible for converting 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. Enzyme deficiency results in the buildup of aldosterone and cortisol precursors, which are then shunted toward adrenal androgen synthesis. In genetically female infants, androgen excess leads to ambiguous genitalia (virilization). Although 11β-hydroxylase deficiency inhibits aldosterone synthesis, 11-deoxycorticosterone accumulates and acts as a weak mineralocorticoid, causing affected individuals to have hypertension and hypokalemia.\n\n(Choice A) 5α-reductase deficiency causes ambiguous genitalia in boys due to the defective conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. Girls have normal genitalia, and blood pressure and electrolytes are unaffected.\n\n(Choice C) 17α-hycroxylase deficiency results in impaired sex steroid and cortisol synthesis, and increased production of mineralocorticoids. Girls are born with normal genitalia, but boys are born undervirilized (ambiguous genitalia). Affected individuals develop hypertension and hypokalemia (mineralocorticoid excess) and do not undergo puberty (no sex steroids).\n\n(Choice D) 21-hycroxylase deficiency decreases glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid synthesis and increases adrenal androgen production. Girls are born with ambiguous genitalia (androgen excess) and frequently develop hypotension and hyperkalemia (mineralocorticoid deficiency).\n\n(Choice E) Side-chain cleavage enzyme converts cholesterol to pregnenolone. Because this is the first enzyme in the steroidogenic pathway, deficiency impairs synthesis of all steroid hormones. Complete deficiency is lethal due to absent placental progesterone synthesis.\n\nEducational objective:\n11β-hydroxylase deficiency typically results in excessive adrenal androgen and mineralocorticoid (11-deoxycorticosterone) production. Genetically female infants are born with ambiguous genitalia, and affected individuals develop hypertension and hypokalemia early in life. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency, its presentation with ambiguous genitalia, hypertension, and hypokalemia, and the underlying pathophysiology of steroid hormone synthesis. It requires understanding the specific enzyme deficiencies that cause CAH and their associated clinical and biochemical findings.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the triad of ambiguous genitalia, hypertension, and hypokalemia in a female infant. Recall that 11β-hydroxylase deficiency is the second most common cause of CAH and leads to increased mineralocorticoid (deoxycorticosterone) and androgen production, causing these specific clinical manifestations.",
