    "en": "This patient presents with findings consistent with ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME, with ongoing injury as evidenced by the positive troponin. An important component of therapy involves not only treating the existing clot but also preventing its propagation. The coagulation cascade amplifies the generation of thrombin, which activates platelets to form a plug and also helps convert fibrinogen to fibrin to reinforce the platelet plug. Antithrombin can inhibit both Factor Xa in the coagulation cascade and also thrombin.\n\nBoth unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) contain a pentasaccharide sequence that binds to antithrombin and causes a conformational change that increases its ability to inactivate Factor Xa. However, heparin must bind to both antithrombin and thrombin together to form a ternary complex to inactivate thrombin. Only unfractionated heparin (not LMWH) has a pentasaccharide chain long enough (>18 saccharide units) to bind to both antithrombin and thrombin. As a result, unfractionated heparin has equal activity against Factor Xa and thrombin, while LMWH has greater activity against Factor Xa than thrombin.\n\n(Choice A) Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin that has fewer of the required long saccharide units that bind to thrombin and less antithrombotic activity compared to unfractionated heparin.\n\n(Choice B) Fondaparinux is a synthetic pentasaccharide Factor Xa inhibitor. It has none of the required long saccharide units that bind to thrombin and much lower antithrombin activity compared to unfractionated heparin.\n\nEducational objective:\nBoth unfractionated heparin and LMWH can bind to antithrombin to increase its activity against Factor Xa. Only unfractionated heparin is able to bind to both antithrombin and thrombin to allow antithrombin to inactivate thrombin.",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现与急性冠状动脉综合征相符，并且由于肌钙蛋白呈阳性，表明存在持续性损伤。治疗的重要组成部分不仅包括治疗现有的血栓，还包括预防其扩散。凝血级联反应会放大凝血酶的生成，凝血酶会激活血小板形成血栓，并有助于将纤维蛋白原转化为纤维蛋白以加强血小板栓子。抗凝血酶可抑制凝血级联反应中的 Xa 因子和凝血酶。\n\n普通肝素和低分子量肝素 (LMWH) 都含有一种五糖序列，可与抗凝血酶结合，并引起构象变化，从而增加其灭活 Xa 因子的能力。然而，肝素必须同时与抗凝血酶和凝血酶结合，形成三元复合物才能灭活凝血酶。只有普通肝素（而非 LMWH）具有足够长的五糖链（>18 个糖单位），可以同时与抗凝血酶和凝血酶结合。因此，普通肝素对 Xa 因子和凝血酶的活性相同，而 LMWH 对 Xa 因子比对凝血酶的活性更高。\n\n（选项 A）依诺肝素是一种低分子量肝素，它具有较少的结合凝血酶所需的长的糖单位，并且与普通肝素相比，抗血栓活性较低。\n\n（选项 B）磺达肝癸钠是一种合成的五糖 Xa 因子抑制剂。它没有任何结合凝血酶所需的长的糖单位，并且与普通肝素相比，抗凝血酶活性低得多。\n\n教育目标：\n普通肝素和 LMWH 都可以与抗凝血酶结合，以增加其对 Xa 因子的活性。只有普通肝素能够同时与抗凝血酶和凝血酶结合，从而使抗凝血酶灭活凝血酶。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of different anticoagulants, specifically their ability to inactivate thrombin. It requires understanding the structural differences between unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and fondaparinux and how these differences affect their interaction with antithrombin and thrombin.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the specific target of inactivation (thrombin) and recall which anticoagulant has the structural capacity to bind both antithrombin and thrombin simultaneously. Eliminate options that primarily target Factor Xa or lack the necessary saccharide units for thrombin binding.",
