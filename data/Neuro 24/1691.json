    "en": "A newborn is taken to the neonatal intensive care unit after delivery due to respiratory distress. The neonate was born full-term, and there were no significant complications during pregnancy or delivery. Once the patient is stabilized, a detailed physical examination is performed and shows an underdeveloped mandible and hypoplastic zygomatic bones. Genetic testing confirms a gene mutation that results in abnormal development of the first and second pharyngeal arches. Which of the following structures is also likely abnormal in this patient?",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The developing embryo has 6 pharyngeal arches, and all but the fifth arch contribute to adult structures. The mesoderm forms muscular and vascular elements, and neural crest cells form bony and cartilaginous structures. Each arch is also innervated by a specific cranial nerve (CN).\n\n- The first arch is associated with the trigeminal nerve (CN V). Its bony derivatives include the maxilla, zygoma, mandible, incus, and malleus, and its muscular derivatives include the muscles of mastication (eg, masseter, temporalis).\n\n- The second arch is associated with the facial nerve (CN VII) and gives rise to the styloid process of the temporal bone, lesser horn of the hyoid, and stapes. Muscular derivatives include the muscles of facial expression.\n\nThis patient's presentation is consistent with Treacher Collins syndrome, a rare genetic disorder resulting in the abnormal development of the first and second pharyngeal arches. The associated craniofacial abnormalities (eg, mandibular, maxillary, and zygomatic bone hypoplasia) often result in airway compromise, while absent or abnormal ossicles (eg, incus, malleus, stapes) can lead to profound conductive hearing loss.\n\n(Choices A, E, and F) The fourth and sixth arches make up the cartilaginous structures of the larynx, including the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. Derivatives of these arches (eg, most pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles) are innervated by the vagus nerve (CN X).\n\n(Choice B) The third pharyngeal arch is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). Neurologic dysfunction may lead to impaired taste perception and an absent gag reflex.\n\n(Choice C) Although the lesser horn of the hyoid bone is derived from the secondary pharyngeal arch, the greater horn of the hyoid is derived from the third arch.\n\nEducational objective:\nDisrupted development of the first and second pharyngeal arches results in hypoplasia of the arches' musculoskeletal derivatives, including the mandible, maxilla, zygomatic bones, and ossicles.",
    "zh": "发育中的胚胎有6个咽弓，除了第五咽弓外，所有咽弓都参与构成成人的结构。中胚层形成肌肉和血管结构，神经嵴细胞形成骨骼和软骨结构。每个咽弓也由特定的脑神经 (CN) 支配。\n\n- 第一咽弓与三叉神经 (CN V) 相关。其骨骼衍生物包括上颌骨、颧骨、下颌骨、砧骨和锤骨，其肌肉衍生物包括咀嚼肌（例如咬肌、颞肌）。\n\n- 第二咽弓与面神经 (CN VII) 相关，产生颞骨的茎突、舌骨小角和镫骨。肌肉衍生物包括面部表情肌。\n\n该患者的临床表现与 Treacher Collins 综合征一致，这是一种罕见的遗传病，导致第一和第二咽弓发育异常。相关的颅面畸形（例如，下颌骨、上颌骨和颧骨发育不全）常导致气道受损，而缺失或异常的听小骨（例如，砧骨、锤骨、镫骨）可导致严重的传导性听力损失。\n\n（选项 A、E 和 F）第四和第六咽弓组成了喉部的软骨结构，包括环状软骨和甲状软骨。这些咽弓的衍生物（例如，大多数咽肌和喉肌）由迷走神经 (CN X) 支配。\n\n（选项 B）第三咽弓由舌咽神经 (CN IX) 支配。神经功能障碍可能导致味觉受损和咽反射消失。\n\n（选项 C）虽然舌骨小角源自第二咽弓，但舌骨大角源自第三咽弓。\n\n教学目标：\n第一和第二咽弓发育受损会导致咽弓的骨骼肌肉衍生物发育不全，包括下颌骨、上颌骨、颧骨和听小骨。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the embryological development of the pharyngeal arches and their derivatives, specifically focusing on the structures derived from the first and second arches and their associated clinical manifestations in conditions like Treacher Collins syndrome.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall the derivatives of each pharyngeal arch, particularly the bony and cartilaginous structures and ossicles. Identifying the affected arches (first and second) based on the clinical presentation and genetic testing allows for the deduction of other likely affected structures derived from these arches.",
    "zh": "这道题测试对咽弓及其衍生物的胚胎学发育的理解，特别是侧重于源自第一和第二咽弓的结构及其在 Treacher Collins 综合征等疾病中的相关临床表现。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须回忆每个咽弓的衍生物，特别是骨骼和软骨结构以及听小骨。根据临床表现和基因检测确定受影响的咽弓（第一和第二咽弓），可以推断出其他可能受影响的源自这些咽弓的结构。"
