His roommate says that the patient has had a fever and headache for the past 2 days and that today he was talking nonsensically. The patient works for a fast-food chain and occasionally smokes cigarettes on his breaks. He does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Temperature is 38.6 C (101.5 F). MRI of the brain shows swelling of the temporal lobes. CSF analysis is most likely to reveal which of the following patterns?",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of encephalitis, including fever, headache, altered mental status, and seizure, along with MRI findings of temporal lobe swelling. These findings are highly suggestive of HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS (HSV) ENCEPHALITIS. HSV encephalitis typically presents with acute onset fever, headache, altered mental status, and focal neurologic deficits or seizure. The virus enters the brain via the olfactory tract and travels to the olfactory cortex, located in the medial temporal lobe, leading to temporal lobe edema. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis in HSV encephalitis characteristically shows a \"viral pattern\" with LYMPHOCYTIC PLEOCYTOSIS, normal glucose, and normal to slightly elevated protein. Hemorrhagic inflammation of the temporal lobes can also cause ELEVATED ERYTHROCYTES in the CSF. Therefore, the CSF analysis is most likely to reveal normal glucose, increased protein, and increased lymphocytes and erythrocytes.\n\n(Choice A) Trauma from inserting the lumbar puncture needle can lead to a \"traumatic tap,\" which is characterized by CSF evidence of normal glucose, elevated protein, and elevated erythrocytes. While erythrocytes are present, the predominance of lymphocytes and the clinical picture point away from a simple traumatic tap as the sole explanation.\n\n(Choice B) Bacterial meningitis is usually associated with CSF evidence of low glucose, high protein, and a markedly elevated white blood cell count with a neutrophil predominance. Bacterial meningitis classically causes the triad of fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental state. The presence of temporal lobe swelling on brain imaging makes HSV encephalitis far more likely than bacterial meningitis.\n\n(Choice D) Tuberculous or fungal meningitis is often associated with CSF evidence of low glucose, moderately elevated protein, and lymphocytic pleocytosis. While lymphocytic pleocytosis is present, the glucose is typically low in these conditions, and the clinical presentation with prominent temporal lobe involvement is more characteristic of HSV encephalitis.\n\n(Choice E) Patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) often have CSF protein elevations with normal cell counts (albuminocytologic dissociation), which is thought to be due to increased permeability of the blood-nerve barrier at the level of the nerve root. GBS usually presents with progressive, symmetric ascending muscle weakness, not seizures and fevers.\n\n(Choice F) A normal CSF analysis is inconsistent with the clinical presentation and MRI findings suggestive of encephalitis.",
    "zh": "患者出现提示脑炎的症状，包括发烧、头痛、精神状态改变和癫痫发作，以及颞叶肿胀的 MRI 结果。这些发现高度提示单纯疱疹病毒 (HSV) 脑炎。HSV 脑炎通常表现为急性发热、头痛、精神状态改变以及局灶性神经功能缺损或癫痫发作。病毒通过嗅束进入大脑，并到达位于内侧颞叶的嗅皮质，导致颞叶水肿。HSV 脑炎的脑脊液 (CSF) 分析特征性地显示出“病毒模式”，伴有淋巴细胞增多、葡萄糖正常和蛋白轻度升高。颞叶的出血性炎症也会导致 CSF 中红细胞升高。因此，脑脊液分析最有可能揭示葡萄糖正常、蛋白升高以及淋巴细胞和红细胞增多。\n\n(选项 A) 插入腰椎穿刺针造成的损伤可导致“创伤性穿刺”，其特征是脑脊液中葡萄糖正常、蛋白升高和红细胞升高。虽然红细胞存在，但淋巴细胞占优势以及临床表现表明，单纯的创伤性穿刺不是唯一的解释。\n\n(选项 B) 细菌性脑膜炎通常与脑脊液中葡萄糖降低、蛋白升高以及中性粒细胞占优势的白细胞计数显着升高有关。细菌性脑膜炎通常会导致发烧、颈部僵硬和精神状态改变的“三联征”。脑部影像学上颞叶肿胀的存在使得 HSV 脑炎比细菌性脑膜炎的可能性大得多。\n\n(选项 D) 结核性或真菌性脑膜炎通常与脑脊液中葡萄糖降低、蛋白中度升高和淋巴细胞增多有关。虽然存在淋巴细胞增多，但这些情况下葡萄糖通常较低，且以颞叶受累为主的临床表现更符合 HSV 脑炎。\n\n(选项 E) 格林-巴利综合征 (GBS) 患者通常有脑脊液蛋白升高，细胞计数正常（蛋白细胞分离），这被认为是由神经根水平血-神经屏障的通透性增加所致。GBS 通常表现为进行性、对称性上升的肌无力，而不是癫痫发作和发烧。\n\n(选项 F) 正常的脑脊液分析与提示脑炎的临床表现和 MRI 结果不符。"

It requires integrating patient history, physical examination, imaging findings, and laboratory results to arrive at the most likely diagnosis.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the key clinical features pointing towards encephalitis, particularly HSV encephalitis, given the temporal lobe involvement. Then, recall or refer to the typical CSF findings for various central nervous system infections and compare them with the options provided, selecting the pattern most consistent with HSV encephalitis.",
