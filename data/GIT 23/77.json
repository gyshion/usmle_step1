    "en": "A 64-year-old man comes to the office due to acute-onset right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient had an extensive small bowel resection due to bowel ischemia a year ago and has been receiving total parenteral nutrition since then. His other medical problems include atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Examination shows right upper quadrant tenderness on deep palpation. Initial laboratory studies show moderate leukocytosis with normal hepatic transaminase, amylase, and lipase levels. Abdominal ultrasonography reveals gallstones and edema of the gallbladder wall. Review of prior records indicates that he had no gallstones noted on abdominal imaging performed prior to the bowel resection.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "A prolonged course of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is often complicated by gallstones. In normal individuals, enteral passage of fat and amino acids into the duodenum triggers release of cholecystokinin (CCK), leading to contraction of the gallbladder. The absence of normal enteral stimulation in patients receiving TPN leads to decreased CCK release and subsequent biliary stasis. In addition, patients with extensive resection of the ileum can have disruption to the normal enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, leading to inadequate solubilization of biliary cholesterol and formation of cholesterol crystals. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice B) Advanced liver disease can impair cholesterol conversion to bile acids due to the diminished synthetic ability of injured hepatocytes, leading to supersaturation of the bile with cholesterol. This contributes to the increased risk of gallstones seen in cirrhotic individuals but would be unlikely in this patient with no evidence of hepatocellular dysfunction.\n\n(Choice C) TPN preparations contain glucose, amino acids, and fats based on the individual patient's needs, with additional electrolytes, vitamins, minerals, and trace elements in carefully calculated amounts. Serum triglyceride levels may rise on TPN, but TPN does not contain significant amounts of cholesterol, and serum cholesterol levels do not usually change significantly.\n\n(Choice D) Deficient supplementation of essential fatty acids in TPN is associated with a number of clinical complications, including dermatitis, alopecia, neuropathy, visual disturbances, and ataxia. Gallstones are not related.\n\n(Choice E) Digested peptides and free amino acids in the gastric lumen are a major stimulus for gastrin release, so parenteral nutrition typically results in decreased (not increased) gastrin levels. Moreover, gastrin is not a significant factor in the formation of gallstones.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe absence of normal enteral stimulation in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition leads to decreased cholecystokinin release, biliary stasis, and increased risk of gallstones. Resection of the ileum can also increase the risk of gallstones due to disruption of normal enterohepatic circulation of bile acids.",
    "zh": "长期全静脉营养(TPN)疗程常常并发胆结石。在正常个体中，脂肪和氨基酸通过肠道进入十二指肠会触发胆囊收缩素(CCK)的释放，从而导致胆囊收缩。接受TPN治疗的患者缺乏正常的肠道刺激，导致CCK释放减少和随后的胆汁淤滞。此外，广泛的 ileum 切除术患者可能破坏胆汁酸的正常肠肝循环，导致胆汁胆固醇溶解不足，从而形成胆固醇结晶。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项B) 晚期肝病由于受损肝细胞的合成能力下降，会损害胆固醇转化为胆汁酸的过程，导致胆汁中胆固醇过度饱和。这导致了肝硬化患者胆结石风险的增加，但对于本例患者来说，由于没有肝细胞功能障碍的证据，这种情况不太可能。\n\n(选项C) TPN制剂含有葡萄糖、氨基酸和脂肪，基于个体患者的需求，并以仔细计算的量添加额外的电解质、维生素、矿物质和微量元素。血清甘油三酯水平可能会在TPN治疗中升高，但TPN不含大量胆固醇，血清胆固醇水平通常不会发生显著变化。\n\n(选项D) TPN中必需脂肪酸补充不足与多种临床并发症有关，包括皮炎、脱发、神经病变、视觉障碍和共济失调。胆结石无关。\n\n(选项E) 胃腔内消化的肽和游离氨基酸是胃泌素释放的主要刺激因素，因此肠外营养通常会导致胃泌素水平降低（而不是升高）。此外，胃泌素不是形成胆结石的重要因素。\n\n教育目标：\n接受全静脉营养的患者缺乏正常的肠道刺激，导致胆囊收缩素释放减少、胆汁淤滞，并增加胆结石的风险。回肠切除术也可能由于破坏胆汁酸的正常肠肝循环而增加胆结石的风险。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology of gallstone formation in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Specifically, it focuses on the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) and biliary stasis in the development of gallstones.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that TPN bypasses normal enteral stimulation, leading to decreased CCK release and subsequent biliary stasis. This stasis promotes the formation of gallstones, especially in the absence of normal enterohepatic circulation of bile acids.",
