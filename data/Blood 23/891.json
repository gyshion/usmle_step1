    "en": "This patient's anemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and indirect hyperbilirubinemia is suggestive of hemolytic anemia. Red cell lysis (ie, hemoglobin release) when incubated in hypotonic saline describes a positive osmotic fragility test, a diagnostic test for HEREDITARY SPHEROCYTOSIS (HS).\n\nHS is the most common form of hemolytic anemia caused by an RBC membrane defect. HS mutations most often affect spectrin and ankyrin (plasma-membrane scaffolding proteins), producing an unstable plasma membrane that loses fragments over time. As a result, the RBCs acquire an inflexible, spheroid shape (ie, spherocytes). Because spherocytes have a decreased surface area/volume ratio, they are more prone to rupture when incubated in hypotonic saline (ie, increased osmotic fragility).\n\nPatients with HS have the classic findings of CHRONIC EXTRAVASCULAR HEMOLYSIS, including anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly (due to increased splenic macrophages and congestion). They are also at risk for pigmented gallstones (due to increased bilirubin precipitating as calcium bilirubinate in the gallbladder) and aplastic crises with parvovirus B19 infection.\n\n(Choice A) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) results in findings similar to those seen in HS (eg, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, elevated LDH, spherocytes). In contrast to HS, patients with AIHA have a positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test and a propensity for developing other autoimmune disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus).\n\n(Choices B and C) The abnormal adhesion of sickled RBCs to the endothelium and the subsequent obstruction of small blood vessels lead to various injuries, including splenic autoinfarction and femoral avascular necrosis. Although sickle cell disease causes hemolysis (eg, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, elevated LDH), a positive osmotic fragility test classically describes HS.\n\n(Choice D) Hemochromatosis (ie, iron overload) is a potential complication of beta-thalassemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis (stimulates iron absorption) and treatment-related blood transfusions. Hemolysis is often less severe in HS, and most patients do not develop iron overload.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hereditary spherocytosis, its pathophysiology related to RBC membrane defects, and the associated complications like pigmented gallstones due to chronic hemolysis. It also assesses the ability to differentiate hereditary spherocytosis from other hemolytic anemias based on laboratory findings like the osmotic fragility test and Coombs test.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the signs of hemolytic anemia (jaundice, splenomegaly, elevated LDH, indirect hyperbilirubinemia).
