    "en": "6 year old boy with extreme sensitivity to sunlight and has developed freckles on his face, neck, and limbs since infancy. On physical examination, the skin in sun-exposed areas is dry and rough with numerous freckles and erythematous macules. There is an ulcerated plaque on the left face; a biopsy reveals squamous cell carcinoma. Further testing leads to a diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum.",
    "zh": "一名6岁男孩，对阳光极度敏感，自婴儿时期以来，面部、颈部和四肢出现雀斑。体格检查显示，暴露在阳光下的皮肤干燥粗糙，有大量雀斑和红斑性斑疹。左侧面部有一处溃疡斑块；活检显示鳞状细胞癌。进一步检查确诊为色素性干皮病。"

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient has xeroderma pigmentosum, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defects in NUCLEOTIDE EXCISION REPAIR. DNA can be damaged by ULTRAVIOLET rays, leading to formation of THYMINE DIMERS between 2 adjacent thymine residues. These thymine dimers are repaired by UV-SPECIFIC ENDONUCLEASE, an enzyme that is frequently deficient in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum.",
    "zh": "该患者患有色素性干皮病，这是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是核苷酸切除修复缺陷。DNA 可被紫外线损伤，导致两个相邻的胸腺嘧啶残基之间形成胸腺嘧啶二聚体。这些胸腺嘧啶二聚体由 UV 特异性内切核酸酶修复，这种酶在色素性干皮病患者中经常缺乏。"

    "en": "1) Xeroderma pigmentosum is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective nucleotide excision repair often caused by a deficiency in UV-specific endonuclease. 2) Recognize the clinical presentation of xeroderma pigmentosum and associate it with a defect in nucleotide excision repair, specifically the UV-specific endonuclease.",
    "zh": "1) 色素性干皮病是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是核苷酸切除修复缺陷，通常由 UV 特异性内切核酸酶缺乏引起。 2) 认识色素性干皮病的临床表现，并将其与核苷酸切除修复缺陷，特别是 UV 特异性内切核酸酶的缺陷联系起来。"
