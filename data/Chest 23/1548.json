  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Mucociliary clearance is responsible for removing the vast majority of inhaled particles that lodge within the bronchial tree. Ciliated mucosal epithelium {{exhibit_1}} lines the pulmonary airways from the trachea to the proximal portions of the respiratory bronchioles. Mucus and fluid secreted onto this epithelial surface act to trap particles suspended in the inspired air. The trapped particles are constantly swept upward from the bronchioles toward the pharynx by cilia that collectively beat in the direction of the pharynx. The mucus and debris are then swallowed or expectorated upon reaching the pharynx.\n\nThe terminal bronchioles are covered by ciliated cuboidal epithelium and club cells, which help with mucociliary clearance in this region.\n\n(Choice B) Goblet cells are mucus-secreting cells that are interspersed throughout the respiratory mucosa from the trachea down to the larger bronchioles. However, they are not found within the terminal bronchioles. This region is lined by a surfactant-containing fluid secreted by club cells that is continuous with the more proximal mucous layer.\n\n(Choice C) Clearance of particles that lodge distal to the terminal bronchioles is dependent on phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages. These cells can destroy some inhaled particles (eg, bacteria) by lysosomal degradation. Nondigestible material must be transported by macrophages to the pulmonary lymphatics or to the terminal bronchioles (for clearance by the mucociliary system).\n\n(Choice D) Submucosal mucous and mucoserous glands help form the mucous layer in the larger airways. They are found within the trachea and bronchi but not in the bronchioles.\n\n(Choices E and F) Type I and type II pneumocytes line the alveolar ducts and alveoli. Type I pneumocytes are thin cells stretched across the alveolar wall that mediate gas exchange. Type II pneumocytes produce surfactant and divide and differentiate into type I pneumocytes to replace damaged cells.",
    "zh": "黏液纤毛清除负责清除滞留在支气管树内的绝大多数吸入颗粒。纤毛黏膜上皮{{exhibit_1}}覆盖肺部气道，从气管延伸到呼吸性细支气管的近端部分。分泌到该上皮表面的黏液和液体起到捕获吸入空气中悬浮颗粒的作用。通过纤毛的共同摆动，将捕获的颗粒不断从细支气管向上扫向咽部，纤毛共同朝向咽部的方向摆动。当到达咽部后，黏液和碎片被吞咽或咳出。\n\n末端细支气管被纤毛立方上皮细胞和Clara细胞覆盖，这有助于该区域的黏液纤毛清除。\n\n(选项B) 杯状细胞是分泌黏液的细胞，散布于从气管到较大细支气管的呼吸黏膜中。然而，它们不存在于末端细支气管内。该区域衬有Clara细胞分泌的含表面活性剂的液体，该液体与更近端的黏液层相连。\n\n(选项C) 清除滞留在末端细支气管远端的颗粒依赖于肺泡巨噬细胞的吞噬作用。这些细胞可以通过溶酶体降解来破坏一些吸入的颗粒（例如，细菌）。不可消化的物质必须由巨噬细胞输送到肺淋巴管或末端细支气管（通过黏液纤毛系统清除）。\n\n(选项D) 黏膜下黏液腺和黏液浆液腺有助于形成较大气道中的黏液层。它们存在于气管和支气管内，但不在细支气管中。\n\n(选项E和F) I型和II型肺细胞覆盖肺泡导管和肺泡。I型肺细胞是伸展在肺泡壁上的薄细胞，介导气体交换。II型肺细胞产生表面活性剂，并分裂和分化成I型肺细胞以替换受损细胞。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mucociliary clearance mechanism in the respiratory system and the role of ciliated cells in removing inhaled particles from the airways.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that mucociliary clearance, facilitated by ciliated cells, is the primary mechanism for removing particles from the bronchial tree, especially in the proximal airways and terminal bronchioles.",
