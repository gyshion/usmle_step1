    "en": "This professional athlete most likely has the cardiovascular adaptations of athlete's heart. The soft systolic murmur with intensive endurance training is a pulmonic flow murmur, a common finding due to the high stroke volume that develops with intensive endurance training.\n\nThe adaptations of athlete's heart differ depending on whether intensive endurance training (eg, long-distance running) or resistance training (eg, heavy weightlifting) is pursued. With endurance training, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is reduced (due to vasodilation in skeletal muscle) and blood volume is increased, leading to increased left ventricular (LV) volume load. To compensate, LV eccentric hypertrophy (ie, LV wall lengthening) develops, which increases LV cavity size to increase diastolic filling capacity and facilitate increased stroke volume and cardiac output. Right ventricular (RV) cavity enlargement also takes place to increase diastolic filling and accommodate the increase in cardiac output; because the right ventricle and left ventricle are arranged in series and contract at the same rate, RV stroke volume must increase to match LV stroke volume and prevent backup of blood flow.\n\nAn increase in stroke volume is maintained at rest and allows for adequate cardiac output at low resting heart rate (eg, <55/min). The anterior location of the pulmonic valve and slightly smaller valve area compared to the aortic valve often create a pulmonic flow murmur due to the high stroke volume. The murmur is best heard at the left second intercostal space in the supine position and may disappear when venous return is decreased with standing.\n\n(Choice A) Pulmonary vascular capacitance is increased with endurance training, allowing the pulmonary circulation to accommodate high flow while minimizing the afterload on the right ventricle.\n\n(Choice B) Baseline vagal tone is increased with endurance training, facilitating low resting heart rate.\n\n(Choices D and E) Intensive resistance training increases SVR during exercise (due to vascular compression by vigorously contracting muscles), which increases LV pressure load and leads to mild concentric hypertrophy (ie, LV wall thickening). Unlike pathologic concentric LV hypertrophy, the LV cavity remains normal in size and diastolic function is maintained. LV stroke volume and ejection fraction remain normal or are slightly increased, and the right ventricle is unaffected. A flow murmur is not expected.\n\nEducational objective: Intensive endurance training causes cavity enlargement of both the left ventricle and right ventricle to facilitate an increase in stroke volume and cardiac output. The high stroke volume may cause a pulmonic valve flow murmur.",
    "zh": "这位职业运动员很可能患有运动员心脏的心血管适应症。高强度耐力训练下的柔和收缩期杂音是一种肺动脉血流杂音，这是由于高强度耐力训练所产生的高每搏输出量而常见的发现。\n\n运动员心脏的适应取决于进行的是高强度耐力训练（例如长跑）还是力量训练（例如举重）。在耐力训练中，全身血管阻力（SVR）降低（由于骨骼肌血管舒张），血容量增加，导致左心室（LV）容量负荷增加。为了代偿，LV向心性肥大（即LV壁延长）发展，这增加了LV腔的尺寸，以增加舒张充盈能力并促进每搏输出量和心输出量的增加。右心室（RV）腔增大也会发生，以增加舒张充盈并适应心输出量的增加；因为右心室和左心室串联排列并以相同的速率收缩，RV每搏输出量必须增加以匹配LV每搏输出量，并防止血流回流。\n\n静息时每搏输出量的增加得以维持，并允许在低静息心率下（例如<55次/分）有足够的心输出量。肺动脉瓣的前部位置和与主动脉瓣相比稍小的瓣膜面积，常常由于高每搏输出量而产生肺动脉血流杂音。杂音在仰卧位时于左侧第二肋间隙听诊最为清晰，当静脉回流因站立而减少时可能会消失。\n\n（选项A）耐力训练可增加肺血管容量，使肺循环能够适应高血流量，同时最大限度地减少右心室的后负荷。\n\n（选项B）耐力训练可增加基线迷走神经张力，促进低静息心率。\n\n（选项D和E）高强度力量训练在运动过程中增加SVR（由于剧烈收缩的肌肉对血管的压迫），这会增加LV压力负荷并导致轻度向心性肥大（即LV壁增厚）。与病理性向心性LV肥大不同，LV腔的大小保持正常，并且舒张功能得以维持。LV每搏输出量和射血分数保持正常或略有增加，并且右心室不受影响。预计不会出现血流杂音。\n\n教育目标：高强度耐力训练导致左心室和右心室腔增大，以促进每搏输出量和心输出量的增加。高每搏输出量可能导致肺动脉瓣血流杂音。"
