    "en": "A 58-year-old homeless man is brought to the emergency department after being found unresponsive on a sidewalk. The patient has been hospitalized on several occasions for alcohol and illicit drug intoxication. He also has a history of hypertension but is not adherent with medical therapy. On arrival, the patient is obtunded, febrile, and hypotensive. Physical examination reveals lung crackles and a new blowing diastolic murmur consistent with aortic regurgitation. Appropriate treatment is started, but the patient dies several days later. Autopsy examination shows symmetric, bilateral wedge-shaped strips of necrosis over the cerebral convexity, parallel and a few centimeters lateral to the interhemispheric cerebral fissure. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's cerebral findings?",

    "en": "This patient's autopsy findings of symmetric, bilateral wedge-shaped strips of necrosis over the cerebral convexity, parallel and a few centimeters lateral to the interhemispheric cerebral fissure, are characteristic of watershed infarcts. Watershed infarcts occur in areas of the brain that are supplied by the distal branches of major arteries and are particularly vulnerable to hypoperfusion. \n\nProfound systemic hypotension (eg, cardiogenic shock, cardiopulmonary arrest) diminishes blood supply to the entire brain, resulting in neuron cell death in areas that are vulnerable to hypoxia. This includes brain regions with high metabolic demand (eg, hippocampus, cerebellar Purkinje cells) and areas supplied by the distal-most branches of cerebral arteries (watershed zones). These border zones are located between areas supplied by the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries and are vulnerable because of low baseline perfusion pressure. The resulting necrosis occurs in bilateral, wedge-shaped strips that can extend from the frontal to occipital lobe and are located parallel and a few centimeters lateral to the interhemispheric fissure. \n\n(Choice A) Cerebral amyloid angiopathy typically affects patients over the age of 70 and results in lobar hemorrhages (eg, occipital, parietal) rather than ischemia. Amyloidosis can also cause cardiomyopathy, although patients typically develop right-sided heart failure (eg, edema, ascites) rather than valvular insufficiency. \n\n(Choice B) Although infectious endocarditis frequently causes embolization of bacterial vegetations, cardiac embolism would likely cause multiple scattered infarcts in an asymmetric pattern within different major vascular territories (eg, middle and anterior cerebral artery). This patient's symmetric, bilateral infarcts correspond to the cortical watershed regions and are more suggestive of global cerebral ischemia. \n\n(Choice D) Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms form as a result of chronic hypertension, and a rupture causes intracerebral hemorrhage typically involving deep brain structures (eg, basal ganglia, cerebellar nuclei, thalamus, pons). \n\n(Choice E) Saccular aneurysms, which occur at areas of weakness in cerebral arteries, typically cause subarachnoid hemorrhage after a rupture rather than cerebral ischemia. Patients usually have sudden-onset severe (thunderclap) headache and meningismus.\n\nEducational objective:\nSustained cerebral hypoperfusion (eg, hypotension, shock) may cause global cerebral ischemia and watershed infarction. These watershed zones are located at the borders between areas perfused by the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries and typically appear as symmetric, bilateral wedge-shaped strips of necrosis over the cerebral convexity, parallel and adjacent to the interhemispheric fissure.",
    "zh": "该患者的尸检结果显示，大脑凸面出现对称的、双侧楔形坏死带，与大脑半球间裂平行，并在其外侧几厘米处，这是分水岭梗死的特征。分水岭梗死发生在大脑中由主要动脉的远端分支供血的区域，并且特别容易受到低灌注的影响。\n\n严重的全身性低血压（例如，心源性休克，心肺骤停）会减少整个大脑的血液供应，导致易于缺氧的区域的神经元细胞死亡。这包括代谢需求高的脑区（例如，海马体、小脑浦肯野细胞）以及由脑动脉最远端分支供血的区域（分水岭区域）。这些边界区位于由大脑前动脉、中动脉和后动脉供血的区域之间，并且由于基线灌注压力低而容易受到影响。由此产生的坏死发生在双侧的楔形带中，可以从额叶延伸到枕叶，并且与大脑半球间裂平行且相邻。\n\n(选项A) 脑淀粉样血管病通常影响70岁以上的患者，并导致叶间出血（例如，枕叶、顶叶），而不是缺血。淀粉样变性也可引起心肌病，尽管患者通常会发生右心衰竭（例如，水肿、腹水），而不是瓣膜功能不全。\n\n(选项B) 尽管感染性心内膜炎经常导致细菌赘生物栓塞，但心脏栓塞可能会导致在不同主要血管区域（例如，大脑中动脉和前动脉）内出现多个不对称分布的散在梗死。该患者的对称性双侧梗死与皮质分水岭区域相对应，并且更提示为全脑缺血。\n\n(选项D) Charcot-Bouchard动脉瘤是慢性高血压的结果，破裂会导致脑内出血，通常涉及深部脑结构（例如，基底神经节、小脑核、丘脑、脑桥）。\n\n(选项E) 动脉壁薄弱部位发生的囊状动脉瘤，破裂后通常会导致蛛网膜下腔出血，而不是脑缺血。患者通常会突然出现剧烈（雷击样）头痛和脑膜刺激征。\n\n教育目标：\n持续的脑低灌注（例如，低血压、休克）可引起全脑缺血和分水岭梗死。这些分水岭区域位于由大脑前动脉、中动脉和后动脉灌注的区域的边界处，并且通常表现为大脑凸面上对称的、双侧楔形坏死带，与大脑半球间裂平行且相邻。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of watershed infarcts, which result from global cerebral hypoperfusion. It requires correlating autopsy findings with potential underlying causes.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recognize the characteristic pattern of watershed infarcts described in the autopsy findings and link it to conditions causing generalized reduction in cerebral perfusion, such as severe hypotension or shock. Evaluating the differential diagnoses based on the pattern and location of the infarcts is crucial.",
