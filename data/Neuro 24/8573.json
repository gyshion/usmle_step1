During the past 3 months, the patient has made numerous trips between the United States and France. He frequently experiences insomnia and daytime sleepiness for several days after he travels, but his sleep improves significantly thereafter.",

    "en": "This patient is experiencing jet lag, a syndrome associated with long flights that cross several time zones. Jet lag is caused by DYSYNCHRONY between the body's CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS (ie, internal 24-hour sleep/wake clock) and the local environment (eg, daylight hours, work schedule). Symptoms include insomnia, daytime drowsiness, decreased work performance, gastrointestinal issues, and generalized malaise.\n\nCircadian rhythms are maintained by the SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS (SCN), which receives input from the retina and sends projections to other hypothalamic nuclei and the pineal gland. The SCN functions primarily to modulate behavior (eg, alertness) and diurnal variations in body temperature and hormone production (eg, cortisol, melatonin). In contrast, cortisol peaks in the morning and reaches its lowest level at night.\n\nIn patients with jet lag, the normal variations in light exposure at the destination are able to RESYNCHRONIZE the body clock to coincide with the local environment over the course of several days. EASTWARD TRAVEL takes longer to recover from than westward travel because it is easier to lengthen the circadian rhythm than to shorten it. Treatment with specifically-timed LIGHT EXPOSURE or MELATONIN administration can help reduce the adjustment period.\n\nThe table shows the major functions of hypothalamic nuclei. The VENTROMEDIAL nucleus mediates satiety, the LATERAL nucleus mediates hunger, the ANTERIOR nucleus mediates heat dissipation, and the POSTERIOR nucleus mediates heat conservation. The SUPRAOPTIC nucleus is involved with ADH and oxytocin, and the SUPRACHIASMATIC nucleus regulates circadian rhythms. Therefore, the suprachiasmatic nucleus is most likely responsible for the patient's symptoms of jet lag.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe suprachiasmatic nucleus regulates circadian rhythms by processing light clues in the environment to modulate alertness, body temperature, and production of hormones (eg, cortisol, melatonin). Dyssynchrony between the local environment (eg, daylight hours, work schedules) and internal circadian rhythm can cause insomnia and daytime sleepiness (ie, jet lag).",
    "zh": "该患者正在经历时差反应，这是一种与跨越多个时区的长途飞行相关的综合征。时差反应是由身体的昼夜节律（即，内部24小时睡眠/觉醒时钟）与当地环境（例如，日光时间，工作安排）之间的节律失调引起的。症状包括失眠、白天嗜睡、工作效率下降、胃肠道问题和全身不适。\n\n昼夜节律由视交叉上核（SCN）维持，该核团接收来自视网膜的输入，并将投射发送到其他下丘脑核团和松果体。SCN的主要功能是调节行为（例如，警觉性）和体温和激素产生的昼夜变化（例如，皮质醇，褪黑激素）。相反，皮质醇在早晨达到峰值，在夜间达到最低水平。\n\n在患有时差反应的患者中，目的地正常的日光照射变化能够在几天内使生物钟与当地环境同步。向东旅行比向西旅行需要更长的恢复时间，因为延长昼夜节律比缩短它更容易。通过特定时间的日光照射或褪黑激素给药治疗可以帮助缩短调整期。\n\n该表显示了下丘脑核团的主要功能。腹内侧核介导饱腹感，外侧核介导饥饿，前核介导散热，后核介导热量保存。视上核与ADH和催产素有关，视交叉上核调节昼夜节律。因此，视交叉上核最有可能导致患者的时差反应症状。\n\n教育目标：\n视交叉上核通过处理环境中的光线线索来调节昼夜节律，从而调节警觉性、体温和激素（例如，皮质醇，褪黑激素）的产生。当地环境（例如，日光时间，工作安排）与内部昼夜节律之间的节律失调会导致失眠和白天嗜睡（即，时差反应）。"
