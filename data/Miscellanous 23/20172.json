    "en": "A 72-year-old man is found to have pleural effusions on chest CT scan. One year ago, he was diagnosed with advanced unresectable adenocarcinoma of the colon, which has progressed despite treatment. Blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg and pulse is 92/min. On physical examination, the patient is cachectic. Neck veins are flat and the trachea is central. Lung auscultation reveals bibasilar decreased breath sounds with no lung crackles. Heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is scaphoid with no tenderness. There is bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Chest imaging reveals bilateral small to moderate sized pleural effusions. Thoracentesis yields straw-colored fluid; laboratory results are as follows:\n\nLeukocytes 100/mm³ (80% monocytes)\nProtein 1.1 g/dL\nLactate dehydrogenase 20 U/L",

    "en": "Differentiating transudative effusion from exudative effusion is a key step in determining the etiology of pleural effusion. Transudative effusions result from changes in vascular hydrostatic or oncotic pressure, whereas exudative effusions most commonly result from an inflammatory increase in vascular membrane permeability; the pleural fluid Light criteria is used to differentiate the two.\n\nExudative effusions meet ≥1 of the Light criteria; if none of the criteria are met, the effusion is transudative. The very low protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in this patient's pleural fluid is consistent with transudate. Normal-appearing, straw-colored fluid and normal pleural fluid leukocyte differential (ie, mostly monocytes) suggest an absence of inflammation and are also consistent with transudate.\n\nThis patient's advanced malignancy has caused cachexia, which commonly leads to weight loss (eg, scaphoid abdomen) and malnutrition with hypoalbuminemia. Accordingly, this patient's transudative effusion is most likely due to low plasma oncotic pressure, which is also responsible for the bilateral pitting edema.\n\n(Choice A) Bacterial infection of the pleural space occurs with a complicated parapneumonic effusion, which is exudative by Light criteria and typically demonstrates a neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis.\n\n(Choice C) Increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure is the primary mechanism of pleural effusion in patients with decompensated heart failure. Although the effusion is transudative, heart failure is less likely in this patient with flat neck veins and no crackles on lung auscultation.\n\n(Choice D) Malignant cells that have metastasized to the pleural space can block parietal pleural lymphatics, preventing pleural fluid reabsorption. However, malignant pleural involvement typically causes exudative effusion due to associated inflammation and tissue disruption (often with bloody-appearing pleural fluid). In addition, pleural effusion secondary to the spread of colon cancer is relatively uncommon; lung cancer, lymphoma, and breast cancer are the most common causes of malignant pleural invasion.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe Light criteria is used to differentiate transudative effusion from exudative effusion. Transudative effusions result from changes in hydrostatic or oncotic pressure (eg, low vascular oncotic pressure due to hypoalbuminemia) and are characterized by low pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations as well as a normal, monocyte-predominant leukocyte differential.",
    "zh": "区分漏出液和渗出液是确定胸腔积液病因的关键步骤。漏出液是由血管静水压或胶体渗透压的变化引起的，而渗出液最常见的是由血管膜通透性炎症性增加引起的；使用胸腔积液Light标准来区分这两种情况。\n\n渗出液符合Light标准中的≥1项；如果未满足任何标准，则积液为漏出液。该患者胸腔积液中非常低的蛋白和乳酸脱氢酶（LDH）水平与漏出液一致。外观正常的淡黄色液体和正常的胸腔积液白细胞计数（即，主要为单核细胞）表明没有炎症，也与漏出液一致。\n\n该患者的晚期恶性肿瘤已导致恶病质，通常会导致体重减轻（如，舟状腹）和营养不良伴低白蛋白血症。因此，该患者的漏出液最可能是由于血浆胶体渗透压低所致，这亦是导致双侧凹陷性水肿的原因。\n\n（选项A）胸膜腔细菌感染发生于并发性副肺炎积液，根据Light标准，此情况为渗出液，通常表现为中性粒细胞为主的白细胞增多。\n\n（选项C）肺毛细血管静水压升高是失代偿性心力衰竭患者胸腔积液的主要机制。尽管积液为漏出液，但该患者颈静脉平坦且肺部听诊无啰音，心力衰竭的可能性较小。\n\n（选项D）已转移至胸膜腔的恶性细胞可以阻塞壁层胸膜淋巴管，阻止胸腔积液的再吸收。然而，恶性胸膜受累通常由于相关的炎症和组织破坏（常伴有血性胸腔积液）而导致渗出液。此外，继发于结肠癌扩散的胸腔积液相对不常见；肺癌、淋巴瘤和乳腺癌是恶性胸膜浸润最常见的原因。\n\n教育目标：\n使用Light标准来区分漏出液和渗出液。漏出液是由静水压或胶体渗透压的变化引起的（如，由于低白蛋白血症引起的低血管胶体渗透压），其特征是胸腔积液蛋白和乳酸脱氢酶浓度低，以及正常的、单核细胞为主的白细胞计数。"

It requires applying the Light criteria and considering the clinical presentation to determine the underlying cause of the pleural effusions.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first analyze the pleural fluid laboratory results in conjunction with the clinical vignette to classify the effusion as transudative or exudative. Then, by considering the patient's history of malignancy, cachexia, and physical examination findings, the most likely cause of the transudative effusion should be identified from the given options.",
