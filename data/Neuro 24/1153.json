The headaches have been occurring daily for the past 6 weeks and wake him from sleep. MRI reveals a tumor in the cerebellum.

    "en": "The correct answer is E. Pilocytic astrocytoma (PCA) is the most common pediatric brain tumor and typically arises in the cerebellum. {{exhibit_2}} Histopathologic findings often include a well-differentiated neoplasm composed of cells with hair-like processes that stain positively for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), indicative of glial lineage. Eosinophilic corkscrew-shaped (Rosenthal fibers) and eosinophilic granular bodies are frequently present. {{exhibit_3}} The patient's presentation of nausea, vomiting, headache, ataxia, and vision disturbances is consistent with a posterior fossa mass. \n\n(Choice A) Ependymomas often arise near the ventricular system and may also cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, and ataxia. However, histopathologic examination typically shows ependymal cells arranged around a central blood vessel (ie, perivascular pseudorosette). {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choice B) Glioblastomas are malignant glial tumors that occur most often in adults. They are often located in the cerebral hemispheres and may cross the corpus callosum. They are composed of atypical (eg, pleomorphic, hyperchromatic) astrocytes that often accumulate around regions of necrosis (ie, pseudopalading). Microvascular proliferation is also commonly present. {{exhibit_5}}\n\n(Choice C) Medulloblastomas, another common pediatric brain tumor, also primarily arise within the cerebellum. However, histopathologic examination often shows small, round, blue tumor cells that may be arranged around a central core of neuropil (ie, fibrillary material containing neuronal processes), forming Homer-Wright rosettes.\n\n(Choice D) Neuroblastomas, the third most common childhood cancer after leukemia and CNS tumors, are embryonal neuroendocrine tumors typically found in the adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia. Histopathologic examination often shows small, round, blue tumor cells that can form Homer-Wright rosettes.\n\nEducational objective:\nPilocyctic astrocytoma is the most common pediatric brain tumor and is typically found in the cerebellum. Histopathologic findings often include a well-differentiated neoplasm composed of cells with hair-like processes that stain positively for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Eosinophilic corkscrew-shaped (Rosenthal) fibers and eosinophilic granular bodies are frequently present.",

    "en": "This question tests the ability to diagnose a pediatric brain tumor based on clinical presentation, imaging findings (implied by MRI), and characteristic histopathological features. It requires differentiating between common pediatric central nervous system neoplasms.\n\nTo solve this question, one must correlate the patient's symptoms (headache, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, vision disturbances) with the location of the tumor (cerebellum) and then match the specific histopathological description (hair-like glial processes, eosinophilic corkscrew-shaped fibers, granular bodies) to the correct tumor type.",
