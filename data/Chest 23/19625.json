The patient was admitted to the hospital 3 months ago after a nonfatal drowning event that resulted in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated for 1 week and then discharged 2 weeks later. The patient currently feels well and reports mild dyspnea with exertion.",

    "en": "{{exhibit_1}}\nARDS (eg, aspiration of water) or intense systemic inflammation (eg, sepsis, pancreatitis). ARDS has a mortality rate of approximately 40%; those who survive often have reduced lung function that persists for months or years and is sometimes permanent.\n\nThe pathogenesis of ARDS can progress through 3 phases, although most patients move through only the first 2. The exudative phase (phase 1) involves inflammatory disruption of the alveolar-capillary membrane with leakage of protein-rich fluid from the alveolar capillaries into the alveoli and surrounding interstitium. Gas exchange is acutely impaired by alveolar edema and by hyaline membranes that develop on the alveolar surface. After 1–2 weeks, ARDS progresses to the proliferative phase (phase 2), during which endothelial cells, pneumocytes, and fibroblasts proliferate in an attempt to repair damage. Collagen is deposited in the interstitium and may lead to scarring.\n\nThe majority of ARDS survivors have a persistent reduction in diffusion capacity that eventually normalizes after several years (Choice B). These patients may remain in a prolonged proliferative phase in which interstitial collagen deposition and remodeling impair gas diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane, causing an increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient that manifests clinically with mild dyspnea. A small percentage of surviving patients likely enter and remain in the fibrotic phase (phase 3) of ARDS, during which severe interstitial fibrosis develops and manifests as an irreversible reduction in diffusion capacity with marked clinical symptoms (eg, severe dyspnea).\n\n(Choices C and E) Collagen deposition during recovery from ARDS typically leads to decreased lung compliance, which in some patients manifests as a restrictive defect with reductions in both forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 second on pulmonary function testing. The reductions in expiratory lung volumes typically normalize within 6 months.\n\n(Choice D) The pulmonary edema in ARDS is noncardiogenic, meaning it does not result from heart failure and involves normal left atrial pressure (estimated by pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) during both the acute disease and recovery.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the long-term pulmonary sequelae of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in children, specifically focusing on changes in lung function parameters. It requires understanding the pathophysiology of ARDS and its impact on gas exchange and lung mechanics.\n\nThe best approach is to consider the typical changes that occur in the lungs following ARDS, such as fibrosis and impaired gas exchange. Then, evaluate how these changes would affect parameters like alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, diffusion capacity, lung compliance, and lung volumes.",
