    "en": "A 30-year-old man with a history of epilepsy comes to the office for follow-up. He has a history of recurrent seizures that start as jerky, rhythmic movements of his left leg and gradually spread to involve the entire left side of his body. The patient frequently loses consciousness and has been witnessed to have a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Neuroimaging has revealed a focal lesion in the right motor area. He has been treated with several antiepilepsy drugs, but his seizures have remained poorly controlled. Surgery is performed to remove the lesion, and the excised brain tissue shows a 1.5-cm mass composed of engorged purplish clusters. Microscopy shows numerous dilated capillaries with an endothelial lining separated by a thin layer of fibrous connective tissue.",
    "zh": "一名有癫痫病史的30岁男性前来就诊复查。他有反复发作的癫痫病史，癫痫发作始于左腿的抽搐、节律性运动，并逐渐蔓延到身体的整个左侧。患者经常失去意识，并且有人目睹其发生全面强直-阵挛性癫痫发作。神经影像学检查显示右侧运动区存在局灶性病变。他接受了几种抗癫痫药物治疗，但癫痫发作仍然难以控制。进行了手术切除病变，切除的脑组织显示一个1.5厘米的肿块，由充血的紫色簇组成。显微镜下可见许多扩张的毛细血管，毛细血管内皮细胞衬里被一层薄的纤维结缔组织分隔。"

    "en": "Cerebral cavernous hemangioma {{exhibit_1}}\nas the liver and brain. Gross examination of hemangiomas reveals a \"mulberry-like\" appearance due to their purple vascular clusters. Histologically, they are composed of abnormal, dilated blood vessels with a thin adventitia lacking elastic fibers and smooth muscle. The reduced structural support gives them a tendency to leak, causing recurrent hemorrhage.\n\nMost patients with cavernous hemangiomas are asymptomatic, although hemangiomas in the brain may cause neurologic deficits and seizures due to compression of the surrounding tissue and irritation from recurrent bleeding. Surgical resection is indicated for lesions causing intractable epilepsy or progressive neurologic deficits.\n\n(Choice B) Ependymoma is a rare central nervous system tumor typically found intracranially in children and in the spinal cord in adults. The tumor cells may arrange themselves around blood vessels and form intervening processes, a histological appearance called perivascular pseudorosettes.\n\n(Choice C) Glioblastoma is a common and aggressive brain tumor characterized histologically by areas of necrosis surrounded by tumor cells (pseudopalisading necrosis).\n\n(Choice D) Kaposi sarcoma is a tumor that results from infection with human herpesvirus 8. It typically manifests as skin nodules but can also affect the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Microscopic evaluation reveals highly vascular tissue containing elongated spindle cells {{exhibit_2}}.\n\n(Choice E) Saccular (berry) aneurysms are vascular outpouchings composed of a thickened intima due to myointimal hyperplasia with a stretched adventitial layer. They occur as a result of congenital blood vessel weakness and are found most commonly in the circle of Willis. Intracranial aneurysms are typically asymptomatic unless they rupture.\n\nEducational objective:\nCavernous hemangiomas are vascular malformations composed of abnormally dilated capillaries separated by thin connective tissue septa. The lack of structural support gives them a tendency to bleed, and those that occur in the brain can present with neurologic deficits and seizures.",
    "zh": "脑海绵状血管瘤 {{exhibit_1}}，类似于肝脏和大脑。肉眼检查血管瘤显示“桑葚状”外观，这归因于其紫色的血管簇。组织学上，它们由异常扩张的血管组成，其薄外膜缺乏弹性纤维和平滑肌。结构支撑的减少使它们倾向于渗漏，从而导致反复出血。\n\n大多数海绵状血管瘤患者无症状，尽管脑部血管瘤可能由于压迫周围组织和反复出血引起的刺激而导致神经功能缺损和癫痫发作。对于引起顽固性癫痫或进行性神经功能缺损的病变，需要手术切除。\n\n(选项 B) 室管膜瘤是一种罕见的中枢神经系统肿瘤，通常在儿童颅内和成人的脊髓中发现。肿瘤细胞可能围绕血管排列并形成介入过程，这种组织学表现称为血管周围假菊形团。\n\n(选项 C) 胶质母细胞瘤是一种常见的侵袭性脑肿瘤，其组织学特征是坏死区域被肿瘤细胞包围（假栅栏状坏死）。\n\n(选项 D) 卡波西肉瘤是一种由人类疱疹病毒 8 型感染引起的肿瘤。它通常表现为皮肤结节，但也可能影响胃肠道和呼吸道。显微镜评估显示高度血管化的组织，包含细长的梭形细胞 {{exhibit_2}}。\n\n(选项 E) 囊状（浆果状）动脉瘤是血管外鼓，由内膜增厚引起，是由于内膜肌层增生伴有外膜层伸展所致。它们是先天性血管薄弱的结果，最常见于Willis环。脑内动脉瘤通常无症状，除非破裂。\n\n教育目标：\n海绵状血管瘤是血管畸形，由异常扩张的毛细血管组成，被薄的结缔组织间隔分隔。缺乏结构支撑使它们有出血倾向，发生在脑中的那些血管瘤可表现为神经功能缺损和癫痫发作。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the presentation, histology, and pathophysiology of cavernous hemangiomas, a type of vascular malformation that can cause seizures and neurological deficits. It also requires differentiating cavernous hemangiomas from other brain lesions such as ependymomas, glioblastomas, Kaposi sarcoma, and saccular aneurysms.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key histological findings of dilated capillaries with thin connective tissue septa and the clinical presentation of recurrent seizures. Eliminate options that do not match the described histology or clinical context. Consider the \"mulberry-like\" appearance as a key feature of cavernous hemangiomas.",
