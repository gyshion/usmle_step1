    "en": "A 46-year-old woman comes to the office due to dysphagia. The patient has had difficulty swallowing both liquids and solid foods as well as frequent episodes of regurgitation and cough while eating. She has also had weakness in her extremities and a rash. The patient has no prior medical problems and takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows an erythematous eruption on the upper eyelids. The oropharynx is clear and cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. She has difficulty lifting her arms above her head and standing from a sitting position.",
    "zh": "一名46岁的女性因吞咽困难前来就诊。患者既往有吞咽液体和固体食物困难的病史，以及进食时频繁反流和咳嗽。她也有肢体无力和皮疹。患者既往无任何医疗问题，且未服用任何药物。生命体征在正常范围内。体格检查显示上眼睑出现红斑。口咽部清晰，心肺和腹部检查无特殊发现。她难以将手臂举过头顶，也难以从坐姿站立。"

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has painless proximal muscle weakness, in association with the heliotrope rash on her eyelids, this presentation is consistent with dermatomyositis, an inflammatory myopathy that primarily affects striated muscle and skin. Diagnostic findings include elevated muscle enzymes (eg, creatinine kinase) and positive autoantibodies (ie, antinuclear antibody [high sensitivity, low specificity], anti-Jo-1 [low sensitivity, high specificity]). Muscle biopsy in dermatomyositis shows perimysial inflammatory infiltrates and atrophy involving the fibers around the periphery of muscle fascicles (perifascicular atrophy).\n\nThe oropharynx and upper esophagus also contain skeletal muscle that can be affected in dermatomyositis and polymyositis, leading to dysphagia and pulmonary aspiration. Other important complications of inflammatory myopathies include interstitial lung disease and myocarditis (due to involvement of striated cardiac muscle).\n\n(Choice A) Progressive systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) commonly affects the esophagus, leading to atrophy and fibrous replacement of the distal esophageal muscularis propria. Clinical features include dysphagia, reflux esophagitis, and aspiration. However, the dermal manifestations include sclerodactyly, digital ulcers, and calcinosis cutis, rather than a heliotrope rash. Also, dermatomyositis affects only the striated muscle in the oropharynx and upper esophagus (eg, choking, aspiration); whereas scleroderma can affect the lower esophagus.\n\n(Choice B) Eosinophilic esophagitis typically presents with dysphagia, epigastric pain, recurrent esophageal reflux, and food impaction. Skin rash and extremity weakness would be unexpected.\n\n(Choice C) Achalasia is caused by inflammation and degeneration of the esophageal myenteric plexus, resulting in impaired relaxation of the smooth muscle in the distal esophagus and lower esophageal sphincter. It typically presents with dysphagia, regurgitation, and heartburn but is not associated with rash or skeletal muscle weakness.\n\n(Choice D) Zenker diverticulum develops immediately above the upper esophageal sphincter, with posterior mucosal herniation between the fibers of the cricopharyngeus muscle. Although it presents with dysphagia, regurgitation, and aspiration, it is not associated with rash or muscular weakness.\n\nEducational objective:\nDermatomyositis is characterized by proximal muscle weakness resembling polymyositis, with additional inflammatory features affecting the skin (eg, heliotrope rash, Gottron papules). In both conditions, involvement of striated muscle in the oropharynx and heart can lead to dysphagia, pulmonary aspiration, and myocarditis.",
    "zh": "该患者出现无痛性近端肌无力，并伴有眼睑的向日葵皮疹，这种表现与皮肌炎一致，皮肌炎是一种主要影响横纹肌和皮肤的炎症性肌病。诊断结果包括肌肉酶升高（例如，肌酸激酶）和自身抗体阳性（即，抗核抗体[高敏感性，低特异性]，抗Jo-1抗体[低敏感性，高特异性]）。皮肌炎的肌肉活检显示肌束周围的炎性浸润和萎缩，涉及肌束周边的纤维（周围束萎缩）。\n\n口咽部和上食管也含有骨骼肌，这些肌肉可能受皮肌炎和多发性肌炎的影响，导致吞咽困难和肺部吸入。炎性肌病的其他重要并发症包括间质性肺病和心肌炎（由于累及横纹肌）。\n\n（选项A）进行性系统性硬化症（硬皮病）常影响食管，导致远端食管肌层固有层的萎缩和纤维替代。临床特征包括吞咽困难、反流性食管炎和吸入。然而，皮肤表现包括硬指症、指尖溃疡和皮肤钙化，而不是向日葵皮疹。此外，皮肌炎仅影响口咽部和上食管的横纹肌（例如，呛咳、吸入）；而硬皮病可以影响下食管。\n\n（选项B）嗜酸性粒细胞性食管炎通常表现为吞咽困难、上腹痛、复发性食管反流和食物嵌塞。皮疹和肢体无力是意想不到的。\n\n（选项C）失弛缓症是由食管肌间神经丛的炎症和变性引起的，导致远端食管和平滑肌的舒张受损。它通常表现为吞咽困难、反流和烧心，但与皮疹或骨骼肌无力无关。\n\n（选项D）Zenker憩室发生在食管上括约肌的正上方，后部黏膜在环咽肌纤维之间疝出。虽然它表现为吞咽困难、反流和吸入，但与皮疹或肌肉无力无关。\n\n教育目标：\n皮肌炎的特征是近端肌无力，类似于多发性肌炎，并伴有影响皮肤的额外炎症特征（例如，向日葵皮疹，Gottron丘疹）。在这两种情况下，口咽部和心脏中横纹肌的受累可导致吞咽困难、肺部吸入和心肌炎。"
