    "en": "The patient's presentation of severe muscle rigidity, sinus tachycardia, and difficulty maintaining abdominal insufflation shortly after induction of anesthesia is highly suggestive of MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA (MH). MH is a hypermetabolic disorder of skeletal muscle that is triggered by exposure to volatile anesthetics and/or succinylcholine in genetically susceptible individuals. The underlying pathophysiology involves a mutation in the RYR1 gene, which encodes the ryanodine receptor, a calcium channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. In susceptible individuals, exposure to triggering agents leads to unregulated release of CALCIUM from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm. This excessive intracellular calcium causes sustained muscle contraction, leading to rigidity, increased CO2 production (hypercapnia), acidosis, and increased oxygen consumption. Hyperthermia is a later manifestation as cellular metabolism overwhelms the body's ability to dissipate heat. The treatment for MH is immediate cessation of the triggering anesthetic agent and administration of DANTROLENE. Dantrolene works by directly inhibiting the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by acting on the ryanodine receptor, thereby reversing the sustained muscle contraction. Therefore, inhibition of sarcoplasmic calcium release in skeletal muscles is the most likely intervention to improve this patient's condition.\n\n(Choice A) Neostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine levels in the neuromuscular junction, which would potentiate muscle contraction, not inhibit it. This would worsen the condition.\n\n(Choice B) Alpha-adrenergic antagonists primarily affect vascular tone and are not directly involved in the pathophysiology of malignant hyperthermia. While sympathetic activity may be increased due to stress, inhibiting it would not address the primary defect.\n\n(Choices C and D) GABA-mediated neuron hyperpolarization (Choice C) and ligand-receptor interaction in cholinergic synapses (Choice D) relate to neurotransmission in the central nervous system and neuromuscular junction, respectively. While some anesthetics affect these systems, the core problem in malignant hyperthermia is a defect in calcium handling within the muscle cell itself, specifically at the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Drugs acting on these pathways would not directly address the unregulated calcium release. Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers, which act on cholinergic synapses, are also ineffective and can sometimes worsen MH.\n\nEducational objective: Malignant hyperthermia presents with widespread muscle rigidity after administration of inhalation anesthetics and/or succinylcholine to genetically susceptible individuals. It is treated with dantrolene, which blocks ryanodine receptors to prevent the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm of skeletal muscle fibers.",
    "zh": "患者在麻醉诱导后不久出现严重的肌肉僵硬、窦性心动过速和难以维持腹部充气，这高度提示恶性高热（MH）。MH是一种骨骼肌的代谢亢进性疾病，由易感个体暴露于挥发性麻醉剂和/或琥珀酰胆碱引起。其潜在的病理生理学涉及RYR1基因突变，该基因编码兰尼碱受体，一种位于骨骼肌肌浆网中的钙通道。在易感个体中，暴露于触发剂会导致钙从肌浆网不受控制地释放到细胞质中。这种过度的细胞内钙会导致持续的肌肉收缩，从而导致僵硬、CO2产生增加（高碳酸血症）、酸中毒和耗氧量增加。高热是晚期表现，因为细胞代谢超过了身体的散热能力。MH的治疗方法是立即停止使用触发麻醉剂并给予丹曲林。丹曲林通过作用于兰尼碱受体，直接抑制钙从肌浆网的释放，从而逆转持续的肌肉收缩。因此，抑制骨骼肌中肌浆钙的释放是最有可能改善患者病情的方法。\n\n（选项A）新斯的明是一种乙酰胆碱酯酶抑制剂，可增加神经肌肉接头处的乙酰胆碱水平，从而增强肌肉收缩，而不是抑制它。这将使病情恶化。\n\n（选项B）α-肾上腺素能受体拮抗剂主要影响血管张力，并且不直接参与恶性高热的病理生理学。虽然由于应激，交感神经活性可能增加，但抑制它并不能解决主要缺陷。\n\n（选项C和D）GABA介导的神经元超极化（选项C）和胆碱能突触中的配体-受体相互作用（选项D）分别与中枢神经系统和神经肌肉接头中的神经传递有关。虽然一些麻醉剂会影响这些系统，但恶性高热的核心问题是肌肉细胞内钙处理的缺陷，特别是在肌浆网。作用于这些通路的药物不会直接解决不受控制的钙释放。作用于胆碱能突触的非去极化神经肌肉阻滞剂也无效，有时会使MH恶化。\n\n教育目标：恶性高热在易感个体使用吸入麻醉剂和/或琥珀酰胆碱后出现广泛的肌肉僵硬。它用丹曲林治疗，丹曲林阻断兰尼碱受体，以防止钙从肌浆网释放到骨骼肌纤维的细胞质中。"
