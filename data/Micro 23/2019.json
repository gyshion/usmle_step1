    "en": "A 24-year-old pregnant woman comes to the emergency department in active labor at full term. The patient has a history of HIV from injection drug use. She is not adherent with antiretroviral therapy and has had no recent testing of CD4 count or plasma viral load. Physical examination shows regular uterine contractions, ruptured amniotic membranes, and a fully dilated cervix. A decision is made to continue with the vaginal delivery due to advanced labor. Intravenous zidovudine is administered to the patient during the delivery and to the infant immediately after birth. This medication helps decrease the risk of perinatal transmission by inhibiting which of the following components of viral genome replication?",

    "en": "HIV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is converted into cDNA (copy/complementary DNA) by the HIV enzyme REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE. This enzyme grows DNA by adding nucleotides to the terminal 3'-hydroxyl group using a 3'-5' PHOSPHODIESTER BOND. NUCLEOSIDE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITORS (NRTIs) such as zidovudine block this step in viral replication. This class of medications is composed of nucleoside/nucleotide analogues that do not have a 3'-hydroxyl group. When reverse transcriptase incorporates an NRTI into a growing DNA strand, it results in chain termination because no 3'-hydroxyl group is available to add additional base pairs.\n\nZidovudine (ZDV) was the first approved HIV medication but is now used primarily to prevent maternal to fetal transmission of HIV during labor and delivery. It is a thymidine analogue that contains an azido group in place of the hydroxyl group usually found at the 3' end of thymidine.\n\n(Choice A) The enzyme thymidylate synthase catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP). N5, N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate is the methyl donor in this reaction and is converted to dihydrofolate (DHF) in the process. Tetrahydrofolate is then regenerated from DHF by dihydrofolate reductase. Methotrexate is a chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits DNA synthesis by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase.\n\n(Choice B) Integration of viral DNA into the host genome is mediated by integrase, an HIV enzyme that is inhibited by integrase strand transfer inhibitors (eg, raltegravir).\n\n(Choice C) Inhibition of nucleoside phosphorylation is not an effect of ZDV. In fact, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (including ZDV) must be phosphorylated within the host cell to form the functional triphosphate moiety. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors can bind directly to (and inactivate) reverse transcriptase without being phosphorylated.\n\n(Choice E) In double-stranded DNA, A always pairs with T, and G always pairs with C. These bases bind via hydrogen bonds. Some chemotherapeutic agents, such as the anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin, intercalate between the bases, causing defective base pairing and splitting of the DNA strands. Transcription and replication failure and mutagenesis ultimately result.\n\nEducational objective:\nZidovudine (ZDV) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used to prevent maternal to fetal transmission of HIV during labor (when the mother is not virally suppressed). It is a thymidine analogue that does not have the normal 3'-hydroxyl group found on thymidine. Because new nucleotides are added to growing DNA chains only at the 3'-hydroxyl group, the addition of ZDV into DNA results in chain termination.",
    "zh": "HIV是一种单链RNA病毒，通过HIV酶反转录酶转化为cDNA（拷贝/互补DNA）。该酶通过使用3'-5'磷酸二酯键将核苷酸添加到末端3'-羟基上而使DNA生长。核苷逆转录酶抑制剂（NRTIs），例如齐多夫定，可阻断病毒复制的这一步骤。这类药物由核苷/核苷酸类似物组成，没有3'-羟基。当逆转录酶将NRTI掺入正在生长的DNA链中时，会导致链终止，因为没有3'-羟基可用于添加额外的碱基对。\n\n齐多夫定（ZDV）是首个获批的HIV药物，但现在主要用于预防分娩期间HIV的母婴传播。它是一种胸腺嘧啶类似物，在胸腺嘧啶3'端通常发现的羟基的位置含有叠氮基。\n\n(选项A) 酶胸苷酸合酶催化脱氧尿苷单磷酸(dUMP)转化为脱氧胸苷单磷酸(dTMP)。N5，N10-亚甲基四氢叶酸是该反应中的甲基供体，并在过程中转化为二氢叶酸(DHF)。然后通过二氢叶酸还原酶从DHF中再生四氢叶酸。甲氨蝶呤是一种化疗药物，通过抑制二氢叶酸还原酶来抑制DNA合成。\n\n(选项B) 病毒DNA整合到宿主基因组中是由整合酶介导的，整合酶是一种HIV酶，可被整合酶链转移抑制剂（例如，雷特格韦）抑制。\n\n(选项C) 抑制核苷磷酸化不是ZDV的作用。事实上，核苷逆转录酶抑制剂（包括ZDV）必须在宿主细胞内磷酸化才能形成功能性三磷酸基团。非核苷逆转录酶抑制剂可以直接与（并灭活）逆转录酶结合，而无需磷酸化。\n\n(选项E) 在双链DNA中，A始终与T配对，G始终与C配对。这些碱基通过氢键结合。一些化疗药物，例如蒽环类药物柔红霉素和多柔比星，插入碱基之间，导致碱基配对缺陷并分裂DNA链。最终导致转录和复制失败以及突变。\n\n教育目标：\n齐多夫定（ZDV）是一种核苷逆转录酶抑制剂，用于预防分娩期间HIV的母婴传播（当母亲没有病毒抑制时）。它是一种胸苷类似物，没有胸苷上发现的正常3'-羟基。因为新的核苷酸仅在3'-羟基上添加到正在生长的DNA链中，所以将ZDV添加到DNA中会导致链终止。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of HIV replication, specifically the mechanism of action of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors like zidovudine in preventing maternal-fetal transmission. It requires understanding how these drugs interfere with phosphodiester bond formation during viral DNA synthesis.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that zidovudine is an NRTI that inhibits reverse transcriptase by acting as a chain terminator. This occurs because it lacks a 3'-hydroxyl group, preventing the formation of phosphodiester bonds necessary for DNA elongation.",
