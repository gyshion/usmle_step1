    "en": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department with dehydration. He has had several days of decreased oral intake, and today his parents could not get him to drink anything. The patient has received no vaccinations due to parental beliefs. Vital signs are normal except for mild tachycardia. Physical examination shows decreased skin turgor and sunken eyes. His jaw muscles are tight. Neurologic examination shows increased tone throughout and 3+ patellar reflexes. There is a small, healed puncture wound on his lower leg. The father says that the boy fell on a piece of chain-link fence in their backyard last week.",

    "en": "This unvaccinated child has evidence of tetanus (Clostridium tetani infection) following a puncture wound. C tetani causes disease not through tissue invasion but by producing a potent metalloprotease exotoxin (tetanospasmin) that is deadly in nanogram quantities. The toxin first binds to receptors on the presynaptic membranes of peripheral motor neurons. From there, it migrates by retrograde axonal transport to central inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem and prevents the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Suppression of inhibitory nerve activity results in increased activation of motor nerves, causing muscle spasms and hyperreflexia. Classic features include difficulty opening the jaw (lockjaw, or trismus), a fixed sardonic smile (risus sardonicus), and contractions of back muscles resulting in backward arching (opisthotonos). Patients are also extremely irritable and develop tetanic spasms in response to minor stimuli such as loud noises.\n(Choice A) Acetylcholine release is inhibited by the botulinum toxin from C botulinum, leading to the flaccid paralysis seen in clinical botulism.\n(Choices B and C) Neither dopamine nor glutamate release has been linked to toxin effects in humans.\n(Choice E) Serotonin release from enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract is stimulated by Vibrio cholera enterotoxin. This increased serotonin release contributes to the extreme fluid secretion seen in cholera.\nEducational objective:\nTetanospasmin is a neuro-exotoxin released by Clostridium tetani. The toxin blocks the release of glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from the spinal inhibitory interneurons that regulate the lower motor neurons. These disinhibited motor neurons cause increased activation of muscles, leading to spasms and hyperreflexia.",
    "zh": "这名未接种疫苗的儿童在穿刺伤口后有破伤风（破伤风梭菌感染）的证据。破伤风梭菌引起疾病不是通过组织侵袭，而是通过产生一种有效的金属蛋白酶外毒素（破伤风痉挛毒素），这种毒素以纳克量级致命。该毒素首先与周围运动神经元突触前膜上的受体结合。从那里，它通过逆行轴突转运迁移到脊髓和脑干中的中枢抑制性神经元，并阻止抑制性神经递质甘氨酸和γ-氨基丁酸（GABA）的释放。抑制性神经活动的抑制导致运动神经激活增加，引起肌肉痉挛和反射亢进。典型特征包括难以张开下颌（锁颚或牙关紧闭）、固定的嘲讽微笑（risus sardonicus）以及背部肌肉收缩导致向后弯曲（角弓反张）。患者也极度易怒，并且会对轻微刺激（如嘈杂的噪音）产生强直性痉挛。\n（选项 A）乙酰胆碱的释放被肉毒杆菌毒素（来自肉毒梭菌）抑制，导致肉毒中毒的弛缓性麻痹。\n（选项 B 和 C）多巴胺和谷氨酸的释放均未与人类的毒素效应相关联。\n（选项 E）由霍乱弧菌肠毒素刺激肠嗜铬细胞释放血清素。这种血清素释放的增加导致霍乱中出现的极端体液分泌。\n教育目标：破伤风痉挛毒素是由破伤风梭菌释放的神经外毒素。该毒素阻断了来自调节下运动神经元的脊髓抑制性中间神经元的甘氨酸和γ-氨基丁酸（GABA）的释放。这些去抑制的运动神经元导致肌肉激活增加，导致痉挛和反射亢进。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology of tetanus, specifically the mechanism of action of tetanus toxin on neurotransmitter release in the central nervous system. It assesses the ability to correlate clinical signs and symptoms with the underlying neurochemical disruption.\nTo solve this question, identify the clinical syndrome as tetanus based on the unvaccinated status, puncture wound, and characteristic neurologic findings (muscle rigidity, hyperreflexia). Recall or deduce that tetanus toxin affects inhibitory neurotransmitters in the spinal cord, leading to disinhibition of motor neurons and subsequent spasms. Recognize that glycine and GABA are the primary inhibitory neurotransmitters affected.",
