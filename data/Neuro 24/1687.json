    "en": "This patient has CLASP-KNIFE SPASTICITY, which is characterized by initial resistance to passive flexion followed by a sudden release of tension. This form of spasticity is seen with UPPER MOTOR NEURON lesions and results from a lack of upper motor neuron inhibition on the spinal stretch reflex arc. With passive arm flexion, the extensor muscles are activated by the DISINHIBITED STRETCH REFLEX, causing initial resistance that can be overcome with continued flexion.\n\nUpper motor neuron lesions can affect any part of the pyramidal motor system (eg, corticobulbar/corticospinal tracts), which runs from the precentral gyrus (primary motor cortex) through the INTERNAL CAPSULE to the brainstem and spinal cord. Patients with an INTERNAL CAPSULE STROKE can have both sensory and motor deficits, but most commonly have pure MOTOR WEAKNESS affecting the contralateral arm, leg, and lower face as well as clasp-knife spasticity, hyperreflexia, and a positive Babinski sign.\n\n(Choices A, D, and E) The caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus (ie, basal ganglia) are part of the extrapyramidal motor system, which regulates both voluntary and involuntary motor function (eg, posture, muscle tone, prevention of erratic movements). Lesions to these structures can result in motor dysfunction, including chorea (ie, random, jerky, uncontrollable movements), tremor, bradykinesia, or rigidity, as well as changes in cognition and behavior.\n\n(Choice C) The insular cortex (insula) plays a role in emotional experience (in conjunction with the limbic system), autonomic function, and introspection/awareness of visceral sensations.\n\nEducational objective: Upper motor neuron lesions (ie, internal capsule stroke) cause contralateral weakness with clasp-knife spastic spasticity, hyperreflexia, and a positive Babinski sign. These lesions damage the pyramidal motor system (eg, corticospinal tracts), which runs from the precentral gyrus (primary motor cortex) through the internal capsule to the brainstem and spinal cord. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有折刀样痉挛，其特征为被动屈曲的初始阻力，随后突然释放张力。这种形式的痉挛见于上运动神经元损伤，是由于上运动神经元对脊髓牵张反射弧的抑制不足所致。在被动屈曲手臂时，伸肌被去抑制的牵张反射激活，引起最初的阻力，但可通过持续屈曲来克服。\n\n上运动神经元损伤可影响锥体运动系统的任何部分（例如，皮质延髓/皮质脊髓束），该系统从中央前回（初级运动皮质）穿过内囊到脑干和脊髓。内囊卒中的患者可能同时出现感觉和运动障碍，但最常见的是纯粹的运动无力，影响对侧手臂、腿和下脸，以及折刀样痉挛、反射亢进和巴宾斯基征阳性。\n\n（选项 A、D 和 E）尾状核、壳核和苍白球（即基底神经节）是锥体外运动系统的一部分，该系统调节随意和不随意运动功能（例如，姿势、肌张力、防止不规则运动）。这些结构的病变可导致运动功能障碍，包括舞蹈症（即，随机、抽搐、无法控制的运动）、震颤、运动迟缓或僵硬，以及认知和行为的改变。\n\n（选项 C）脑岛皮质（岛叶）在情绪体验（与边缘系统相关）、自主神经功能和内省/内脏感觉意识中起作用。\n\n教育目标：上运动神经元损伤（即，内囊卒中）引起对侧无力伴有折刀样痉挛、反射亢进和巴宾斯基征阳性。这些病变损害了锥体运动系统（例如，皮质脊髓束），该系统从中央前回（初级运动皮质）穿过内囊到脑干和脊髓。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation of upper motor neuron lesions, specifically focusing on the neurological deficits associated with an internal capsule stroke and the characteristic finding of clasp-knife spasticity.\n\nTo solve this question, one must correlate the patient's symptoms of motor weakness, slurred speech, facial droop, and clasp-knife spasticity with the anatomical location of the lesion within the brain. Identifying the internal capsule as the pathway for the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts is crucial for understanding why a lesion there causes these specific deficits.",
    "zh": "此题测试对上运动神经元损伤临床表现的理解，特别是关注与内囊卒中相关的神经功能缺损以及折刀样痉挛的特征性发现。\n\n要解决此问题，必须将患者的运动无力、言语不清、面部下垂和折刀样痉挛的症状与脑内病变的解剖位置相关联。将内囊确定为皮质脊髓束和皮质延髓束的通路对于理解病变发生于此的原因至关重要。"
