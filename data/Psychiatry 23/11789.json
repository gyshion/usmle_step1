    "en": "A 9-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother for evaluation of frequent stomach aches. The mother says that her daughter has always had a \"sensitive stomach\" but that it has gotten worse since she started going to a new school a few months ago. The girl has been missing class due to being in the nurse's office multiple times per week. The patient's symptoms improve when her mother comes to get her. In response to the doctor's questions about the girl's peer relationships, the mother replies, \"She has friends but never enjoys sleepovers.\" When the patient is at a friend's house, she often complains of stomach pain and nausea. She occasionally has nightmares about being left alone and wakes up crying. Although both parents are healthy, the patient says she worries about them \"dying of a terrible illness, like cancer.\" Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities.",
    "zh": "一位9岁女孩由母亲带来就诊，评估频繁的胃痛。母亲说她的女儿一直都有“敏感的胃”，但自从几个月前开始上新学校后，情况变得更糟。由于每周多次待在护士办公室，女孩一直在旷课。当她的母亲来接她时，患者的症状有所改善。在回答医生关于女孩同伴关系的问题时，母亲回答说：“她有朋友，但从不喜欢过夜。”当患者在朋友家时，她经常抱怨胃痛和恶心。她偶尔会做关于独自一人被留下的噩梦，醒来时哭泣。尽管父母都很健康，但患者说她担心他们“死于可怕的疾病，比如癌症”。腹部检查显示没有异常。"

    "en": "Although separation anxiety is common in young children and in older children at times of change or stress, this patient's distress is excessive and impairing when she is separated from her mother. Her inability to sleep away from home, abdominal pain from her mother, and repeated nightmares involving the theme of separation are consistent with SEPARATION ANXIETY DISORDER. Children with this disorder commonly experience PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS (eg, headaches, stomach aches, nausea) when separation occurs or is anticipated, and have repeated NIGHTMARES involving the theme of separation. According to DSM-5, symptoms must be present for ≥4 weeks in children and ≥6 months in adults.\n(Choice A) This girl's symptoms predate the stressor of starting a new school. In addition, adjustment disorders are not diagnosed when symptoms better meet the criteria for another disorder. As in this patient, stressful events often exacerbate symptoms of another disorder.\n(Choice B) Patients with dependent personality disorder fear being left alone and seek out others to support and assume responsibility for them. However, personality disorders are not diagnosed in children as their personalities are still developing.\n(Choice C) Generalized anxiety disorder involves chronic anxiety regarding multiple issues. This patient's symptoms occur in the context of separation, making separation anxiety disorder the appropriate diagnosis.\n(Choice D) This child's fears focus on her parents becoming ill, causing her to be left alone. Illness anxiety disorder is diagnosed in individuals who excessively worry about having a specific illness themselves.\n(Choice F) Social anxiety disorder is considered when anxiety and avoidance of social settings are due to worry about being viewed negatively by others. This child fears separation from her parents, not social rejection.\n(Choice G) Patients with somatic symptom disorder have an ongoing preoccupation with physical symptoms; their anxiety is primarily related to their physical symptoms and health. This child's somatic symptoms are an expression of anxiety due to separation from attachment figures.",
    "zh": "虽然分离焦虑在幼儿中很常见，在较大儿童遇到变化或压力时也可能发生，但当该患者与母亲分离时，她的痛苦是过度的且具有损害性的。她无法离开家睡觉，因为离开母亲而引起的腹痛，以及反复出现的涉及分离主题的噩梦，都与分离焦虑症一致。患有这种疾病的儿童在发生或预期发生分离时，通常会经历身体症状（例如，头痛、胃痛、恶心），并反复出现涉及分离主题的噩梦。根据DSM-5，症状必须持续存在≥4周（儿童）和≥6个月（成人）。\n(选项A) 这个女孩的症状早于开始上新学校的压力。此外，当症状更能满足另一种疾病的标准时，不诊断适应障碍。就像在这个病人身上一样，压力事件经常会加重另一种疾病的症状。\n(选项B) 依赖型人格障碍患者害怕被单独留下，并寻求他人来支持和承担责任。然而，由于儿童的人格仍在发展中，因此不诊断人格障碍。\n(选项C) 广泛性焦虑障碍涉及对多个问题的慢性焦虑。该患者的症状发生在分离的背景下，因此分离焦虑症是合适的诊断。\n(选项D) 这个孩子害怕她的父母生病，导致她被单独留下。疾病焦虑症的诊断依据是个体过度担心自己患有特定疾病。\n(选项F) 当焦虑和回避社交环境是由于担心被他人负面看待时，则考虑社交焦虑症。这个孩子害怕与父母分离，而不是社交排斥。\n(选项G) 躯体症状障碍患者持续关注身体症状；他们的焦虑主要与他们的身体症状和健康有关。这个孩子的躯体症状是由于与依恋对象分离而引起的焦虑的表现。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of pediatric anxiety disorders, specifically differentiating between separation anxiety disorder and other anxiety-related conditions based on clinical presentation.
