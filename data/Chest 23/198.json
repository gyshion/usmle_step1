    "en": "A 56-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to progressively worsening dyspnea. The patient can walk only a few blocks before becoming short of breath. He also finds it difficult to sleep lying flat and requires 3 pillows to prop himself upright when sleeping. Other medical problems include long-standing hypertension, for which he occasionally takes his prescribed antihypertensive medication. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Blood pressure is 170/100 mm Hg, and pulse is 80/min and regular. Physical examination reveals bilateral basilar lung crackles, jugular venous distension, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Chest x-ray reveals cardiomegaly and hilar prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiogram shows elevated pressures in the pulmonary artery. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the observed echocardiographic finding in this patient? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient with dyspnea, orthopnea, and pulmonary crackles has LEFT-SIDED HEART FAILURE (LHF) most likely due to long-standing, poorly controlled hypertension. Hypertensive heart disease typically manifests as heart failure due to concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and consequent LV diastolic dysfunction. LHF of any cause (eg, LV systolic dysfunction, valvular dysfunction) will result in higher diastolic filling pressures. This increase in pressure is transmitted backward to the left atrium and pulmonary veins, resulting in pulmonary venous congestion and consequent elevations in pulmonary capillary and pulmonary arterial pressure. The resulting pulmonary hypertension (PH) can lead to right-sided heart failure with jugular venous distension and peripheral edema.\n\nOver time, remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature occurs with increased smooth muscle cell proliferation (medial hypertrophy) and collagen deposition (intimal thickening and fibrosis). The remodeling is less extensive than in (primary) pulmonary arterial hypertension; therefore, the PH is at least partially reversible with treatment of the LHF. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choices A and E) Hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction and emphysematous obliteration of the vasculature underlie PH that occurs secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although there is a small component of hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction in LHF, pulmonary venous congestion is the major cause of PH.\n\n(Choice B) Congenital heart disease that causes left-to-right shunting (eg, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect) can lead to PH via an increase in pulmonary arterial blood flow. In LHF, PH occurs due to backwards transmission of pressure from increased pulmonary venous blood volume; pulmonary arterial blood flow remains the same or decreases as LHF worsens.\n\n(Choice D) Inflammatory large-vessel vasculitis (ie, Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis) can sometimes involve the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. However, pulmonary vascular inflammation does not play a role in PH occurring secondary to LHF.\n\n(Choice F) Thrombotic obstruction of the pulmonary arterial tree occurs in acute pulmonary embolism, and some patients can develop chronic thromboembolic PH despite receiving appropriate anticoagulation therapy. However, this patient has no history of thromboembolic disease, and his orthopnea and crackles are more suggestive of PH due to LHF.\n\nEducational objective:\nLeft-sided heart failure can cause secondary pulmonary hypertension via elevated left-sided diastolic filling pressures transmitting backward to the pulmonary veins, resulting in pulmonary venous congestion. Over time, pulmonary arterial remodeling (medial hypertrophy and intimal thickening with fibrosis) can occur, but not to the extent that occurs in (primary) pulmonary arterial hypertension.",
    "zh": "该患者出现呼吸困难、端坐呼吸和肺部爆裂音，最有可能患有左心衰竭（LHF），这很可能是由于长期、控制不佳的高血压所致。高血压性心脏病通常表现为心力衰竭，原因是向心性左心室（LV）肥大和随之而来的左心室舒张功能障碍。任何原因引起的LHF（例如，左心室收缩功能障碍、瓣膜功能障碍）都会导致舒张期充盈压升高。这种压力增加会向后传递到左心房和肺静脉，导致肺静脉充血，进而导致肺毛细血管和肺动脉压力升高。由此产生的肺动脉高压（PH）可导致右心衰竭，伴有颈静脉扩张和周围水肿。\n\n随着时间的推移，肺血管会发生重塑，伴有平滑肌细胞增生（内膜肥厚）和胶原蛋白沉积（内膜增厚和纤维化）。这种重塑不如（原发性）肺动脉高压广泛；因此，通过治疗LHF，PH至少可以部分逆转。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n（选项A和E）低氧诱导的血管收缩和肺气肿性血管闭塞是继发于慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD）的PH的基础。尽管在LHF中存在一小部分的低氧诱导的肺血管收缩，但肺静脉充血是PH的主要原因。\n\n（选项B）导致左向右分流的先天性心脏病（例如，室间隔缺损、房间隔缺损）可通过增加肺动脉血流导致PH。在LHF中，PH的发生是由于压力从肺静脉血容量增加向后传递；随着LHF恶化，肺动脉血流保持不变或减少。\n\n（选项D）炎症性大血管性血管炎（即，高安氏病、巨细胞动脉炎）有时会累及肺动脉并引起PH。然而，肺血管炎症在继发于LHF的PH中不起作用。\n\n（选项F）肺动脉树血栓阻塞发生在急性肺栓塞中，尽管接受适当的抗凝治疗，一些患者仍可发生慢性血栓栓塞性PH。然而，该患者没有血栓栓塞性疾病史，并且他的端坐呼吸和爆裂音更提示PH是由LHF引起的。\n\n教育目标：\n左心衰竭可通过升高的左侧舒张期充盈压向后传递到肺静脉，从而导致继发性肺动脉高压，进而导致肺静脉充血。随着时间的推移，可能发生肺动脉重塑（内膜肥厚和内膜增厚伴纤维化），但其程度不如（原发性）肺动脉高压。"
