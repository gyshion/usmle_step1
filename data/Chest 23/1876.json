    "en": "A 32-year-old hospitalized man is evaluated for new-onset shortness of breath and confusion. The patient was admitted 3 days ago following a motor vehicle collision during which he sustained bilateral femur fractures, a pelvic fracture, and urethral injury. He underwent surgical repair with no operative complications. Temperature is 37.9 C (100.2 F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and oxygen saturation is 84% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appears agitated and disoriented. The lungs are clear to auscultation and there is no lower extremity edema. A petechial rash is present on the chest. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ischemic changes.",

    "en": "The clinical triad of acute-onset neurologic abnormalities, hypoxemia, and petechiae in a patient with traumatic bone fracture is strongly suggestive of FAT EMBOLISM SYNDROME (FES). This condition most commonly occurs 24-72 hours following LONG-BONE and/or PELVIC fracture. Pathophysiologically, the traumatic event dislodges fat globules from the bone marrow and allows them to enter disrupted marrow venules, where they can then traverse the systemic veins and deposit in pulmonary microvessels. The PULMONARY CAPILLARY OCCLUSION impairs gas exchange and induces HYPOXEMIA; release of free fatty acids from the fat globules also causes local toxic injury to the endothelium, potentially leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nSome fat globules escape the lungs via precapillary arteriovenous shunts that open due to increased pulmonary artery pressure. This phenomenon appears to be responsible for the fat emboli-associated microvascular occlusion that can occur within the CNS, manifesting with confusion and neurologic impairment, and in the dermal capillaries, resulting in erythrocyte extravasation and a petechial rash.\n\n(Choices A, C, and D) A neutrophil-rich alveolar exudate is not an early histologic manifestation of FES but rather of acute bacterial or aspiration pneumonia. Mononuclear interstitial pulmonary infiltrates are found early in the course of a variety of interstitial lung diseases. A red thrombus lodged in the pulmonary artery is consistent with a thromboembolism from a deep venous source. None of these conditions would typically be associated with the neurologic impairment or petechial rash seen with FES.\n\n(Choice E) Focal necrosis of alveolar walls with associated intra-alveolar hemorrhage is often seen with pulmonary hemorrhage syndromes (eg, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis).\n\nEducational objective:\nFat embolism syndrome should be strongly suspected in a patient with severe long-bone and/or pelvic fractures who develops acute-onset neurologic abnormalities, hypoxemia, and a petechial rash. Occlusion of the pulmonary microvessels by fat globules is an early histologic finding of this syndrome.",
    "zh": "在伴有创伤性骨折的患者中，急性起病的神经系统异常、低氧血症和瘀点三联征强烈提示脂肪栓塞综合征（FES）。这种情况最常发生在长骨和/或骨盆骨折后的24-72小时内。从病理生理学角度来看，创伤事件将脂肪小球从骨髓中分离出来，并允许它们进入受损的骨髓小静脉，然后它们可以穿过体循环静脉并沉积在肺微血管中。肺毛细血管阻塞会损害气体交换并引起低氧血症；脂肪小球释放的游离脂肪酸也会对内皮细胞造成局部毒性损伤，可能导致急性呼吸窘迫综合征。\n\n一些脂肪小球通过由于肺动脉压力升高而开放的毛细血管前动静脉分流逃逸出肺。这种现象似乎是导致脂肪栓塞相关的微血管闭塞的原因，这种闭塞可能发生在CNS内，表现为意识模糊和神经功能障碍，并且在皮肤毛细血管中，导致红细胞外渗和瘀点皮疹。\n\n（选项A、C和D）富含中性粒细胞的肺泡渗出液不是FES的早期组织学表现，而是急性细菌性或吸入性肺炎的表现。单核细胞间质性肺浸润可见于多种间质性肺疾病的早期病程。滞留在肺动脉中的红色血栓与来自深静脉来源的血栓栓塞症一致。这些情况通常都不会与FES所见的神经功能障碍或瘀点皮疹相关。\n\n（选项E）伴有肺泡内出血的肺泡壁局灶性坏死常可见于肺出血综合征（例如，抗肾小球基底膜抗体病、伴多血管炎的肉芽肿病）。\n\n教学目标：\n对于患有严重的长骨和/或骨盆骨折并出现急性起病神经系统异常、低氧血症和瘀点皮疹的患者，应强烈怀疑脂肪栓塞综合征。肺微血管被脂肪小球阻塞是该综合征的早期组织学发现。"
