    "en": "This patient has isolated numbness of his left hand and graphesthesia, which are suspicious for a lesion impacting the RIGHT somatosensory cortex. {{exhibit_2}} A small lesion of the somatosensory cortex leads to contralateral deficits impacting the corresponding area of the body. Higher-level sensory processing (ie, CORTICAL SENSORY SIGNS) can also be impaired. This may include loss of:\n\n* Two-point discrimination\n* Stereognosis, or the ability to recognize an object only through touch\n* Ability to perceive multiple stimuli at the same time (loss of this is called extinction)\n* Graphesthesia, or the ability to recognize numbers or letters traced on the palm\n\nThe primary somatosensory cortex is located on the POSTCENTRAL GYRUS, which is posterior to the central sulcus and superior to the lateral sulcus.\n\n(Choice B) The area just anterior to the central sulcus (precentral gyrus) is the primary motor cortex. A lesion in this area would lead to weakness according to the somatotopic organization of the cortex.\n\n(Choice C) This area indicates the frontal eye fields, an area that directs gaze to produce conjugate horizontal gaze. An ischemic lesion in this area would lead to gaze deviation toward the side of the lesion (ie, rightward deviation if the right hemisphere is impacted).\n\n(Choice D) This is the occipital cortex, the area of the primary visual cortex. A lesion in this area would cause cortical blindness.\n\n(Choice E) A lesion impacting the cerebellum typically leads to ataxia and vertigo.\n\nEducational objective:\nA lesion of the somatosensory cortex, located just posterior to the central sulcus, leads to contralateral sensory deficits and cortical sensory signs. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the localization of neurological deficits based on sensory symptoms, specifically graphesthesia and numbness, and relates these symptoms to specific brain regions responsible for somatosensory processing. It assesses the ability to correlate clinical presentation with neuroanatomy.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the affected sensory modality (somatosensory cortex) and its anatomical location (postcentral gyrus). Then, by correlating the patient's symptoms of left-sided sensory loss with the provided diagram of the brain, the correct area of the lesion can be identified.",
