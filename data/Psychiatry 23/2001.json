  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's presentation of agitation, chest pain, hypertension, tachycardia, dilated pupils, and nasal perforation is highly suggestive of COCAINE ABUSE. Cocaine is a potent STIMULANT that inhibits the presynaptic reuptake of monoamines, including norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. This leads to increased levels of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, resulting in sympathetic stimulation. The increased sympathetic activity causes the patient's hypertension, tachycardia, mydriasis, and agitation. Cocaine's ability to increase synaptic availability of norepinephrine, combined with some of its other effects (eg, sodium channel antagonism), makes it a potent vasoconstrictor that can promote MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA by causing CORONARY ARTERY VASOSPASM and increased platelet aggregation (ie, thrombus formation). When cocaine is used intranasally, its vasoconstrictive effects cause local ischemia resulting in MUCOSAL ATROPHY that can then lead to NASAL SEPTAL PERFORATION; these findings are highly suggestive of cocaine abuse.\n\n(Choices A, D, and E) Inhibition of neuronal tyrosine uptake, impaired norepinephrine release into the synaptic cleft, or blockade of postsynaptic adrenergic receptors would result in sympatholytic effects (reduced blood pressure and heart rate).\n(Choice B) Metyrosine blocks the rate-limiting step of catecholamine synthesis (tyrosine hydroxylase). This results in decreased levels of catecholamines and sympathetic effects.\n(Choice C) Reserpine (an antihypertensive agent no longer in clinical use) blocks monoamine entry into presynaptic vesicles, resulting in sympatholytic effects.\n(Choice G) Catechol-O-Methyl transferase (COMT) is found in the brain and liver and degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters. Entacapone and tolcapone are COMT inhibitors used to prolong the effects of levodopa treatment in patients with Parkinson disease.\n\nEducational objective:\nCocaine is a stimulant that inhibits the presynaptic reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. Intoxicated patients develop agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, and light-responsive mydriasis due to increased sympathetic activity. Cocaine is also a potent vasoconstrictor that can cause myocardial ischemia and atrophy of the nasal mucosa and septum.",
    "zh": "患者表现出激动、胸痛、高血压、心动过速、瞳孔散大和鼻中隔穿孔，高度提示可卡因滥用。可卡因是一种强效兴奋剂，可抑制单胺类神经递质（包括去甲肾上腺素、多巴胺和血清素）的突触前再摄取。这导致这些神经递质在突触间隙中的水平升高，从而导致交感神经兴奋。交感神经活动增加导致患者出现高血压、心动过速、瞳孔散大和激动。可卡因增加去甲肾上腺素突触可用性的能力，加上其其他一些作用（例如，钠通道拮抗作用），使其成为一种有效的血管收缩剂，可通过引起冠状动脉血管痉挛和血小板聚集增加（即血栓形成）来促进心肌缺血。当可卡因经鼻内使用时，其血管收缩作用会导致局部缺血，从而导致粘膜萎缩，进而导致鼻中隔穿孔；这些发现高度提示可卡因滥用。\n\n（选项A、D和E）抑制神经元酪氨酸摄取、损害去甲肾上腺素释放到突触间隙中或阻断突触后肾上腺素受体，将导致拟交感神经抑制作用（降低血压和心率）。\n（选项B）美替罗辛阻断儿茶酚胺合成的限速步骤（酪氨酸羟化酶）。这导致儿茶酚胺水平降低和交感神经作用。\n（选项C）利血平（一种不再用于临床的降压药）阻断单胺类物质进入突触前囊泡，从而导致拟交感神经抑制作用。\n（选项G）儿茶酚-O-甲基转移酶 (COMT) 存在于大脑和肝脏中，并降解儿茶酚胺神经递质。恩他卡朋和托卡朋是COMT抑制剂，用于延长帕金森病患者左旋多巴治疗的效果。\n\n教育目标：\n可卡因是一种兴奋剂，可抑制去甲肾上腺素、多巴胺和血清素的突触前再摄取。中毒患者由于交感神经活动增加而出现激动、心动过速、高血压和光反应性瞳孔散大。可卡因也是一种强效血管收缩剂，可引起心肌缺血以及鼻粘膜和鼻中隔萎缩。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of cocaine intoxication, specifically focusing on how cocaine's mechanism of action leads to sympathetic overstimulation and cardiovascular complications. It requires correlating the patient's symptoms and physical findings with the neurochemical effects of the drug.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the clinical syndrome suggestive of cocaine abuse. Then, by understanding the diagram of neurotransmitter metabolism and release, identify the specific process inhibited by cocaine (presynaptic reuptake of monoamines) that explains the observed sympathetic effects and cardiovascular events.",
