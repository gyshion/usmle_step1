    "en": "A 54-year-old man is brought to the office by his friend because of worsening memory impairment over the past several months. The patient is also withdrawn and not focused during conversations. He is slow to answer questions or carry out instructions. The patient has a prolonged history of HIV infection and has had several opportunistic infections due to inconsistent antiretroviral medication use. On physical examination, he is alert and oriented. Muscle strength, deep tendon reflexes, and sensation are normal. MRI of the head shows diffuse cerebral atrophy with no focal mass lesions or areas of demyelination. Viral proliferation in which of the following central nervous system cells is most likely involved in this patient's disease process?",
    "zh": "一名54岁男性由其朋友带来就诊，因为过去几个月记忆力减退。患者在谈话中也表现出退缩和注意力不集中。他回答问题或执行指令的速度很慢。患者有长期的HIV感染史，并且由于不一致的抗逆转录病毒药物使用，曾患有几次机会性感染。体格检查显示，他神志清醒，定向力好。肌力、深腱反射和感觉正常。头部MRI显示弥漫性脑萎缩，无局灶性肿块病变或脱髓鞘区域。病毒在以下哪种中枢神经系统细胞中的增殖最有可能参与该患者的疾病过程？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "In the context of a long history of HIV infection, this patient's memory impairment, subcortical dysfunction (ie, inattention, impaired psychomotor speed), and cerebral atrophy on MRI of the head are consistent with HIV-associated dementia (HAD). HAD is characteristically a subcortical dementia with prominent mood, attention, memory, and psychomotor dysfunction. It is uncommon in patients receiving antiretroviral treatment but can occur in those with inconsistently treated, advanced HIV infection.\n\nAlthough HIV-1 preferentially infects and replicates in CD4+ helper T cells in peripheral blood (Choice A), CNS infection is associated with a change in viral tropism (ie, ability to infect different cell types) to microglia and macrophages, which allows the virus to penetrate deeper into the brain parenchyma. This macrophage tropic (M-tropic) version of the virus becomes \"compartmentalized\" in the CNS and evolves independently from the strain found in the blood.\n\n(Choices B and E) HIV is not neuron or oligodendrocyte tropic. Viruses that are neuron tropic include the lyssaviruses that cause rabies.\n\n(Choice C) HIV does not preferentially infect and replicate in endothelial cells in the CNS. Cytomegalovirus is an example of an endothelial cell-tropic virus.\n\nEducational objective: HIV-associated dementia has become rare since the advent of antiretroviral treatment but may still develop in patients with inadequately treated, late-stage HIV infection. In the CNS, HIV preferentially infects and replicates in macrophages.",
    "zh": "在长期HIV感染史的背景下，该患者的记忆力减退、皮质下功能障碍（即注意力不集中、精神运动速度受损）以及头部MRI上的脑萎缩与HIV相关性痴呆（HAD）一致。HAD的特征是皮质下痴呆，主要表现为情绪、注意力、记忆和精神运动功能障碍。接受抗逆转录病毒治疗的患者中这种情况并不常见，但可能发生在治疗不一致的晚期HIV感染患者中。\n\n尽管HIV-1优先感染并在外周血中CD4+辅助T细胞中复制（选项A），但中枢神经系统感染与病毒嗜性的改变（即感染不同细胞类型）有关，microglia和巨噬细胞，这使得病毒能够更深入地渗透到脑实质中。这种巨噬细胞嗜性（M-tropic）病毒在中枢神经系统中“分隔化”，并且与在血液中发现的毒株独立演化。\n\n（选项B和E）HIV不是神经元或少突胶质细胞嗜性。神经元嗜性病毒包括引起狂犬病的狂犬病毒。\n\n（选项C）HIV不会优先感染并在中枢神经系统的内皮细胞中复制。巨细胞病毒是内皮细胞嗜性病毒的一个例子。\n\n教育目标：自抗逆转录病毒治疗出现以来，HIV相关性痴呆已变得罕见，但仍可能发生在治疗不充分的晚期HIV感染患者中。在中枢神经系统中，HIV优先感染并在巨噬细胞中复制。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology of HIV-associated dementia (HAD), specifically identifying the primary cells in the central nervous system infected by HIV that lead to this condition.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the clinical presentation suggestive of HAD in a patient with a history of HIV infection and inconsistent treatment, and then recalling or deducing which CNS cell type is most implicated in the pathogenesis of HAD.",
    "zh": "本题考察对HIV相关性痴呆（HAD）病理生理学的理解，特别是确定导致这种情况的HIV感染的中枢神经系统中的主要细胞。\n\n解决本题的方法包括，在有HIV感染史和治疗不一致的患者中，识别提示HAD的临床表现，然后回忆或推断哪种中枢神经系统细胞类型最与HAD的发病机制有关。"
