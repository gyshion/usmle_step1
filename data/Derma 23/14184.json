    "en": "An 85-year-old woman who worked as an environmental scientist prior to retiring comes to the office for evaluation of a round nodule on her left cheek. Her only other medical condition is osteoarthritis. Biopsy of the lesion shows nodular aggregates of dark-blue staining, basaloid keratinocytes in the dermis with peripheral palisading and cleft formation. The cells are crowded, have scant cytoplasm, and have a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio. The patient refuses surgical resection of the lesion. Which of the following is the most likely outcome?",

    "en": "This patient with a likely history of extensive sun exposure has a left cheek lesion that is histologically consistent with basal cell carcinoma (BCC). BCCs arise from keratinocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis or hair follicle. They characteristically form nests (ie, nodular aggregates) of crowded basaloid cells (ie, resembling the basal layer), which appear dark blue on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining due to their basophilic, hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm (ie, high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio). The cells at the periphery frequently display parallel alignment (ie, peripheral palisading), and clefting (ie, retraction artifact) is often seen between the tumor and surrounding stroma following specimen processing. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nThe most common (~80%) subtype of BCC, nodular BCC, usually appears as a pink- or skin-colored papule or nodule, often with a pearly or translucent quality and central telangiectasias. Although BCCs rarely metastasize, if left untreated (eg, refusal of surgical resection) they may undergo continued local growth, causing progressive destruction of surrounding tissue. This can eventually lead to invasion of adjacent structures such as bones or nerves; however, neuronal spread (ie, neurotropism) that causes severe cancer-related pain is typically associated with more aggressive cancers (eg, oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma) rather than BCC (Choice E).\n\n(Choice A) Individuals with a history of BCC are at increased risk for developing additional lesions; however, the lesions more commonly occur in areas of the body that have been exposed to extensive UV radiation (eg, the face rather than the trunk) because it is the most important risk factor for BCC.\n\n(Choices B and D) BCCs almost never undergo extensive regional lymphatic spread or rapid metastasis via hematogenous dissemination. In contrast, malignant melanoma frequently spreads via both pathways. Biopsy of melanoma typically reveals atypical melanocytes (eg, large irregular nuclei, prominent nucleoli) that may contain cytoplasmic melanin granules.\n\nEducational objective:\nBasal cell carcinoma (BCC) commonly presents as a pearly, skin-colored papule/nodule on the face. Biopsy classically shows nests of basaloid keratinocytes with peripheral palisading and clefting artifact. Unresected BCCs rarely metastasize but may undergo continued local growth, causing progressive surrounding tissue destruction. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "这位患者可能长期暴露于阳光下，其左颊病变在组织学上与基底细胞癌（BCC）一致。BCC源自表皮或毛囊基底层的角质形成细胞。它们典型地形成密集基底样细胞的巢（即，结节性聚集）（即，类似于基底层），这些细胞在苏木精和伊红（H&E）染色上呈深蓝色，这归因于它们嗜碱性、高度染色质的核和稀少胞质（即，高核质比）。周边细胞经常显示平行排列（即，周边栅栏状排列），并且在标本处理后，肿瘤和周围基质之间经常可见裂隙（即，回缩伪影）。{{exhibit_1}}\n\nBCC最常见的亚型（约80%），即结节性BCC，通常表现为粉红色或肤色丘疹或结节，常具有珍珠色或半透明的质地和中心毛细血管扩张。虽然BCC很少发生转移，但如果未经治疗（例如，拒绝手术切除），它们可能会持续局部生长，导致周围组织进行性破坏。这最终可能导致侵犯邻近结构，如骨骼或神经；然而，引起严重癌症相关疼痛的神经扩散（即，神经向性）通常与更具侵袭性的癌症（例如，舌鳞状细胞癌、胰腺癌）相关，而不是BCC（选项E）。\n\n（选项A）有BCC病史的个体发生额外病变的风险增加；然而，病变更常见于暴露于大量紫外线辐射的身体部位（例如，面部而不是躯干），因为它是BCC最重要的危险因素。\n\n（选项B和D）BCC几乎从不发生广泛的区域淋巴扩散或通过血行播散的快速转移。相反，恶性黑色素瘤经常通过这两种途径扩散。黑色素瘤活检通常显示非典型黑色素细胞（例如，大的不规则核，突出的核仁），其中可能含有细胞质黑色素颗粒。\n\n教育目标：\n基底细胞癌（BCC）通常表现为面部珍珠色、肤色丘疹/结节。活检典型显示基底样角质形成细胞的巢，伴有周边栅栏状排列和裂隙伪影。未切除的BCC很少发生转移，但可能发生持续的局部生长，导致进行性周围组织破坏。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), its histological features, and its typical clinical course. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing that BCCs rarely metastasize but can cause significant local tissue destruction if left untreated.\n\nThe best approach is to recall the characteristic features of BCC, including its appearance and behavior. Understanding that BCCs are locally invasive but rarely metastatic helps to narrow down the options and select the most likely outcome in the absence of surgical intervention.",
    "zh": "此题考察对基底细胞癌（BCC）的认识，包括其组织学特征和典型临床病程。它强调认识到BCC很少转移，但如果未经治疗，可导致明显的局部组织破坏。\n\n最好的方法是回忆BCC的特征性特征，包括其外观和行为。了解BCC具有局部侵袭性但很少转移有助于缩小选项范围，并选择在没有外科干预的情况下最有可能的结局。"
