  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has developed a deep venous thrombosis in his left leg following a lengthy car trip and now has clinical features highly consistent with acute PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE). Obstruction of the pulmonary circulation by an embolus causes INCREASED DEAD SPACE VENTILATION (ie, alveoli are ventilated but not perfused); the term \"dead space\" refers to the volume of inspired air that does not participate in gas exchange. As dead space ventilation increases, blood that continues to flow through the pulmonary circulation cannot be fully oxygenated by the decreased number of accessible alveoli (ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch), leading to HYPOXEMIA.\n\n(Choice A) Functional residual capacity refers to the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a normal expiration. It is increased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to air trapping; however, it is unchanged in PE.\n\n(Choice B) Diffusion capacity is reduced by conditions that disrupt the alveolar-capillary interface (eg, pulmonary fibrosis), but it is not altered in PE.\n\n(Choice D) Pulmonary compliance (ability to expand) is reduced in restrictive lung disease (eg, pulmonary fibrosis) and is increased in COPD (due to emphysematous destruction of the distal airways). However, it is not significantly altered in the setting of PE.\n\n(Choice E) Total airway resistance is increased by bronchoconstriction, which occurs in patients with asthma. PE does not affect airway resistance.",
    "zh": "该患者在长时间的乘车旅行后，其左腿出现了深静脉血栓形成，现在具有与急性肺栓塞（PE）高度一致的临床特征。栓子阻塞肺循环导致无效腔通气增加（即，肺泡通气但未灌注）；“无效腔”一词指的是未参与气体交换的吸入空气的体积。随着无效腔通气增加，继续流经肺循环的血液无法被减少的可及肺泡（通气/血流比 (V/Q) 失调）完全氧化，从而导致低氧血症。\n\n（选项A）功能残气量是指正常呼气后残留在肺中的空气量。它在慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD）中由于气体潴留而增加；然而，在肺栓塞中它没有变化。\n\n（选项B）弥散容量因破坏肺泡毛细血管界面（例如，肺纤维化）的情况而降低，但在肺栓塞中没有改变。\n\n（选项D）肺顺应性（扩张能力）在限制性肺病（例如，肺纤维化）中降低，在COPD中增加（由于远端气道的肺气肿破坏）。然而，在肺栓塞的情况下，它没有显着改变。\n\n（选项E）总气道阻力因支气管收缩而增加，这发生在哮喘患者中。肺栓塞不影响气道阻力。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pulmonary embolism pathophysiology, specifically the concept of increased physiologic dead space due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch. The question requires recognizing the clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism and linking it to the resulting physiological changes in the lungs.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the key findings suggestive of pulmonary embolism (sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, leg swelling, tachycardia, hypoxemia) and then consider how these findings relate to lung physiology. Understanding that pulmonary embolism causes obstruction of pulmonary circulation and leads to increased dead space ventilation is crucial for selecting the correct answer.",
    "zh": "这道题测试对肺栓塞病理生理学的了解，特别是由于通气-血流比失调导致生理无效腔增加的概念。该问题要求识别肺栓塞的临床表现，并将其与肺部的相应生理变化联系起来。\n\n最好的方法是确定提示肺栓塞的关键发现（突发胸痛、呼吸短促、腿部肿胀、心动过速、低氧血症），然后考虑这些发现与肺生理学的关系。了解肺栓塞会导致肺循环阻塞并导致无效腔通气增加，这对于选择正确答案至关重要。"
