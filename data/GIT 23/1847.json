    "en": "In an animal experiment, murine proerythroblasts are cultured in 2 different growth media; the first medium is folate deficient, whereas the second (control) is supplemented with additional folic acid. Both media contain high concentrations of erythropoietin. Over 48 hours, cells in the control media proliferate and differentiate into reticulocytes, whereas in the folate-deficient media, cell proliferation is minimal, with the majority of cells undergoing apoptosis. In another experiment, a substance is added to the folate-deficient media; this substance prevents apoptosis and permits proliferation of some of the proerythroblasts. Which of the following is the most likely substance added to the growth medium?",

    "en": "Folate derivatives are crucial in the synthesis of nucleic acids (particularly thymidine), conversion of homocysteine into methionine, and generation of one-carbon carriers (eg, S-adenosylmethionine) for methylation reactions. All biochemical functions of folate require the reduced tetrahydrofolate form of the vitamin, which is synthesized by dihydrofolate reductase (a rate-limiting step in folate metabolism).\n\nThe enzyme thymidylate synthase is responsible for converting deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP). Although most enzymes involved in one-carbon metabolism maintain folate in its active tetrahydrofolate form, thymidylate synthase is unique in that it oxidizes 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to dihydrofolate. This makes de novo thymidine synthesis particularly susceptible to folate-deficient conditions because tetrahydrofolate must be continuously regenerated by dihydrofolate reductase. In this experiment, inhibition of thymidylate synthase due to deficient folate increases the ratio of dUMP to dTMP, causing the incorporation of uracil into DNA in place of thymidine. This leads to excessive activation of DNA repair mechanisms, resulting in double-stranded DNA breaks and apoptosis. Thymidine supplementation reduces the metabolic folate demand, preventing apoptosis in folate-deficient cells. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Cobalamin is a necessary cofactor for methionine synthase, the enzyme that transfers a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, forming methionine and regenerating tetrahydrofolate. Cobalamin deficiency can cause folate to become trapped in 5-methyltetrahydrofolate form, resulting in secondary folate deficiency.\n\n(Choice B) Cytosine is a pyrimidine base. Unlike thymine, it is not dependent on folate and can be synthesized in sufficient quantities under folate-deficient conditions.\n\n(Choice C) Glutamine is a major source of nitrogen in the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine bases. However, glutamine supplementation would not ameliorate the cellular apoptosis induced by folate deficiency.\n\n(Choice D) Homocysteine is an amino acid associated with endothelial cell injury and vascular inflammation. Levels are elevated in folate deficiency due to impaired conversion into methionine. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "叶酸衍生物在核酸（特别是胸苷）的合成、同型半胱氨酸转化为甲硫氨酸以及一碳载体（如 S-腺苷甲硫氨酸）的生成中至关重要，用于甲基化反应。叶酸的所有生化功能都需要维生素的还原型四氢叶酸形式，该形式由二氢叶酸还原酶合成（叶酸代谢的限速步骤）。\n\n胸苷酸合酶负责将脱氧尿苷一磷酸 (dUMP) 转化为脱氧胸苷一磷酸 (dTMP)。虽然大多数参与一碳代谢的酶都将叶酸维持在其活性四氢叶酸形式，但胸苷酸合酶是独特的，因为它将 5,10-亚甲基四氢叶酸氧化为二氢叶酸。这使得从头合成胸苷特别容易受到叶酸缺乏的影响，因为二氢叶酸还原酶必须不断再生四氢叶酸。在本实验中，由于叶酸缺乏而抑制胸苷酸合酶会增加 dUMP 与 dTMP 的比例，导致尿嘧啶取代胸苷掺入到 DNA 中。这会导致 DNA 修复机制过度激活，导致双链 DNA 断裂和凋亡。补充胸苷可减少代谢性叶酸需求，从而防止叶酸缺乏细胞的凋亡。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项 A) 钴胺素是甲硫氨酸合酶的必要辅因子，该酶将甲基从 5-甲基四氢叶酸转移到同型半胱氨酸，形成甲硫氨酸并再生四氢叶酸。钴胺素缺乏会导致叶酸被困在 5-甲基四氢叶酸形式中，从而导致继发性叶酸缺乏。\n\n(选项 B) 胞嘧啶是一种嘧啶碱基。与胸腺嘧啶不同，它不依赖于叶酸，并且可以在叶酸缺乏的条件下合成足够的量。\n\n(选项 C) 谷氨酰胺是嘌呤和嘧啶碱合成的主要氮源。然而，补充谷氨酰胺并不能改善由叶酸缺乏引起的细胞凋亡。\n\n(选项 D) 同型半胱氨酸是一种与内皮细胞损伤和血管炎症相关的氨基酸。由于转化为甲硫氨酸受损，叶酸缺乏时水平升高。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of folate's role in nucleotide synthesis, specifically thymidine production, and the consequences of folate deficiency on cell proliferation and apoptosis. It also assesses understanding of how thymidine supplementation can bypass the folate-dependent pathway.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that folate is essential for thymidine synthesis. In folate-deficient conditions, thymidine supplementation can restore cell proliferation by providing the necessary building block for DNA synthesis, bypassing the blocked folate-dependent pathway.",
