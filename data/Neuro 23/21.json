The patient woke with left-hand clumsiness that rapidly progressed to profound left-sided weakness, affecting the left arm more than the left leg. He has a history of hypertension and has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. Blood pressure is 175/90 mm Hg and pulse is 82/min and regular. Neurologic examination reveals impaired touch discrimination in the left arm with left facial weakness sparing the forehead. 2/5 muscle strength in the left upper limb, and 4/5 muscle strength in the left lower limb. Right-sided strength and visual field examinations are normal. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient most has likely had an acute ischemic stroke involving the territory supplied by the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). Patients with MCA occlusion usually present with CONTRALATERAL HEMIPARESIS and HEMISENSORY LOSS involving the face and upper limb due to infarction of the corresponding motor and sensory cortices. The contralateral lower limb is typically less affected. Other features may include spatial neglect of the contralateral side (damage to the nondominant parietal lobe) and contralateral homonymous quadrantanopia (damage to the optic radiations in the subcortical temporoparietal lobe).\n\nIf the stroke affects the dominant (usually left) hemisphere, the speech areas of the brain can be damaged. Consequently, patients with left MCA stroke (right-sided motor and sensory deficits) also often have expressive or receptive aphasia due to infarction of the Broca and Wernicke areas, respectively (Choice H).\n\n(Choices A and G) Occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery causes contralateral motor and sensory deficits, with the lower limb being affected more than the upper limb. Bilateral anterior cerebral artery occlusion can cause significant behavioral symptoms (eg, abulia), primitive reflexes (eg, Moro, grasp), and urinary incontinence due to damage of the prefrontal cortex.\n\n(Choices C and F) Saccular aneurysms often affect the anterior and posterior communicating arteries in the circle of Willis. Anterior communicating artery aneurysms can compress the central optic chiasm, causing bitemporal hemianopia. Posterior communicating artery aneurysm frequently compresses the oculomotor nerve, producing ipsilateral mydriasis, ptosis, and \"down and out\" eye deviation.\n\n(Choices D and I) Posterior cerebral artery territory infarction typically results in contralateral hemianopia due to infarction of the visual cortex. The macula is often spared due to collateral circulation from the MCA.\n\n(Choice E) Basilar artery occlusion usually damages the base of the pons, which contains the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts, and the paramedian tegmentum. Consequently, patients typically have quadriplegia, bulbar dysfunction (eg, facial weakness, dysarthria), and oculomotor deficits (eg, horizontal gaze palsy).\n\n(Choice J) Occlusion of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery causes lateral pontine syndrome. Patients with this condition typically have ipsilateral loss of pain or temperature in the face (trigeminal nucleus), ipsilateral facial weakness (facial nucleus), ipsilateral hearing impairment (cochlear nucleus), contralateral loss of pain and temperature in the trunk and extremities (lateral spinothalamic tract), and cerebellar dysfunction (eg, ataxia, dysmetria).\n\nEducational objective:\nOcclusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) typically results in contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss of the face and upper limb with relative preservation of lower limb function. If the occluded MCA is in the dominant (usually left) hemisphere, aphasia may also occur. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有涉及由右侧大脑中动脉(MCA) 供血区域的急性缺血性卒中。MCA阻塞的患者通常表现为对侧偏瘫和感觉缺失，累及面部和上肢，这是由于相应运动和感觉皮质的梗死所致。对侧下肢通常受影响较小。其他特征可能包括对对侧的忽略（损害非优势半球顶叶）和对侧同向性象限盲（损害皮质下颞顶叶的视放射）。\n\n如果卒中影响优势半球（通常是左侧），大脑的言语区域可能会受损。因此，左侧MCA卒中的患者（右侧运动和感觉缺陷）也经常因Broca区和Wernicke区分别梗死而出现表达性或接受性失语（选项H）。\n\n（选项A和G）大脑前动脉阻塞会导致对侧运动和感觉缺陷，下肢受影响大于上肢。双侧大脑前动脉阻塞可引起明显的行为症状（如，意愿缺乏）、原始反射（如，莫罗反射、抓握反射）和尿失禁，这是由于前额叶皮质受损所致。\n\n（选项C和F）囊状动脉瘤常影响Willis环的前交通动脉和后交通动脉。前交通动脉瘤可压迫中央视交叉，引起双颞侧偏盲。后交通动脉瘤常压迫动眼神经，产生同侧瞳孔扩大、眼睑下垂和“向下向外”的眼球偏斜。\n\n（选项D和I）大脑后动脉区域梗死通常会导致对侧偏盲，这是由于视觉皮质梗死所致。黄斑通常会因MCA的侧支循环而幸免于难。\n\n（选项E）基底动脉阻塞通常会损害脑桥底部，其中包含皮质脊髓束和皮质延髓束，以及正中被盖。因此，患者通常会出现四肢瘫痪、延髓功能障碍（如，面部无力、言语不清）和动眼神经缺陷（如，水平凝视麻痹）。\n\n（选项J）小脑前下动脉阻塞会导致外侧脑桥综合征。患有此病的患者通常会出现面部（三叉神经核）同侧疼痛或温度缺失、面部（面神经核）同侧无力、听力障碍（耳蜗核）同侧受损、躯干和四肢（侧束丘脑束）对侧疼痛和温度缺失以及小脑功能障碍（如，共济失调、辨距不良）。\n\n教育目标：\n大脑中动脉 (MCA) 阻塞通常会导致对侧偏瘫和感觉缺失，影响面部和上肢，而下肢功能相对保留。如果阻塞的MCA位于优势半球（通常是左侧），也可能发生失语。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the clinical presentation of middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, specifically the typical pattern of contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss affecting the face and upper limb more than the lower limb. It also tests the ability to correlate the clinical findings with the affected artery on an anatomical diagram.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the side of the body affected (left), and recognize that MCA strokes typically cause contralateral deficits. Then, correlate the clinical findings (weakness and sensory loss in the face and arm) with the anatomical location of the middle cerebral artery on the right side of the brain.",
