  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Although gift giving as an expression of gratitude is common in many cultures, accepting gifts from patients can raise complex issues in the physician-patient relationship. From an ethical standpoint, expensive gifts may influence or appear to influence the physician's professional judgment (eg, gift is given or perceived to be given in expectation of preferential treatment and/or impacts the physician's adherence to the standard of care). The consensus and professional standard are that it is unethical to accept gifts of significant monetary value. Some medical offices and hospitals implement a no-gift rule to keep things simple while others implement a dollar-amount rule.\n\nDeclining a valuable gift should be done with care to protect the patient's feelings and avoid damaging the physician-patient relationship. The physician should acknowledge the patient's generosity and thoughtfulness behind the gift, explain why the gift cannot be accepted (eg, personal, practice, or hospital policy), and assure the patient that this does not in any way change the care provided. Accepting gifts of low monetary value given as a token of appreciation or cultural tradition and that are not intended to influence care is generally considered appropriate (eg, homemade, small gifts that are clearly inexpensive). In this situation, it would be appropriate to accept the cookies and card but decline the expensive tickets with an explanation.\n\n(Choices A and C) Accepting low monetary value gifts is not unethical, and the physician should accept the cookies and thank-you card to be sensitive to the patient's feelings. Rejecting this low monetary value, homemade gift could be perceived as rude or hurtful, potentially damaging the physician-patient relationship.\n\n(Choice D) It is inappropriate to accept an expensive gift on a conditional basis.\n\n(Choice E) It is ethically problematic to accept the expensive tickets, even with the intention of sharing them with the office staff. The patient may feel obligated to provide gifts to the office staff, and the staff may feel compelled to provide preferential treatment to the patient.\n\nEducational objective:\nIt is ethically problematic for physicians to accept expensive gifts as they may influence or appear to influence professional judgment. These gifts should be declined after expressing appreciation for the gesture.",
    "zh": "虽然在许多文化中，赠送礼物作为表达感激之情是很常见的，但接受患者的礼物可能会引发医患关系中的复杂问题。从伦理角度来看，贵重的礼物可能会影响或似乎影响医生的专业判断（例如，赠送或被认为赠送礼物是为了期望获得优先待遇和/或影响医生对护理标准的遵守）。共识和专业标准是，接受具有重大货币价值的礼物是不道德的。一些医疗办公室和医院实施了禁止礼物的规定以保持简单，而另一些则实施了金额规定。\n\n拒绝贵重礼物时应谨慎行事，以保护患者的感受并避免损害医患关系。医生应承认患者在礼物背后的慷慨和体贴，解释为什么不能接受礼物（例如，个人、执业或医院政策），并向患者保证这绝不会以任何方式改变所提供的护理。接受作为感谢或文化传统象征且无意影响护理的低货币价值礼物通常被认为是合适的（例如，自制、明显不贵的、小礼物）。在这种情况下，接受饼干和卡片，但拒绝贵重的票并附上解释是合适的。\n\n（选项A和C）接受低货币价值的礼物并不违背伦理，医生应接受饼干和感谢卡，以体谅患者的感受。拒绝这种低货币价值的自制礼物可能会被认为是粗鲁或伤人的，从而可能损害医患关系。\n\n（选项D）有条件地接受贵重礼物是不合适的。\n\n（选项E）接受贵重门票在伦理上是有问题的，即使目的是与办公室工作人员分享。患者可能会感到有义务向办公室工作人员赠送礼物，而工作人员可能会感到被迫向患者提供优先待遇。\n\n教育目标：\n医生接受贵重礼物在伦理上是有问题的，因为它们可能会影响或似乎影响专业判断。在表达对该姿态的感谢后，应拒绝这些礼物。"
