    "en": "A 23-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to right wrist pain after a fall. The patient fell on her outstretched hand while walking across the floor at a gym where she exercises regularly. She has no significant medical history and takes no medications. The patient says she avoids eating high-fat or high-carbohydrate foods because she wants to avoid \"getting bloated\" and \"gaining fat.\" Her last menstrual period was 7 months ago. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Temperature is 35.9 C (96.6 F), blood pressure is 90/58 mm Hg, and pulse is 48/min. BMI is 18 kg/m². Tenderness and swelling are present over the right distal radius. The parotid glands are enlarged and there are fine, soft hairs on her extremities. Urine pregnancy test is negative. X-ray reveals a nondisplaced fracture of the right distal radius and generalized radiolucency of the bone. Which of the following is the most likely underlying diagnosis? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a restricted diet, thin body habitus, and amenorrhea (last menstrual cycle 7 months ago); these features suggest functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA), characterized by a low-estrogen state due to suppression of GnRH by chronic energy deficits. Hypoestrogenism in FHA increases the risk for OSTEOPOROSIS, suggested by this patient's low-trauma fragility fracture (eg, fall from standing height).\n\nFHA is a potential manifestation of ANOREXIA NERVOSA (AN), an eating disorder that should be suspected in patients with the following:\n\n*   Low BMI (<18.5 kg/m²)\n*   Restrictive eating patterns or purging behaviors (eg, self-induced vomiting leading to parotid hypertrophy)\n*   Physiologic changes arising from chronic caloric deficits and associated clinical starvation (eg, bradycardia, osteoporosis, lanugo [ie, fine, downy body hair])\n*   Distorted body image and abnormal fear of gaining weight\n\nLike AN, bulimia nervosa is characterized by abnormal fear of gaining weight; however, the predominant behavior pattern includes cycles of binge eating with purging (eg, vomiting, laxative abuse), and BMI is generally normal or near-normal. Electrolyte disorders are common, but manifestations of clinical starvation, seen in this patient (eg, FHA, lanugo, osteoporosis), are inconsistent with bulimia nervosa (Choice C).\n\n(Choice B) Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is characterized by inadequate food intake due to lack of interest in eating (eg, dislike of sensory experience of eating). Patients may have low BMI and signs of nutritional deficiency, but fear of gaining fat and distorted body image are not seen.\n\n(Choices D and E) Celiac disease and hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss and osteoporosis. However, the patient's fear of gaining fat suggests an alternate diagnosis; moreover, parotid gland swelling, bradycardia, and hypothermia are not expected in either of these conditions.\n\nEducational objective: Anorexia nervosa is characterized by low body weight (BMI<18.5 kg/m²), fear of becoming fat, and distorted body image. Unlike other patterns of restrictive eating (eg, bulimia nervosa), patients with anorexia nervosa experience complications of progressive clinical starvation, such as bradycardia, osteoporosis, and amenorrhea.",
    "zh": "该患者有饮食限制、瘦弱体格和闭经（上次月经7个月前）；这些特征提示功能性下丘脑闭经（FHA），其特征是由于慢性能量不足抑制GnRH而导致的低雌激素状态。FHA中的低雌激素血症增加了骨质疏松症的风险，这从该患者的低创伤性脆性骨折（如站立高度跌倒）可以看出。\n\nFHA是神经性厌食症（AN）的一种潜在表现，在具有以下特征的患者中应怀疑AN：\n\n*   低BMI（<18.5 kg/m²）\n*   限制性饮食模式或清除行为（例如，自我诱导呕吐导致腮腺肥大）\n*   由慢性热量不足和相关的临床饥饿引起的生理变化（例如，心动过缓、骨质疏松、毳毛[即，细而柔软的体毛]）\n*   扭曲的身体形象和对体重增加的异常恐惧\n\n与AN一样，神经性贪食症的特征是对体重增加的异常恐惧；然而，主要的行为模式包括暴饮暴食和清除（例如，呕吐、滥用泻药），并且BMI通常正常或接近正常。电解质紊乱很常见，但该患者出现的临床饥饿表现（例如，FHA、毳毛、骨质疏松）与神经性贪食症不一致（选项C）。\n\n（选项B）回避/限制性食物摄入障碍的特征是由于对进食不感兴趣（例如，不喜欢进食的感官体验）而导致的食物摄入不足。患者可能BMI较低，并出现营养不良的迹象，但没有对发胖的恐惧和扭曲的身体形象。\n\n（选项D和E）腹腔疾病和甲状腺功能亢进可引起体重减轻和骨质疏松。然而，患者对发胖的恐惧提示了另一种诊断；此外，腮腺肿胀、心动过缓和体温过低在这两种情况下均不常见。\n\n教学目标：神经性厌食症的特征是体重过低（BMI<18.5 kg/m²）、害怕发胖和扭曲的身体形象。与其他限制性饮食模式（例如，神经性贪食症）不同，神经性厌食症患者会经历进行性临床饥饿的并发症，例如心动过缓、骨质疏松和闭经。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of anorexia nervosa diagnostic criteria and associated complications, specifically focusing on the clinical presentation and risk factors for osteoporosis. It requires recognizing the constellation of symptoms, including low BMI, restrictive eating, amenorrhea, bradycardia, and lanugo, as indicative of anorexia nervosa. \n\nTo solve this question, identify the key features of the patient's presentation that align with the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa. Rule out other conditions based on the presence or absence of specific symptoms, such as fear of gaining weight or binge-purge cycles.",
