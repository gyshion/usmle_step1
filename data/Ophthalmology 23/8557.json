    "en": "A 34-year-old woman comes to the office due to double vision. The patient first experienced difficulty focusing her eyes while at work yesterday. On awakening this morning, her symptoms had progressed to frank diplopia. Medical history is insignificant. A complete physical examination is performed, including a full neurologic assessment. Shining light into the patient's right eye causes constriction of her right pupil, but not the left pupil. Shining light into her left eye causes constriction of only her right pupil. Which of the following additional physical examination findings is likely to be found in this patient?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has diplopia (suggesting a lesion impacting extraocular muscles) and a left efferent pupillary defect (absent left pupillary response when light enters either eye). This is likely due to dysfunction of the left oculomotor nerve (CN III), which has multiple functions:\n\n* Innervation of most of the extraocular muscles (superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, inferior oblique). Paralysis of these muscles leads to unopposed action of the superior oblique and lateral rectus, which results in the characteristic \"down and out\" pupil.\n* Parasympathetic fibers innervate the iris sphincter and ciliary muscle. Paralysis of these fibers causes an efferent pupillary defect, as seen in this patient.\n* Somatic innervation of the levator palpebrae superioris. This elevates the upper eyelid, and paralysis of it leads to ptosis (ie, drooping of the eyelid).\n\nAlthough the most common causes of acquired oculomotor nerve palsy are diabetes mellitus and hypertensive ischemia, patients are often evaluated with neuroimaging to rule out an enlarging aneurysm of the posterior-communicating artery, which can present with isolated CN III palsy.\n\n(Choice A) Absence of the left corneal reflex (corneal stimulation causes orbicularis oculi to contract the eyelids) can result from lesions involving the afferent limb (CN V) or efferent limb (CN VII).\n\n(Choice C) A lesion involving the left CN VII would result in the inability to close the left eye due to paralysis of the orbicularis oculi muscle.\n\n(Choice D) Inward deviation of the left eye would result from paralysis of the lateral rectus, which is innervated by the abducens nerve (CN VI).\n\n(Choice E) The left optic nerve (CN II) is functional in this patient because light shining into the left eye produced a consensual pupillary response in the right eye.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe oculomotor nerve (CN III) provides innervation to many of the extraocular muscles (superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, inferior oblique); parasympathetic innervation to the pupil; and somatic innervation of the levator palpebrae superioris. Dysfunction of CN III leads to a characteristic triad of a \"down and out\" pupil, an efferent pupillary defect, and ptosis.",
    "zh": "该患者出现复视（提示影响眼外肌的病变）和左侧传出性瞳孔缺陷（当光线进入任一眼时，左侧瞳孔无反应）。这很可能由于左侧动眼神经 (CN III) 功能障碍所致，该神经具有多种功能：\n\n* 支配大多数眼外肌（上直肌、内直肌、下直肌、下斜肌）。这些肌肉麻痹会导致上斜肌和外直肌的拮抗作用，从而导致特征性的“向下和向外”瞳孔。\n* 副交感神经纤维支配虹膜括约肌和睫状肌。这些纤维的麻痹会导致传出性瞳孔缺陷，如该患者所见。\n* 躯体神经支配提上睑肌。这抬高上眼睑，其麻痹会导致上睑下垂（即眼睑下垂）。\n\n尽管获得性动眼神经麻痹最常见的原因是糖尿病和高血压性缺血，但患者通常会接受神经影像学检查，以排除后交通动脉扩张性动脉瘤，这种动脉瘤可表现为孤立性 CN III 麻痹。\n\n（选项 A）左侧角膜反射缺失（角膜刺激导致眼轮匝肌收缩眼睑）可能是由涉及传入支 (CN V) 或传出支 (CN VII) 的病变引起的。\n\n（选项 C）涉及左侧 CN VII 的病变将导致由于眼轮匝肌麻痹而无法闭合左眼。\n\n（选项 D）左眼内斜将是由于外展神经 (CN VI) 支配的外直肌麻痹所致。\n\n（选项 E）该患者的左侧视神经 (CN II) 功能正常，因为光线照射到左眼会在右眼产生一致的瞳孔反应。\n\n教学目标：\n动眼神经 (CN III) 为许多眼外肌（上直肌、内直肌、下直肌、下斜肌）提供神经支配；为瞳孔提供副交感神经支配；并为提上睑肌提供躯体神经支配。CN III 功能障碍会导致特征性的三联征，即“向下和向外”瞳孔、传出性瞳孔缺陷和上睑下垂。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical manifestations of oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy. It requires correlating the patient's symptoms of diplopia and pupillary abnormalities with the specific functions of CN III, including its motor innervation to extraocular muscles and the levator palpebrae superioris, as well as its parasympathetic innervation to the iris sphincter.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the likely nerve palsy based on the pupillary findings and diplopia. Then, recall the specific functions of the affected nerve and predict the associated physical examination findings. The options provided represent potential deficits related to cranial nerves controlling eye movements and eyelid function, allowing for differential diagnosis.",
    "zh": "此问题测试对动眼神经 (CN III) 麻痹的临床表现的理解。它需要将患者的复视和瞳孔异常症状与 CN III 的特定功能相关联，包括其对眼外肌和提上睑肌的运动神经支配，以及其对虹膜括约肌的副交感神经支配。\n\n要解决这个问题，首先必须根据瞳孔检查结果和复视确定可能的神经麻痹。然后，回忆受影响神经的特定功能并预测相关的体格检查结果。所提供的选项代表与控制眼球运动和眼睑功能的脑神经相关的潜在缺陷，从而允许进行鉴别诊断。"
