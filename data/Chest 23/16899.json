While doing yard work, the patient fell off of a ladder, striking his back on several large stones. Immediately afterward, he felt sharp pain over his posterior chest and had trouble catching his breath. Blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 24/min. Chest x-ray is shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}. Physical examination of the right side of the chest would most likely reveal which of the following?",

    "en": "This patient experienced sudden-onset shortness of breath and chest pain following chest trauma; chest x-ray {{exhibit_2}} shows several rib fractures and a collapsed right lung, findings consistent with traumatic pneumothorax.\n\nTraumatic pneumothorax can result from puncture of either the chest wall (eg, penetrating chest trauma) or the lung (eg, by fractured ribs), allowing air to enter the pleural space. The communication pathway causes intrapleural pressure to equalize with atmospheric pressure (ie, loss of intrapleural negative pressure), which prevents lung expansion during inspiration and leads to breathing difficulty.\n\nBecause air in the pleural space insulates sounds and vibrations originating in the airways, physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds and decreased tactile fremitus on the affected side. In addition, the relatively low density of air compared to normal lung tissue causes hyperresonance to percussion. Disruption of the skin or parietal pleura during the initial injury often allows air to enter the subcutaneous tissues of the chest wall, which is detected as subcutaneous crepitus (ie, crackling during palpation).\n\n(Choice A) Bronchophony is a phenomenon in which spoken words (eg, \"ninety-nine,\" \"toy boat\") are heard more loudly and clearly when auscultated over an area of alveolar consolidation (eg, lobar pneumonia) compared to normal lung. It results from increased sound transmission due to increased tissue density.\n\n(Choice B) Dullness to percussion over the chest is expected with conditions that cause increased density (eg, hemothorax, pleural effusion, alveolar consolidation) compared to normal lung tissue.\n\n(Choice C) The increased thoracic pressure with pneumothorax flattens the resting position of the diaphragm and restricts its movement with respiration. Therefore, diaphragmatic excursion (the distance the diaphragm moves between expiration and inspiration) is decreased.\n\n(Choices D and F) Prolonged expiration and wheezing are expected with bronchoconstriction, usually in the setting of obstructive lung disease (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Bronchoconstriction is not expected with pneumothorax.\n\nEducational objective:\nTraumatic pneumothorax can involve puncture of either the chest wall (eg, penetrating chest trauma) or the lung (eg, by fractured ribs), allowing air to enter the pleural space. Patients usually experience chest pain and difficulty breathing. Crepitus, caused by air in the subcutaneous tissues of the chest wall, is often present on physical examination. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "该患者在胸部外伤后出现突发性呼吸困难和胸痛；胸部X光片{{exhibit_2}}显示有多处肋骨骨折和右肺萎陷，这些发现与创伤性气胸一致。\n\n创伤性气胸可能由胸壁（例如，穿透性胸部外伤）或肺（例如，肋骨骨折）的穿刺引起，导致空气进入胸膜腔。这种通道使胸腔内压力与大气压相等（即，胸腔内负压消失），这会阻止吸气时的肺扩张并导致呼吸困难。\n\n由于胸膜腔内的空气隔离了来自气道的声响和振动，体格检查显示受影响一侧的呼吸音减弱和触觉语颤减弱。此外，与正常肺组织相比，空气的相对低密度会导致叩诊呈过清音。在最初的损伤过程中，皮肤或壁层胸膜的破坏通常允许空气进入胸壁的皮下组织，这被检测为皮下捻发音（即，触诊时有爆裂声）。\n\n(选项A) 支气管语音是一种现象，当听诊于肺泡实变区域（例如，大叶性肺炎）时，说话声（例如，“九十九”，“玩具船”）比正常肺听起来更大声、更清晰。这是由于组织密度增加导致声音传播增加。\n\n(选项B) 与正常肺组织相比，在胸部叩诊时出现浊音预计是由于导致密度增加的情况（例如，血胸、胸腔积液、肺泡实变）。\n\n(选项C) 气胸时增加的胸腔压力会使膈肌的静止位置变平，并限制其在呼吸时的运动。因此，膈肌活动度（膈肌在呼气和吸气之间移动的距离）降低。\n\n(选项D和F) 呼气延长和喘息预计发生在支气管收缩时，通常发生在阻塞性肺病（例如，哮喘、慢性阻塞性肺病）的情况下。气胸预计不会出现支气管收缩。\n\n教育目标：\n创伤性气胸可能涉及胸壁（例如，穿透性胸部外伤）或肺（例如，肋骨骨折）的穿刺，从而允许空气进入胸膜腔。患者通常会经历胸痛和呼吸困难。皮下捻发音，由胸壁皮下组织中的空气引起，通常存在于体格检查中。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of traumatic pneumothorax, its clinical presentation, and associated physical exam findings. Specifically, it assesses the ability to recognize subcutaneous crepitus as a key finding in pneumothorax due to air leaking into subcutaneous tissues. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the mechanism of injury (fall, rib fractures), the symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath), and then associate these with the expected physical exam findings in pneumothorax, particularly subcutaneous crepitus.",
