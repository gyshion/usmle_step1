    "en": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the office due to headaches that have worsened progressively over the past month and are most severe when lying down. He also has had nonbloody, nonbillious emesis for 2 weeks that typically occurs early in the morning. The child has intermittent blurry vision, particularly when looking up at the mirror while brushing his teeth. Physical examination shows bilateral papilledema, inability to gaze upwards, and bilateral eyelid retraction. Laboratory testing of sodium, growth hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is normal. Given the early morning emesis and papilledema, a brain mass is suspected and a brain MRI is ordered. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient has a pineal gland mass. Classic manifestations of a pineal mass include obstructive hydrocephalus from aqueductal stenosis (papilledema, headache, and vomiting) and dorsal midbrain (Parinaud) syndrome due to direct compression of the pretectal region of the midbrain. Parinaud syndrome is characterized by limitation of upward gaze with a downward gaze preference, bilateral eyelid retraction (eg, Collier sign, sclera visible above the superior corneal limbus), and light-near dissociation (eg, pupils that react to accommodation but not to light). Diagnosis of pineal gland mass is made by brain MRI.\n\nThe most common pineal mass is a germinoma, a midline malignant tumor thought to arise from embryonic germ cells. A germinoma can also arise in the gonads or mediastinum and is more common in young boys. The most common locations for intracranial germinomas are the pineal gland and the suprasellar region (less common site).\n(Choice A) Due to their proximity to the pituitary gland and hypothalamus, suprasellar germinomas do not lead to Parinaud syndrome, but they are more likely to present with endocrinopathies (eg, central precocious puberty, diabetes insipidus).\n(Choice B) Primary thalamic tumors are rare. Damage to the thalamus from a mass or more commonly infarction/hemorrhage presents with contralateral hemisensory loss, behavioral changes, and language deficits.\n(Choice D) Pontine hemorrhage or tumor may cause \"locked-in\" syndrome, which is characterized by spastic quadriplegia and paralysis of most cranial nerves (CNs) with preserved consciousness and eye movements.\n(Choice E) The most common cerebellar tumor in children is medulloblastoma, which typically presents with gait and limb ataxia, intention tremor, and nystagmus.\n(Choice F) Lesions of the medulla can cause lateral and medial medullary syndromes. Lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome leads to contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensations along with ipsilateral paralysis of CNs V, IX, and X. Medial medullary syndrome causes contralateral spastic paralysis, contralateral sensory loss of vibration and proprioception, and ipsilateral flaccid paralysis of the tongue (CN XII).\n\nEducational objective:\nGerminomas are the most common pineal gland tumor and present with obstructive hydrocephalus and dorsal midbrain (Parinaud) syndrome. Germinomas in the suprasellar region cause endocrinopathies due to pituitary/hypothalamic dysfunction.",
    "zh": "该患者患有松果体肿块。松果体肿块的典型表现包括由于导水管狭窄引起的梗阻性脑积水（视乳头水肿、头痛和呕吐）和由于直接压迫中脑的视前区引起的背侧中脑（帕里诺）综合征。帕里诺综合征的特征是向上凝视受限，向下凝视优先，双侧眼睑回缩（例如，科利尔征，角膜缘上方的巩膜可见）和光-近反应分离（例如，对调节反应但对光无反应的瞳孔）。通过脑MRI诊断松果体肿块。\n\n最常见的松果体肿块是生殖细胞瘤，这是一种中线恶性肿瘤，被认为起源于胚胎生殖细胞。生殖细胞瘤也可以发生在性腺或纵隔，并且在年轻男孩中更常见。颅内生殖细胞瘤最常见的部位是松果体和鞍上区（不太常见的部位）。\n(选项A) 由于靠近垂体和下丘脑，鞍上生殖细胞瘤不会导致帕里诺综合征，但它们更有可能表现为内分泌病变（例如，中枢性性早熟、尿崩症）。\n(选项B) 原发性丘脑肿瘤很少见。由于肿块或更常见的是梗死/出血对丘脑的损伤表现为对侧半感觉缺失、行为改变和语言障碍。\n(选项D) 脑桥出血或肿瘤可能导致“闭锁”综合征，其特征是痉挛性四肢瘫痪和大多数脑神经（CNs）麻痹，但意识和眼球运动保留。\n(选项E) 儿童中最常见的脑肿瘤是髓母细胞瘤，通常表现为步态和肢体共济失调、意向性震颤和眼球震颤。\n(选项F) 延髓病变可引起外侧和内侧延髓综合征。外侧延髓（瓦伦伯格）综合征导致对侧疼痛和温度感觉缺失以及同侧CN V、IX和X麻痹。内侧延髓综合征导致对侧痉挛性瘫痪、对侧振动和本体感觉缺失以及同侧舌头（CN XII）的弛缓性麻痹。\n\n教育目标：\n生殖细胞瘤是最常见的松果体肿瘤，表现为梗阻性脑积水和背侧中脑（帕里诺）综合征。鞍上区的生殖细胞瘤由于垂体/下丘脑功能障碍而导致内分泌病变。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation and neuroimaging localization of a pineal gland mass, specifically a germinoma, in a pediatric patient. It assesses the ability to correlate symptoms like headaches, vomiting, papilledema, and visual disturbances with specific anatomical structures and their pathological involvement.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the constellation of symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure and dorsal midbrain compression. Then, by interpreting the provided MRI image, the labeled anatomical structures should be identified. Finally, knowledge of common brain tumors and their typical locations, particularly pineal region tumors and their associated syndromes, is required to pinpoint the most likely site of the lesion.",
