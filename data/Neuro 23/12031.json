    "en": "A 54-year-old woman is evaluated in the clinic due to easy fatigability. The patient has had no weight gain or cold intolerance and has no history of thyroid conditions. Medical history is significant for gastrectomy due to a nonhealing gastric ulcer. Physical examination shows a shiny tongue and pale palmar creases. The patient's gait is unstable when her eyes are closed, and vibration sense is decreased in the upper and lower extremities. There is mild, symmetric loss of strength affecting the proximal lower extremity muscles. Blood hemoglobin level is 7.2 g/dL and white blood cell count is 3,600/mm³. Stool tests for occult blood are repeatedly negative. Which of the following spinal cord regions is most likely to be affected by this patient's disease process? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient most likely has subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, a condition that results from chronically low levels of vitamin B₁₂ (cobalamin). Low cobalamin levels may occur due to pernicious anemia (autoimmune gastritis with deficient intrinsic factor), gastrectomy, ileal resections, infection by the tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum, and strict vegan diets containing no animal products for a prolonged period (3–4 years).\n\nVitamin B₁₂ is an important cofactor in DNA synthesis, and hematologic manifestations of deficiency include megaloblastic anemia and pancytopenia. This patient's pale palmar crease and easy fatigability are consistent with anemia.\n\nElevated levels of methylmalonic acid also occur in vitamin B₁₂ deficiency and can destabilize myelin and damage white matter in particular regions of the spinal cord:\n\n*   Dorsal columns (loss of position and vibration sensation, sensory ataxia [Romberg sign])\n*   Lateral corticospinal tracts (progressive weakness that can result in spastic paresis)\n*   Spinocerebellar tracts (contributes to ataxia)\n\nPatients may also develop atrophic glossitis, which appears as a smooth, shiny, erythematous tongue.\n\n(Choice A) Poliomyelitis and spinal muscular atrophy are associated with the destruction of lower motor neurons in the anterior horn, which causes flaccid paralysis, muscle atrophy, and fasciculations.\n\n(Choice B) Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder affecting the white matter of the CNS in a random and asymmetric pattern. Patients typically have neurologic deficits disseminated in space and time.\n\n(Choice C) Tabes dorsales (tertiary neurosyphilis) is characterized by degeneration of the dorsal root ganglia and dorsal columns. Although patients may have impaired vibratory sensation and proprioception, pancytopenia and atrophic glossitis are not characteristic. In addition, tabes dorsales does not typically affect the lateral corticospinal tracts.\n\n(Choice E) Syringomyelia is a central cavitation of the cervical spinal cord that is associated with damage to the anterior white commissure of the spinothalamic tract. Patients typically have bilateral loss of pain/temperature in the upper extremities. Expansion into the ventral horns may result in flaccid paralysis of the hand muscles.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nNeurologic damage associated with vitamin B₁₂ deficiency classically includes subacute combined degeneration of the dorsal columns (loss of position and vibration sensation, positive Romberg sign) and lateral corticospinal tracts (muscle weakness, spastic paresis). {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有脊髓亚急性联合变性，这是一种由慢性维生素B₁₂（钴胺素）水平低引起的疾病。钴胺素水平低可能由于恶性贫血（自身免疫性胃炎伴内因子缺乏）、胃切除术、回肠切除术、阔节裂头绦虫感染以及长期（3-4年）不含动物制品的严格素食饮食引起。\n\n维生素B₁₂是DNA合成中的重要辅助因子，缺乏的血液学表现包括巨幼细胞性贫血和全血细胞减少。该患者苍白的手掌纹和易疲劳与贫血一致。\n\n甲基丙二酸水平升高也发生在维生素B₁₂缺乏症中，并且可以使髓鞘不稳定，并损伤脊髓的特定区域的白质：\n\n*   后柱（位置和震动觉丧失，感觉性共济失调[Romberg征]）\n*   侧皮质脊髓束（进行性无力，可导致痉挛性轻瘫）\n*   脊髓小脑束（导致共济失调）\n\n患者还可能出现萎缩性舌炎，表现为舌头光滑、发亮、发红。\n\n(选项A) 脊髓灰质炎和脊髓性肌萎缩与前角下运动神经元的破坏有关，导致弛缓性麻痹、肌肉萎缩和肌束颤动。\n\n(选项B) 多发性硬化症是一种炎症性脱髓鞘疾病，以随机和不对称的方式影响中枢神经系统的白质。患者通常具有时空分布的神经功能缺损。\n\n(选项C) 背髓痨（三期神经梅毒）的特征是背根神经节和后柱变性。尽管患者可能存在震动觉和本体感觉受损，但全血细胞减少和萎缩性舌炎并非其特征。此外，背髓痨通常不影响侧皮质脊髓束。\n\n(选项E) 脊髓空洞症是颈脊髓的中央空洞形成，与脊髓丘脑束前白质联合的损伤有关。患者通常出现上肢双侧疼痛/温度觉丧失。向腹角扩展可能导致手部肌肉弛缓性麻痹。\n\n教学目标：\n\n与维生素B₁₂缺乏相关的神经系统损伤通常包括后柱亚急性联合变性（位置和震动觉丧失，Romberg征阳性）和侧皮质脊髓束（肌无力，痉挛性轻瘫）。{{exhibit_2}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord due to vitamin B12 deficiency, focusing on the specific spinal cord tracts affected and the associated clinical manifestations. It also requires differentiating this condition from other spinal cord disorders based on their distinct patterns of neurological deficits. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical features of vitamin B12 deficiency (anemia, glossitis, sensory ataxia, weakness) and associate them with the specific spinal cord tracts involved in subacute combined degeneration (dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts). Eliminate other options based on their different clinical presentations and affected spinal cord regions.",
