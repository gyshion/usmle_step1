    "en": "A 4-year-old boy is being evaluated for failure to thrive, shortness of breath, and exercise intolerance. The parents first became aware of his symptoms after the patient started preschool a few weeks ago. His teacher mentioned that the patient seemed to tire faster than the other children when playing outside. Cardiac examination shows bounding peripheral pulses and a palpable thrill below the clavicle near the left upper sternal border. On auscultation, a continuous murmur is best heard over the same region. After discussion with the parents, a thoracotomy is scheduled to correct the patient's condition. During the procedure, the surgeon should plan on ligating a derivative of which of the following embryologic structures?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient most likely has a PATENT DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS (PDA). The ductus arteriosus is an embryonic derivative of the SIXTH AORTIC ARCH that allows fetal blood to pass directly from the pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta (bypassing the pulmonary circulation). This vessel usually closes shortly after birth, secondary to decreased prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) levels and increased oxygen concentration. Patency of the ductus after birth results in a LEFT-TO-RIGHT SHUNT that can cause left ventricular volume overload and symptoms of HEART FAILURE (eg, failure to thrive, respiratory distress). Physical examination will show a continuous \"machinery-like\" murmur and palpable thrill over the LEFT INFRACLAVICULAR REGION due to turbulent blood flow through the PDA.\n\nPharmacologic closure of a PDA can be achieved by PGE₂ SYNTHESIS INHIBITORS (eg, indomethacin) in premature infants. However, older patients usually require SURGICAL LIGATION or percutaneous PDA occlusion.\n\n(Choice A) The bulbus cordis forms the beginning of the ventricular outflow tract in the embryonic heart. This structure forms the smooth portions of the left and right ventricles adjacent to the aorta and pulmonary artery, respectively.\n\n(Choice B) The fourth aortic arch on the left forms the arch of the aorta between the left carotid artery and ductus arteriosus. Abnormalities during development can result in coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta, which can present with continuous murmurs over the back due to collateral formation.\n\n(Choice C) The primitive atrium receives blood from the sinus venosus in the embryonic heart and transmits it to the primitive ventricle. The primitive atrium forms the rough portions of the left and right atria.\n\n(Choice D) The sinus venosus is an embryologic structure within the heart that receives blood from the vena cava. In adults, this structure forms the smooth portion of the right atrium, known as the sinus venarum.",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有动脉导管未闭 (PDA)。动脉导管是第六主动脉弓的胚胎衍生物，它允许胎儿血液直接从肺动脉流向近端降主动脉（绕过肺循环）。该血管通常在出生后不久关闭，这继发于前列腺素E₂ (PGE₂)水平降低和氧气浓度升高。出生后动脉导管的开放会导致左向右分流，这可引起左心室容量超负荷和心力衰竭的症状（例如，生长迟缓、呼吸窘迫）。体格检查将显示连续的“机器样”杂音和在左锁骨下区可触及的震颤，这归因于通过 PDA 的湍流血流。\n\n可以通过PGE₂合成抑制剂（例如，吲哚美辛）在早产儿中实现PDA的药物学闭合。然而，年龄较大的患者通常需要手术结扎或经皮PDA闭合。\n\n(选项A) 球状动脉干形成胚胎心脏中室性流出道起始部分。该结构分别形成了与主动脉和肺动脉相邻的左心室和平滑部分。\n\n(选项B) 左侧的第四主动脉弓形成了左颈动脉和动脉导管之间的主动脉弓。发育过程中的异常可导致主动脉缩窄（狭窄），这可能因侧支形成而在背部出现连续性杂音。\n\n(选项C) 原始心房从胚胎心脏的静脉窦接收血液，并将其传输到原始心室。原始心房形成了左心房和右心房的粗糙部分。\n\n(选项D) 静脉窦是心脏内的一个胚胎结构，它接收来自腔静脉的血液。在成人中，该结构形成了右心房的平滑部分，称为静脉窦。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the embryological origin of the ductus arteriosus and its clinical presentation when it remains patent after birth. It requires recognizing the signs and symptoms of a patent ductus arteriosus and linking it to the sixth aortic arch.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key findings suggestive of PDA (continuous murmur, bounding pulses, thrill) and recall that the ductus arteriosus is derived from the sixth aortic arch. Eliminate other options based on their embryological origins.",
