    "en": "A 62-year-old man comes to the office due to pain while swallowing for the past 4 weeks. He has had no fever, upper respiratory illness, or cough but has noticed a lump on the left upper anterior neck. Medical history is significant for prolonged tobacco use. Physical examination shows a firm mass at the base of the tongue. CT scan confirms a 3-cm mass at the tongue base with a small central area of necrosis. Several anterior cervical lymph nodes are enlarged on the left side. Biopsy of the tongue lesion shows invasive squamous cell carcinoma. External beam radiation therapy is planned. Malignant cells in which of the following portions of the tumor mass would be most resistant to this treatment?",

    "en": "Radiation therapy damages cells by inducing DNA strand breaks by breaking DNA strands both directly and indirectly (via the production of free radicals). Approximately two-thirds of the effect of ionizing radiation is due to the formation of destructive reactive oxygen species derived from radiolysis of water. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nHowever, tumors generally have highly irregular and poorly formed vasculature systems, leading to regions that are significantly hypoxic. Hypoxic tumor cells are often resistant to the effects of radiation. Oxygen augments the DNA damage induced by free radicals by forming persistent DNA adducts that cannot be easily repaired. In contrast, in the hypoxic environment, free radicals are more easily scavenged and eliminated by reducing compounds (eg, molecules that contain sulfhydryl groups), resulting in improved DNA repair. In addition, hypoxic tumor cells overexpress hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha, leading to the upregulation of pathways that increase antioxidant production.\n\nBecause solid tumors commonly contain hypoxic regions, radiation therapy alone is rarely curative; it is usually combined with other treatment modalities (eg, chemotherapy, surgery).\n\n(Choice A) Tumors that have a high amount of T-lymphocyte infiltration are often more resistant to treatment with immunotherapy medications because regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment exert a strong immunosuppressive effect. T-lymphocyte infiltration would not significantly promote resistance to radiation therapy.\n\n(Choice C) Lymphatic invasion is associated with more aggressive and advanced tumors but does not affect the efficacy of radiation therapy.\n\n(Choice D) Rapidly dividing neoplastic cells are more sensitive to radiation therapy due to the decreased time for DNA repair.\n\nEducational objective:\nRadiation therapy damages cells by inducing DNA strand breaks. Most of the effect of ionizing radiation is mediated by the production of reactive oxygen species, and hypoxic tumor regions are most resistant to radiotherapy.",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the mechanism of radiation therapy and the factors that influence tumor cell sensitivity to radiation, specifically the role of hypoxia. It requires understanding that radiation induces DNA damage via free radicals, and hypoxic conditions reduce the effectiveness of this process. \n\nTo solve this question, recall that radiation therapy works by damaging DNA. Hypoxic tumor cells are resistant to radiation because oxygen is needed for the formation of destructive reactive oxygen species. Therefore, regions with lower tissue oxygenation are most resistant.",
