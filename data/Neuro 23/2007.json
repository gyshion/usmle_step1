  "explanation": {
    "en": "Equilibrium potentials of cellular ions reflect how they affect the membrane potential if the membrane were permeable solely for that ion. The resting membrane potential shown in the graph is negative, indicating that at rest, the membrane is permeable to an ion with a negative equilibrium potential (potassium or chloride).\n\nOpening of Ligand-gated ion channels in response to neurotransmitter binding (black arrow) causes an increase in membrane potential to above zero. This indicates that the membrane has become permeable for an ion with a positive equilibrium potential (sodium or calcium). Opening of voltage-gated ion channels in response to the change in membrane potential (red arrow) causes a drop in membrane potential, indicating that the membrane becomes permeable to an ion with a negative equilibrium potential (potassium or chloride).\n\n(Choices A and B) If the membrane were permeable for sodium at rest, the resting membrane potential would be positive as the equilibrium potential of sodium is +60 mV.\n\n(Choices C and D) Had the membrane become more permeable for calcium or sodium following the opening of the voltage-gated ion channels, the membrane potential would have remained positive as both ions have positive equilibrium potentials.",

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of how changes in neuronal membrane permeability to various ions affect the membrane potential, based on their equilibrium potentials. The key to solving this question is to analyze the graph of membrane potential changes and relate them to the equilibrium potentials of sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride, considering the sequence of ion channel openings.",
