    "en": "A 65-year-old man comes to the office with dysphagia. For the last 3 months, he has relied on protein shakes and juices for nourishment as he has had difficulty swallowing solid foods. He has also had a diminished appetite and an estimated weight loss of 9.1 kg (20 lb). Medical history includes hyperlipidemia, emphysema, and previous episodes of pancreatitis. Family history includes lung cancer in his mother. The patient smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 50 years but quit 2 years ago. He has been drinking a fifth (750 mL) of vodka weekly for the last decade. Vital signs are normal. BMI is 19.2 kg/m². Temporal wasting is present but physical examination is otherwise unremarkable. Upper endoscopy reveals a 4-cm mass in the middle third of the esophagus, and several biopsies are taken. Thoracic imaging reveals mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Histologic evaluation of the biopsy specimens will most likely show which of the following in this patient?",
    "zh": "一名65岁男性因吞咽困难就诊。在过去的3个月里，他依靠蛋白质奶昔和果汁来维持营养，因为他难以吞咽固体食物。他也有食欲减退，估计体重减轻了9.1公斤（20磅）。病史包括高脂血症、肺气肿和既往的胰腺炎发作。家族史包括其母亲患肺癌。该患者每天吸一包香烟，持续50年，但于2年前戒烟。在过去的十年里，他每周喝一品脱（750毫升）伏特加。生命体征正常。BMI为19.2 kg/m²。存在颞肌萎缩，但体格检查无其他异常发现。上消化内镜检查显示食管中间三分之一处有一个4厘米的肿块，并取了多个活检样本。胸部影像学检查显示纵隔淋巴结肿大。该患者的活检标本的组织学评估最有可能显示以下哪一项？"

    "en": "This patient with a mid-esophageal mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy typically likely has **squamous cell carcinoma** (SCC) of the esophagus. SCC is characterized by sheets or nests of atypical squamous cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and may show large, bizarre nuclei with atypical mitoses; **keratin formation** (keratin pearls) and intercellular bridges are common. Malignant cells are often seen invading the submucosa and surrounding structures.\n\nThe esophagus can be subdivided (based on anatomy and embryonic formation) into thirds; malignancies occur at different frequencies within each segment.\n\n*   Proximal and middle third: SCC is more common, and occurs at the highest frequency in the middle third. Lymphatics drain to mediastinal nodes: metastatic disease may present with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\n*   Distal third: Adenocarcinoma is more common. Lymphatics drain caudally to the gastric and celiac nodes: metastatic disease may present with abdominal lymphadenopathy.\n\nAdenocarcinoma is characterized by invasive patches of dysplastic, mucin-producing cells that form glands. It typically occurs as a consequence of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and is preceded by Barrett esophagus (replacement of the normal esophagus with nondysplastic columnar intestinal cells) (Choices **A** and **B**).\n\n(Choices **D** and **E**) Leiomyosarcoma demonstrates myocyte atypia on histology. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are often composed of uniform spindle cells that overexpress CD117. These malignancies occur more commonly in the stomach and small intestine and are rare in the esophagus.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nEsophageal squamous cell carcinoma presents mostly in the proximal two-thirds of the esophagus and frequently metastasizes to the mediastinal lymph nodes. Histology characteristically shows sheets of atypical squamous cells with keratin pearls and intercellular bridges. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "该患者出现食管中部肿块和纵隔淋巴结肿大，通常可能患有食管**鳞状细胞癌** (SCC)。SCC的特征是异型鳞状细胞成片或成巢，胞质丰富嗜酸性，可能表现出大的、奇异的核，伴有异型有丝分裂；**角蛋白形成**（角蛋白珠）和细胞间桥常见。恶性细胞常可见浸润黏膜下层和周围结构。\n\n食管可以根据解剖结构和胚胎发育分为三部分；恶性肿瘤在每个节段中的发生频率不同。\n\n*   近端和中间三分之一：鳞状细胞癌更常见，并且发生频率在中间三分之一处最高。淋巴管引流至纵隔淋巴结：转移性疾病可能表现为纵隔淋巴结肿大。\n*   远端三分之一：腺癌更常见。淋巴管向下引流至胃和腹腔淋巴结：转移性疾病可能表现为腹部淋巴结肿大。\n\n腺癌的特征是侵袭性的、形成腺体的异型增生、产生粘蛋白的细胞。它通常是慢性胃食管反流病的结果，并且先于巴雷特食管（用非异型增生的柱状肠细胞替代正常的食管）（选项**A**和**B**）。\n\n（选项**D**和**E**）平滑肌肉瘤在组织学上表现出肌细胞异型性。胃肠间质瘤通常由过度表达CD117的均匀梭形细胞组成。这些恶性肿瘤更常见于胃和小肠，在食管中很少见。\n\n教育目标：\n\n食管鳞状细胞癌主要发生在食管近端三分之二处，并经常转移到纵隔淋巴结。组织学特征性表现为异型鳞状细胞片，伴有角蛋白珠和细胞间桥。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of esophageal cancer, specifically squamous cell carcinoma, including its risk factors, location within the esophagus, and characteristic histological findings. It also tests the ability to differentiate squamous cell carcinoma from other esophageal malignancies like adenocarcinoma and leiomyosarcoma.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the patient's risk factors (smoking, alcohol use), the location of the mass (middle third of the esophagus), and the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which are all suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma. Knowing the typical histological features of squamous cell carcinoma (keratin pearls and intercellular bridges) will lead to the correct answer.",
    "zh": "此题考察了食管癌的知识，特别是鳞状细胞癌，包括其危险因素、在食管内的位置以及特征性组织学发现。它还考察了区分鳞状细胞癌与其他食管恶性肿瘤（如腺癌和平滑肌肉瘤）的能力。\n\n解决此题的关键在于识别患者的危险因素（吸烟、饮酒）、肿块的位置（食管中间三分之一）以及纵隔淋巴结肿大，这些都提示鳞状细胞癌。了解鳞状细胞癌的典型组织学特征（角蛋白珠和细胞间桥）将有助于得出正确答案。"
