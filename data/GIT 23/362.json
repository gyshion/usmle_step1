    "en": "This patient's isolated elevation in unconjugated bilirubin and history of intermittent scleral icterus with an otherwise normal physical examination are consistent with GILBERT SYNDROME, the most common inherited disorder of bilirubin glucuronidation. In contrast to hepatobiliary disease (eg, cholestasis) in which conjugated bilirubin is elevated due to reflux back into the plasma, UNCONJUGATED HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA is typically caused by increased bilirubin production (eg, hemolysis) or IMPAIRED BILIRUBIN CONJUGATION.\n\nIn general, a key component of bilirubin metabolism is the conjugation of bilirubin with glucuronic acid in the liver by UDP glucuronosyltransferase. In Gilbert syndrome, a genetic mutation results in REDUCED ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY of UDP GLUCURONOSYLTRANSFERASE.\n\nPatients are usually asymptomatic but have RECURRENT EPISODES of mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia causing SCLERAL ICTERUS and JAUNDICE, usually beginning after puberty. Episodes are typically triggered when production of unconjugated bilirubin is mildly increased, such as with STRESS (eg, fasting, vigorous exertion, illness).\n\n(Choice B) Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a benign, hereditary cause of hyperbilirubinemia that can present with intermittent scleral icterus. However, this condition is due to DEFECTIVE EXCRETION of bilirubin by hepatocytes, which results in conjugated (not unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia.\n\n(Choice C) Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by poor red blood cell deformability due to an erythrocyte membrane defect (eg, spectrin, ankyrin) and leads to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia from chronic hemolysis. Anemia, an elevated reticulocyte count, and splenomegaly would be expected.\n\n(Choice D) Inflammation of the liver due to viral infection (eg, hepatitis C) may cause hyperbilirubinemia, but significant elevations in aminotransferases would be expected.\n\n(Choice E) Choledocholithiasis leading to bile duct obstruction causes an elevation of conjugated (not unconjugated) bilirubin. In addition, alkaline phosphatase and transaminases are typically elevated, and patients usually have right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nEducational objective:\nGilbert syndrome is a benign disorder that presents with recurrent scleral icterus and jaundice, typically triggered by stress (eg, fasting, illness). Pathogenesis involves decreased activity of UDP glucuronosyltransferase (impaired bilirubin conjugation), and an isolated mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is typical. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者血中非结合胆红素的孤立性升高，以及间歇性巩膜黄染的病史，且体格检查无其他异常发现，与吉尔伯特综合征一致，吉尔伯特综合征是最常见的胆红素葡萄糖醛酸化遗传性疾病。与肝胆疾病（如胆汁淤积）中结合胆红素升高，是由于其反流入血浆中不同，非结合性高胆红素血症通常是由胆红素产生增加（如溶血）或胆红素结合受损引起的。\n\n总的来说，胆红素代谢的一个关键组成部分是肝脏中胆红素与葡萄糖醛酸的结合，由UDP葡萄糖醛酸转移酶催化。在吉尔伯特综合征中，基因突变导致UDP葡萄糖醛酸转移酶的酶活性降低。\n\n患者通常无症状，但会出现轻度非结合性高胆红素血症的反复发作，导致巩膜黄染和黄疸，通常始于青春期后。发作通常由非结合胆红素的产生轻度增加引发，例如应激状态（如禁食、剧烈运动、疾病）。\n\n（选项B）Dubin-Johnson综合征是一种良性、遗传性高胆红素血症，可表现为间歇性巩膜黄染。然而，这种情况是由于肝细胞对胆红素的排泄缺陷，导致结合型（而非非结合型）高胆红素血症。\n\n（选项C）遗传性球形红细胞增多症的特征是由于红细胞膜缺陷（如血影蛋白、锚蛋白）导致红细胞变形性差，并导致慢性溶血引起的非结合型高胆红素血症。预计会出现贫血、网织红细胞计数升高和脾肿大。\n\n（选项D）病毒感染（如丙型肝炎）引起的肝脏炎症可能导致高胆红素血症，但预计转氨酶会显著升高。\n\n（选项E）胆管结石导致胆管梗阻会导致结合型（而非非结合型）胆红素升高。此外，碱性磷酸酶和转氨酶通常升高，并且患者通常有右上腹或上腹痛、恶心和呕吐。\n\n教育目标：\n吉尔伯特综合征是一种良性疾病，表现为反复发作的巩膜黄染和黄疸，通常由应激（如禁食、疾病）引发。发病机制涉及UDP葡萄糖醛酸转移酶活性降低（胆红素结合受损），并且典型的为孤立的轻度非结合型高胆红素血症。{{exhibit_2}}"
