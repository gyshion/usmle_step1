    "en": "Neurocysticercosis {{exhibit_2}}\nHistopathology of this cystic brain lesion shows an invaginated scolex, the anterior portion of a tapeworm. The scolex has refractile hooklets and suckers, which allow attachment to host tissue. These findings are consistent with neurocysticercosis (NCC). NCC occurs after humans ingest Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) eggs in contaminated food or water. The eggs hatch into embryos, invade the intestinal mucosal border, and lodge in tissue (eg, brain, muscle, eye), where they form cysts with larvae. When the cystic lesions degenerate months or years later, it can cause inflammation and edema of the surrounding tissue, leading to symptomatic disease. The most common manifestation is adult-onset seizures due to intraparenchymal brain lesions.\n\nAlthough the diagnosis is usually made based on neuroimaging findings (eg, ≥1 cystic lesion) and serology, brain biopsy is sometimes performed due to concern for malignancy.\n\n(Choice B) Meningioma is the most common CNS neoplasm and often presents with seizure. However, imaging reveals an extraaxial, dural-based mass that compresses brain tissue. In addition, histopathology often shows whorls of uniform, oval tumor cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, as well as psammoma bodies.\n\n(Choice C) Brain metastases (eg, melanoma) often cause seizures due to focal brain edema. However, imaging usually reveals multiple masses with surrounding edema at the gray-white matter junction, not a single cystic temporal lobe lesion. Histopathology is usually similar to the primary tumor.\n\n(Choice D) Protozoal infections such as toxoplasmosis and amoebic encephalitis can cause brain infection with seizure. However, toxoplasmosis appears as ring-enhancing lesions on imaging, and histology shows spherical cysts and tachyzoites, not a scolex. Amoebic encephalitis typically appears as nonspecific brain edema on imaging, and histology shows trophozoites and cysts.\n\n(Choice E) Tuberculosis can spread to the meninges or CNS. Tuberculomas in the brain can cause seizures, but imaging reveals ring-enhancing intraparenchymal lesions, not cysts. In addition, histopathology would show caseating granulomas with acid-fast bacilli.\n\nEducational objective:\nNeurocysticercosis is a helminth infection that occurs after the ingestion of Taenia solium eggs. It often presents with adult-onset seizure in patients from an endemic area. Imaging reveals ≥1 cystic brain lesions. The presence of a scolex, the anterior portion of the worm with hooks and suckers, is diagnostic. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of neurocysticercosis, a parasitic infection of the brain caused by the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. It assesses the ability to recognize the characteristic histopathological findings of a scolex with hooklets and suckers in a cystic brain lesion, leading to the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to identify the histopathological findings of a scolex with hooklets and suckers, which are diagnostic for neurocysticercosis. Consider the patient's presentation with new-onset seizures and the presence of a cystic lesion in the brain. Rule out other potential causes of brain lesions based on their typical imaging and histopathological features.",
