    "en": "A 28-year-old man with vague abdominal pain, low-grade fever, and diarrhea is treated with antibiotics without significant improvement in his symptoms. Several weeks after symptom onset, the patient develops a skin lesion over the abdomen. His temperature is 37.8 C (100 F), blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 88/min. On physical examination, the abdomen is mildly distended and tender to palpation. Bowel contents appear to be draining to the surface of the skin in the right lower abdominal quadrant.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease. They may have similar clinical manifestations, but they also have key distinguishing features (Table) {{exhibit_1}}.\n\nCrohn disease typically presents with prolonged diarrhea and abdominal pain. Diarrhea can be bloody if the colon is involved. Constitutional symptoms (eg, low-grade fever, fatigue), malabsorption, and weight loss are also common. TRANSMURAL INFLAMMATION of the bowel wall may result in the formation of fistulas and fibrotic strictures, causing bowel obstruction. Fistulas can form between 2 adjacent loops of bowel (enteroenteric fistula), between the bowel and another organ (eg, bladder, vagina), or between the bowel and skin of the abdominal wall (enterocutaneous fistula). Perianal fistulas and abscesses are also often seen.\n\nUlcerative colitis typically presents with bloody diarrhea associated with abdominal pain and tenesmus. Fistula formation does not usually occur as inflammation is confined to the mucosa and submucosa (Choice E).\n\n(Choice A) Right lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting are classic symptoms of acute appendicitis. If untreated, appendicitis may progress to peritonitis or abscess formation, but fistula formation is not common.\n\n(Choice C) Mesenteric adenitis most often occurs in children age 5-14. Many cases are thought to be associated with Yersinia enterocolitica infection. Clinical manifestations may include fever, right lower quadrant abdominal pain, and nausea/vomiting, but fistulas are not characteristic.\n\n(Choice D) Pseudomembranous colitis is typically caused by CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE infection and presents with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever in a patient who has recently been hospitalized or treated with antibiotics. Fistulas are not typically seen.\n\nEducational objective:\nCrohn disease typically presents with prolonged diarrhea and abdominal pain. Constitutional symptoms (eg, low-grade fever, fatigue), malabsorption, and weight loss are also common. Transmural inflammation of the bowel wall may result in the formation of fistulas (enteroenteric, enterocutaneous), abscesses, and fibrotic strictures.",
    "zh": "克罗恩病和溃疡性结肠炎统称为炎症性肠病。它们可能具有相似的临床表现，但也有关键的区别特征（表格）{{exhibit_1}}。\n\n克罗恩病通常表现为持续性腹泻和腹痛。如果结肠受累，腹泻可能带血。全身症状（例如，低烧、疲劳）、吸收不良和体重减轻也很常见。肠壁的TRANSMURAL炎症可能导致瘘管和纤维性狭窄的形成，引起肠梗阻。瘘管可在2个相邻的肠袢之间（肠肠瘘）、肠与其他器官之间（例如，膀胱、阴道），或肠与腹壁皮肤之间（肠皮肤瘘）形成。肛周瘘管和脓肿也经常出现。\n\n溃疡性结肠炎通常表现为血性腹泻，伴有腹痛和里急后重。瘘管的形成通常不会发生，因为炎症仅限于黏膜和黏膜下层（选项E）。\n\n（选项A）右下腹象限腹痛、发烧、恶心和呕吐是急性阑尾炎的典型症状。如果未经治疗，阑尾炎可能会发展为腹膜炎或脓肿形成，但瘘管形成并不常见。\n\n（选项C）肠系膜淋巴结炎最常发生在5-14岁的儿童中。许多病例被认为与耶尔森菌感染有关。临床表现可能包括发烧、右下腹象限腹痛、恶心/呕吐，但瘘管并非其特征。\n\n（选项D）假膜性结肠炎通常由艰难梭菌感染引起，表现为腹泻、腹痛和发烧，患者最近曾住院或接受过抗生素治疗。通常不会看到瘘管。\n\n教育目标：\n克罗恩病通常表现为持续性腹泻和腹痛。全身症状（例如，低烧、疲劳）、吸收不良和体重减轻也很常见。肠壁的Transmural炎症可能导致瘘管（肠肠瘘、肠皮肤瘘）、脓肿和纤维性狭窄的形成。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of inflammatory bowel disease, specifically Crohn's disease, and its characteristic presentation including fistula formation. It requires differentiating Crohn's disease from other conditions with similar abdominal symptoms.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key features of the case: prolonged diarrhea, low-grade fever, antibiotic treatment without improvement, and the presence of a skin lesion draining bowel contents. These findings are highly suggestive of a fistula, which is a common complication of Crohn's disease.",
