    "en": "A 32-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to fever, agitation, and disorientation. According to his family, the patient has been acting strangely and seeing and hearing things that do not exist. He also drools excessively and has severe, painful throat spasms when he attempts to eat or drink. The patient returned 4 weeks ago from a camping trip in New Mexico. Physical examination shows a confused and combative patient with mydriasis and neck rigidity. Which of the following acts as an entry receptor for the causative agent of this patient's condition?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's progressive agitation, disorientation, and pharyngospasm raises strong suspicion for RABIES, a fatal infection caused by a neurotropic virus from the Rhabdoviridae family. Exposure usually occurs when patients come into contact with CONTAMINATED SALIVA from an infected animal (eg, dog, bat), which likely occurred during this patient's camping trip in New Mexico. The virus contains a bullet-shaped envelope with knob-like glycoproteins that allow it to attach to the NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR at the neuromuscular junction. The virus replicates locally within the muscle tissue of the bite wound for several days or weeks and then travels in a retrograde fashion through peripheral nerve axons to the dorsal root ganglia. From there, it rapidly ascends the spinal cord and infects the diencephalon, hippocampus, and brain stem.\n\nPatients initially develop a nonspecific flu-like prodrome (fever, malaise, myalgias); paresthesias radiating proximally from a known wound site can be an important clue. When the virus enters the CNS, the infection typically evolves into rabies encephalitis, which is characterized by painful PHARYNGEAL SPASMS leading to avoidance of water (HYDROPHOBIA), mental status changes, muscular rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction (pupil dilation, HYPERSALIVATION). Once symptoms of rabies encephalitis appear, postexposure prophylaxis is no longer effective and nearly all patients die.\n\n(Choice A) Epstein-Barr virus binds to CD21 on inactive B-lymphocytes and results in infectious mononucleosis, which is usually characterized by sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, malaise, and atypical lymphocytosis. Because this virus is a member of the Herpesviridae family, initial infection is followed by a long-standing (usually asymptomatic) latent infection.\n\n(Choice C) Rhinovirus binds intracellular adhesion molecule-1, which is found on nasopharyngeal and adenoid epithelial cells. It is associated with the common cold, not agitation, pharyngeal spasm, and hallucinations.\n\n(Choice D) The influenza virus has hemagglutinin glycoproteins that allow it to attach to sialic acids on the surface of the respiratory epithelium. Influenza is usually characterized by fever, myalgias, cough, headache, and respiratory symptoms; agitation and pharyngeal spasm are not typical features.\n\n(Choice E) Cytomegalovirus binds to vascular endothelial integrins, leading to replication within endothelial cells. Initial cytomegalovirus infections are often asymptomatic, but patients can develop a mononucleosis-type syndrome (eg, lethargy, fever, atypical lymphocytosis). Psychosis and disorientation would be atypical.",
    "zh": "该患者进行性烦躁不安、定向力障碍和咽痉挛强烈提示狂犬病，这是一种由弹状病毒科的嗜神经病毒引起的致命感染。接触通常发生在患者接触来自受感染动物（例如，狗、蝙蝠）的受污染唾液时，这很可能发生在该患者在新墨西哥州的露营旅行期间。该病毒包含一个子弹形包膜，带有旋钮状糖蛋白，可使其附着在神经肌肉接合处的烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体上。该病毒在咬伤部位的肌肉组织内局部复制数天或数周，然后通过周围神经轴突以逆行方式传播到背根神经节。从那里，它迅速向上移动脊髓，并感染间脑、海马体和脑干。\n\n患者最初会出现非特异性的流感样前驱症状（发热、不适、肌痛）；从已知伤口部位向近端放射的异常感觉可能是重要的线索。当病毒进入中枢神经系统时，感染通常会发展为狂犬病脑炎，其特征是疼痛性咽痉挛，导致回避水（恐水症）、精神状态改变、肌肉僵硬和自主神经功能障碍（瞳孔散大、流涎过多）。一旦出现狂犬病脑炎的症状，暴露后预防不再有效，几乎所有患者都会死亡。\n\n(选项A) 爱泼斯坦-巴尔病毒与未活化的B淋巴细胞上的CD21结合，导致传染性单核细胞增多症，其通常的特征是咽喉痛、淋巴结肿大、不适和非典型淋巴细胞增多。由于该病毒是疱疹病毒科的成员，因此在初次感染后会发生长期（通常无症状）潜伏感染。\n\n(选项C) 鼻病毒与鼻咽和腺样体上皮细胞上的细胞内黏附分子-1结合。它与普通感冒有关，而不是烦躁、咽痉挛和幻觉。\n\n(选项D) 流感病毒具有血凝素糖蛋白，可使其附着在呼吸道上皮表面的唾液酸上。流感的特征通常是发热、肌痛、咳嗽、头痛和呼吸道症状；烦躁和咽痉挛不是典型特征。\n\n(选项E) 巨细胞病毒与血管内皮整合素结合，导致在内皮细胞内复制。最初的巨细胞病毒感染通常无症状，但患者可能会出现单核细胞增多症样综合征（例如，嗜睡、发热、非典型淋巴细胞增多症）。精神病和定向力障碍是不典型的。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of rabies, specifically focusing on the viral entry receptor. It requires correlating the patient's symptoms and travel history with the known mechanisms of viral infection.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the most likely diagnosis based on the constellation of symptoms (fever, agitation, disorientation, pharyngeal spasms, mydriasis, neck rigidity) and the recent travel history. Then, recall or deduce the specific cellular receptor that the causative agent of this disease utilizes for entry into host cells.",
