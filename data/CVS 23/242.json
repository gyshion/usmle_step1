  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's presentation (fatigue, progressive dyspnea, presyncope with exertion, and a cardiac murmur) is suggestive of AORTIC VALVE STENOSIS (AS). In AS, the heart is unable to adequately increase cardiac output during exercise, causing pulmonary vascular congestion and reduced mean arterial pressure. These changes cause dyspnea and lightheadedness, respectively. AS can also chronically lower cardiac output, causing an increased tendency toward fatigue in general. AS murmur is usually a harsh ejection-type systolic murmur heard best at the base of the heart in the \"aortic area\" (second right intercostal space) with radiation to the carotid arteries. Second heart sound (S2) is diminished in intensity due to reduced mobility of the aortic leaflets, and a fourth heart sound (S4) may be heard due to decreased compliance of the hypertrophic myocardium.\n\nCalcific degeneration of the trileaflet aortic valve is the most common cause of valvular AS in developed nations. AS is characterized by progressive aortic valve leaflet thickening and calcification, leading to restricted leaflet excursion and mobility. Congenital heart disease, such as bicuspid aortic valve, can also lead to AS due to accelerated valve degeneration. On the other hand, rheumatic valve disease is a common cause of AS in developing nations and is characterized by fusion of valve commissures due to repetitive inflammation (Choice B). Rheumatic valve disease usually presents at an earlier age and involves the mitral valve as well.\n\n(Choice C) Hypertrophy of the basal interventricular septum with subaortic obstruction is the pathophysiologic process in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Physical examination reveals a harsh crescendo-decrescendo murmur heard best at the apex and lower sternal border. The murmur does not radiate to the neck, and S2 is usually normal.\n\n(Choice D) Infective endocarditis can lead to aortic regurgitation (AR) due to inadequate coaptation of the aortic leaflets. AR murmur is an early, decrescendo, high-pitched, blowing diastolic murmur that begins immediately after A2. It is best heard along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces.\n\n(Choice E) Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve leaflets leads to mitral valve prolapse. Cardiac auscultation usually reveals a non-ejection click and mid-to-late systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation.",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现（疲劳、进行性呼吸困难、劳力性晕厥和心脏杂音）提示主动脉瓣狭窄（AS）。在AS中，心脏无法在运动时充分增加心输出量，导致肺血管充血和平均动脉压降低。这些变化分别引起呼吸困难和头晕。AS也会长期降低心输出量，从而导致普遍的疲劳倾向增加。AS杂音通常是一种粗糙的喷射型收缩期杂音，在心脏底部“主动脉区”（第二肋间隙右侧）听诊最佳，并向颈动脉放射。由于主动脉瓣叶活动受限，第二心音（S2）强度减弱，并且由于肥厚心肌的顺应性降低，可能会听到第四心音（S4）。\n\n三叶主动脉瓣的钙化退变是发达国家瓣膜性AS最常见的原因。AS的特征是主动脉瓣叶进行性增厚和钙化，导致瓣叶活动受限。先天性心脏病，如二叶主动脉瓣，也可因瓣膜加速退变而导致AS。另一方面，风湿性瓣膜病是发展中国家AS的常见原因，其特征是由于反复炎症导致的瓣膜交界融合（选项B）。风湿性瓣膜病通常发病年龄较早，并且也涉及二尖瓣。\n\n（选项C）基底部室间隔肥厚伴主动脉下梗阻是肥厚型心肌病患者的病理生理过程。体格检查显示粗糙的渐强-渐弱型杂音，在心尖和胸骨下缘听诊最佳。杂音不向颈部放射，S2通常正常。\n\n（选项D）感染性心内膜炎可因主动脉瓣叶的对合不全而导致主动脉瓣关闭不全（AR）。AR杂音是一种早期、递减、高调、吹风样舒张期杂音，在A2后立即开始。它在第三和第四肋间隙的左胸骨缘听诊最佳。\n\n（选项E）二尖瓣叶的粘液样变性导致二尖瓣脱垂。心脏听诊通常揭示非喷射性喀喇声和二尖瓣反流的中晚期收缩期杂音。"
