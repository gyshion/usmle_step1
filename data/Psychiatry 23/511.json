    "en": "A 60-year-old woman comes to the office due to uncontrollable movements that have worsened. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, and schizophrenia, and she has been on a stable medication regimen for years. Throughout the interview, she exhibits facial grimacing, lip smacking, and twisting movements of her hands and feet. The patient has lived in a group home for many years and worries that her housemates are avoiding her because her symptoms make her look \"strange.\" On mental status examination, the patient makes poor eye contact and is generally distrustful but has no specific delusions or hallucinations.",
    "zh": "一位60岁的女性因无法控制的运动前来就诊，病情有所恶化。病史包括高血压、高脂血症、骨关节炎和精神分裂症，并且她多年来一直采用稳定的药物治疗方案。在整个访谈过程中，她表现出面部扭曲、咂嘴和手脚扭动。该患者多年来一直住在集体宿舍，并担心她的室友正在避开她，因为她的症状让她看起来“很奇怪”。在精神状态检查中，患者眼神接触差，并且通常不信任，但没有特定的妄想或幻觉。"

    "en": "This patient has a diagnosis of schizophrenia and has likely been treated with antipsychotic medications for many years. Her abnormal movements are characteristic of TARDIVE DYSKINESIA (TD), a movement disorder associated with long-term treatment with dopamine antagonist medications (eg, antipsychotics, metoclopramide). Possible mechanisms of TD include development of hypersensitive post-synaptic D2 receptors following prolonged D2 blockade and an imbalance between D1 and D2 receptor-mediated effects.\n\nTD typically consists of repetitive, rhythmic, involuntary movements of the tongue, lips, face, trunk, and extremities. Orofacial dyskinesias (eg, facial grimacing, tongue movements, lip smacking and puckering) are most common, but choreoathetoid movements of the trunk and limbs can also occur. Older age and exposure to first-generation antipsychotics increase the risk of developing TD. Treatment typically includes discontinuing the offending agent when feasible.\n\n(Choices A, C, and D) TD can be differentiated from acute extrapyramidal syndromes that also result from exposure to dopamine antagonists. Acute dystonia involves a distressing, sustained, involuntary contraction of the neck, mouth, tongue, or eye muscles that typically occurs within the first few days of receiving a dopamine antagonist. Akathisia is characterized by physical restlessness, difficulty sitting still, and a compelling need to move. Drug-induced parkinsonism manifests with tremor, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity.\n\n(Choice B) Poor eye contact and general distrust are symptoms that frequently persist in patients treated with antipsychotics during the maintenance phase of schizophrenia. Signs and symptoms of an acute psychotic episode include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech and behavior.\n\n(Choice E) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which is also an adverse reaction related to antipsychotic treatment, is a rare and potentially fatal syndrome characterized by delirium, high fever, severe muscle rigidity, and autonomic instability.\n\n(Choice G) The characteristic feature of all tic disorders involves brief, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movements (eg, eye blinking) and/or vocalizations (eg, grunting), beginning in childhood.\n\nEducational objective:\nTardive dyskinesias consists of abnormal involuntary movements of the mouth, tongue, face, extremities, or trunk associated with prolonged exposure to antipsychotics. Characteristic movements include lip smacking, facial grimacing, tongue protrusions, and choreoathetoid movements of the head, limbs, and trunk.",
    "zh": "该患者被诊断患有精神分裂症，并且可能已经接受抗精神病药物治疗多年。她的异常运动是迟发性运动障碍(TD)的特征，这是一种与长期使用多巴胺拮抗剂药物（例如，抗精神病药，甲氧氯普胺）相关的运动障碍。 TD的可能机制包括在长期D2受体阻滞后，出现过度敏感的突触后D2受体，以及D1和D2受体介导效应之间的失衡。\n\nTD通常包括舌、唇、面部、躯干和四肢的重复性、节律性、不自主运动。 口面部运动障碍（例如，面部扭曲、舌头运动、咂嘴和噘嘴）最为常见，但也可能发生躯干和四肢的舞蹈手足徐动症样运动。 年龄较大和接触第一代抗精神病药会增加发生TD的风险。 治疗通常包括在可行的情况下停用致病药物。\n\n（选项A、C和D）TD可以与也由接触多巴胺拮抗剂引起的急性锥体外系综合征区分开来。 急性肌张力障碍涉及颈部、口腔、舌头或眼部肌肉的痛苦、持续、不自主的收缩，通常发生在接受多巴胺拮抗剂的最初几天内。 静坐不能的特征是身体躁动不安、难以静坐以及迫切需要移动。 药物引起的帕金森病表现为震颤、运动迟缓和齿轮样强直。\n\n（选项B）在精神分裂症的维持期，眼神接触差和普遍的不信任是接受抗精神病药物治疗的患者经常持续存在的症状。 急性精神病发作的体征和症状包括妄想、幻觉以及思维和行为紊乱。\n\n（选项E）神经阻滞剂恶性综合征也是一种与抗精神病药物治疗相关的不良反应，是一种罕见且可能致命的综合征，其特征是谵妄、高热、严重肌肉僵硬和自主神经功能不稳定。\n\n（选项G）所有抽动障碍的特征是短暂、反复、非节律性的运动（例如，眨眼）和/或发声（例如，哼哼），始于儿童时期。\n\n教育目标：\n迟发性运动障碍包括与长期接触抗精神病药物相关的口腔、舌、面部、四肢或躯干的异常不自主运动。 特征性运动包括咂嘴、面部扭曲、舌头伸出以及头部、四肢和躯干的舞蹈手足徐动症样运动。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the differential diagnosis of abnormal involuntary movements in a patient with a history of schizophrenia treated with antipsychotics. It specifically assesses the ability to distinguish tardive dyskinesia from other movement disorders and psychiatric conditions.\n\nTo solve this question, one should first identify the patient's chronic antipsychotic use and the nature of her involuntary movements. Then, consider the characteristic features of each option, particularly focusing on the chronicity and type of movement, to arrive at the most likely diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia.",
