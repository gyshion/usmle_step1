    "en": "A 77-year-old man comes to the office after he was found to have high blood pressure during a health fair. The patient denies any medical problems and feels proud that he has not needed to see a doctor for many years. His blood pressure is 170/70 mm Hg and pulse is 74/min. Other physical examination findings are normal. The patient is started on a medication to treat his hypertension. During his follow-up visit 3 weeks later, he reports bilateral leg swelling. He has no chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal symptoms. His blood pressure is 135/65 mm Hg and pulse is 80/min. Cardiopulmonary examination is normal, but there is bilateral, symmetrical, 2+ pitting lower extremity edema. Laboratory studies show serum creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, and urinalysis is negative for proteinuria.",

    "en": "Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine, nifedipine) are effective antihypertensive agents commonly used as monotherapy or in combination with other agents for treatment of hypertension. The major side effects associated with use of calcium channel blockers include headache, flushing, dizziness, and peripheral edema. Development of peripheral edema is related to preferential dilation of precapillary vessels (arteriolar dilation), which leads to increased capillary hydrostatic pressure and fluid extravasation into the interstitium. Renin-angiotensin system blockers (eg, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs]) cause postcapillary venodilation and can normalize the increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, reducing the risk of peripheral edema in patients taking calcium channel blockers.\n\n(Choice B) Eplerenone is an aldosterone antagonist and functions similarly to spironolactone as a potassium-sparing diuretic. The most frequent side effects of eplerenone are hyperkalemia, increased creatinine, and gynecomastia (~1% versus 10% with spironolactone).\n\n(Choices C and E) The most common side effects of thiazide (eg, hydrochlorothiazide) and loop diuretics (eg, torsemide) are electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia. They do not cause peripheral edema.\n\n(Choices D and F) The potential side effects of ACE inhibitors (eg, ramipril) and ARBs (eg, valsartan) include cough, hypotension, hyperkalemia, and angioedema. The risk of cough and angioedema is much lower with ARBs. These medications do not cause peripheral edema.\n\nEducational objective:\nAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker commonly used as monotherapy or in combination with other agents for treatment for hypertension. Major side effects include headache, flushing, dizziness, and peripheral edema.",
    "zh": "二氢吡啶类钙通道阻滞剂（例如，氨氯地平、硝苯地平）是有效的高血压药物，通常用作单一疗法或与其他药物联合治疗高血压。与使用钙通道阻滞剂相关的主要副作用包括头痛、潮红、头晕和外周水肿。外周水肿的发生与微动脉前血管（小动脉扩张）的优先扩张有关，这会导致毛细血管静水压升高和液体渗出到间质中。肾素-血管紧张素系统阻滞剂（例如，ACE抑制剂或血管紧张素II受体阻滞剂[ARBs]）引起毛细血管后静脉扩张，可以使升高的毛细血管静水压正常化，从而降低服用钙通道阻滞剂的患者发生外周水肿的风险。\n\n（选项 B）依普利酮是一种醛固酮拮抗剂，其功能与螺内酯相似，是一种保钾利尿剂。依普利酮最常见的副作用是高钾血症、肌酐升高和男性乳房发育 (~1% 比螺内酯的10%)。\n\n（选项 C 和 E）噻嗪类（例如，氢氯噻嗪）和袢利尿剂（例如，托拉塞米）最常见的副作用是电解质异常，例如低钾血症、低钠血症和低镁血症。它们不会引起外周水肿。\n\n（选项 D 和 F）ACE抑制剂（例如，雷米普利）和 ARBs（例如，缬沙坦）的潜在副作用包括咳嗽、低血压、高钾血症和血管性水肿。 ARBs 引起的咳嗽和血管性水肿风险要低得多。这些药物不会引起外周水肿。\n\n教育目标：\n氨氯地平是一种二氢吡啶类钙通道阻滞剂，常用于单药治疗或与其他药物联合治疗高血压。主要副作用包括头痛、潮红、头晕和外周水肿。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of antihypertensive medications and their side effects, specifically focusing on peripheral edema as a side effect of calcium channel blockers. The question requires recognizing that amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is the most likely cause of the patient's peripheral edema, given his history of hypertension treatment and the absence of other relevant findings.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the patient's symptoms (peripheral edema) and the medications he is likely taking for hypertension. Then, recall the common side effects associated with each class of antihypertensive drugs, focusing on which one is most likely to cause peripheral edema.",
    "zh": "本题考察了对抗高血压药物及其副作用的知识，特别侧重于钙通道阻滞剂的外周水肿。该问题需要认识到，考虑到患者的高血压治疗史以及没有其他相关发现，氨氯地平（一种钙通道阻滞剂）最有可能引起患者的外周水肿。\n\n要解决这个问题，请确定患者的症状（外周水肿）以及他可能正在服用的高血压药物。然后，回忆与每类抗高血压药物相关的常见副作用，重点关注哪一种最有可能引起外周水肿。"
