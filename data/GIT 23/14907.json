    "en": "A 73-year-old woman is brought to the clinic by her niece due to a 10-day history of abdominal pain and loss of appetite. The patient does not like \"going to the doctor\" and has not been seen by a physician in many years. Frequent loose stools and loss of appetite have been present since the pain began. Family history is significant for colon cancer in a maternal aunt. Temperature is 37.8 C (100 F) and pulse is 98/min. Abdominal examination is significant for tenderness on deep palpation of the left lower quadrant, along with an appreciable mass. There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy. White blood cell count is 15,000/mm³. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the abdominal pain in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient with abdominal pain, leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and a mass palpated in the left lower quadrant likely has acute diverticulitis. DIVERTICULITIS is characterized by inflammation of colonic diverticula (ie, herniated outpouchings of the colonic mucosa and submucosa through the muscularis mucosae) and is caused by trapped food particles and elevated intraluminal pressure within a diverticulum, resulting in microperforation. The risk increases with age (particularly in those age ≥60). \n\nPatients commonly present with constant abdominal pain, classically in the LEFT LOWER QUADRANT, signifying sigmoid colon involvement. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and changes in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea). Patients often have low-grade fever, and examination may reveal lower abdominal tenderness and, often, a palpable mass due to inflammation or abscess formation. Mild leukocytosis is a common laboratory finding; occult blood may be present, but gross hematochezia is rare.\n\n(Choice B) Colon cancer may present with abdominal pain. However, a tumor large enough to palpate on examination suggests extensive disease and would typically be associated with more chronic symptoms (eg, weight loss). The leukocytosis and short duration of symptoms in this patient are more consistent with diverticulitis.\n\n(Choice C) Incarcerated direct inguinal hernias cause a palpable mass; however, the mass would typically be in the groin, not the abdomen. In addition, unless the hernia is strangulated, leukocytosis and fevers are unexpected.\n\n(Choice D) Ischemic colitis is a common cause of abdominal pain in an older patient; however, it typically presents with hematochezia and postprandial pain in patients with ischemic risk factors (eg, hypertension, diabetes).\n\n(Choice E) Tubo-ovarian abscess can cause abdominal pain and leukocytosis; however, patients typically have vaginal discharge, and a mass (if present) is located in the pelvis, not the abdomen. Tubo-ovarian abscesses typically occur in the setting of pelvic inflammatory disease, which is far more common in patients age <40.\n\n(Choice F) Ulcerative colitis often presents with abdominal pain and diarrhea; however, hematochezia is common. In addition, patients are typically diagnosed at age 20–40.\n\nEducational objective:\nDiverticulitis is characterized by inflammation of colonic diverticula. Patients have abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and changes in bowel habits. Low-grade fever and leukocytosis are common, and physical examination may demonstrate a tender mass in the left lower quadrant.",
    "zh": "这位患者出现腹痛、白细胞增多、低烧，并且在左下象限触及肿块，很可能患有急性憩室炎。憩室炎的特征是结肠憩室的炎症（即，结肠粘膜和粘膜下层通过肌层外翻），由滞留的食物颗粒和憩室内腔内压力升高引起，导致微穿孔。风险随着年龄的增长而增加（尤其是在60岁以上的人群中）。\n\n患者通常表现为持续性腹痛，典型位于左下象限，提示乙状结肠受累。其他症状包括恶心、呕吐和排便习惯的改变（便秘或腹泻）。患者常有低烧，检查可能会显示下腹部压痛，并且通常由于炎症或脓肿形成而出现可触及的肿块。轻度白细胞增多是常见的实验室发现；可能存在潜血，但肉眼血便很少见。\n\n(选项 B) 结肠癌可能表现为腹痛。然而，在检查中足够大的肿瘤表明疾病广泛，并且通常与更慢性的症状（如体重减轻）相关。该患者的白细胞增多和症状持续时间短与憩室炎更一致。\n\n(选项 C) 嵌顿性腹股沟直疝会导致可触及的肿块；但是，肿块通常位于腹股沟，而不是腹部。此外，除非疝气被绞窄，否则白细胞增多和发烧是意料之外的。\n\n(选项 D) 缺血性结肠炎是老年患者腹痛的常见原因；然而，它通常表现为血便和餐后疼痛，患者存在缺血性危险因素（例如，高血压、糖尿病）。\n\n(选项 E) 输卵管卵巢脓肿可引起腹痛和白细胞增多；然而，患者通常有阴道分泌物，并且肿块（如果存在）位于盆腔，而不是腹部。输卵管卵巢脓肿通常发生在盆腔炎的背景下，而盆腔炎在40岁以下的患者中更为常见。\n\n(选项 F) 溃疡性结肠炎常表现为腹痛和腹泻；然而，血便很常见。此外，患者通常在20-40岁时被诊断出来。\n\n教学目标：\n憩室炎的特征是结肠憩室的炎症。患者有腹痛、恶心、呕吐和排便习惯的改变。低烧和白细胞增多很常见，体格检查可能会显示左下象限有压痛性肿块。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of acute diverticulitis presentation, including risk factors, common symptoms, and physical exam findings. It also requires differentiating diverticulitis from other causes of abdominal pain in elderly patients. \n\nTo solve this question, focus on the patient's age, left lower quadrant pain, palpable mass, leukocytosis, and lack of hematochezia. Consider and rule out other common causes of abdominal pain based on their typical presentations.",
