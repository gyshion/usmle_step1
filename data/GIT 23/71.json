    "en": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the office due to several months of episodic right upper quadrant abdominal pain associated with nausea. The pain is often brought on by fatty meals and subsides in 1-2 hours. The patient has no fever, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, or bright red blood per rectum. Her BMI is 31.2 kg/m2. Physical examination is unremarkable. A cholecystokinin stimulation test is performed and shows slow and incomplete gallbladder emptying. This patient is most likely to have which of the following pathologic findings?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's slow/incomplete gallbladder emptying in response to cholecystokinin stimulation is consistent with gallbladder hypomotility. The gallbladder functions to actively absorb water from bile; conditions that cause gallbladder hypomotility result in excessive dehydration of bile. This promotes the precipitation and accumulation of particulate material (eg, cholesterol monohydrate crystals, calcium bilirubinate, mucus) in bile, forming viscous biliary sludge. Sludge formation may be asymptomatic or cause biliary colic (right upper quadrant abdominal pain associated with nausea) and is a known precursor to stone formation (particularly cholesterol stones). Complications such as acute cholecystitis and cholangitis can also occur in patients with biliary sludge. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choices B and C)  Pigment gallstones can be brown or black and arise from conditions that increase the amount of unconjugated bilirubin in bile. Brown pigment stones are associated with biliary tract infections (microbes producing β-glucuronidases), whereas black stones occur with chronic hemolytic anemias (eg, sickle cell disease) and increased enterohepatic cycling of bilirubin (eg, Crohn disease, which also decreases enterohepatic cycling of bilirubin a more likely diagnosis.\n\n(Choice D)  Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by a defect in an amino acid transporter gene, resulting in elevated urinary cystine concentrations. Patients typically present with cystine kidney stones during childhood or adolescence.\n\n(Choice E)  Individuals with high serum uric acid levels are at increased risk of developing uric acid kidney stones. Hyperuricemia can be caused by uric acid underexcretion (eg, thiazide diuretics) or overproduction (eg, tumor lysis syndrome).\n\nEducational objective:\nThe gallbladder functions to actively absorb water from bile. Gallbladder hypomotility causes the bile to become concentrated, promoting precipitation and accumulation of particulate material. This forms a viscous biliary sludge that can cause transient bile duct obstruction (biliary colic) and promote cholesterol gallstone formation.",
    "zh": "该患者对胆囊收缩素刺激的反应是胆囊排空缓慢/不完全，这与胆囊运动减弱一致。胆囊的功能是主动吸收胆汁中的水分；导致胆囊运动减弱的情况会导致胆汁过度脱水。这会促进胆汁中颗粒物质（例如，胆固醇一水合物晶体、胆红素钙、粘液）的沉淀和积累，形成粘稠的胆汁淤泥。淤泥形成可能无症状，或引起胆绞痛（右上腹疼痛伴恶心），并且是结石形成（特别是胆固醇结石）的已知前兆。胆汁淤泥患者也可能发生急性胆囊炎和胆管炎等并发症。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n（选项B和C）胆色素性胆结石可为棕色或黑色，其产生于增加胆汁中非结合胆红素量的疾病。棕色胆色素结石与胆道感染（产生β-葡萄糖醛酸苷酶的微生物）有关，而黑色结石则发生于慢性溶血性贫血（例如，镰状细胞病）和胆红素的肝肠循环增加（例如，克罗恩病，克罗恩病也降低了胆红素的肝肠循环，这是一个更有可能的诊断）。\n\n（选项D）胱氨酸尿症是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是氨基酸转运蛋白基因的缺陷，导致尿胱氨酸浓度升高。患者通常在儿童期或青春期出现胱氨酸肾结石。\n\n（选项E）血清尿酸水平高的人发生尿酸肾结石的风险增加。高尿酸血症可由尿酸排泄不足（例如，噻嗪类利尿剂）或过度产生（例如，肿瘤溶解综合征）引起。\n\n教育目标：\n胆囊的功能是主动吸收胆汁中的水分。胆囊运动减弱导致胆汁浓缩，促进颗粒物质的沉淀和积累。这形成粘稠的胆汁淤泥，可引起短暂的胆管梗阻（胆绞痛）并促进胆固醇胆结石的形成。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of biliary sludge formation and its association with gallbladder hypomotility. It also requires differentiating biliary sludge from other types of gallstones based on clinical presentation and risk factors.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the symptoms of biliary colic (RUQ pain after fatty meals) and the finding of slow gallbladder emptying on cholecystokinin stimulation. This points towards gallbladder hypomotility, which leads to bile concentration and sludge formation.",
    "zh": "本题考察对胆汁淤泥形成的了解及其与胆囊运动减弱的关系。它还需要根据临床表现和危险因素区分胆汁淤泥与其他类型的胆结石。\n\n最好的方法是识别胆绞痛的症状（高脂饮食后右上腹疼痛）和胆囊收缩素刺激时胆囊排空缓慢的发现。这指向胆囊运动减弱，从而导致胆汁浓缩和淤泥形成。"
