    "en": "Heparin's mechanism of action\n\nNonambulatory hospitalized patients are at increased risk for developing lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to pulmonary embolism. In patients undergoing elective surgery without prophylaxis against DVT, the risk can be even higher, particularly with certain orthopedic procedures such as hip and knee replacement. In such cases, DVT prophylaxis is usually initiated within hours of wound closure.\n\nUnfractionated and low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are commonly used for DVT prevention in inpatient settings. Administration of heparin (a negatively charged chemical naturally present in mast cells) increases the effect of the naturally occurring anticoagulant antithrombin III (AT III). Unfractionated heparin binds to AT III via a pentasaccharide in the heparin chain. This results in a conformational change of AT III, which subsequently inhibits factor Xa and neutralizes thrombin, promoting anticoagulation. AT III activated by LMWH (which has better bioavailability and does not need laboratory monitoring when given therapeutically) acts predominantly on factor Xa, not thrombin.\n\n(Choice B) Direct thrombin inhibitors directly inhibit thrombin-mediated fibrin formation. Lepirudin and argatroban (parenteral) are primarily used for management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Dabigatran (oral) is used for DVT prevention and treatment and for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.\n\n(Choice C) Clopidogrel and ticlopidine inhibit ADP-mediated platelet aggregation. They are useful following percutaneous coronary intervention and for treatment of unstable angina and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.\n\n(Choice D) Use of drugs that convert inactive plasminogen to plasmin leads to fibrinolysis and clot lysis; such medications are given for clot lysis in acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and arterial thrombosis.\n\n(Choice E) Aspirin irreversibly acetylates platelet cyclooxygenase-I, leading to decreased formation of thromboxane A2. Aspirin is used for primary and secondary prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke.\n\nEducational objective:\nHeparin is commonly used for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis in nonambulatory patients or those undergoing elective surgery, especially hip and knee surgery. Heparin increases the effect of the naturally occurring anticoagulant antithrombin III.",
    "zh": "肝素的作用机制\n\n无法活动的住院患者发生下肢深静脉血栓形成（DVT）的风险增加，这可能导致肺栓塞。在未预防DVT而接受选择性手术的患者中，这种风险甚至可能更高，尤其是在某些骨科手术（如髋关节和膝关节置换术）中。在这种情况下，DVT预防通常在伤口闭合后数小时内开始。\n\n普通肝素和低分子量肝素（LMWH）常用于住院环境中预防DVT。使用肝素（一种天然存在于肥大细胞中的带负电化学物质）可增加天然存在的抗凝血酶III（AT III）的效果。普通肝素通过肝素链中的五糖与AT III结合。这会导致AT III的构象改变，随后抑制Xa因子并中和凝血酶，从而促进抗凝。由LMWH激活的AT III（具有更好的生物利用度，并且在治疗性给药时不需要实验室监测）主要作用于Xa因子，而不是凝血酶。\n\n（选项B）直接凝血酶抑制剂直接抑制凝血酶介导的纤维蛋白形成。来匹芦定和阿加曲班（注射剂）主要用于治疗肝素诱导的血小板减少症。达比加群（口服）用于预防和治疗DVT，以及预防房颤引起的卒中。\n\n（选项C）氯吡格雷和他克替啶抑制ADP介导的血小板聚集。它们用于经皮冠状动脉介入治疗后，以及治疗不稳定型心绞痛和非ST段抬高型心肌梗死。\n\n（选项D）使用将无活性的纤溶酶原转化为纤溶酶的药物会导致纤维蛋白溶解和血栓溶解；此类药物用于治疗急性心肌梗死、肺栓塞和动脉血栓形成。\n\n（选项E）阿司匹林不可逆地乙酰化血小板环氧合酶-I，导致血栓烷A2的形成减少。阿司匹林用于心肌梗死和卒中的一级和二级预防。\n\n教育目标：\n肝素常用于预防无法活动患者或接受选择性手术（特别是髋关节和膝关节手术）患者的深静脉血栓形成。肝素可增强天然存在的抗凝血酶III的效果。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. It requires understanding how heparin enhances the activity of antithrombin III (AT III). \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the patient is receiving postoperative DVT prophylaxis with a low molecular weight heparin.
