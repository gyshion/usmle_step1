    "en": "The autopsy findings of a large thrombus occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery indicate a myocardial infarction. The cerebral findings, described as consistent with an old cerebral infarct {{exhibit_2}}, are likely secondary to embolic phenomena from the damaged heart or a consequence of systemic hypoperfusion. Interruption in blood supply to an area of the brain (eg, brain, thrombosis, embolism) induces irreversible ischemic changes in neurons. Release of LYSOSOMAL ENZYMES from ischemic neurons and responding inflammatory cells (eg, neutrophils, macrophages) results in tissue degradation in the affected region (LIQUEFACTIVE NECROSIS). Over time, phagocytic cells remove the necrotic tissue, leaving a cavity, while astrocytes proliferate around the periphery to form a scar (gliosis).\n\nLiquefactive necrosis is characteristic of irreversible CNS injury because of the brain's high cholesterol content and lack of supporting architecture. It also occurs in other body tissues in the setting of severe infection/inflammation (eg, bacterial abscess) due to massive release of hydrolytic enzymes from reacting inflammatory cells.\n\n(Choice A) Early fibroblast migration to an area of injury occurs outside of the CNS and results in the formation of granulation tissue and fibrous scarring. In the CNS, tissue repair and scar formation are performed by astrocytes.\n\n(Choice B) A granulomatous reaction against parasites within the CNS occurs in neurocysticercosis. However, multiple cystic lesions or residual calcified granulomas would be expected.\n\n(Choice C) Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease characterized grossly by multiple periventricular lesions (ie, demyelinating plaques). Cystic cavity formation does not occur.\n\n(Choice D) Although glioblastoma can present with areas of cystic necrosis on gross examination, these areas classically are part of a diffuse, poorly delineated, heterogeneous mass with midline shift away from the affected tissue.\n\nEducational objective:\nLIQUEFACTIVE NECROSIS is characterized by complete digestion and removal of necrotic tissue with formation of a cystic cavity. Irreversible ischemic CNS injury is typically followed by liquefactive necrosis due to the release of lysosomal enzymes from inflammatory cells and damaged neurons.",
    "zh": "左前降冠状动脉被大血栓阻塞的尸检结果表明发生了心肌梗死。脑部发现，被描述为与陈旧性脑梗死一致 {{exhibit_2}}，可能继发于来自受损心脏的栓塞现象或全身灌注不足。中断大脑某区域的血液供应（例如，脑部血栓形成、栓塞）会引起神经元不可逆的缺血性改变。缺血性神经元和反应性炎症细胞（例如，中性粒细胞、巨噬细胞）释放溶酶体酶会导致受影响区域的组织降解（液化性坏死）。随着时间的推移，吞噬细胞会清除坏死组织，留下一个空腔，而星形胶质细胞会在周围增生形成瘢痕（神经胶质增生）。\n\n液化性坏死是不可逆转的中枢神经系统损伤的特征，原因是脑部胆固醇含量高且缺乏支撑结构。它也发生在其他身体组织中，在严重感染/炎症（例如，细菌性脓肿）的情况下，由于反应性炎症细胞大量释放水解酶。\n\n（选项 A）成纤维细胞早期迁移到损伤区域发生在 CNS 之外，导致肉芽组织和纤维瘢痕的形成。在中枢神经系统中，组织修复和瘢痕形成由星形胶质细胞完成。\n\n（选项 B）针对中枢神经系统中寄生虫的肉芽肿反应发生在神经囊尾蚴病中。然而，预计会出现多个囊性病变或残留的钙化肉芽肿。\n\n（选项 C）多发性硬化症是一种慢性炎症性脱髓鞘疾病，其特征是肉眼可见多个脑室周围病变（即脱髓鞘斑块）。不会发生囊性腔形成。\n\n（选项 D）虽然胶质母细胞瘤在肉眼检查中可能表现出囊性坏死区域，但这些区域通常是弥漫性、边界不清、异质性肿块的一部分，并且中线移位远离受影响的组织。\n\n教学目标：\n液化性坏死的特征是完全消化和清除坏死组织，形成囊性腔。不可逆的缺血性 CNS 损伤通常继发于液化性坏死，这是由于炎症细胞和受损神经元释放溶酶体酶所致。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathogenesis of ischemic brain lesions, specifically liquefactive necrosis following cerebral infarction. It requires correlating clinical findings with autopsy results and understanding the cellular and enzymatic processes involved in tissue destruction and repair.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the likely cause of the brain lesion based on the clinical scenario and autopsy findings (cerebral infarct). Then, recall the characteristic pathological process of irreversible ischemic injury in the brain, which involves the release of lysosomal enzymes leading to liquefactive necrosis. Finally, differentiate this process from other potential causes of brain lesions presented in the options.",
