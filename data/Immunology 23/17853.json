  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has erythema that blanches without blistering, which is characteristic of a superficial burn. Burn {{exhibit_1}} classifications are accorded to depth based on which layers of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues are damaged:\n\n•\tSuperficial burns damage only the epidermis.\n•\tSuperficial partial-thickness burns damage the epidermis and upper dermis.\n•\tDeep partial-thickness burns damage the epidermis and most of the dermis.\n•\tFull-thickness burns damage the entire dermis and may extend into the fat, muscle, and/or bone.\n\nThe morphologic changes in burns occur due to both direct tissue damage and inflammatory mediators released from epidermal and immune cells. Release of histamine and other preformed vasoactive mediators from mast cells in the minutes following a burn leads to dilation of superficial skin capillaries. This results in blanching erythema (ie, temporary whitening with pressure due to capillary collapse) that extends to the area surrounding the initial burn.\n\nDeeper (eg, partial-thickness) burns affect dermal structures such as nerve endings and venules in addition to the epidermis. Nerve damage can lead to loss of sensation while damage to venules can result in fluid extravasation through gaps between injured venule endothelial cells. The result is a blister formed from a collection of serous fluid between the dermis and epidermis (Choice A).\n\n(Choices C and E) Platelets and neutrophils play an important role in healing after a thermal burn by releasing prostaglandins, cytokines, and growth factors that stimulate increased blood flow, inflammation, and tissue regrowth. Although both cells contribute to the erythema in and around a burn wound, these changes occur hours to days after the burn rather than minutes after, as in this patient.\n\n(Choice D) Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is released by platelets, macrophages, and endothelial cells and plays an important role in generating the vascular and fibroblast proliferation needed for normal wound healing over the days to weeks following the initial injury.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe earliest morphologic change that occurs after a superficial thermal burn is erythema due to the release of preformed mediators (eg, histamine) from mast cells. Deeper (eg, partial-thickness) burn wounds form blisters due to fluid extravasation through gaps between damaged venule endothelial cells.",
    "zh": "该患者出现红斑，按压后变白，无水疱，这是浅表烧伤的特征。烧伤 {{exhibit_1}} 分级根据损伤的皮肤和皮下组织的层数进行深度分类：\n\n•\t浅表烧伤仅损伤表皮。\n•\t浅表部分厚度烧伤损伤表皮和真皮上层。\n•\t深部部分厚度烧伤损伤表皮和大部分真皮。\n•\t全厚度烧伤损伤整个真皮，并可能延伸到脂肪、肌肉和/或骨骼。\n\n烧伤的形态学变化是由于直接组织损伤和表皮及免疫细胞释放的炎症介质。烧伤后几分钟内，肥大细胞释放组胺和其他预先形成的血管活性介质，导致浅表皮肤毛细血管扩张。这导致按压时出现红斑变白（即，由于毛细血管塌陷而引起的暂时性变白），并延伸到最初烧伤的周围区域。\n\n较深的（例如，部分厚度）烧伤会影响真皮结构，如神经末梢和小静脉，以及表皮。神经损伤可导致感觉丧失，而小静脉损伤可导致液体通过受损小静脉内皮细胞之间的间隙外渗。结果是在真皮和表皮之间形成水疱（选项 A）。\n\n（选项 C 和 E）血小板和中性粒细胞在热烧伤后的愈合中起重要作用，通过释放前列腺素、细胞因子和生长因子来刺激血流增加、炎症和组织再生。尽管这两种细胞都会导致烧伤伤口内外的红斑，但这些变化发生在烧伤发生后数小时到数天，而不是像该患者那样在数分钟内发生。\n\n（选项 D）血小板衍生生长因子（PDGF）由血小板、巨噬细胞和内皮细胞释放，并在产生正常伤口愈合所需的血管和成纤维细胞增生方面起重要作用，在最初损伤后的几天到几周内发生。\n\n教育目标：\n浅表热烧伤后最早发生的形态学变化是由于肥大细胞释放预先形成的介质（例如组胺）引起的红斑。较深的（例如，部分厚度）烧伤伤口由于液体通过受损小静脉内皮细胞之间的间隙外渗而形成水疱。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the immediate inflammatory response following a superficial burn and the mediators involved. Specifically, it focuses on the role of histamine in causing erythema and blanching in the early stages of a burn.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of a superficial burn (erythema without blistering) and recall the immediate inflammatory mediators released by mast cells, particularly histamine, which causes vasodilation and blanching.",
