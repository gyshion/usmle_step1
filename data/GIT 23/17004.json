    "en": "A 74-year-old man comes to the office due to chronic constipation. Bowel movements occur once every 3 days and are hard and pellet-like. The patient frequently strains when he tries to defecate and never feels completely evacuated. The constipation is occasionally so severe that he uses his fingers to remove stool from the anorectal vault. Medical history is significant for Parkinson disease, for which he takes carbidopa-levodopa. Vital signs are unremarkable. A resting tremor is present on physical examination. The abdomen is distended but nontender to palpation.",
    "zh": "一名74岁男性因慢性便秘前来就诊。每3天排便一次，粪便坚硬呈颗粒状。患者排便时经常用力，且从未感到完全排空。便秘有时非常严重，需要用手指从肛门直肠腔内取出粪便。病史中，患者患有帕金森病，正在服用卡比多巴-左旋多巴。生命体征未见异常。体格检查显示静止性震颤。腹部膨隆，但触诊无压痛。"

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Stool continence is largely maintained by tonic contraction of the internal and external anal sphincter and the puborectalis muscle, which forms a muscular sling around the rectum and squeezes it into a narrow angle to prevent stool leakage. **Defecation** requires the coordinated relaxation of these muscles, which occurs as follows:\n\n1.  Distension of the rectal vault activates mechanoreceptors that cause involuntary relaxation of the internal anal sphincter (rectosphincteric reflex) and an urge to defecate.\n2.  The puborectalis muscle and external anal sphincter are under voluntary control; when defecation is desired, the muscles relax and the rectum contracts, expelling feces.\n3.  The abdominal muscles contract to increase the pressure gradient of the rectum and aid in the rapid expulsion of feces.\n\nIf the internal or external anal sphincter or, more commonly, the **puborectalis muscle fails to relax**, stool remains in the rectal vault despite attempts to initiate bowel movements (**dyssynergia**), resulting in chronic **constipation**. Patients often strain for a long time only to pass small amounts of stool, and manual disimpaction may be required. Dyssynergic defecation is usually considered a functional disorder and occurs more commonly in the elderly; however, it can occur with certain neurologic disorders (eg, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis) or trauma.\n\n(Choice A) The bulbospongiosus is a superficial perineal muscle that enables penile erection and ejaculation in men and facilitates both vaginal canal closure and orgasm in women. Its dysfunction would lead to sexual impairment but not defecatory dysfunction.\n\n(Choices B and C) The obturator internus and externus and the piriformis contribute to lateral hip rotation. Dysfunction in these muscles would result in motor impairment and gait abnormalities, not defecatory dysfunction.\n\n(Choice E) The rectus abdominis consists of 2 large, paired muscles that run vertically along the anterior abdominal wall. Contraction of abdominal muscles increases the pressure gradient of the rectum and aids in the rapid expulsion of feces; failure of this muscle to relax would not result in constipation.\n\nEducational objective:\nDyssynergic defecation occurs when the puborectalis muscle or the internal or external anal sphincter fails to relax during defecation, leading to chronic constipation. Dyssynergic defecation is usually considered a functional disorder and occurs more commonly in the elderly but may also occur with certain neurologic disorders (eg, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis) or trauma.",
    "zh": "粪便的控制主要由肛门内括约肌和外括约肌以及耻骨直肠肌的持续收缩维持，耻骨直肠肌在直肠周围形成一个肌肉吊带，将其挤压成一个狭窄的角度以防止粪便漏出。**排便**需要这些肌肉的协调性松弛，其过程如下：\n\n1. 直肠腔的扩张激活机械感受器，引起肛门内括约肌的自主松弛（直肠括约肌反射）和排便的冲动。\n2. 耻骨直肠肌和肛门外括约肌受自主控制；当需要排便时，肌肉松弛，直肠收缩，排出粪便。\n3. 腹部肌肉收缩，增加直肠的压力梯度，帮助粪便快速排出。\n\n如果肛门内括约肌或外括约肌，或者更常见的是，**耻骨直肠肌未能松弛**，粪便仍停留在直肠腔内，尽管尝试启动排便（**排便失协同**），导致慢性**便秘**。患者通常会长时间用力，但只能排出少量粪便，并且可能需要手动清除粪便。排便失协同通常被认为是一种功能性疾病，在老年人中更为常见；然而，它也可能发生在某些神经系统疾病（例如，帕金森病，多发性硬化症）或外伤中。\n\n（选项A）球海绵体肌是浅表的会阴肌肉，使男性阴茎勃起和射精，并促进女性阴道闭合和性高潮。其功能障碍会导致性功能障碍，但不会导致排便功能障碍。\n\n（选项B和C）闭孔内肌、闭孔外肌和梨状肌有助于髋关节外旋。这些肌肉的功能障碍会导致运动障碍和步态异常，而不是排便功能障碍。\n\n（选项E）腹直肌由两块大的、成对的肌肉组成，沿腹前壁垂直延伸。腹部肌肉的收缩增加了直肠的压力梯度，有助于粪便的快速排出；该肌肉未能松弛不会导致便秘。\n\n教育目标：\n当耻骨直肠肌或肛门内括约肌或外括约肌在排便过程中未能松弛时，就会发生排便失协同，导致慢性便秘。排便失协同通常被认为是一种功能性疾病，在老年人中更为常见，但也可能发生在某些神经系统疾病（例如，帕金森病，多发性硬化症）或外伤中。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of defecation and the role of the puborectalis muscle in maintaining continence and facilitating bowel movements. It also assesses understanding of dyssynergic defecation, a common cause of constipation, especially in the elderly.\n\nTo solve this question, understand the normal physiology of defecation, particularly the role of the puborectalis muscle. Recognize that failure of this muscle to relax during defecation leads to dyssynergic defecation and chronic constipation. Rule out other muscles based on their primary functions.",
