    "en": "A 28-year-old woman comes to the office due to right hand tremors for the past several weeks. The patient has difficulty performing daily activities and feels embarrassed in social gatherings. She has a history of the remitting-relapsing form of multiple sclerosis. There is no family history of tremors. On physical examination, no abnormal hand movement is observed at rest. When the patient is instructed to touch an object on the table, a coarse tremor is observed that gradually increases as the hand moves closer to its target. Dysfunction of which of the following structures is the most likely cause of this patient's tremor?",

    "en": "This patient has developed a large-amplitude (ie, coarse) tremor that worsens as the hand approaches the target, suggesting a cerebellar tremor. Cerebellar tremor can result from multiple pathologies that affect the cerebellum, most commonly MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, as in this patient. Other common causes include stroke, fragile X syndrome, and cerebellar degeneration.\n\nTremors due to cerebellar lesions are classically LOW FREQUENCY (ie, \"slow,\" <5 Hz) and HIGH AMPLITUDE (ie, coarse) because they involve the proximal, as well as the distal, muscles. The tremor classically increases in amplitude as an action approaches a target (ie, INTENTION TREMOR). It is often accompanied by other CEREBELLAR SIGNS, including ataxia, dysmetria, and/or impaired rapidly alternating movements.\n\n(Choice A) Parkinson disease occurs due to loss of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia (substantia nigra). In contrast to this patient, patients with Parkinson disease classically have a resting tremor that improves with intentional movement. In addition, tremor would be accompanied by rigidity (increased resistance to passive movements), bradykinesia (slowing of voluntary movements), and gait disturbances.\n\n(Choice C) The motor cortex controls voluntary muscle activity. Damage to this area causes a combination of spastic paralysis, clasp-knife rigidity, hyperreflexia, and pathologic reflexes but does not typically cause a rhythmic tremor.\n\n(Choice D) The premotor frontal cortex is responsible for the selection of movements in response to internal and external cues. A lesion affecting this part of the brain can result in abnormal posturing or repetitive movements but not an action tremor.\n\n(Choice E) Lesions affecting the thalamus typically result in contralateral hemiplegia or contralateral hemisensory loss rather than tremor.\n\nEducational objective:\nCerebellar tremors are classically low frequency (<5 Hz) and high amplitude and increase as an action approaches a target. They are often accompanied by other cerebellar signs, including ataxia, dysmetria, and impaired rapidly alternating movements.",
    "zh": "该患者出现了大振幅（即粗大）震颤，并且随着手部接近目标而加重，提示为小脑性震颤。小脑性震颤可能由影响小脑的多种病理引起，最常见的是多发性硬化症，就像该患者一样。其他常见原因包括中风、脆性X染色体综合征和小脑变性。\n\n由于小脑病变引起的震颤通常为低频（即“慢”，<5 Hz）和高振幅（即粗大），因为它们涉及近端和远端肌肉。当动作接近目标时，震颤的振幅通常会增加（即意向性震颤）。它通常伴有其他小脑体征，包括共济失调、辨距不良和/或快速交替运动受损。\n\n（选项A）帕金森病是由于基底神经节（黑质）中多巴胺能神经元的丢失引起的。与该患者不同，帕金森病患者通常表现为静止性震颤，这种震颤随着有意运动而改善。此外，震颤还会伴有僵硬（对被动运动的阻力增加）、运动迟缓（自主运动减慢）和步态障碍。\n\n（选项C）运动皮层控制自主肌肉活动。该区域的损伤会导致痉挛性瘫痪、折刀样强直、反射亢进和病理反射，但通常不会引起节律性震颤。\n\n（选项D）前运动额叶皮层负责根据内部和外部线索选择运动。影响大脑这一部分的病变可能导致异常姿势或重复运动，但不会引起动作性震颤。\n\n（选项E）影响丘脑的病变通常会导致对侧偏瘫或对侧感觉缺失，而不是震颤。\n\n教育目标：\n小脑性震颤通常为低频（<5 Hz）和高振幅，并随着动作接近目标而增加。它们通常伴有其他小脑体征，包括共济失调、辨距不良和快速交替运动受损。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of different types of tremors and their underlying neurological causes, specifically differentiating cerebellar tremors from other tremor types based on clinical presentation and associated neurological signs. It also assesses the knowledge of common etiologies of cerebellar dysfunction, such as multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully analyzing the characteristics of the tremor described in the vignette, such as its presence at rest versus during action, its amplitude, frequency, and how it changes with movement. Comparing these features to the classic descriptions of tremors associated with different neurological structures (basal ganglia, cerebellum, cortex, thalamus) and considering the patient's medical history (multiple sclerosis) will lead to the correct diagnosis.",
