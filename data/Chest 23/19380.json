    "en": "A 17-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department due to hemoptysis and severe respiratory distress. The patient has been on several oral antibiotics for pneumonia over the past week and has required numerous similar treatments in the past. She has been coughing up blood for the past day, which has become progressively worse. Temperature is 37.0 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 42/min. Pulmonary examination reveals diffusely reduced air flow, rales, and intercostal retractions. Copious red blood is produced while coughing during the examination and progresses rapidly. Despite aggressive management, the patient ultimately expires. An autopsy is performed and a gross lung specimen is shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}:",

    "en": "This patient's fatal, massive hemoptysis is suggestive of hemorrhage from the bronchial arteries. A common underlying cause of massive hemoptysis is bronchiectasis, as indicated by this patient's autopsy showing thick, widened airways and mucus plugging. Bronchiectasis is often associated with cystic fibrosis and immunodeficiency disorders, which causes chronic and recurrent airway inflammation and infection. This stimulates neovascularization and bronchial artery hypertrophy. The dilated, fragile, and tortuous vessels are in close proximity to the bronchioles and prone to rupture with increased airway pressure, such as during coughing (eg, acute pulmonary exacerbation).\n\nNormally, blood supply to the lungs consists of the pulmonary circulation and the bronchial circulation. Pulmonary arteries deliver deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lung parenchyma (ie, respiratory bronchioles to alveoli) to be oxygenated and returned to the heart; bronchial arteries arise from the aorta and supply the endobronchial tree (ie, bronchi to terminal bronchioles) with oxygenated blood. Although bleeding from the low-pressure pulmonary circulation is more common, hemorrhage from the high-pressure, systemic bronchial circulation is usually responsible for massive, life-threatening hemoptysis.\n\n(Choices B and C) Hemoptysis due to hypertrophied pulmonary arteries or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (ie, alveolar capillary vasculitis) involves bleeding from the pulmonary circulation, which is a low-pressure system that is unlikely to result in life-threatening hemoptysis. In addition, bronchiectasis is not associated with either condition.\n\n(Choice D) A fistula between the tracheobronchial tree and aorta is usually fatal and can occur with chronic vascular or airway inflammation, typically due to an implanted medical device or stent. A fistula is an uncommon cause of hemoptysis that would not cause dilated bronchial walls on pathology.\n\n(Choice E) Carcinoid tumors are highly vascular endobronchial tumors that commonly present with hemoptysis. However, autopsy would show a discrete mass (not bronchiectasis).\n\nEducational objective:\nMassive, life-threatening hemoptysis is typically due to hemorrhage from the high-pressure bronchial circulation. Bronchiectasis is a common etiology because chronic airway inflammation causes hypertrophied bronchial arteries that are prone to rupture with coughing. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者致命性的大量咯血提示来自支气管动脉的出血。大量咯血的常见潜在病因是支气管扩张，这从该患者的尸检结果显示气道增厚、扩张和粘液阻塞可以证实。支气管扩张通常与囊性纤维化和免疫缺陷病相关，这些疾病会导致慢性、反复的气道炎症和感染。这会刺激血管新生和支气管动脉肥大。扩张的、脆弱的、弯曲的血管非常靠近细支气管，并且容易在气道压力增加时破裂，例如咳嗽期间（例如，急性肺部恶化）。\n\n正常情况下，肺部的血液供应包括肺循环和支气管循环。肺动脉将右心室的静脉血输送到肺实质（即呼吸性细支气管至肺泡）进行氧合，然后返回心脏；支气管动脉起源于主动脉，向支气管内树（即支气管至末端细支气管）供应含氧血。尽管来自低压肺循环的出血更为常见，但来自高压、全身支气管循环的出血通常是导致大量、危及生命的咯血的原因。\n\n（选项B和C）因肥大肺动脉或弥漫性肺泡出血（即，肺泡毛细血管炎）引起的咯血涉及来自肺循环的出血，肺循环是一个低压系统，不太可能导致危及生命的咯血。此外，支气管扩张与这两种情况均无相关性。\n\n（选项D）气管支气管树和主动脉之间的瘘管通常是致命的，并且可能发生在慢性血管或气道炎症中，通常是由于植入的医疗设备或支架引起。瘘管是咯血的不常见原因，不会在病理学上导致扩张的支气管壁。\n\n（选项E）类癌瘤是高度血管化的支气管内肿瘤，通常表现为咯血。然而，尸检会显示一个离散的肿块（而不是支气管扩张）。\n\n教学目标：\n大量、危及生命的咯血通常是由于来自高压支气管循环的出血引起的。支气管扩张是一种常见病因，因为慢性气道炎症会导致支气管动脉肥大，容易在咳嗽时破裂。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the etiology and pathophysiology of massive hemoptysis, specifically focusing on the role of bronchial artery hypertrophy in the context of bronchiectasis. It requires understanding the difference between pulmonary and bronchial circulation and their respective pressures.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of massive hemoptysis in a young patient with a history of recurrent pneumonia. The autopsy findings of thick, widened airways and mucus plugging point towards bronchiectasis, which leads to bronchial artery hypertrophy and subsequent rupture.",
