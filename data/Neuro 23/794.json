Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is most likely to show atrophy of which of the following structures? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the neurodegenerative changes associated with Alzheimer's disease, specifically the pattern of brain atrophy seen on MRI. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing hippocampal atrophy as an early and characteristic finding in Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to recall the typical pattern of brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease. Hippocampal atrophy is a prominent early feature, making it the most likely finding on MRI in a patient with progressive memory loss and cognitive decline.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了与阿尔茨海默病相关的神经退行性变知识，特别是MRI上可见的脑萎缩模式。它强调了将海马体萎缩识别为阿尔茨海默病早期和特征性发现的重要性。\n\n解决这个问题的关键是回忆阿尔茨海默病中典型的脑萎缩模式。海马体萎缩是一个突出的早期特征，使其成为患有进行性记忆力减退和认知能力下降的患者在MRI上最可能的发现。"
