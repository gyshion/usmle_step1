    "en": "A 3-year-old girl is brought to the office due to leg stiffness. Her mother reports that the patient is a clumsy walker and requires assistance to ambulate. The patient was born preterm and has delayed developmental skills. Physical examination shows increased {{exhibit_1}} knee and ankle reflexes and clonus at the ankles bilaterally. Muscle tone of the upper extremities and neck is also mildly increased. MRI of the brain reveals periventricular leukomalacia suggestive of cerebral palsy. An oral medication is prescribed that reduces the extremity stiffness. Which of the following CNS drug effects most likely resulted in this patient's improvement?",

    "en": "This patient has cerebral palsy, a heterogeneous condition characterized by permanent, nonprogressive motor dysfunction caused by damage to the developing brain. Certain subtypes (eg, spastic cerebral palsy) often manifest as delayed gross motor milestones and spasticity (eg, hypertonia, hyperreflexia). Spastic cerebral palsy may be caused by white matter necrosis (seen in this patient as periventricular leukomalacia), which leads to a loss of descending inhibitory control from the upper motor neurons. This results in muscle overactivity, leading to increased tone and hyperreflexia.\n\nEnhancement of CNS inhibitory neurotransmitter activity can improve spasticity. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS and acts on two different receptors:\n\n*   GABA A receptor mediates a fast response to GABA because it is an ion-gated chloride channel. Activation of this receptor leads to rapid muscle relaxation and sedation. Its activity is enhanced by benzodiazepines, which can be used to treat spasticity.\n*   GABA B receptor mediates a slower response to GABA because it is mediated by a G protein-coupled receptor that opens potassium channels. It is agonized by baclofen, which can also be used to treat spasticity.\n\n(Choice A) Glutamate is the primary excitatory CNS neurotransmitter; therefore, activation of NMDA glutamate receptors would result in increased excitation and lead to further increases in muscle tone.\n\n(Choices C and E) Dopamine is a modulatory (rather than primarily excitatory or inhibitory) neurotransmitter that affects motor control. In patients with Parkinson disease who have a relative deficiency of dopamine in the substantia nigra, medications that increase dopaminergic activity (eg, levodopa) can improve muscle rigidity. In some patients, a relative excess of acetylcholine compared to dopamine has been implicated in the tremor or rigidity associated with Parkinson disease or drug-induced parkinsonism. In these patients, anticholinergic medications (eg, trihexyphenidyl) are sometimes used.\n\n(Choice D) Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter found primarily in the spinal cord rather than in the brain. Blockade of glycine receptors (eg, strychnine poisoning) leads to increased muscle contraction.",
    "zh": "该患者患有脑瘫，这是一种异质性疾病，其特征是由于发育中的大脑受损导致的永久性、非进行性运动功能障碍。某些亚型（例如，痉挛型脑瘫）通常表现为粗大运动里程碑延迟和痉挛（例如，肌张力亢进、反射亢进）。痉挛型脑瘫可能由白质坏死引起（在该患者中表现为脑室周围白质软化），这会导致来自上运动神经元的下行抑制控制丧失。这会导致肌肉过度活动，导致肌张力增加和反射亢进。\n\n增强中枢神经系统抑制性神经递质活性可以改善痉挛。 GABA 是中枢神经系统中的主要抑制性神经递质，作用于两种不同的受体：\n\n*   GABA A 受体介导对 GABA 的快速反应，因为它是一个离子门控氯离子通道。该受体的激活会导致肌肉快速放松和镇静。其活性受到苯二氮卓类药物的增强，这些药物可用于治疗痉挛。\n*   GABA B 受体介导对 GABA 的较慢反应，因为它由开放钾离子通道的 G 蛋白偶联受体介导。它被巴氯芬激动，巴氯芬也可用于治疗痉挛。\n\n（选项 A）谷氨酸是主要的中枢神经系统兴奋性神经递质；因此，激活 NMDA 谷氨酸受体将导致兴奋性增加，并导致肌张力进一步增加。\n\n（选项 C 和 E）多巴胺是一种调节性（而不是主要的兴奋性或抑制性）神经递质，会影响运动控制。在黑质中多巴胺相对缺乏的帕金森病患者中，增加多巴胺能活性的药物（例如，左旋多巴）可以改善肌肉僵硬。在某些患者中，与多巴胺相比，乙酰胆碱的相对过量与帕金森病或药物引起的帕金森病相关的震颤或僵硬有关。在这些患者中，有时会使用抗胆碱能药物（例如，苯海索）。\n\n（选项 D）甘氨酸是一种主要存在于脊髓而非大脑中的抑制性神经递质。阻断甘氨酸受体（例如，士的宁中毒）会导致肌肉收缩增加。"

    "en": "The patient presents with symptoms consistent with spastic cerebral palsy, characterized by increased muscle tone and reflexes due to impaired descending inhibitory control. The prescribed medication likely works by enhancing the activity of GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, which can reduce spasticity. Therefore, agonistic activity at GABA receptors is the most likely mechanism of improvement.",
