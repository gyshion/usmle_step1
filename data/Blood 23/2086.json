    "en": "This patient has β thalassemia due to a mutation in the β globin gene just before the methionine start codon (AUG) that is most likely disrupting translation initiation. Eukaryotic translation initiation requires the assembly of ribosomal subunits (60S and 40S), mRNA, initiation factors, initiator tRNA charged with methionine, and guanosine-5-triphosphate (GTP).\n\nThe small ribosomal subunit (40S) initially binds to the 5' cap of mRNA and scans for the start codon, which is positioned near the beginning of the mRNA and is surrounded by the Kozak consensus sequence. This short sequence identifies the specific AUG codon that serves as the initiator of translation (analogous to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in bacteria).\n\nMutations affecting the Kozak consensus sequence can significantly impair protein translation and have been identified in patients with α and β thalassemias.\n\n(Choice A) Co-translational protein targeting is mediated by the N-terminal amino acid sequence of an elongating polypeptide. This localization signal is recognized by a signal recognition protein that helps transport the ribosome to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mutations affecting the signal sequence would be found after the start codon (AUG).\n\n(Choice C) Peptide bond formation is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase, an RNA enzyme (\"ribozyme\") that resides in the large ribosomal subunit. A defect in rRNA coding for ribosomes would interfere with this process.\n\n(Choice D) During polypeptide elongation, the ribosome moves 3 nucleotides toward the 3' end of mRNA, advancing peptidyl tRNA from the A site to the P site (translocation). Translocation is catalyzed by elongation factor 2 and requires GTP hydrolysis.\n\n(Choice E) Termination of polypeptide synthesis occurs at stop codons. Mutations in stop codons (nonstop mutations) can result in continued and inappropriate translation of mRNA into the 3'-untranslated region, producing an excessively long, nonfunctional polypeptide.",
    "zh": "该患者患有β地中海贫血，是由于在甲硫氨酸起始密码子（AUG）之前的β珠蛋白基因发生了突变，这最有可能破坏翻译起始。真核生物翻译起始需要核糖体亚基（60S和40S）、mRNA、起始因子、带甲硫氨酸的起始tRNA和鸟苷-5-三磷酸（GTP）的组装。\n\n小核糖体亚基（40S）最初与mRNA的5'端帽结合，并扫描起始密码子，起始密码子位于mRNA的起始端附近，并被Kozak共有序列包围。这个短序列识别了作为翻译起始子的特定AUG密码子（类似于细菌中的Shine-Dalgarno序列）。\n\n影响Kozak共有序列的突变会显著损害蛋白质翻译，并且已在患有α和β地中海贫血的患者中被发现。\n\n(选项A) 共翻译蛋白质靶向是由延伸中的多肽的N末端氨基酸序列介导的。该定位信号被信号识别蛋白识别，该蛋白有助于将核糖体转运到粗面内质网(ER)。影响信号序列的突变将出现在起始密码子（AUG）之后。\n\n(选项C) 肽键的形成由肽酰基转移酶催化，肽酰基转移酶是一种RNA酶（“核酶”），存在于大核糖体亚基中。rRNA编码核糖体的缺陷会干扰这一过程。\n\n(选项D) 在多肽链延伸期间，核糖体向mRNA的3'端移动3个核苷酸，将肽酰基tRNA从A位点推进到P位点（易位）。易位由延伸因子2催化，并需要GTP水解。\n\n(选项E) 多肽合成的终止发生在终止密码子处。终止密码子中的突变（非终止突变）可能导致mRNA继续和不适当地翻译到3'-非翻译区，从而产生过长、无功能的多肽。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of eukaryotic translation initiation and the role of the Kozak consensus sequence in identifying the start codon. It also assesses understanding of how mutations in this region can impair protein translation, leading to diseases like thalassemia.\n\nTo solve this question, analyze the provided mRNA sequences to identify the mutation's location relative to the start codon. Recognize that mutations near the start codon, particularly within the Kozak sequence, are most likely to disrupt the initiation of translation.",
