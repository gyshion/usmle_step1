    "en": "A 26-year-old previously healthy man is brought to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. The patient was driving while wearing a seatbelt when his car was hit on the left side by another vehicle. He has since had persistent left shoulder pain. He also has nausea and hiccups. The patient's blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg and pulse is 115/min. On examination, he has a bruise on the left lower chest wall with tenderness to palpation along the area. Chest auscultation reveals normal heart sounds and bilaterally equal breath sounds. He has a rigid and tender abdomen.",

    "en": "This patient's rigid abdomen with associated left shoulder pain, hypotension, and tachycardia suggests a possible splenic laceration and hemoperitoneum. The shoulder pain likely represents referred pain due to peritoneal irritation (Kehr sign). \n\nThe phrenic nerves originate from C3-C5 and pass between the lung and heart to provide motor function to the diaphragm. The phrenic nerves also provide sensory fibers to the pericardium, mediastinal pleura, and diaphragmatic peritoneum. The supraclavicular nerves originate from C3-C4 and their branches innervate the sternoclavicular joint, local muscles (eg, sternocleidomastoid), and the skin of the upper and posterior shoulder. Any abdominal process (eg, ruptured spleen, peritonitis, hemoperitoneum) irritating the sensory fibers around the diaphragm can cause referred pain via the phrenic nerve to the C3-C5 shoulder region. Phrenic nerve irritation can also cause hiccups due to spasmodic diaphragmatic contraction pulling air against a closed larynx.\n\n(Choice A) Traumatic aortic rupture presents with chest wall contusions and hypotension, but it is not typically associated with persistent left shoulder pain or hiccups.\n\n(Choices B and D) Hemopericardium (blood accumulation in the pericardial sac) typically presents with shortness of breath, tachycardia, jugular venous distention, and possible hypotension. Lung contusion usually presents gradually with shortness of breath, chest pain, and consolidation on lung imaging. However, persistent shoulder pain is not commonly associated with either condition.\n\n(Choice C) Humerus fracture typically presents with acute shoulder pain that is increased with movement. Examination can show a deformed shoulder joint. This patient's rigid abdomen and absence of obvious shoulder abnormalities make this less likely.\n\n(Choice E) Myocardial contusion after chest wall trauma typically presents with mid-anterior chest wall pain, shortness of breath, persistent tachycardia, and new conduction defects on ECG (eg, bundle branch block). It is not typically associated with persistent abdominal or shoulder pain.\n\n(Choice F) Pneumothorax after chest trauma usually presents with tachypnea, shortness of breath, decreased or absent breath sounds, unilateral hyperresonance to percussion, and pleuritic chest pain. This patient's bilaterally equal breath sounds make this unlikely.\n\nEducational objective:\nAny abdominal process (eg, ruptured spleen, peritonitis, hemoperitoneum) irritating the phrenic nerve sensory fibers around the diaphragm can cause referred pain to the C3-C5 shoulder region (Kehr sign).",
    "zh": "该患者的腹部僵硬，伴有左肩疼痛、低血压和心动过速，提示可能存在脾脏撕裂和腹腔内积血。肩部疼痛可能代表由于腹膜刺激引起的牵涉痛（Kehr征）。\n\n膈神经起源于C3-C5，穿过肺和心脏之间，为膈肌提供运动功能。膈神经还为心包、纵隔胸膜和膈腹膜提供感觉纤维。锁骨上神经起源于C3-C4，其分支支配胸锁关节、局部肌肉（例如，胸锁乳突肌）以及肩部上方和后方的皮肤。任何刺激膈肌周围感觉纤维的腹部过程（例如，脾破裂、腹膜炎、腹腔内积血）都可以通过膈神经引起C3-C5肩部的牵涉痛。膈神经受到刺激也可能引起打嗝，这是由于痉挛性膈肌收缩将空气拉向闭合的喉部。\n\n（选项A）创伤性主动脉破裂表现为胸壁挫伤和低血压，但通常与持续性左肩疼痛或打嗝无关。\n\n（选项B和D）血心包（心包囊内积血）通常表现为呼吸短促、心动过速、颈静脉扩张，可能出现低血压。肺挫伤通常逐渐出现呼吸短促、胸痛和肺部影像学上的实变。然而，持续性肩痛通常与这两种情况无关。\n\n（选项C）肱骨骨折通常表现为活动时加剧的急性肩痛。检查可显示肩关节畸形。该患者的腹部僵硬，且没有明显的肩部异常，因此不太可能。\n\n（选项E）胸壁外伤后的心肌挫伤通常表现为胸壁前中部疼痛、呼吸短促、持续性心动过速和心电图上新的传导缺陷（例如，束支传导阻滞）。它通常与持续性腹部或肩部疼痛无关。\n\n（选项F）胸部外伤后的气胸通常表现为呼吸急促、呼吸短促、呼吸音减弱或消失、叩诊呈单侧过清音和胸膜性胸痛。该患者的双侧呼吸音相等，因此不太可能。\n\n教育目标：\n任何刺激膈神经周围感觉纤维的腹部过程（例如，脾破裂、腹膜炎、腹腔内积血）都可能导致C3-C5肩部区域的牵涉痛（Kehr征）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize the clinical presentation of splenic rupture following blunt abdominal trauma, including referred pain to the shoulder (Kehr's sign) due to diaphragmatic irritation. It also requires knowledge of the typical presentations of other traumatic injuries such as aortic rupture, hemopericardium, lung contusion, myocardial contusion, and pneumothorax.\n\nTo solve this question, prioritize the patient's vital signs (hypotension, tachycardia) and physical exam findings (rigid abdomen, left shoulder pain). Consider the mechanism of injury (motor vehicle collision) and the potential for intra-abdominal bleeding. Recognize that Kehr's sign (referred left shoulder pain) is a classic sign of splenic rupture.",
