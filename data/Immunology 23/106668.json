    "en": "A 36-year-old woman comes to the clinic due to a rash for the past 3 days. The rash started on the patient's torso and spread to the extremities. She has not had a similar rash previously. The patient feels mildly feverish but has no other symptoms. Medical history is notable for multiple sclerosis and associated trigeminal neuralgia. Medications include a recombinant anti-B-cell antibody that was started a year ago and carbamazepine, which the patient has been on for the past 2 weeks. Temperature is 38 C (100.4 F), blood pressure is 118/86 mm Hg, and heart rate is 86/min. Examination shows a rash on the chest, abdomen, back, and proximal extremities, as shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}. Conjunctivae are clear bilaterally, and oropharyngeal examination is unremarkable. The remainder of the examination is normal.",

    "en": "This patient developed a morbilliform (ie, measles-like) rash 1-2 weeks following carbamazepine initiation, concerning for morbilliform drug eruption, a type of drug-induced exanthem.\n\nMorbilliform drug eruption is a type IV (delayed-type) HYPERSENSITIVITY reaction caused by drugs or their metabolites. It typically manifests 5-21 days following drug initiation, or within 1-3 days after reexposure in previously sensitized patients. Lesions consist of erythematous papules and macules distributed symmetrically on the trunk and extremities, sometimes accompanied by low-grade fever, pruritis, and eosinophilia. Unlike Stevens-Johnson syndrome, mucosal involvement (eg, conjunctivae, oropharynx) and skin tenderness are absent.\n\nCommon culprit drugs include ANTICONVULSANTS (eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin), ANTIBIOTICS (eg, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and antiretroviral therapy. Treatment involves cessation of the offending drug; the rash typically self-resolves within 1-3 weeks.\n\n{{exhibit_2}}\n(Choice B) Bacterial folliculitis presents as discrete erythematous follicular papules and pustules. Confluent macules and nonfollicular papules are not characteristic.\n\n(Choice C) In addition to fever, measles typically presents with conjunctivitis, cough, and coryza before the rash erupts; these symptoms are absent in this patient. In addition, measles is rare, particularly in adults.\n\n(Choice D) Scarlet fever is associated with streptococcal pharyngitis and presents with diffuse, fine, erythematous papules with a sandpaper-like texture. This patient does not have sore throat and lacks tonsillitis on examination.\n\n(Choice E) Caused by Staphylococcus aureus, toxic shock syndrome presents with high fever, hypotension (ie, shock), vomiting, diarrhea, altered mentation, and a diffuse erythematous macular rash. This patient has normal blood pressure and lacks symptoms of a serious systemic illness.\n\nEducational objective:\nMorbilliform drug eruption is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction caused by drugs (eg, anticonvulsants, antibiotics) or their metabolites that typically occurs 5-21 days following drug initiation. Lesions consist of erythematous macules and papules, distributed symmetrically on the trunk and extremities, sometimes accompanied by low-grade fever. Mucosal involvement is absent.",
    "zh": "该患者在开始服用卡马西平后1-2周出现了麻疹样皮疹，提示麻疹样药疹，这是一种药物诱发的皮疹。\n\n麻疹样药疹是一种由药物或其代谢产物引起的IV型（迟发型）超敏反应。它通常在开始用药后5-21天出现，或者在先前已致敏的患者再次接触后1-3天内出现。病变包括红斑性丘疹和斑疹，对称分布于躯干和四肢，有时伴有低烧、瘙痒和嗜酸性粒细胞增多。与Stevens-Johnson综合征不同的是，黏膜受累（如结膜、口咽）和皮肤压痛均不存在。\n\n常见的罪魁祸首药物包括抗惊厥药（如卡马西平、苯妥英钠）、抗生素（如复方新诺明）和抗逆转录病毒疗法。治疗包括停止使用致病药物；皮疹通常在1-3周内自愈。\n\n{{exhibit_2}}\n（选项B）细菌性毛囊炎表现为散在的红斑性毛囊性丘疹和脓疱。融合性斑疹和非毛囊性丘疹不是其特征。\n\n（选项C）除了发烧外，麻疹通常在皮疹出现前出现结膜炎、咳嗽和流涕；这些症状在该患者中不存在。此外，麻疹很少见，尤其是在成年人中。\n\n（选项D）猩红热与链球菌性咽炎有关，表现为弥漫性、细小的、红斑性丘疹，呈砂纸样质地。该患者没有咽喉痛，检查也没有扁桃体炎。\n\n（选项E）由金黄色葡萄球菌引起的中毒性休克综合征表现为高烧、低血压（即休克）、呕吐、腹泻、精神状态改变和弥漫性红斑性斑疹。该患者血压正常，且缺乏严重全身性疾病的症状。\n\n教育目标：\n麻疹样药疹是一种IV型超敏反应，由药物（如抗惊厥药、抗生素）或其代谢产物引起，通常在开始用药后5-21天发生。病变包括红斑性斑疹和丘疹，对称分布于躯干和四肢，有时伴有低烧。无黏膜受累。"

It assesses the ability to recognize a drug-induced exanthem based on the timing of medication initiation and the characteristics of the rash. \n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's medication history, the timing of the rash onset relative to the start of carbamazepine, and the absence of mucosal involvement.
