The parents note that she often seems to breathe hard and fast, particularly after feeding or crying. Her lips also sometimes turn blue. On examination, height and weight are at the 15th and 2nd percentiles, respectively. The patient has a 4/6, harsh systolic, crescendo-decrescendo murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border.

    "en": "This patient with episodic cyanosis and respiratory difficulty and a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border (suggestive of right ventricular outflow tract [RVOT] obstruction [ie, pulmonic stenosis]) most likely has tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) {{exhibit_1}}.\n\nIn ToF, RVOT obstruction leads to right-to-left shunting through the large ventricular septal defect, with resulting underperfusion of the pulmonary arteries and hypoxemia. Because the degree of RVOT obstruction is dynamic (eg, can worsen during infundibular muscle spasm), patients can experience periodic episodes of worsening hypoxemia and cyanosis often triggered by feeding or crying (ie, \"tet\" episodes). Poor weight gain is common and likely related to reduced caloric intake and/or higher metabolic needs.\n\nIn response to chronic hypoxemia, the body increases red blood cell (RBC) production to increase oxygen-carrying capacity. Tissue hypoxia in the inner cortex and medulla of the kidney triggers increased renal production of erythropoietin, which then stimulates erythrocyte precursor cells in the bone marrow to produce more RBCs, resulting in an increased hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit. This physiologic type of secondary polycythemia is the most common overall mechanism of polycythemia.\n\n(Choice A) Pulmonary dead space refers to portions of the lung that are ventilated but not perfused. Decreased pulmonary dead space tends to increase alveolar air exchange and would not contribute to development of hypoxemia or secondary polycythemia.\n\n(Choice B) Impaired postnatal lung expansion (eg, pulmonary hypoplasia, diaphragmatic hernia), typically causes acute hypoxemia in the immediate newborn period. This patient's pathologic murmur makes cardiac pathology more likely.\n\n(Choice C) Decreased, not increased, renal blood flow (as in renal artery stenosis) can sometimes cause secondary polycythemia due to reduced oxygen delivery to the renal interstitium.\n\n(Choice D)\nMonoclonal proliferation of erythroid cells (ie, originating from a single mutant cell) is seen in polycythemia vera, a form of blood cancer that involves autonomous RBC production independent of erythropoietin. It is the most common cause of primary polycythemia, which is usually seen in adults and often accompanied by thrombocytosis and leukocytosis (not seen in this patient). In contrast, secondary polycythemia (ie, erythropoietin-stimulated RBC production) involves polyclonal proliferation of erythroid cells.\n\nEducational objective:\nTetralogy of Fallot can present in infancy with episodic cyanosis and poor weight gain. Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (reduced perfusion of the pulmonary arteries) results in chronic hypoxemia, leading to secondary polycythemia. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
