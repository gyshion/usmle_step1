    "en": "A 42-year-old man comes to the emergency department after a syncopal episode preceded by palpitations and lightheadedness. The patient has no significant medical history and takes no medications. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. The patient is a computer programmer and spends most of his time indoors. Vital signs are within normal limits with no orthostatic changes. Heart and lung sounds are normal. The liver span is increased with no tenderness. The skin appears darkly tanned. ECG demonstrates sinus node dysfunction, and echocardiography reveals abnormal diastolic relaxation of the left ventricle.",

    "en": "This patient has syncope associated with diastolic dysfunction, hepatomegaly, and skin hyperpigmentation. This presentation is suggestive of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive intestinal iron absorption with accumulation of the excess iron in parenchymal tissues.\n\nCardiac manifestations of HH include heart failure and conduction system disease. In early stages, myocardial iron overload is expressed as diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with a restrictive filling pattern. As the disease advances, progressive ventricular remodeling leads to dilated cardiomyopathy and reduced LV ejection fraction. Iron deposition can also affect the cardiac conduction system. Sinus node dysfunction (ie, sick sinus syndrome) can lead to presyncope or syncope; malignant arrhythmias with sudden cardiac death occasionally occur.\n\nOn light microscopy, cardiac hemochromatosis is visible as brown, granular deposits (arrow) in myocytes that stain strongly with Prussian blue. Cardiomyopathy can be the first presenting manifestation of HH, although careful assessment can usually find evidence of iron deposition elsewhere (eg, elevated hepatic transaminases, hepatomegaly). Treatment includes therapeutic phlebotomy to remove excess iron stores, which can lead to regression of cardiomyopathy in some patients.\n\n(Choice A) Amyloidosis is caused by extracellular deposition of misfolded amyloid proteins. Multiorgan involvement (eg, cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly) is common, but amyloidosis frequently involves the kidney (eg, nephrotic syndrome), nerves (eg, neuropathy), and muscles (eg, macroglossia). It is not associated with hyperpigmentation.\n\n(Choice B) Primary adrenal insufficiency (ie, cortisol deficiency) can cause hyperpigmentation due to cosecretion of melanocyte-stimulating hormone with ACTH (both derived from proopiomelanocortin). However, hepatomegaly is not seen, and although hypotension is common, sinus node and diastolic dysfunction are not.\n\n(Choice C) Sarcoidosis results from widespread formation of noncaseating granulomas. Cardiac infiltration can cause conduction blockade, and liver involvement may result in hepatomegaly. However, lung symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough) are more common, and skin manifestations include papules and nodules rather than hyperpigmentation.\n\n(Choice D) HH is associated with mutations in the HFE gene; the HFE protein binds to the transferrin receptor and regulates intestinal and hepatic iron uptake. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mutations are associated with autoimmune disorders (eg, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes).\n\n(Choice F) Glycogen storage disease type II (ie, Pompe disease) is caused by a deficiency in alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase). It manifests shortly after birth with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly, muscle weakness, and failure to thrive. Skin hyperpigmentation is not typical.\n\nEducational objective:\nHereditary hemochromatosis is characterized by excessive intestinal iron absorption with deposition of iron in parenchymal tissues. Cardiac manifestations include diastolic dysfunction (initial), dilated cardiomyopathy (later), and conduction system disease (eg, sinus node dysfunction). {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者出现晕厥，并伴有舒张功能障碍、肝肿大和皮肤色素沉着过度。这种表现提示遗传性血色病（HH），这是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是肠道过度吸收铁，导致过多的铁在实质组织中积聚。\n\nHH的心脏表现包括心力衰竭和传导系统疾病。在早期阶段，心肌铁超载表现为舒张性左心室（LV）功能障碍，伴有受限的充盈模式。随着疾病进展，进行性心室重塑导致扩张型心肌病和左室射血分数降低。铁沉积也会影响心脏传导系统。窦房结功能障碍（即病态窦房结综合征）可导致晕厥前或晕厥；恶性心律失常伴有心脏性猝死偶有发生。\n\n在光学显微镜下，心脏血色病可见心肌细胞中呈棕色颗粒状沉积物（箭头），用普鲁士蓝染色呈强阳性。心肌病可以是HH的首发表现，尽管仔细评估通常可以找到其他部位的铁沉积证据（例如，肝转氨酶升高、肝肿大）。治疗包括治疗性放血以去除多余的铁储存，这可以使某些患者的心肌病消退。\n\n（选项A）淀粉样变性是由错误折叠的淀粉样蛋白的细胞外沉积引起的。多器官受累（例如，心肌病、肝肿大）很常见，但淀粉样变性常涉及肾脏（例如，肾病综合征）、神经（例如，神经病变）和肌肉（例如，巨舌症）。它与色素沉着过度无关。\n\n（选项B）原发性肾上腺皮质功能不全（即皮质醇缺乏症）可引起色素沉着过度，这与促黑素细胞刺激素与ACTH的共分泌有关（两者均源自阿片黑素皮质素）。然而，未见肝肿大，虽然低血压很常见，但窦房结和舒张功能障碍则不常见。\n\n（选项C）结节病源于广泛的非干酪性肉芽肿形成。心脏浸润可导致传导阻滞，肝脏受累可导致肝肿大。然而，肺部症状（例如，呼吸困难、咳嗽）更为常见，皮肤表现包括丘疹和结节，而非色素沉着过度。\n\n（选项D）HH与HFE基因突变有关；HFE蛋白与转铁蛋白受体结合，调节肠道和肝脏对铁的吸收。人白细胞抗原（HLA）突变与自身免疫性疾病（例如，乳糜泻、1型糖尿病）相关。\n\n（选项F）II型糖原累积病（即庞贝病）是由α-葡萄糖苷酶（酸性麦芽糖酶）缺乏引起的。它在出生后不久表现为肥厚型心肌病、肝肿大、肌肉无力和生长迟缓。皮肤色素沉着过度不常见。\n\n教学目标：\n遗传性血色病的特征是肠道过度吸收铁，导致铁在实质组织中沉积。心脏表现包括舒张功能障碍（最初）、扩张型心肌病（后期）和传导系统疾病（例如，窦房结功能障碍）。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}"
