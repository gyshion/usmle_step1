    "en": "Researchers want to study the effects of labyrinthectomy with cochlear implantation on hearing, vertigo, and tinnitus. A random sample of medical charts is selected from a cohort of patients who had undergone labyrinthectomy with cochlear implantation in the same ear for intractable vertigo and hearing loss and who had documentation of both preoperative and postoperative audiometric evaluations. Tinnitus is quantified using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) before and after the interventions. The THI score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating greater tinnitus severity. {{exhibit_1}}",
