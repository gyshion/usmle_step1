    "en": "A 64-year-old man comes to the office due to worsening dyspnea on exertion for the past 3 months. The patient has had a nonproductive cough but no chest pain, fever, or chills. He was diagnosed with hypertension several years ago but takes no medications. Blood pressure is 160/96 mm Hg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination shows bilateral inspiratory crackles as well as dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds at the right lung base. Chest x-ray {{exhibit_1}} reveals a right-sided pleural effusion. Which of the following pleuropulmonary changes are most likely present in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient with progressive dyspnea on exertion, nonproductive cough, bilateral crackles on lung auscultation, and a right-sided pleural effusion most likely has DECOMPENSATED HEART FAILURE (chronic, poorly controlled hypertension is a common cause). Pleural effusion in decompensated heart failure is primarily driven by backward transmission of pressure from the failing left ventricle to the pulmonary circulation, resulting in increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure and an increased rate of fluid inflow to the pleural space. Vascular permeability remains normal, as does vascular oncotic pressure (which is mostly determined by serum albumin concentration). Outflow through the parietal pleural lymphatics increases in response to the increased fluid inflow, but it is unable to keep up, resulting in development of pleural effusion. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) Lung malignancy can cause pleural effusion via both an increased rate of inflow due to an inflammatory increase in vascular membrane permeability and a decreased rate of outflow due to obstruction of parietal pleural lymphatics.\n\n(Choice B) All 4 of these changes encourage the development of pleural effusion and multiple disturbances would be required for such changes to take place (eg, lung malignancy [increased vascular permeability and decreased lymphatic flow] in the setting of both hypoalbuminemia [decreased oncotic pressure] and heart failure [increased hydrostatic pressure]).\n\n(Choice C) Hypoalbuminemia (eg, due to nephrotic syndrome or malnutrition) causes pleural effusion due to an increased rate of fluid inflow from reduced vascular oncotic pressure. As with decompensated heart failure, lymphatic flow increases but is unable to keep up with the increased inflow.\n\n(Choice E) All 4 of these changes would discourage the development of pleural effusion.\n\nEducational objective:\nPleural effusion results from an increased rate of fluid inflow from the nearby vasculature or a decreased rate of fluid outflow through the parietal lymphatics. Decompensated heart failure causes pleural effusion primarily due to increased fluid inflow from increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure; lymphatic outflow increases but is unable to keep up with the increased inflow.",
    "zh": "该患者出现进行性劳力性呼吸困难、非生产性咳嗽、双侧肺部听诊爆裂音和右侧胸腔积液，最有可能患有失代偿性心力衰竭（慢性、控制不佳的高血压是常见病因）。失代偿性心力衰竭患者的胸腔积液主要是由衰竭的左心室向肺循环逆向传递压力所驱动，导致肺毛细血管静水压升高，进入胸膜腔的液体流入速率增加。血管通透性保持正常，血管胶体渗透压也保持正常（主要由血清白蛋白浓度决定）。通过壁层胸膜淋巴管的流出量会响应增加的液体流入而增加，但无法跟上，从而导致胸腔积液的发生。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n（选项A）肺恶性肿瘤可通过两种方式引起胸腔积液：由于血管膜通透性的炎症增加导致流入速率增加，以及由于壁层胸膜淋巴管阻塞导致流出速率降低。\n\n（选项B）所有这4种变化都会促进胸腔积液的形成，并且需要多种干扰才能发生此类变化（例如，肺部恶性肿瘤[血管通透性增加和淋巴回流减少]，在低白蛋白血症[胶体渗透压降低]和心力衰竭[静水压升高]的情况下）。\n\n（选项C）低白蛋白血症（例如，由于肾病综合征或营养不良）会导致胸腔积液，原因是由于血管胶体渗透压降低，液体流入速率增加。与失代偿性心力衰竭一样，淋巴回流增加，但无法跟上增加的流入。\n\n（选项E）所有这4种变化都会阻碍胸腔积液的形成。\n\n教学目标：\n胸腔积液是由于附近血管的液体流入速率增加或通过壁层淋巴管的液体流出速率降低引起的。失代偿性心力衰竭引起的胸腔积液主要是由于肺毛细血管静水压升高导致液体流入增加；淋巴流出量增加，但无法跟上增加的流入。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the Starling equation and the factors that contribute to pleural effusion formation, specifically in the context of decompensated heart failure. It requires knowledge of how hydrostatic pressure, oncotic pressure, vascular permeability, and lymphatic flow influence fluid movement in the pleural space.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the pathophysiology of heart failure and its impact on pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure. Recognize that increased hydrostatic pressure is the primary driver of pleural effusion in heart failure, while other factors like vascular permeability and oncotic pressure remain relatively normal. Also, understand that lymphatic flow increases initially to compensate but eventually becomes overwhelmed.",
    "zh": "本题考察对Starling方程的理解以及对导致胸腔积液形成的因素的理解，特别是在失代偿性心力衰竭的背景下。它需要了解静水压、胶体渗透压、血管通透性和淋巴回流如何影响胸膜腔内的液体运动。\n\n要解决这个问题，请考虑心力衰竭的病理生理学及其对肺毛细血管静水压的影响。认识到静水压升高是心力衰竭中胸腔积液的主要驱动因素，而血管通透性和胶体渗透压等其他因素保持相对正常。另外，要了解淋巴回流最初增加以进行补偿，但最终不堪重负。"
