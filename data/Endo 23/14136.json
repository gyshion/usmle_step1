    "en": "A 44-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up of type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was diagnosed 4 years ago and has since been taking metformin. Six months ago, a new antidiabetic agent was added because of suboptimal glycemic control. Today, the patient is pleased because he has unintentionally lost 7 kg (15.4 lb). His only symptoms are occasional nausea, vomiting, and a prolonged sensation of fullness after eating. Vital signs are within normal limits. BMI is 34 kg/m². Physical examination reveals normal heart and lung sounds, a nontender abdomen, and normal deep tendon reflexes. Laboratory testing shows normal renal function and a hemoglobin A1c of 7.2%. If this patient's weight loss is due to the new medication, which of the following agents is most likely responsible?",
    "zh": "一名44岁男性前来就诊，随访2型糖尿病。4年前他被诊断出该病，此后一直在服用二甲双胍。6个月前，由于血糖控制不佳，加用了一种新的降糖药。今天，患者很高兴，因为他无意中减了7公斤（15.4磅）。他唯一的症状是偶尔恶心、呕吐和进食后长时间的饱腹感。生命体征在正常范围内。BMI为34 kg/m²。体格检查显示心肺音正常，腹部无压痛，深腱反射正常。实验室检查显示肾功能正常，糖化血红蛋白A1c为7.2%。如果该患者的体重减轻是由于新药所致，下列哪种药物最有可能导致这种情况？"

    "en": "This patient with inadequately controlled diabetes on metformin therapy was prescribed a second medication. The new agent is associated with nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and significant weight loss, effects characteristic of a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist (eg, exenatide, liraglutide).\n\nGLP-1 is secreted by intestinal L cells in response to food intake and regulates glucose by slowing gastric emptying, suppressing glucagon secretion, and increasing glucose-dependent insulin release (ie, insulin release in response to food intake), which lowers the risk for hypoglycemia. It acts through cell surface receptors that are coupled with a G protein–adenylyl cyclase system. Native GLP-1 is degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), but synthetic GLP-1 agonists are more resistant to degradation, prolonging their therapeutic effect.\n\nAlthough insulin secretion is increased by GLP-1 agonists, most patients lose weight due to suppressed appetite caused by the following:\n\n•\tSlowed gastric emptying\n•\tNausea and vomiting\n•\tIncreased satiety (mediated by receptors in the hypothalamus)\n\nThese effects are also seen in patients without diabetes, a reason that certain GLP-1 agonists are also approved for the primary indication of weight loss.\n\n(Choice A) Basal-bolus insulin therapy is typically used to treat patients with severe diabetes mellitus (eg, hemoglobin A1c >10%). Insulin therapy is not associated with gastrointestinal side effects but causes significant weight gain.\n\n(Choice B) DPP-4 inhibitors (eg, sitagliptin) are oral agents that block the degradation of endogenous GLP-1. Because they act indirectly on the GLP-1 receptor, their effects (eg, antihyperglycemic, weight loss–related) are less pronounced compared to GLP-1 agonists, which act directly on the receptor. Therefore, these agents do not result in weight loss but are considered weight neutral.\n\n(Choice D) Sulfonylureas directly stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion independent of circulating glucose levels, resulting in significant weight gain and risk for hypoglycemia.\n\n(Choice E) Thiazolidinediones (eg, pioglitazone) increase the transcription of certain insulin-responsive genes and decrease insulin resistance. Weight gain and fluid retention are common side effects; weight loss is not seen. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该患者接受二甲双胍治疗的糖尿病控制不佳，因此被处方了第二种药物。这种新药与恶心、呕吐、早期饱腹感和显著的体重减轻有关，这些都是胰高血糖素样肽-1（GLP-1）受体激动剂（如艾塞那肽、利拉鲁肽）的特征。\n\nGLP-1由肠道L细胞分泌，以响应食物摄入，并通过减缓胃排空、抑制胰高血糖素分泌和增加葡萄糖依赖性胰岛素释放（即响应食物摄入的胰岛素释放）来调节葡萄糖，从而降低低血糖的风险。它通过与G蛋白-腺苷酸环化酶系统偶联的细胞表面受体发挥作用。天然GLP-1会被二肽基肽酶-4（DPP-4）降解，但合成GLP-1激动剂对降解更具抵抗力，从而延长其治疗效果。\n\n尽管GLP-1激动剂会增加胰岛素分泌，但大多数患者会因以下原因导致的食欲抑制而减轻体重：\n\n•\t胃排空减慢\n•\t恶心和呕吐\n•\t饱腹感增加（由下丘脑中的受体介导）\n\n这些影响也见于没有糖尿病的患者，这也是某些GLP-1激动剂也被批准用于主要适应症（减肥）的原因。\n\n（选项A）基础-餐时胰岛素治疗通常用于治疗患有严重糖尿病的患者（例如，糖化血红蛋白A1c >10%）。胰岛素治疗与胃肠道副作用无关，但会导致明显的体重增加。\n\n（选项B）DPP-4抑制剂（例如，西格列汀）是口服药物，可阻断内源性GLP-1的降解。由于它们间接作用于GLP-1受体，与直接作用于受体的GLP-1激动剂相比，它们的效果（例如，降血糖、与体重减轻相关）不那么明显。因此，这些药物不会导致体重减轻，但被认为是体重中性。\n\n（选项D）磺脲类药物直接刺激胰腺胰岛素分泌，不依赖于循环葡萄糖水平，从而导致明显的体重增加和低血糖的风险。\n\n（选项E）噻唑烷二酮类（例如，吡格列酮）增加某些胰岛素反应基因的转录并降低胰岛素抵抗。体重增加和液体潴留是常见的副作用；未见体重减轻。{{exhibit_1}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of antidiabetic medications and their side effect profiles, specifically focusing on weight loss as a side effect. It requires understanding the mechanism of action of different antidiabetic agents and their impact on weight.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to recognize that GLP-1 agonists are associated with weight loss due to their effects on gastric emptying, appetite suppression, and increased satiety. Other antidiabetic medications like insulin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones are typically associated with weight gain.",
