    "en": "A 4-week-old boy is brought to the office for a routine well-baby visit. The boy has been exclusively breastfeeding every 2-3 hours and is making 6 or 7 wet diapers a day. His urine has appeared dark yellow, and he has had a few pale-colored stools. His parents also noticed that his skin has appeared yellow for the past 2 weeks, but they were not concerned as {{exhibit_1}} they heard from friends that yellow skin is common with breastfeeding. The patient was born full term without complications from vaginal delivery to a primigravida. On physical examination, he is well-appearing with icteric sclerae and jaundice of the head and upper chest. Abdominal examination reveals a mildly enlarged and firm liver. Liver function results are as follows:",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Biliary atresia is a progressive, complete or partial obstruction of extrahepatic bile ducts. The biliary tree is normal at birth and subsequently undergoes destruction that is thought to be immune-related or viral-induced. Infants may appear healthy at birth, but then present with jaundice within the first 2 months of life, along with dark urine and acholic (pale or clay-colored) stools due to excessive renal excretion of bilirubin and lack of intestinal bile, respectively. {{exhibit_2}} Physical examination may also reveal firm hepatomegaly due to inflammation. Laboratory findings, including elevated direct bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transferase, are consistent with cholestasis. Liver biopsy is usually diagnostic and reveals intrahepatic bile duct proliferation, portal tract edema, and fibrosis. Urgent surgical intervention is required, as lack of intervention can lead to death (due to cirrhosis) usually within 2 years.",
    "zh": "胆道闭锁是肝外胆管进行性、完全或部分阻塞。胆道在出生时是正常的，随后发生破坏，这被认为是与免疫相关的或病毒诱导的。婴儿出生时可能看起来很健康，但在出生后 2 个月内出现黄疸，以及深色尿液和无胆汁性（淡色或陶土色）粪便，这分别归因于胆红素过度肾脏排泄和缺乏肠道胆汁。{{exhibit_2}} 体格检查也可能显示由于炎症引起的肝肿大。实验室检查结果，包括直接胆红素和谷氨酰转肽酶升高，与胆汁淤积一致。肝活检通常具有诊断意义，并显示肝内胆管增生、门管区水肿和纤维化。需要紧急外科干预，因为缺乏干预会导致死亡（由于肝硬化），通常在 2 年内。"
