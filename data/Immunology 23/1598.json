  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's history of night sweats, weight loss, and cough with the finding of apical pulmonary granulomas showing caseous necrosis is highly suggestive of ACTIVE TUBERCULOSIS. The caseating granulomas of tuberculosis consist of large epithelioid macrophages with pale pink granular cytoplasm surrounding a central region of necrotic debris. The most specific cell surface marker of the monocyte-macrophage cell lineage is CD14, which binds to bacterial lipopolysaccharide.\n\n(Choice A) Together with T cell receptors, CD4 transmembrane proteins recognize antigens presented by MHC Class II molecules. CD4 is expressed on the surface of macrophages but is also found on T helper cells. Therefore, CD4 is not a specific marker for monocytes/macrophages.\n\n(Choice B) CD7 is a multi-chain complex T cell marker. It is key to the interaction between T cells and B cells during lymphoid cell development.\n\n(Choice C) CD8 is a transmembrane protein associated with T cell receptors and found on the surface of cytotoxic T cells. Together, these proteins recognize antigenic peptides presented by MHC Class I molecules.\n\n(Choice E) CD20 is a B cell surface marker. Monoclonal antibodies against the CD-20 antigen (eg, rituximab) have been successful in the treatment of lymphomas.\n\nEducational objective: The caseating granulomas of tuberculosis are surrounded by large epithelioid macrophages with pale pink granular cytoplasm. CD14 is a surface marker most specific to the monocyte-macrophage cell lineage. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathogenesis of tuberculosis and the cell surface markers of macrophages, specifically CD14. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of tuberculosis and linking it to the characteristic granulomatous inflammation and the immune cells involved.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the key features of the clinical vignette (recent immigrant, weight loss, night sweats, cough, apical granulomas with caseous necrosis) and associate them with tuberculosis. Then, recall that the granulomas are composed of macrophages, and CD14 is a specific marker for cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage.",
