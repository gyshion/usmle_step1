    "en": "A 43-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with severe epigastric pain that started after she ate a heavy meal. She has had several milder episodes, noting that they occur after she eats fried food. The patient has not experienced bloating or changes in stool frequency. She recently sprained her ankle, for which she takes ibuprofen daily. BMI is 31 kg/m². Physical examination is limited by pain. Which of the following substances most likely initiates the recurrent episodes of epigastric pain seen in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient's recurrent epigastric pain after eating fat- and protein-rich meals strongly suggests biliary colic from underlying gallstones and/or biliary sludge. Most commonly, gallstones are cholesterol based, often developing in persons older than age 40. Elevated estrogen exposure (eg, female sex, obesity, pregnancy) significantly increases the risk because it stimulates cholesterol-rich bile secretion.\n\nWhen bile becomes supersaturated with cholesterol, microscopic crystal formation creates a thick slurry (biliary sludge), with further aggregation producing gallstones. On detecting fat- and protein-rich chyme, I cells lining the duodenum and jejunum release the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), causing the gallbladder to contract. This contraction may force gallstones and sludge against the gallbladder outlet; the resulting occlusion increases intragallbladder pressure, leading to pain that is typically felt in the right subcostal or epigastric region. As CCK levels wane, the gallstones and sludge fall back, relieving pressure (ie, a postprandial waxing-waning pain pattern). In addition to stimulating gallbladder contraction, CCK also increases pancreatic enzyme secretion and relaxes the sphincter of Oddi, thereby orchestrating fatty and amino acid absorption. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice B) Patients with lactose intolerance often have postprandial abdominal pain after ingesting dairy products. However, the pain usually occurs with bloating and diarrhea, symptoms not present in this patient.\n\n(Choice C) Prostaglandins (eg, PGE2, PGI2) help protect the gastric mucosa from damage by acid; in contrast, excess consumption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can inhibit production of gastroprotective prostaglandins, increasing the risk for gastric ulcers that may cause postprandial epigastric pain.\n\n(Choice D) Secretin is a hormone that stimulates the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate, helping to regulate pH in the duodenum. Although it also increases bicarbonate secretion by the biliary tract, it does not induce gallbladder contraction.\n\n(Choice E) Carcinoid tumors can secrete high amounts of serotonin, causing flushing, diarrhea, and bronchospasm. They most commonly present with periodic abdominal pain, which arises from mesenteric fibrosis or bowel kinking/obstruction rather than increased serotonin.\n\n(Choice F) Somatostatin suppresses gastrointestinal hormone release (eg, insulin, CCK, vasoactive intestinal peptide), reduces intestinal motility, and decreases splanchnic blood flow.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe release of cholecystokinin (CCK) from the duodenum and jejunum after exposure to fat- and protein-rich meals stimulates gallbladder contraction. In patients with gallstones or biliary sludge, contraction can force the stones/sludge against the gallbladder outlet, causing temporary occlusion of outflow and increased intragallbladder pressure. This manifests as postprandial upper abdominal pain that waxes and wanes with CCK levels (biliary colic).",
    "zh": "该患者进食富含脂肪和蛋白质的餐食后反复出现上腹部疼痛，强烈提示可能存在潜在的胆结石和/或胆道淤泥引起的胆绞痛。最常见的是，胆结石以胆固醇为基础，常发生于40岁以上的人群。雌激素暴露增加（例如，女性，肥胖，怀孕）会显著增加风险，因为它刺激富含胆固醇的胆汁分泌。\n\n当胆汁过饱和胆固醇时，微观晶体形成会产生浓稠的浆液（胆道淤泥），进一步聚集产生胆结石。当检测到富含脂肪和蛋白质的食糜时，覆盖十二指肠和空肠的I细胞释放激素胆囊收缩素（CCK），引起胆囊收缩。这种收缩可能会迫使胆结石和淤泥与胆囊出口相遇；由此产生的阻塞会增加胆囊内压力，导致疼痛，这种疼痛通常在右肋下或上腹部区域感觉到。随着CCK水平下降，胆结石和淤泥回落，减轻压力（即，餐后时有变化的疼痛模式）。除了刺激胆囊收缩外，CCK还会增加胰酶分泌并松弛奥狄括约肌，从而协调脂肪和氨基酸的吸收。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项B) 乳糖不耐受的患者在摄入乳制品后通常会出现餐后腹痛。然而，这种疼痛通常伴有腹胀和腹泻，而该患者没有这些症状。\n\n(选项C) 前列腺素（例如，PGE2，PGI2）有助于保护胃粘膜免受酸的损害；相比之下，过量摄入非甾体抗炎药会抑制胃保护性前列腺素的产生，增加导致餐后上腹部疼痛的胃溃疡的风险。\n\n(选项D) 促胰液素是一种刺激胰腺分泌碳酸氢盐的激素，有助于调节十二指肠的pH值。尽管它也增加胆道分泌碳酸氢盐，但它不会引起胆囊收缩。\n\n(选项E) 类癌肿瘤可以分泌大量的血清素，导致潮红，腹泻和支气管痉挛。它们最常表现为周期性腹痛，这种疼痛源于肠系膜纤维化或肠扭结/梗阻，而不是血清素增加。\n\n(选项F) 生长抑素抑制胃肠激素释放（例如，胰岛素，CCK，血管活性肠肽），降低肠道蠕动，并减少内脏血流。\n\n教育目标：\n在接触富含脂肪和蛋白质的餐食后，十二指肠和空肠释放胆囊收缩素（CCK），刺激胆囊收缩。在患有胆结石或胆道淤泥的患者中，收缩可以将结石/淤泥推向胆囊出口，导致暂时性流出道阻塞和胆囊内压力升高。这表现为餐后上腹部疼痛，其随CCK水平而变化（胆绞痛）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of biliary colic pathophysiology, specifically the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in gallbladder contraction and pain generation after fatty meals. It also requires differentiating biliary colic from other causes of abdominal pain. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the pattern of postprandial epigastric pain, especially after fatty meals, and associating it with gallbladder contraction stimulated by CCK. Ruling out other causes based on the absence of associated symptoms is also crucial.",
