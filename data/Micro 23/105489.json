  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Traditional vaccinations are generally divided into the following categories.\n\n*   **Live attenuated vaccinations** introduce a disabled virus that replicates but causes minimal illness. Because the virus infects host cells, it produces a long-lasting humoral and cell-mediated immune response against a diverse range of viral antigens that mirrors that of a normal infection.\n*   **Inactivated vaccinations** introduce viral fragments that are taken up by antigen presenting cells and displayed to B and T lymphocytes. However, because the virus does not replicate with host cells, they tend to elicit a short-acting humoral immune response and less robust cell-mediated response; multiple doses and booster shots are often required to provide effective immunity.\n\nAlthough live attenuated and inactivated virus immunizations are effective, their development requires years or decades and is often more difficult for nonmicrobial antigens (eg, cancer cell antigens). In contrast, mRNA vaccinations can be rapidly synthesized in vitro and can be targeted to produce any known protein (eg, viral spike protein, cancer antigens). Once in the cytoplasm, the exogenous mRNA is translated by host ribosomes to the encoded viral protein, which then translocates to the cell surface. This triggers a strong B- and T-cell–mediated immune response against the foreign protein, leading to long-lasting immunity.\n\n(Choice A) RNase enzymes present in the extracellular milieu as part of the innate immune defense against viruses rapidly destroy unprotected mRNA. Therefore, mRNA vaccines are generally encased in a carrier compound (eg, lipid bilayer) to protect it and to efficiently deliver it into host cells.\n\n(Choice C) mRNA vaccines provide protective immunity only when the mRNA is translated to its encoded protein and expressed on the surface of host cells. An adaptive immune response targeting the mRNA directly would not provide protective immunity, as the viral capsid/membrane protects the genome while the viron remains extracellular.\n\n(Choice D) Retroviruses (eg, HIV) can convert their genomic RNA to DNA and then integrate into the host genome. However, mRNA is transcribed to protein and then degraded within host cells; it is not integrated into the genome.\n\nEducational objective:\nmRNA vaccines deliver mRNA molecules encoding foreign protein into the cytoplasm of host cells (particularly antigen presenting cells that avidly engulf the associated carrier compound). The mRNA is then translated by ribosomes and displayed on the cell surface, leading to a robust adaptive immune response.",
    "zh": "传统疫苗接种通常分为以下几类。\n\n*   **减毒活疫苗**引入一种失活病毒，该病毒会复制但引起轻微疾病。由于病毒感染宿主细胞，它会产生针对多种病毒抗原的长期体液和细胞介导的免疫反应，这与正常感染的免疫反应相似。\n*   **灭活疫苗**引入病毒片段，这些片段被抗原呈递细胞摄取并呈递给B淋巴细胞和T淋巴细胞。然而，由于病毒不在宿主细胞内复制，它们往往会引起短效的体液免疫反应和不太强的细胞介导的反应；通常需要多次接种和加强针才能提供有效的免疫力。\n\n虽然减毒活疫苗和灭活病毒疫苗接种有效，但它们的发展需要数年或数十年，并且对于非微生物抗原（例如，癌细胞抗原）来说通常更困难。相比之下，mRNA疫苗可以在体外快速合成，并且可以靶向产生任何已知蛋白质（例如，病毒刺突蛋白、癌抗原）。一旦进入细胞质，外源mRNA就会被宿主核糖体翻译成编码的病毒蛋白，然后转运到细胞表面。这会触发针对外来蛋白的强烈B细胞和T细胞介导的免疫反应，从而产生持久的免疫力。\n\n（选项A）作为先天免疫防御的一部分，存在于细胞外环境中的RNase酶会迅速破坏未受保护的mRNA。因此，mRNA疫苗通常被包裹在载体化合物中（例如，脂质双层），以保护它并有效地将其递送到宿主细胞中。\n\n（选项C）只有当mRNA被翻译成其编码的蛋白质并在宿主细胞表面表达时，mRNA疫苗才能提供保护性免疫力。直接靶向mRNA的适应性免疫反应不会提供保护性免疫力，因为病毒衣壳/膜保护基因组，而病毒仍然存在于细胞外。\n\n（选项D）逆转录病毒（例如，HIV）可以将其基因组RNA转化为DNA，然后整合到宿主基因组中。然而，mRNA被转录成蛋白质，然后在宿主细胞内降解；它不会整合到基因组中。\n\n教育目标：\nmRNA疫苗将编码外来蛋白的mRNA分子递送到宿主细胞的细胞质中（特别是积极吞噬相关载体化合物的抗原呈递细胞）。然后，mRNA被核糖体翻译并在细胞表面显示，从而产生强大的适应性免疫反应。"

    "en": "This question tests the mechanism of action of mRNA vaccines and how they elicit an immune response. It requires understanding that mRNA vaccines lead to the expression of a viral protein by antigen-presenting cells, triggering both B- and T-cell mediated immunity.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the fact that mRNA vaccines are translated into viral proteins within host cells. This expression of viral protein by antigen-presenting cells is what stimulates the adaptive immune response.",
