  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has an elevated alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level and ultrasound findings consistent with an open neural tube defect (NTD), a condition caused by failure of PRIMARY NEURULATION. Primary neurulation begins with formation of the neural plate. During the third week of fetal development, the lateral ends of the neural plate elevate to become neural folds that fuse in the midline to form the neural tube. Fusion starts in the cervical region and extends rostrally and caudally to the anterior and posterior neuropores, respectively.\n\nFailure of either neuropore to close leads to open NTDs, in which a portion of the developing CNS remains connected to the amniotic cavity. Maternal serum AFP is ELEVATED due to direct leakage from the open neural tube into the amniotic fluid.\n\nFailure of posterior (caudal) neuropore closure specifically results in a NTD referred to as an open spinal dysraphism, and most commonly causes a myelomeningocele in which portions of the spinal cord within the meningeal sac protrude through a vertebral arch defect. Prenatal ultrasound may show a complex cystic mass along the lower spine, as in this case. Myelomeningoceles are also commonly associated with downward displacement of the hindbrain (Chiari II malformation) that can obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (causing ventriculomegaly).\n\n(Choice A) The primitive streak establishes the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo; it normally completely disappears by the end of the 4th week of gestation. Rarely, remnants can persist in the sacrococcygeal region and give rise to a sacral teratoma. The brain would not be affected.\n\n(Choice B) Dandy-Walker syndrome results from underdevelopment of the cerebellar vermis. Ultrasound would demonstrate cystic enlargement of the posterior fossa and hypoplasia of the vermis, and elevated AFP would not be expected.\n\n(Choice C) Neural crest cells are the progenitors for the peripheral (not central) nervous system; Hirschsprung disease (congenital aganglionic megacolon) is a disorder of neural crest cell migration. NTDs are not related to neural crest cell abnormalities.\n\n(Choice D) Neuronal migration disorders (eg, lissencephaly, or loss of sulci) are caused by the abnormal migration of nascent neurons within the brain. A spinal mass would not be seen. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者甲胎蛋白 (AFP) 水平升高，超声检查结果与开放性神经管缺陷 (NTD) 相符，这种情况是由原发性神经胚管形成失败引起的。原发性神经胚管形成始于神经板的形成。在胎儿发育的第三周，神经板的侧端抬高，成为神经褶，在中线融合形成神经管。融合从颈部开始，分别向头端和尾端延伸到前神经孔和后神经孔。\n\n任一神经孔闭合失败都会导致开放性 NTD，在开放性 NTD 中，发育中的中枢神经系统的一部分与羊膜腔相连。由于开放性神经管直接渗漏到羊水中，母体血清 AFP 升高。\n\n特别是，后部（尾部）神经孔闭合失败会导致 NTD，称为开放性脊柱裂，最常见的原因是脊髓脊膜膨出，即脊髓的一部分在脊膜囊内通过椎弓缺陷突出。产前超声检查可能会显示沿着下脊柱的复杂囊性肿块，如本例所示。脊髓脊膜膨出也常与后脑向下移位（Chiari II 畸形）相关，这会阻塞脑脊液的流动（导致脑室扩大）。\n\n(选项 A) 原条建立胚胎的前后轴；它通常在妊娠第4周末完全消失。 很少情况下，残留物会持续存在于骶尾部，并引起骶部畸胎瘤。大脑不会受到影响。\n\n(选项 B) Dandy-Walker 综合征是由于小脑蚓部发育不全所致。超声检查将显示后颅窝囊性增大和小脑蚓部发育不全，并且 AFP 升高不明显。\n\n(选项 C) 神经嵴细胞是周围神经系统（而非中枢神经系统）的前体；Hirschsprung 病（先天性无神经节巨结肠）是一种神经嵴细胞迁移的疾病。NTD 与神经嵴细胞异常无关。\n\n(选项 D) 神经元迁移障碍（例如，脑回缺失或脑沟消失）是由新生神经元在大脑内异常迁移引起的。不会看到脊柱肿块。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of neural tube defects, specifically myelomeningocele, and the embryological process of primary neurulation. It also assesses the ability to interpret ultrasound findings and correlate them with the underlying developmental abnormality.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the ultrasound findings (cystic mass, ventriculomegaly, hindbrain herniation) as indicative of myelomeningocele. Recall that myelomeningocele is a neural tube defect caused by failure of posterior neuropore closure during primary neurulation.",
