    "en": "An 18-year-old woman comes to the clinic due to intermittent dry cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath. She recently began practicing twice a day for her college track team and has been experiencing these symptoms with running. Her symptoms have been limiting her ability to complete practice but usually resolve after several minutes of rest. Medical history includes childhood asthma that has not required treatment for the past 5 years. The patient is prescribed a medication that reduces bronchoconstriction by inhibiting the interaction of inflammatory mediators with cell surface receptors. Which of the following drugs was most likely used in this patient?",

    "en": "Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is common in patients with underlying asthma. Asthma occurs due to a complex inflammatory response to the environment that involves Th2 lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells. Eosinophils and mast cells synthesize and release leukotrienes, which are inflammatory mediators that induce bronchial smooth muscle contraction (bronchoconstriction), bronchial mucus secretion, and bronchial edema. The leukotrienes mainly responsible for these responses are the cysteinyl-containing leukotrienes such as leukotriene C4, D4, and E4.\n\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists (eg, montelukast, zafirlukast) effectively treat asthma by binding to leukotriene receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells and blocking the effects of cysteinyl-containing leukotrienes. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Albuterol causes short-acting bronchodilation via selective stimulation of beta 2 receptors. It is typically used as an as-needed rescue inhaler in patients with asthma.\n\n(Choice B) Dextromethorphan suppresses cough via stimulation of sigma opioid receptors in the CNS (it does not stimulate mu or delta opioid receptors and therefore does not cause other typical opioid effects). It is commonly used in cold medication but is not effective for treatment of asthma.\n\n(Choice C) Inhaled corticosteroids (eg, fluticasone, budesonide) help treat asthma by inhibiting nuclear transcription of inflammatory genes leading to widespread anti-inflammatory effects. One effect is reduced activity of the enzyme phospholipase A2 to decrease the production of leukotrienes. Corticosteroids do not block cell surface receptors.\n\n(Choice D) Ipratropium stimulates bronchodilation via blockade of the binding of acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter) to muscarinic receptors. Inhaled ipratropium is sometimes used in the treatment of asthma but is more commonly used for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n(Choice F) Zileuton is a 5-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitor that reduces the production of leukotrienes (it does not block leukotriene cell surface receptors). It can be used for treatment of asthma, but it is often avoided due to concerns about toxicity.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe cysteinyl-containing leukotrienes (ie, leukotriene C4, D4, and E4) are inflammatory mediators that stimulate bronchoconstriction, bronchial mucus secretion, and bronchial edema to contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (eg, montelukast, zafirlukast) treat asthma by binding to leukotriene receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells and blocking these effects.",
    "zh": "运动诱发性支气管收缩在有潜在哮喘的患者中很常见。哮喘的发生是由于对环境的复杂炎症反应，涉及Th2淋巴细胞、嗜酸性粒细胞和肥大细胞。嗜酸性粒细胞和肥大细胞合成并释放白三烯，这些白三烯是炎症介质，可诱导支气管平滑肌收缩（支气管收缩）、支气管粘液分泌和支气管水肿。主要负责这些反应的白三烯是含半胱氨酰基的白三烯，如白三烯C4、D4和E4。\n\n白三烯受体拮抗剂（如孟鲁司特、扎鲁司特）通过与支气管平滑肌细胞上的白三烯受体结合并阻断含半胱氨酰基的白三烯的作用来有效治疗哮喘。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项A) 沙丁胺醇通过选择性刺激β2受体引起短效支气管扩张。它通常用作哮喘患者的按需急救吸入剂。\n\n(选项B) 右美沙芬通过刺激中枢神经系统中的σ阿片受体来抑制咳嗽（它不刺激μ或δ阿片受体，因此不会引起其他典型的阿片类药物作用）。它通常用于感冒药，但对治疗哮喘无效。\n\n(选项C) 吸入性皮质类固醇（如氟替卡松、布地奈德）通过抑制炎症基因的核转录来帮助治疗哮喘，从而产生广泛的抗炎作用。一种作用是降低酶磷脂酶A2的活性，以减少白三烯的产生。皮质类固醇不阻断细胞表面受体。\n\n(选项D) 异丙托溴铵通过阻断乙酰胆碱（一种神经递质）与毒蕈碱受体的结合来刺激支气管扩张。吸入性异丙托溴铵有时用于治疗哮喘，但更常用于慢性阻塞性肺病。\n\n(选项F) 齐留通是一种5-脂氧合酶抑制剂，可减少白三烯的产生（它不阻断白三烯细胞表面受体）。它可用于治疗哮喘，但由于对毒性的担忧，通常避免使用。\n\n教育目标：\n含半胱氨酰基的白三烯（即白三烯C4、D4和E4）是炎症介质，可刺激支气管收缩、支气管粘液分泌和支气管水肿，从而促成哮喘的发病机制。白三烯受体拮抗剂（如孟鲁司特、扎鲁司特）通过与支气管平滑肌细胞上的白三烯受体结合并阻断这些作用来治疗哮喘。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of asthma pathophysiology and the mechanism of action of leukotriene receptor antagonists. It requires understanding how these medications reduce bronchoconstriction by blocking the effects of inflammatory mediators.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the medication class that specifically targets the inflammatory mediators involved in asthma, particularly leukotrienes. Recognizing that montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist will lead to the correct answer.",
