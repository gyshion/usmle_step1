    "en": "A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, at 18 weeks gestation comes to the office for a routine prenatal appointment. She is feeling well and has had no complications during this pregnancy. The patient has no chronic medical conditions and has had no previous surgeries. Her only medications are a daily prenatal vitamin and an iron supplement. Blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg and pulse is 62/min. BMI is 24 kg/m². Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. The uterus is consistent with 18 weeks gestation and fetal heart tones are normal. There is mild bilateral pedal edema to the shins. Compared to a nonpregnant state, which of the following changes are most likely expected in this patient? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is D because pregnancy is associated with a mild prothrombotic state due to increased procoagulant factors, decreased anticoagulant factors, and reduced fibrinolysis. Specifically, fibrinogen levels increase significantly during pregnancy. Protein S levels decrease, and fibrinolytic activity is reduced. The table {{exhibit_1}} shows that option D reflects these expected changes: fibrinogen level is increased (indicated by '-'), Protein S level is decreased (indicated by '-'), and fibrinolysis activity is decreased (indicated by '-').\n\nOption A is incorrect because fibrinogen levels increase, Protein S levels decrease, and fibrinolytic activity decreases in pregnancy.\nOption B is incorrect because while fibrinogen and Protein S levels are decreased, the percentage for fibrinolysis activity is not representative of the overall reduction.\nOption C is incorrect because Protein S levels decrease, not remain unchanged, and fibrinolytic activity decreases.\nOption E is incorrect because fibrinogen levels increase, not remain unchanged, and Protein S levels decrease.\nOption F is incorrect because fibrinogen levels increase, not remain unchanged, and while Protein S levels decrease, fibrinolytic activity also decreases, not increases.\n\nKey clinical pearls: Pregnancy is a state of hypercoagulability to prevent excessive bleeding during delivery. This is achieved by increased procoagulant factors (like fibrinogen), decreased anticoagulant factors (like Protein S), and reduced fibrinolysis. This increased risk of thrombosis also contributes to the risk of venous thromboembolism in pregnant and postpartum women.",
    "zh": "正确答案是D，因为妊娠与轻度促血栓形成状态相关，这归因于促凝血因子增加、抗凝血因子减少和纤维蛋白溶解减少。具体来说，纤维蛋白原水平在妊娠期间显著升高。蛋白S水平降低，纤维蛋白溶解活性降低。表格{{exhibit_1}}显示选项D反映了这些预期变化：纤维蛋白原水平升高（用“-”表示），蛋白S水平降低（用“-”表示），纤维蛋白溶解活性降低（用“-”表示）。\n\n选项A不正确，因为妊娠期间纤维蛋白原水平升高，蛋白S水平降低，纤维蛋白溶解活性降低。\n选项B不正确，因为虽然纤维蛋白原和蛋白S水平降低，但纤维蛋白溶解活性的百分比并不能代表总体的降低。\n选项C不正确，因为蛋白S水平降低，而不是保持不变，并且纤维蛋白溶解活性降低。\n选项E不正确，因为纤维蛋白原水平升高，而不是保持不变，并且蛋白S水平降低。\n选项F不正确，因为纤维蛋白原水平升高，而不是保持不变，并且虽然蛋白S水平降低，但纤维蛋白溶解活性也降低，而不是升高。\n\n关键临床要点：妊娠是一种高凝状态，以防止分娩期间过度出血。这是通过增加促凝血因子（如纤维蛋白原）、减少抗凝血因子（如蛋白S）和降低纤维蛋白溶解来实现的。这种血栓形成风险的增加也增加了孕妇和产后妇女静脉血栓栓塞的风险。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the hematologic changes that occur during pregnancy, specifically focusing on the coagulation system and its impact on the prothrombotic state. It assesses knowledge of how fibrinogen levels, Protein S levels, and fibrinolytic activity are altered compared to the nonpregnant state.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall or deduce the physiological adaptations of the maternal coagulation system to prepare for delivery. Analyzing the provided table and comparing it with the known physiological changes of pregnancy, particularly the balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors and the fibrinolytic system, is crucial for identifying the correct option.",
