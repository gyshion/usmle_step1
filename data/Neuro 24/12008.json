The patient has no headache, muscle weakness, slurred speech, or difficulty ambulating. Medical history includes hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and prior ischemic stroke without residual symptoms. Anticoagulation was discontinued 2 months ago after he developed a gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg, and pulse is 92/min and regular. During the evaluation, the right arm paresthesia spreads to the entire right side of the body, and the patient develops right-sided convulsions, followed by a bilateral tonic-clonic seizure. {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with a history of stroke and atrial fibrillation presents with symptoms suggestive of a focal neurological deficit that progresses to a generalized seizure. The initial symptom of right arm tingling and numbness, followed by spread to the entire right side of the body and subsequent right-sided convulsions, strongly suggests a focal-onset seizure originating in the left cerebral hemisphere, given the patient is right-handed (dominant hemisphere). The primary somatosensory cortex, located in the postcentral gyrus, is responsible for processing all somatic sensory input from the contralateral side of the body. Therefore, a seizure originating in the left primary somatosensory cortex would manifest as sensory disturbances (numbness, tingling, paresthesia) on the right side of the body. The subsequent development of right-sided convulsions indicates the seizure spread to the adjacent primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus), which controls voluntary movement on the contralateral side. Finally, the bilateral tonic-clonic seizure represents generalization of the seizure activity to both cerebral hemispheres.\n\n(Choice D) The primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus) is responsible for initiating voluntary movements on the contralateral side of the body. While the patient develops right-sided convulsions, indicating motor cortex involvement, the initial symptom was sensory, pointing to the somatosensory cortex as the origin.\n(Choice A) The frontal eye field is located in the frontal lobe and controls voluntary horizontal eye movements. Seizures originating here typically cause contralateral eye deviation.\n(Choice B) Broca's area, typically in the left inferior frontal gyrus, is responsible for speech production. Lesions or seizures here cause expressive aphasia.\n(Choice E) Wernicke's area, typically in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus, is responsible for language comprehension. Lesions or seizures here cause receptive aphasia.\n(Choice F) The primary visual cortex is located in the occipital lobe and processes visual information. Seizures originating here can cause visual hallucinations or disturbances in the contralateral visual field.\n\nKey clinical pearl: Sensory symptoms preceding motor symptoms in a focal seizure suggest an origin in the somatosensory cortex, while motor symptoms preceding sensory symptoms suggest an origin in the motor cortex. The spread of seizure activity often follows the anatomical proximity of cortical areas.",
    "zh": "这名有卒中和房颤病史的患者，其症状提示局灶性神经功能缺损，并进展为全面性癫痫发作。最初的症状为右臂刺痛和麻木，随后蔓延至整个身体右侧，并继发右侧抽搐，强烈提示局灶起病癫痫发作，起源于左脑半球，考虑到该患者是右利手（优势半球）。初级躯体感觉皮层位于中央后回，负责处理来自对侧身体的所有躯体感觉输入。因此，起源于左侧初级躯体感觉皮层的癫痫发作将表现为身体右侧的感觉障碍（麻木、刺痛、感觉异常）。随后发生的右侧抽搐表明癫痫蔓延到邻近的初级运动皮层（中央前回），该皮层控制对侧的自主运动。最后，双侧强直-阵挛性癫痫发作代表癫痫活动泛化到两个脑半球。\n\n（选项 D）初级运动皮层（中央前回）负责启动对侧身体的自主运动。虽然患者出现右侧抽搐，表明运动皮层参与，但最初的症状是感觉异常，表明起源于躯体感觉皮层。\n（选项 A）额叶眼动区位于额叶，控制自主水平眼球运动。起源于此处的癫痫通常会导致对侧眼球偏斜。\n（选项 B）Broca区，通常位于左侧额下回，负责言语产生。此处的病变或癫痫发作会导致表达性失语。\n（选项 E）Wernicke区，通常位于左侧颞上回后部，负责语言理解。此处的病变或癫痫发作会导致接受性失语。\n（选项 F）初级视觉皮层位于枕叶，处理视觉信息。起源于此处的癫痫发作可导致对侧视野的视觉幻觉或障碍。\n\n关键临床要点：局灶性癫痫发作中，感觉症状先于运动症状提示起源于躯体感觉皮层，而运动症状先于感觉症状提示起源于运动皮层。癫痫活动的蔓延通常遵循皮质区域的解剖学邻近性。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the localization of neurological deficits based on seizure semiology. It requires correlating the patient's initial sensory symptoms and subsequent motor manifestations with the functions of specific cerebral cortical areas.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the hemisphere involved based on the contralateral symptoms. Then, the initial symptom (sensory disturbance) should be attributed to the primary somatosensory cortex, and the subsequent spread to motor symptoms should be linked to the primary motor cortex. The question asks for the origin of the seizure, which is the area where the initial symptoms began.",
