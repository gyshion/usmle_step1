    "en": "A 47-year-old man with known coronary artery disease comes to the emergency department with chest tightness, sweating, and palpitations. His symptoms began abruptly 2 hours ago while he was at work. Six months ago, the patient underwent percutaneous angioplasty of the right coronary artery. Past medical history also includes anxiety and panic attacks. Blood pressure is 180/90 mm Hg and pulse is 110/min with a regular rhythm. An esmolol infusion produces rapid symptom relief and heart rate slowing. Which of the following portions of the ECG will be affected most significantly by the medication? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "On an ECG, the P wave represents atrial depolarization and the QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization. The PR interval {{exhibit_2}} is the period from the beginning of atrial depolarization (start of P wave) to the beginning of ventricular depolarization (start of QRS complex). The longer the PR interval, the longer it takes for an electrical stimulus to travel from the SA node to the ventricles via the AV node, bundle of His, and fascicular branches. Drugs that slow AV nodal conduction, such as beta blockers, will prolong the PR interval. Beta blockers (except sotalol, which also has class III properties) do not have any specific effects on QRS or QT interval durations.\n\n(Choice A) The T wave represents ventricular repolarization. It is not affected by beta-adrenergic blockers. Myocardial ischemia can cause T wave inversion.\n\n(Choice C) The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization. It is not affected by beta-adrenergic blockers. A widened QRS complex can occur in the setting of ventricular automaticity, left or right bundle branch blocks, or ventricular pacemakers.\n\n(Choice D) The ST-segment is a period of electrocardiographic inactivity that extends between ventricular depolarization and repolarization. It is not affected by beta-adrenergic blockers. ST-segment elevation or depression is usually a sign of myocardial ischemia.\n\n(Choice E) The QT interval represents the time needed for ventricular depolarization and repolarization (ventricular electrical systole). Long QT syndrome can be congenital or acquired. Antiarrhythmics such as quinidine and sotalol are most frequently associated with acquired long QT. However, most beta blockers have a minimal effect on the resting QT interval.\n\nEducational objective: Beta blockers decrease AV nodal conduction, leading to an increased AV nodal refractory period. This correlates to PR interval prolongation on an ECG.",
    "zh": "在心电图（ECG）上，P波代表心房去极化，QRS波群代表心室去极化。PR间期{{exhibit_2}}是从心房去极化开始（P波开始）到心室去极化开始（QRS波群开始）的时间。PR间期越长，电刺激从窦房结通过房室结、希氏束和束支到达心室所需的时间就越长。减慢房室结传导的药物，如β受体阻滞剂，会延长PR间期。β受体阻滞剂（索他洛尔除外，它也具有III类特性）对QRS或QT间期没有特定的影响。\n\n（选项A）T波代表心室复极化。它不受β-肾上腺素能阻滞剂的影响。心肌缺血可导致T波倒置。\n\n（选项C）QRS波群代表心室去极化。它不受β-肾上腺素能阻滞剂的影响。在心室自律性、左或右束支传导阻滞或心室起搏器的情况下，可能会出现QRS波群增宽。\n\n（选项D）ST段是心电图的非活动期，介于心室去极化和复极化之间。它不受β-肾上腺素能阻滞剂的影响。ST段抬高或压低通常是心肌缺血的征兆。\n\n（选项E）QT间期代表心室去极化和复极化（心室电收缩期）所需的时间。长QT综合征可以是先天性的或后天获得的。抗心律失常药物，如奎尼丁和索他洛尔，最常与获得性长QT相关。然而，大多数β受体阻滞剂对静息QT间期的影响很小。\n\n教学目标：β受体阻滞剂降低房室结传导，导致房室结不应期延长。这与心电图上PR间期延长相关。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of ECG interpretation and the effects of beta-blockers on cardiac conduction. Specifically, it assesses the understanding of how beta-blockers prolong the PR interval by slowing AV nodal conduction.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that beta-blockers primarily affect AV nodal conduction. Therefore, the ECG interval most likely to be affected is the PR interval, which represents the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel through the AV node.",
    "zh": "本题考察对心电图（ECG）解读的知识以及β受体阻滞剂对心脏传导的影响。具体而言，它评估了对β受体阻滞剂通过减慢房室结传导来延长PR间期的理解。\n\n解决此问题的关键是认识到β受体阻滞剂主要影响房室结传导。因此，最有可能受影响的心电图间期是PR间期，它代表电脉冲通过房室结所需的时间。"
