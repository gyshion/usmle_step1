    "en": "A 62-year-old woman comes to the office due to tingling and numbness in her feet over the last several months. The patient has also noticed a small ulcer on her right foot that \"doesn't seem to be healing.\" Medical history is significant for long-term diabetes, hypertension, and gout. Physical examination shows decreased pain sensation over both feet and bilateral absence of ankle reflexes.",

    "en": "This patient presents with symptoms suggestive of diabetic neuropathy, specifically a length-dependent peripheral polyneuropathy. The long-standing diabetes, coupled with the stocking-glove distribution of sensory loss and absent ankle reflexes, points towards this diagnosis. Diabetic neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, particularly with poor glycemic control and long disease duration. The underlying pathophysiology involves several mechanisms, with a primary one being nonenzymatic glycosylation of tissue proteins, including those in the vasa nervorum. This leads to hyalinization of endoneurial arterioles, causing narrowing of the lumen and subsequent ischemic nerve damage. Additionally, accumulation of glycosylation end-products contributes to oxidative stress within the nerve tissue.\n\n(Choice B) Endoneurial inflammatory infiltration is characteristic of conditions like GUILLAIN-BARRÉ SYNDROME, which typically presents with a rapidly progressive ascending paralysis, rather than the chronic, stocking-glove paresthesia seen here. Segmental demyelination is also a hallmark of GBS.\n\n(Choice C) Mutations in myelin protein genes are associated with CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, a hereditary neuropathy. While it can cause foot drop and sensory loss, the presentation is often more insidious and may involve prominent motor symptoms like foot dorsiflexion weakness due to common peroneal nerve involvement, with sensory symptoms typically being less prominent than in this case.\n\n(Choice D) Nerve compression within an anatomic compartment leads to compression neuropathy, such as carpal tunnel syndrome. This typically affects a specific nerve distribution and is caused by mechanical pressure, which is not the primary mechanism described in this patient's diffuse, bilateral symptoms.\n\n(Choice E) Poor signal transmission at the neuromuscular junction is the hallmark of disorders like MYASTHENIA GRAVIS (MG) and LAMBERT-EATON SYNDROME (LES). MG is caused by antibodies against acetylcholine receptors, leading to fatigable weakness, often affecting proximal and facial muscles. LES involves antibodies against presynaptic calcium channels, causing weakness that improves with repetition. These conditions do not typically present with the sensory deficits and areflexia seen in this patient.\n\nKey clinical pearls:\nDIABETIC NEUROPATHY often presents as a length-dependent PERIPHERAL POLYNEUROPATHY with stocking-glove paresthesia and diminished proprioception. The presence of a NONHEALING WOUND is a significant complication related to impaired sensation and poor wound healing in diabetic patients. The pathophysiology involves ENDONEURIAL ARTERIOLAR HYALINIZATION and ISCHEMIC NERVE DAMAGE due to nonenzymatic glycosylation.",
    "zh": "该患者出现的症状提示糖尿病神经病变，特别是长度依赖性周围性多发性神经病。长期糖尿病史，加上袜套样感觉缺失分布和踝反射消失，指向此诊断。糖尿病神经病变是糖尿病的常见并发症，尤其是在血糖控制不佳和病程较长的情况下。其潜在的病理生理机制涉及多种机制，其中主要机制是非酶促糖基化组织蛋白，包括滋养神经血管中的蛋白。这导致神经内膜小动脉玻璃样变性，引起管腔狭窄，进而导致神经缺血性损伤。此外，糖基化终末产物的积累会导致神经组织内的氧化应激。\n\n(选项 B) 神经内膜炎性浸润是吉兰-巴雷综合征等疾病的特征，吉兰-巴雷综合征通常表现为快速进展性上升性瘫痪，而不是此处所见的慢性袜套样感觉异常。节段性脱髓鞘也是 GBS 的一个标志。\n\n(选项 C) 髓磷脂蛋白基因突变与夏科-马利-牙病（遗传性神经病）相关。虽然它可能导致足下垂和感觉缺失，但表现往往更为隐匿，可能涉及突出的运动症状，如由于腓总神经受累引起的足背屈无力，而感觉症状通常不如本例突出。\n\n(选项 D) 神经在解剖间隙内受压导致压迫性神经病变，例如腕管综合征。这通常影响特定的神经分布，并由机械性压迫引起，这并非本患者弥漫性、双侧症状的主要机制。\n\n(选项 E) 神经肌肉接头处信号传递不良是重症肌无力 (MG) 和兰伯特-伊顿综合征 (LES) 等疾病的标志。 MG 由针对乙酰胆碱受体的抗体引起，导致易疲劳的无力，常影响近端和面部肌肉。 LES 涉及针对突触前钙通道的抗体，导致重复后改善的无力。这些情况通常不会出现本患者所见的感觉缺失和反射消失。\n\n关键临床要点：\n糖尿病神经病变通常表现为长度依赖性周围性多发性神经病，伴有袜套样感觉异常和本体感觉减退。不愈合的伤口是糖尿病患者感觉受损和伤口愈合不良相关的重要并发症。其病理生理学涉及神经内膜小动脉玻璃样变性和非酶促糖基化引起的缺血性神经损伤。"
