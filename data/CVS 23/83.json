    "en": "A 17-year-old boy collapses while jogging and dies despite resuscitation efforts. He has no medical history; however, his family history is significant for an uncle who died suddenly at age 20. The boy is 185.4 cm (6 ft 1 in) tall and weighs 80 kg (176.4 lb). Autopsy reveals significant left ventricular hypertrophy predominantly affecting the interventricular septum. There are no valvular abnormalities. Assuming the boy died of an inherited condition, which of the following proteins was most likely affected by the relevant mutation?",

    "en": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in a young patient with a family history of SCD and autopsy findings of asymmetric septal hypertrophy is highly suggestive of HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY (HCM). HCM is an AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT genetic disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding MYOCARDIAL CONTRACTILE PROTEINS of the sarcomere. The most common mutations are single-point missense mutations affecting myosin-binding protein C and beta-myosin heavy chain.\n\nSCD in HCM typically results from VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIA, which is encouraged by the following:\n\nConduction disturbances caused by cardiomyocyte disarray altering the spatial relationship of intercalated discs (the primary mediators of organized cardiac conduction)\nMyocardial ischemia resulting from increased oxygen demand of the hypertrophied myocardium and decreased oxygen supply due to both microvascular dysfunction and dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction\n(Choices B, C, D, and E) X-linked recessive mutations affecting the dystrophin protein are responsible for both Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy and can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy. Autosomal dominant mutations affecting glycoprotein fibrillin-1 cause Marfan syndrome, which is characterized by abnormalities of the skeleton (eg, disproportionately long extremities, pectus deformities, scoliosis), eyes (lens dislocation), and cardiovascular system (eg, aortic root dilation, aortic regurgitation). Autosomal dominant or recessive mutations affecting inward rectifier potassium channels cause long QT syndrome. Acquired mutations affecting the transthyretin protein cause cardiac amyloidosis and resulting restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy in older patients (eg, age >60). All these conditions can cause SCD, but none involve asymmetric septal hypertrophy.\n\nEducational objective: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant inherited condition resulting from mutations affecting genes that encode for myocardial contractile proteins of the sarcomere; myosin-binding protein C and beta-myosin heavy chain are the most commonly affected proteins. HCM is characterized by asymmetric septal hypertrophy and increased risk of sudden cardiac death.",

It also assesses the ability to recognize the clinical presentation and autopsy findings suggestive of HCM in a young patient with a family history of sudden cardiac death.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of HCM: sudden cardiac death in a young person, family history, and asymmetric septal hypertrophy on autopsy. Recall that HCM is often caused by mutations in genes encoding myocardial contractile proteins, particularly myosin-binding protein C and beta-myosin heavy chain.",
