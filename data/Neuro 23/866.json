    "en": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents following a seizure. The patient has had an upper respiratory illness for the last 2 days but has no previous history of seizures. Today, he suddenly became unresponsive and his arms and legs started shaking for approximately 40 seconds. The patient was alert when the paramedics arrived at his house. In the emergency department, temperature is 40 C (104 F) and pulse is 110/min. The patient appears tired but is alert and cooperative. Physical examination shows clear nasal discharge and mild pharyngeal erythema but no nuchal rigidity or other neurologic deficits.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's presentation is consistent with febrile seizure, a generally benign neurologic condition characterized by seizure and elevated temperature (≥38 C [100.4 F]) without signs of CNS infection (eg, nuchal rigidity) or metabolic abnormality. Children age 6 months to 5 years are almost exclusively affected because seizure threshold is lower during early years of brain development. In addition, young children are particularly susceptible to febrile viral illnesses (eg, roseola, influenza) associated with high fever (≥39.5 C [103 F]), a key risk factor for development of seizures due to HYPERTHERMIA-INDUCED NEURONAL DYSFUNCTION.\n\nA simple febrile seizure is characterized by a generalized seizure (eg, unresponsiveness, tonic-clonic movements) that is short (<15 min) and does not recur within 24 hours. Benzodiazepines can be used to abort seizures lasting ≥5 min; however, most self-resolve prior to presentation. Treatment primarily involves ANTIPYRETICS (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), which DECREASE FEVER by inhibiting prostaglandin E2 synthesis and counteracting the effects of circulating cytokines, resulting in reduction of the thermoregulatory set point in the hypothalamus.\n\n(Choice B) Microbial invasion of the meningeal layers occurs with meningitis, a serious infection that may progress to encephalitis and trigger generalized seizures. However, meningitis causes other findings not seen in this patient, such as nausea/vomiting, photophobia, nuchal rigidity, and prolonged confusion (ie, persisting after post-ictal period).\n\n(Choice C) Neuronal injury from cross-reacting antiviral antibodies describes acute cerebellar ataxia, which often occurs in children following a viral illness but presents with gait instability, impaired coordination, and tremor.\n\n(Choice D) Severe neuronal loss and gliosis in the hippocampus (ie, hippocampal sclerosis) causes mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Although this condition is associated with a history of childhood febrile seizures, it usually presents in young adults as focal-onset seizures (rather than generalized-onset seizures) characterized by unilateral motor symptoms, a rising epigastric sensation, and auditory/olfactory auras.\n\n(Choice E) Absence seizures are initiated by synchronized slow-wave discharge of thalamocortical tracts. Although these seizures are more common in children with a history of febrile seizures, they are characterized by staring spells of <20 seconds, not unresponsiveness for 40 seconds with shaking movements.",
    "zh": "该患者的表现与热性惊厥一致，这是一种通常良性的神经系统疾病，其特征是癫痫发作和体温升高（≥38°C [100.4°F]），且无中枢神经系统感染（例如，颈项强直）或代谢异常的迹象。6个月至5岁的儿童几乎完全受到影响，因为在脑发育的早期，癫痫发作阈值较低。此外，年幼的儿童特别容易受到与高烧（≥39.5°C [103°F]）相关的热性病毒性疾病（例如，幼儿急疹、流感）的影响，这是由于高热诱导的神经元功能障碍，是癫痫发作发展的一个关键危险因素。\n\n单纯性热性惊厥的特征是全身性癫痫发作（例如，无反应、强直-阵挛性运动），持续时间短（<15分钟），并且在24小时内不会复发。苯二氮卓类药物可用于终止持续≥5分钟的癫痫发作；然而，大多数在就诊前自行缓解。治疗主要涉及解热药（例如，非甾体抗炎药），通过抑制前列腺素E2的合成并抵消循环细胞因子的影响来降低发热，从而降低下丘脑中的体温调节设定点。\n\n（选项 B）脑膜层微生物侵袭发生在脑膜炎中，这是一种可能进展为脑炎并引发全身性癫痫发作的严重感染。然而，脑膜炎会导致其他在该患者中未见的发现，如恶心/呕吐、畏光、颈项强直和持续性意识模糊（即，在癫痫后状态持续存在）。\n\n（选项 C）交叉反应性抗病毒抗体引起的神经元损伤描述了急性小脑共济失调，这种疾病通常发生在儿童病毒性疾病后，但表现为步态不稳、协调障碍和震颤。\n\n（选项 D）海马体严重神经元丢失和神经胶质增生（即，海马硬化）导致内侧颞叶癫痫。虽然这种情况与儿童热性惊厥史有关，但通常在年轻人中表现为局灶起病性癫痫发作（而非全身起病性癫痫发作），其特征是单侧运动症状、上腹部感觉上升以及听觉/嗅觉先兆。\n\n（选项 E）失神发作是由丘脑皮质束的同步慢波放电引发的。虽然这些癫痫发作在有热性惊厥史的儿童中更常见，但其特征是凝视发作，持续时间<20秒，而不是无反应40秒伴有震颤。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of febrile seizures, their pathophysiology, and clinical presentation in young children. It requires differentiating febrile seizures from other causes of seizures in this age group, particularly infectious etiologies.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key features of the patient's presentation: young age, recent viral illness, high fever, and a brief generalized seizure without focal neurologic deficits or signs of CNS infection. This constellation of findings strongly suggests a febrile seizure, with hyperthermia-induced neuronal dysfunction being the underlying mechanism.",
