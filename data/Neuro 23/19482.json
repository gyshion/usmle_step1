    "en": "A 44-year-old man comes to the office due to paresthesia and pain in his feet. The patient began experiencing tingling and numbness in his toes several months ago, which gradually progressed to the rest of both feet. He has also had burning pain on the soles, which frequently disrupts his sleep at night. The patient has a 6-year history of HIV infection. He was not adherent to treatment initially but now takes antiretroviral therapy regularly. His most recent CD4 cell count was 550/mm³. Vital signs are within normal limits. Foot examination shows decreased pain and touch sensation and loss of ankle reflexes bilaterally. There are no other focal neurologic deficits. Medication review shows no neurotoxic drugs and laboratory studies are within normal limits. Treatment with duloxetine is planned. This medication is most likely to improve this patient's symptoms via which of the following mechanisms?",
    "zh": "一名44岁男性因足部感觉异常和疼痛来诊。患者几个月前开始出现足趾麻木和刺痛，逐渐蔓延至双足。他还出现足底烧灼痛，经常在夜间干扰睡眠。患者有6年HIV感染史。他最初未坚持治疗，但现在定期服用抗逆转录病毒治疗。他最近的CD4细胞计数为550/mm³。生命体征在正常范围内。足部检查显示双侧疼痛和触觉减退，并且踝反射消失。没有其他局灶性神经功能缺损。药物回顾显示无神经毒性药物，实验室检查结果在正常范围内。计划使用度洛西汀治疗。这种药物最有可能通过以下哪种机制改善患者的症状？"

    "en": "This patient with HIV peripheral neuropathy is being treated with duloxetine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Because SNRIs increase norepinephrine in the central synapses, they modulate the descending pain pathway, leading to decreased central perception of pain.\n\nFirst-line therapy for painful neuropathy includes the following 3 classes of medications:\n\n*   Tricyclic antidepressants (eg, nortriptyline, amitriptyline) modulate pain transmission by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels in sensory nerves and increasing norepinephrine signaling in the CNS.\n*   Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (eg, duloxetine, venlafaxine) alter central transmission of pain by increasing norepinephrine in the central synapses.\n*   Anticonvulsants (eg, gabapentin, pregabalin) inhibit the release of excitatory neurotransmitters by binding to voltage-gated calcium modulators on nerve terminals.\n\n(Choice A) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have an analgesic effect that is mediated by decreased sensitization of sensory afferent neurons. They are effective in treating pain due to inflammation but not for neuropathic pain.\n\n(Choices B and D) Opioids reduce pain perception at multiple levels. At the spinal level, they lead to decreased substance P-induced activation of dorsal horn neurons. At the supraspinal level, they inhibit GABA release by the periaqueductal gray neurons. They are possibly effective for neuropathic pain, but they are not recommended as initial treatment due to the risk of abuse and dependence.\n\n(Choice C) Carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant that works by frequency-dependent blockade of neuronal conductance, is used to treat trigeminal neuralgia.",
    "zh": "这名患有HIV相关周围神经病的患者正在接受度洛西汀治疗，度洛西汀是一种5-羟色胺-去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂（SNRI）。由于SNRI可以增加中枢突触中的去甲肾上腺素，它们会调节下行痛觉通路，从而降低中枢对疼痛的感知。\n\n疼痛性神经病的一线治疗包括以下3类药物：\n\n*   三环类抗抑郁药（例如，去甲替林、阿米替林）通过抑制感觉神经中的电压门控钠离子通道和增加中枢神经系统中的去甲肾上腺素信号传导来调节疼痛传递。\n*   5-羟色胺-去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂（SNRI）（例如，度洛西汀、文拉法辛）通过增加中枢突触中的去甲肾上腺素来改变中枢痛觉传递。\n*   抗惊厥药（例如，加巴喷丁、普瑞巴林）通过与神经末梢上的电压门控钙调节剂结合来抑制兴奋性神经递质的释放。\n\n（选项A）非甾体类抗炎药具有镇痛作用，这种作用是通过降低感觉传入神经元的敏感性来实现的。它们可有效治疗由炎症引起的疼痛，但对神经性疼痛无效。\n\n（选项B和D）阿片类药物可在多个水平上降低疼痛感知。在脊髓水平上，它们可导致P物质诱导的背角神经元激活减少。在脑干水平上，它们抑制导水管周围灰质神经元释放GABA。它们可能对神经性疼痛有效，但由于存在滥用和依赖的风险，不建议作为初始治疗。\n\n（选项C）卡马西平是一种抗惊厥药，其通过神经传导的频率依赖性阻滞发挥作用，用于治疗三叉神经痛。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of duloxetine in treating neuropathic pain, specifically HIV-associated peripheral neuropathy. It requires understanding how serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) modulate pain pathways.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's condition as HIV-related peripheral neuropathy and identify duloxetine as an SNRI. Recall that SNRIs increase norepinephrine levels, which activate the descending pain pathway, leading to decreased central pain perception.",
    "zh": "此题考察了度洛西汀治疗神经性疼痛（特别是HIV相关周围神经病）的作用机制。它需要理解5-羟色胺-去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂 (SNRI) 如何调节痛觉通路。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要认识到患者的病情是HIV相关的周围神经病，并将度洛西汀确定为一种SNRI。回想一下，SNRI会增加去甲肾上腺素水平，从而激活下行痛觉通路，导致中枢疼痛感知降低。"
