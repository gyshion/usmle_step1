Medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes daily for 25 years. Blood pressure is 140/86 mm Hg and pulse is 84/min. On physical examination, the right pupil is 3 mm and the left pupil is 5 mm. When the light in the examination room is dimmed, the anisocoria increases. {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has anisocoria (ie, pupillary asymmetry), which indicates a unilateral defect in input from either the ocular sympathetic (pupil dilation) or parasympathetic (pupil constriction) pathway. In response to dim light, input from the oculosympathetic pathway initiates pupillary dilation, allowing more light to reach the retina. Under bright light, parasympathetic input from the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve (CN III) initiates pupillary constriction, limiting the amount of light received by the retina.\n\nDetermining which pathway is affected in anisocoria can be accomplished by observing the change in pupillary discrepancy in both bright and dim light:\n\n*   Asymmetry that increases in dim light indicates that the smaller pupil is unable to dilate due to loss of sympathetic nerve input. Under bright light, the asymmetry will decrease because parasympathetic input (pupillary constriction) is unaffected.\n*   Asymmetry that increases under bright light indicates that the larger pupil is unable to constrict due to loss of parasympathetic nerve input. In dim light, the asymmetry will decrease because sympathetic input (pupillary dilation) is unaffected.\n\nThis patient has increased asymmetry in a dim room, indicating that the smaller (right) pupil is unable to dilate due to loss of sympathetic nerve input secondary to a lesion in the right oculosympathetic pathway. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choices A and D) An oculomotor nerve lesion would disrupt parasympathetic innervation of the ipsilateral pupil, resulting in anisocoria that increases under bright light because the abnormal larger pupil is unable to constrict in response to light.\n\n(Choice B) Damage to the left oculosympathetic pathway would cause loss of sympathetic input to the left eye, resulting in a fixed, constricted pupil in the left eye (with increased asymmetry in dim light) rather than in the right.\n\n(Choices C and F) The optic nerves carry the afferent portions of the pupillary reflex from each eye. A unilateral optic nerve lesion would not cause pupillary asymmetry, but instead monocular vision loss and decreased bilateral pupillary constriction in response to light entering the affected eye (ie, relative afferent pupillary defect).\n\nEducational objective:\nPupillary asymmetry (ie. anisocoria) is caused by a lesion in the ocular parasympathetic (pupillary constriction) or sympathetic (pupillary dilation) pathways. In this patient, the pupillary asymmetry increases in a dim room, indicating that the smaller right pupil is unable to dilate due to a lesion in the right oculosympathetic pathway.",
    "zh": "该患者有瞳孔不等大（即瞳孔不对称），这表明眼交感神经（瞳孔扩张）或副交感神经（瞳孔收缩）通路的单侧输入存在缺陷。在弱光下，来自眼交感神经通路的输入会启动瞳孔扩张，从而允许更多的光线到达视网膜。在强光下，来自同侧动眼神经（CN III）的副交感神经输入启动瞳孔收缩，限制视网膜接收到的光线量。\n\n通过观察强光和弱光下瞳孔差异的变化，可以确定瞳孔不等大受影响的通路：\n\n*   在弱光下，不对称性增加表明较小的瞳孔由于交感神经输入丧失而无法扩张。在强光下，不对称性将会减小，因为副交感神经输入（瞳孔收缩）不受影响。\n*   在强光下，不对称性增加表明较大的瞳孔由于副交感神经输入丧失而无法收缩。在弱光下，不对称性将会减小，因为交感神经输入（瞳孔扩张）不受影响。\n\n该患者在昏暗的房间里不对称性增加，表明较小的（右侧）瞳孔由于右侧眼交感神经通路病变导致的交感神经输入丧失而无法扩张。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n（选项A和D）动眼神经病变会破坏同侧瞳孔的副交感神经支配，导致瞳孔不等大在强光下加剧，因为异常较大的瞳孔无法对光线做出收缩反应。\n\n（选项B）左侧眼交感神经通路损伤会导致左眼交感神经输入丧失，导致左眼瞳孔固定、收缩（在弱光下不对称性增加），而不是右眼。\n\n（选项C和F）视神经携带来自每只眼睛的瞳孔反射的传入部分。单侧视神经病变不会引起瞳孔不对称，而是导致单眼视力丧失，并且对进入受影响眼睛的光线（即相对传入性瞳孔缺陷）的双侧瞳孔收缩减少。\n\n教育目标：\n瞳孔不对称（即瞳孔不等大）是由眼副交感神经（瞳孔收缩）或交感神经（瞳孔扩张）通路的病变引起的。在该患者中，瞳孔不对称在昏暗的房间中增加，表明较小的右侧瞳孔由于右侧眼交感神经通路的病变而无法扩张。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pupillary pathways and how to localize lesions based on anisocoria changes in different lighting conditions. It requires understanding the roles of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems in pupillary dilation and constriction.\n\nTo solve this question, analyze the change in pupillary asymmetry in dim light. Increased asymmetry in dim light indicates a problem with pupillary dilation, suggesting a lesion in the oculosympathetic pathway on the side of the smaller pupil.",
