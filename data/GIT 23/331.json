    "en": "An 8-month-old boy is brought to clinic due to abdominal distension. The patient has had excessive straining and irritability with bowel movements since birth. He had been exclusively breastfed, and his symptoms worsened after transitioning to pureed foods. Vital signs are normal. Abdominal examination shows distension with mild tenderness to palpation. Bowel sounds are present, and there is no hepatosplenomegaly. Barium enema shows a relatively narrow rectum and rectosigmoid area. The rest of the colon proximal to this segment is significantly dilated.",
    "zh": "一名8个月大的男孩因腹胀来诊。患儿自出生以来排便时过度用力且易怒。他一直母乳喂养，在过渡到泥状食物后症状加重。生命体征正常。腹部检查显示腹胀，轻度压痛。肠鸣音存在，无肝脾肿大。钡灌肠显示直肠和乙状结肠区域相对狭窄。该段近端的结肠其余部分明显扩张。"

    "en": "This infant with chronic constipation and abdominal distension has barium enema findings suggestive of HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE (HD). HD is a congenital disorder in which NEURAL CREST CELLS fail to migrate to the bowel wall during embryogenesis. These cells normally develop into ganglion cells of the submucosal (Meissner) and myenteric (Auerbach) plexus. In HD, the affected colon lacks parasympathetic ganglia and is therefore unable to relax. Because the neural crest cells migrate caudally along the bowel, the RECTOSIGMOID AREA is most commonly involved.\n\nTypical presentation is in the neonatal period with delayed passage of meconium and signs of bowel obstruction (eg, bilious emesis, abdominal distension). However, disease severity correlates with the length of nonfunctional bowel. Therefore, those with a short aganglionic segment may go undiagnosed with chronic, refractory CONSTIPATION for months or years, as in this case. Characteristic findings on contrast enema include a narrowed rectosigmoid area (due to chronic contraction) and a dilated bowel proximal to the obstruction.\n\nRectal suction biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of HD and should include the SUBMUCOSA of the rectum (ie, narrowed segment), which is the most superficial layer that demonstrates the ABSENCE OF GANGLION CELLS (ie, submucosal plexus). Absence of ganglia between the longitudinal and circular layers of the muscularis externa (ie, myenteric plexus) can also be seen on full-thickness biopsies.\n\nEducational objective: Absence of the submucosal (Meissner) and myenteric (Auerbach) plexuses in Hirschsprung disease causes the affected rectosigmoid region to become narrowed. The submucosa of the narrowed area is the most superficial layer where the absence of ganglion cells can be confirmed during biopsy procedures.",
    "zh": "该患有慢性便秘和腹胀的婴儿钡灌肠结果提示先天性巨结肠病 (HD)。HD 是一种先天性疾病，神经嵴细胞在胚胎发生过程中未能迁移到肠壁。这些细胞通常发育成粘膜下（Meissner）神经丛和肌间（Auerbach）神经丛的神经节细胞。在 HD 中，受累结肠缺乏副交感神经节，因此无法松弛。由于神经嵴细胞沿肠道向尾侧迁移，直乙状结肠区域最常受累。\n\n典型表现发生在新生儿期，表现为胎便排出延迟和肠梗阻体征（例如，胆汁性呕吐、腹胀）。然而，疾病的严重程度与无功能肠道的长度相关。因此，那些短节段无神经节细胞的患者可能会在数月或数年内未被诊断出患有慢性、顽固性便秘，正如本例所示。对比灌肠的特征性发现包括直乙状结肠区域狭窄（由于慢性收缩）和梗阻近端的肠扩张。\n\n直肠吸取活检是诊断 HD 的金标准，应包括直肠的粘膜下层（即，狭窄段），这是显示神经节细胞缺失的最浅层（即，粘膜下神经丛）。在全层活检中，也可以看到纵行肌层和环行肌层之间的神经节缺失（即，肌间神经丛）。\n\n教育目标：先天性巨结肠病中粘膜下（Meissner）神经丛和肌间（Auerbach）神经丛的缺失导致受累直乙状结肠区域变窄。在活检过程中，可以在狭窄区域的粘膜下层确认神经节细胞的缺失。"

It assesses the understanding that the absence of ganglion cells in the submucosa of the narrowed segment is diagnostic for Hirschsprung disease.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation suggestive of Hirschsprung disease (chronic constipation, abdominal distension, barium enema findings).
