  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is F. Prolactinomas, which are pituitary adenomas that secrete prolactin, are the most common type of hormonally active pituitary tumor. These tumors can cause hyperprolactinemia, leading to symptoms such as hypogonadism, infertility, galactorrhea, and amenorrhea. The provided table lists the clinical features of various pituitary adenomas, with lactotroph (prolactin) adenomas being associated with hypogonadism, infertility (men), galactorrhea, and amenorrhea (women). The explanation further elaborates that prolactin-secreting adenomas (prolactinomas) are the most common hormonally active pituitary tumors and can cause severe hyperprolactinemia. Abnormal prolactin secretion can also occur in nonprolactinoma tumors due to disruption of dopaminergic pathways. \n\n(Choice A) Aldosterone is produced by the adrenal cortex and is regulated by the renin-angiotensin system, not the pituitary gland. \n(Choice B) Catecholamines are primarily released from the adrenal medulla and, to a lesser extent, from sympathetic nervous system synapses. Neuroendocrine tumors like pheochromocytomas can cause excess catecholamine release, but this is not related to pituitary adenomas. \n(Choice C) Estradiol levels are typically suppressed in patients with prolactinomas due to the effect of hyperprolactinemia on GnRH release from the hypothalamus, leading to central hypogonadism. \n(Choice D) Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is primarily influenced by growth hormone (GH). GH-secreting pituitary adenomas (somatotroph adenomas) lead to acromegaly or gigantism, not typically an increase in prolactin. \n(Choice E) Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland and regulates circadian rhythm; it is not secreted by the pituitary gland. \n(Choice G) Vasopressin is produced in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary. Pituitary lesions, especially those affecting the anterior pituitary, generally have minimal impact on circulating vasopressin levels. \n\nKey clinical pearls: Prolactinomas are the MOST COMMON pituitary adenomas. Symptoms of hyperprolactinemia include hypogonadism, infertility, galactorrhea, and amenorrhea. Dopamine normally INHIBITS prolactin release.",
    "zh": "正确答案是F。催乳素瘤，是分泌催乳素的垂体腺瘤，是最常见的具有激素活性的垂体肿瘤。这些肿瘤可引起高催乳素血症，导致如性腺功能减退、不孕症、溢乳和闭经等症状。提供的表格列出了各种垂体腺瘤的临床特征，其中催乳素细胞（催乳素）腺瘤与性腺功能减退、不育症（男性）、溢乳和闭经（女性）相关。解释进一步阐述，分泌催乳素的腺瘤（催乳素瘤）是最常见的具有激素活性的垂体肿瘤，可引起严重的高催乳素血症。由于多巴胺通路受损，非催乳素瘤肿瘤中也可能出现催乳素分泌异常。\n\n（选项A）醛固酮由肾上腺皮质产生，受肾素-血管紧张素系统调节，而非垂体。 \n（选项B）儿茶酚胺主要由肾上腺髓质释放，较少程度由交感神经系统突触释放。 嗜铬细胞瘤等神经内分泌肿瘤可引起儿茶酚胺过量释放，但这与垂体腺瘤无关。 \n（选项C）患有催乳素瘤的患者，由于高催乳素血症对下丘脑 GnRH 释放的影响，导致中枢性性腺功能减退，雌二醇水平通常受到抑制。 \n（选项D）胰岛素样生长因子-1 (IGF-1) 主要受生长激素 (GH) 的影响。分泌GH的垂体腺瘤（生长素细胞腺瘤）导致肢端肥大症或巨人症，通常不会导致催乳素升高。 \n（选项E）褪黑激素由松果体产生并调节昼夜节律；它不由垂体分泌。 \n（选项G）加压素在下丘脑中产生并由垂体后叶释放。 垂体病变，尤其是影响垂体前叶的病变，通常对循环加压素水平的影响很小。\n\n关键临床要点：催乳素瘤是最常见的垂体腺瘤。 高催乳素血症的症状包括性腺功能减退、不孕症、溢乳和闭经。 多巴胺通常抑制催乳素释放。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical features and hormonal secretions of different types of pituitary adenomas. It specifically assesses the ability to identify the most likely hormone to be elevated in a patient with a pituitary tumor based on its common cell type and associated clinical manifestations.\n\nTo solve this question, one should recall the common types of pituitary adenomas and the hormones they secrete. The clinical features associated with each type are crucial for diagnosis. By correlating the potential symptoms with the hormonal output of pituitary tumors, the most likely elevated hormone can be determined.",
