  "explanation": {
    "en": "Helicobacter pylori is a motile, spiral-shaped, gram-negative bacteria found attached to the gastric mucosa or deep in the mucus layer overlying the gastric epithelium. It is protected from gastric acid by endogenous urease production: urease converts urea to ammonia, which alkalizes the surrounding pH but injures gastric epithelial cells. Damage to the gastric mucosa is compounded by localized inflammation due to the immunologic response against H. pylori. {{exhibit_2}} Chronic inflammation due to H. pylori colonization in the gastric antrum leads to depletion of somatostatin-producing cells (c-cells), which are located mostly in the antrum. Somatostatin inhibits gastrin release from G-cells. In its absence, elevated gastrin levels act directly (via cholecystokinin B receptors) and indirectly (via histamine release by enterochromaffin-like cells) to increase acid secretion by parietal cells. In addition, H. pylori releases cytotoxins that inhibit duodenal production of bicarbonate. The resultant increased acid load is emptied into the under-protected duodenum, leading to duodenal ulcer formation. {{exhibit_3}} In contrast, gastric ulcers occur when H. pylori colonizes the gastric body (corpus) (Choice D). Chronic inflammation leads to multifocal atrophic gastritis and a reduction in the number of acid-producing parietal cells, which are located mostly in the gastric body. Delta cells in the antrum are not markedly reduced, therefore acid secretion is often low in normal. Gastric ulcer formation results from direct mucosal damage caused by bacterial products (eg, ammonia, cytotoxins) and the resultant inflammatory response. Unlike antral-predominant disease, corpus-predominant disease is associated with metaplasia and malignancies (eg, gastric lymphoma, adenocarcinoma) (Choice C). (Choice A) Chronic pancreatitis is not associated with H. pylori infection. It is most frequently caused by chronic alcoholism or obstruction of the pancreatic ducts due to gallstones or malignancy. (Choice E) Vitamin B12 deficiency can result from autoimmune gastritis. Autoimmune gastritis is characterized by autoantibodies against gastric parietal cells leading to inflammation of the gastric mucosa, parietal cell destruction, and achlorhydria. Its etiology is at least partially genetic.",
    "zh": "幽门螺杆菌是一种运动性、螺旋形、革兰氏阴性细菌，附着在胃黏膜上或胃上皮覆盖的黏液层深处。它通过内源性脲酶的产生来抵御胃酸：脲酶将尿素转化为氨，氨使周围 pH 值碱化，但会损伤胃上皮细胞。由于针对幽门螺杆菌的免疫反应，对胃黏膜的损伤因局部炎症而加剧。 {{exhibit_2}} 由于幽门螺杆菌在胃窦中的慢性炎症定植导致产生生长抑素的细胞（c 细胞）耗竭，这些细胞主要位于胃窦。生长抑素抑制胃泌素从 G 细胞释放。在没有生长抑素的情况下，升高的胃泌素水平直接（通过胆囊收缩素 B 受体）和间接（通过肠嗜铬样细胞释放组胺）作用，从而增加壁细胞的酸分泌。此外，幽门螺杆菌释放细胞毒素，抑制十二指肠产生碳酸氢盐。由此产生的酸负荷增加被排入未受保护的十二指肠，导致十二指肠溃疡形成。 {{exhibit_3}} 相比之下，当幽门螺杆菌定植在胃体（体部）时，就会发生胃溃疡（选项 D）。慢性炎症导致多灶萎缩性胃炎，并减少产生酸的壁细胞的数量，这些壁细胞主要位于胃体。胃窦中的 Delta 细胞没有明显减少，因此在正常情况下酸分泌通常较低。胃溃疡的形成是由于细菌产物（例如，氨、细胞毒素）造成的直接黏膜损伤和由此产生的炎症反应。与胃窦为主的疾病不同，以胃体为主的疾病与化生和恶性肿瘤（例如，胃淋巴瘤、腺癌）相关（选项 C）。（选项 A）慢性胰腺炎与幽门螺杆菌感染无关。它最常由慢性酒精中毒或胆结石或恶性肿瘤引起的胰管梗阻引起。（选项 E）维生素 B12 缺乏症可由自身免疫性胃炎引起。自身免疫性胃炎的特征是针对胃壁细胞的自身抗体，导致胃黏膜炎症、壁细胞破坏和无胃酸症。其病因至少部分是遗传性的。"
