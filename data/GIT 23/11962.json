    "en": "A 6-hour-old boy is in the newborn nursery with feeding difficulties. The patient was born at 39 weeks gestation to a 33-year-old primigravida via cesarean delivery due to failure to progress and late decelerations seen on fetal heart tracing. Apgar scores were 8 and 9, but examination shows an infant with excessive drooling and coughing. Cardiac, respiratory, and abdominal examinations are otherwise normal at rest. When the infant attempts to breastfeed, however, several bouts of coughing and perioral cyanosis develop with oxygen saturation of 85% on room air.",

    "en": "This infant's presentation is concerning for tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia (TEF/EA). Normally, the trachea develops from a diverticulum that forms from the primitive foregut. The tracheobronchial diverticulum lengthens and separates to form the respiratory tract, while the foregut becomes the esophagus. Failure to separate most commonly leads to esophageal atresia with a remaining fistula between the trachea and esophagus.\n\nPrenatal ultrasounds may demonstrate polyhydramnios due to the inability of the fetus to swallow amniotic fluid. After birth, infants typically present with significant drooling (due to inability to swallow saliva) and choking, coughing, and cyanosis with feeds (due to reflux of breastmilk/formula and aspiration into the trachea/lungs). The diagnosis of TEF/EA is confirmed by x-ray showing positioning of the nasogastric tube in the atretic esophageal pouch after an attempt to pass the tube into the stomach. X-ray will also show a stomach bubble, which results from air flow from the trachea through the fistula to the distal esophagus. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Atresia of the small intestine is a congenital defect that leads to complete obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract at the site of atresia. Neonates present with abdominal distension and bilious emesis.\n\n(Choice B) Laryngomalacia presents with inspiratory stridor during infancy due to collapse of supraglottic structures during inspiration. Stridor is classically worse in the supine position and improves with upright positioning.\n\n(Choice D) Choanal atresia is characterized by congenital obstruction of the posterior nasal passages. Infants with bilateral choanal atresia can present with upper airway obstruction and cyanosis with feeding, but not excessive drooling and coughing. Inability to pass a nasogastric tube through the nares is suggestive of the diagnosis.\n\n(Choice E) Herniation of abdominal viscera into the thoracic cavity occurs in congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Infants typically exhibit respiratory distress shortly after birth due to pulmonary hypoplasia. The presence of abdominal viscera in the thorax results in a scaphoid abdomen and bowel sounds heard over the chest.\n\nEducational objective:\nTracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia results from failure of the primitive foregut to appropriately divide into separate trachea and esophageal structures. Infants present shortly after birth with excessive secretions and choking/cyanosis during feeds. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该婴儿的表现提示气管食管瘘伴食管闭锁（TEF/EA）。正常情况下，气管由原始前肠形成的憩室发育而来。气管支气管憩室延长并分离形成呼吸道，而前肠变成食管。分离失败最常见导致食管闭锁，同时气管和食管之间仍存在瘘管。\n\n产前超声检查可能显示羊水过多，这是由于胎儿无法吞咽羊水所致。出生后，婴儿通常表现为明显的流口水（由于无法吞咽唾液）以及进食时呛咳、咳嗽和发绀（由于母乳/配方奶回流并吸入气管/肺）。通过 X 光检查证实 TEF/EA 的诊断，X 光显示鼻胃管位于闭锁的食管囊内，在试图将管插入胃中之后。X 光还会显示胃气泡，这是由于空气从气管通过瘘管流向远端食管所致。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项 A) 小肠闭锁是一种先天性缺陷，导致胃肠道在闭锁部位完全阻塞。新生儿表现为腹胀和胆汁性呕吐。\n\n(选项 B) 喉软化症表现为婴儿期吸气性喘鸣，这是由于吸气过程中声门上结构塌陷所致。喘鸣在仰卧位时通常会恶化，直立位时会改善。\n\n(选项 D) 鼻后孔闭锁的特征是后鼻孔先天性阻塞。双侧鼻后孔闭锁的婴儿可能会出现上呼吸道阻塞和进食时发绀，但不会出现过度的流口水和咳嗽。无法通过鼻孔插入鼻胃管提示该诊断。\n\n(选项 E) 腹腔内脏疝入胸腔发生在先天性膈疝中。婴儿通常在出生后不久出现呼吸窘迫，这是由于肺发育不全所致。胸腔内存在腹腔内脏会导致舟状腹，并在胸部听到肠鸣音。\n\n教育目标：\n气管食管瘘伴食管闭锁是由于原始前肠未能适当地分裂成单独的气管和食管结构所致。婴儿在出生后不久表现为进食时分泌物过多和呛咳/发绀。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) and esophageal atresia (EA), including its pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic findings. TEF/EA results from the failure of the primitive foregut to properly separate into the trachea and esophagus during development. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic presentation of excessive drooling, coughing, and cyanosis during feeding in a newborn. Consider the associated prenatal finding of polyhydramnios. Understand the diagnostic utility of a nasogastric tube failing to pass into the stomach and the radiographic findings of an atretic esophageal pouch and a stomach bubble.",
