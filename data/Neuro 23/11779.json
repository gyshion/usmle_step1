    "en": "A 46-year-old man comes to the office with left upper limb weakness and numbness. He has had chronic neck pain since being involved in a motor vehicle collision 4 years ago. He has no other medical problems. Neurological evaluation reveals that the tendon reflex shown in the image below is absent {{exhibit_1}}. Reflexes in the right upper extremity and both lower extremities are normal. Imaging studies reveal degenerative changes in the spine causing mild spinal cord compression.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has an absent biceps reflex. The test is performed by quickly tapping a reflex hammer against the biceps brachii tendon as it passes through the cubital fossa. This action activates the muscle's stretch receptors that communicate via the musculocutaneous nerve with lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the C5-C6 spinal level.\n\nAxons from these motor neurons return along the musculocutaneous nerve and cause involuntary biceps muscle contraction and jerking of the forearm. The C5-C6 nerves also control the brachioradialis reflex. A stronger than normal reflex suggests an upper motor neuron lesion whereas an absent or decreased reflex indicates a lower motor neuron lesion at the corresponding spinal cord level.\n\n(Choice A) The C3-C4 cervical nerves provide innervation to the diaphragm but do not mediate any specific reflexes.\n\n(Choices C, D, and E) The C7, C8, and T1 spinal nerve roots form the median and ulnar nerves, which provide motor innervation to the wrist and hand. The T1 and T2 thoracic nerves innervate the rib muscles around the sternum, parts of the axilla, and part of the scapula. However, none of these spinal nerves mediate significant reflexes.",
    "zh": "该患者的肱二头肌反射消失。该测试通过快速敲击反射锤，使其撞击肱二头肌肌腱（当其穿过肘窝时）来进行。此操作激活了肌肉的牵张感受器，这些感受器通过肌皮神经与C5-C6脊髓前角的下运动神经元进行通讯。\n\n来自这些运动神经元的轴突沿肌皮神经返回，引起肱二头肌的非自主收缩和前臂的抽搐。C5-C6神经也控制肱桡肌反射。反射强于正常提示上运动神经元损伤，而反射消失或减弱则表明相应脊髓水平的下运动神经元损伤。\n\n（选项A）C3-C4颈神经支配膈肌，但不介导任何特定的反射。\n\n（选项C、D和E）C7、C8和T1脊神经根形成正中神经和尺神经，为腕部和手部提供运动支配。T1和T2胸神经支配胸骨周围的肋肌、腋窝的一部分和肩胛骨的一部分。然而，这些脊神经均不介导重要的反射。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of spinal nerve root innervation and associated reflexes, specifically the biceps reflex and its relationship to the C5-C6 spinal segments. The key to solving this question is recognizing the absent biceps reflex and recalling the corresponding spinal nerve roots (C5-C6) that mediate this reflex.",
    "zh": "本题测试对脊神经根支配和相关反射的知识，特别是肱二头肌反射及其与C5-C6脊髓节段的关系。解决此问题的关键是识别肱二头肌反射的消失，并回忆起介导此反射的相应脊神经根（C5-C6）。"
