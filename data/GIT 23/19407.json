Medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She takes lisinopril, insulin, and metformin. She has no recent travel or new medications. Family history is unremarkable. She does not drink alcohol. Temperature is 37.4 C (99.3 F), blood pressure is 125/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 80/min. The abdomen is nontender and nondistended. Complete blood count, serum chemistries, and stool studies are normal. ",

    "en": "This patient with diabetes mellitus has several months of watery diarrhea that occurs both during the day and at night. In the setting of normal laboratory evaluation, this presentation suggests diabetic diarrhea due to diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN). Long-standing hyperglycemia results in the accumulation of cross-linked glycosylated serum proteins in the vasa nervorum, which causes inflammation and damage to peripheral nerves. Although this most commonly results in a distal, symmetric polyneuropathy of the feet, it can also result in damage to sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, leading to autonomic dysfunction. Risk factors include poor glucose control and other vascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, obesity).\n\nLoss of autonomic input to the gastrointestinal tract results in abnormal peristalsis, leading to disordered small-bowel and colonic motility, which can result in rapid intestinal transport. Furthermore, intestinal water and electrolyte secretion is increased. Fecal incontinence is particularly common in patients with long-standing diabetes, resulting from both a large volume of watery diarrhea and decreased anorectal sensation. Other common gastrointestinal manifestations of DAN include gastroparesis and gastroesophageal reflux.\n\nPatients with diabetic diarrhea typically have painless, secretory-like diarrhea that persists with fasting (eg, nocturnal diarrhea). Laboratory evaluation, including fecal leukocytes and fecal occult blood testing, is usually unremarkable.\n\n(Choice A) Although altered small-bowel motility related to DAN can predispose to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, this occurs due to an increase in small bowel bacteria, not a decrease in colonic bacterial burden. It typically causes abdominal bloating, discomfort, and gas. Nocturnal diarrhea is unexpected.\n\n(Choice B) Lactase deficiency can cause osmotic diarrhea after lactose ingestion, leading to postprandial loose stools and bloating. However, unless patients are eating during the night, nocturnal bowel movements would not occur.\n\n(Choice D) Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), which is common in chronic pancreatitis or after pancreatic resection, leads to bulky, foul-smelling stool (eg, steatorrhea). Although insulin resistance can mildly impact pancreatic secretions, EPI leading to steatorrhea is rare in diabetes.\n\n(Choice E) Crohn disease, which causes transmural gastrointestinal inflammation, can cause watery diarrhea. However, abdominal pain, anemia, abnormal stool studies (eg, fecal occult blood, fecal calprotectin), and possibly fever are expected.\n\nEducational objective:\nProlonged hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus can injure the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system, resulting in diabetic autonomic neuropathy. This can lead to disordered small-bowel and colonic motility and increased intestinal secretions, resulting in secretory-like diarrhea (eg, fasting bowel movements).",
    "zh": "这位糖尿病患者有几个月的水样腹泻，白天和晚上都会发生。在实验室评估正常的情况下，这种表现提示由于糖尿病自主神经病变（DAN）引起的糖尿病腹泻。长期高血糖导致交联糖基化血清蛋白在神经血管中积累，导致炎症和周围神经损伤。虽然这最常导致足部的远端、对称性多发性神经病变，但它也可能导致交感神经和副交感神经的损伤，从而导致自主神经功能障碍。危险因素包括血糖控制不佳和其他血管危险因素（例如，高血压、肥胖）。\n\n自主神经对胃肠道的输入丧失导致异常的蠕动，从而导致小肠和结肠的动力障碍，这可能导致快速的肠道转运。此外，肠道水和电解质分泌增加。大便失禁在患有长期糖尿病的患者中特别常见，这源于大量的水样腹泻和肛门直肠感觉减退。DAN的其他常见胃肠道表现包括胃轻瘫和胃食管反流。\n\n糖尿病腹泻患者通常有无痛、分泌性腹泻，即使在禁食时（例如，夜间腹泻）也持续存在。实验室评估，包括粪便白细胞和粪便隐血检测，通常无特殊发现。\n\n（选项A）尽管与DAN相关的小肠动力改变可能易患小肠细菌过度生长，但这由于小肠细菌的增加，而不是结肠细菌负荷的减少。它通常会导致腹胀、不适和胀气。夜间腹泻是意料之外的。\n\n（选项B）乳糖酶缺乏症可导致摄入乳糖后发生渗透性腹泻，导致餐后稀便和腹胀。但是，除非患者在夜间进食，否则不会发生夜间排便。\n\n（选项D）外分泌胰腺功能不全（EPI）常见于慢性胰腺炎或胰腺切除术后，导致大便量多、恶臭（例如，脂肪泻）。尽管胰岛素抵抗可能轻微影响胰腺分泌，但在糖尿病中，导致脂肪泻的EPI很少见。\n\n（选项E）克罗恩病，引起全层胃肠道炎症，可引起水样腹泻。然而，腹痛、贫血、异常粪便检查（例如，粪便隐血、粪便钙卫蛋白）以及可能发烧是预期的。\n\n教育目标：糖尿病的长期高血糖会损害副交感神经和交感神经系统，导致糖尿病自主神经病变。这可能导致小肠和结肠动力障碍，以及肠道分泌增加，导致分泌性腹泻（例如，禁食排便）。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of diabetic diarrhea, a complication of diabetic autonomic neuropathy, and its characteristic presentation of watery, painless, secretory-like diarrhea that persists even during fasting.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's history of diabetes and the presence of nocturnal diarrhea despite normal stool studies.
