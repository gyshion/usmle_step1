    "en": "Enkephalins, endorphins, and dynorphins are endogenous opioid peptides that are part of the body's naturally occurring opioid system. These endogenous peptides are released in response to noxious stimuli and bind to different opioid receptors to allow physiologic modulation of pain. Several different types of opioid receptors have been identified and include mu, delta, kappa, and N/OFQ receptors. Available narcotics like morphine and hydromorphone produce therapeutic analgesic effects by binding to mu receptors and modulating pain perception. Endogenous opioid peptides also play a significant role in gastrointestinal, endocrine, autonomic, and emotional function. Beta-endorphin is one endogenous opioid peptide that is derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC). POMC is a polypeptide precursor that goes through enzymatic cleavage and modification to produce not only beta-endorphins, but also ACTH and MSH. The fact that beta-endorphin and ACTH are derived from the same precursor suggests that there may be a close physiological relationship between the stress axis and the opioid system.\n(Choice A) Prolactin is a somatotropic hormone synthesized in the anterior pituitary and is responsible for breast development and milk production. It is structurally similar to growth hormone.\n(Choice B) TSH is a glycoprotein hormone synthesized in the anterior pituitary and is responsible for stimulating the secretion of thyroid hormone. It is also responsible for growth of the thyroid gland.\n(Choice D) Growth hormone belongs to the family of somatotropic hormones. It is synthesized in the anterior pituitary and is responsible for overall body growth.\n(Choice E) Vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is a hormone synthesized in the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary. It primarily functions to regulate fluid retention in the kidneys, but also causes arteriolar contraction of smooth muscle resulting in a pressor effect.\n(Choice F) Somatostatin C is a peptide that is structurally similar to insulin. Also referred to as insulin like growth factor, Somatostatin C is released in response to growth hormone and stimulates growth in target cells.",
    "zh": "脑啡肽、内啡肽和强啡肽是内源性阿片肽，是人体自然发生的阿片系统的一部分。这些内源性肽对有害刺激作出反应并释放，与不同的阿片受体结合以允许对疼痛进行生理调节。已经鉴定了几种不同类型的阿片受体，包括 μ、δ、κ 和 N/OFQ 受体。诸如吗啡和氢吗啡酮等现有麻醉剂通过与 μ 受体结合并调节疼痛知觉产生治疗性镇痛作用。内源性阿片肽也在胃肠道、内分泌、自主神经和情绪功能中发挥重要作用。β-内啡肽是一种内源性阿片肽，来源于促黑素细胞皮质素 (POMC)。POMC 是一种多肽前体，它经历酶促切割和修饰，不仅产生 β-内啡肽，还产生 ACTH 和 MSH。β-内啡肽和 ACTH 来源于同一前体这一事实表明，应激轴和阿片系统之间可能存在密切的生理关系。\n(选项 A) 催乳素是一种在垂体前叶合成的生长素，负责乳房发育和乳汁生成。它在结构上与生长激素相似。\n(选项 B) 促甲状腺激素 (TSH) 是一种在垂体前叶合成的糖蛋白激素，负责刺激甲状腺激素的分泌。它也负责甲状腺的生长。\n(选项 D) 生长激素属于生长素家族。它在垂体前叶合成，负责全身生长。\n(选项 E) 加压素，也称为抗利尿激素 (ADH)，是一种在下丘脑合成并从垂体后叶释放的激素。它主要用于调节肾脏的液体潴留，但也引起平滑肌的动脉收缩，从而产生升压效应。\n(选项 F) 生长抑素 C 是一种在结构上与胰岛素相似的肽。生长抑素 C 也被称为胰岛素样生长因子，对生长激素作出反应并释放，刺激靶细胞的生长。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the molecular origins of endogenous opioid peptides and their relationship to other hormones derived from common precursors. Specifically, it assesses knowledge of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) pathway and its products.\nTo solve this question, one must identify that the pentapeptide described is likely an endogenous opioid peptide such as an enkephalin or endorphin. Then, recall or deduce which of the listed hormones shares a common precursor with these opioid peptides, focusing on the POMC pathway and its cleavage products.",
