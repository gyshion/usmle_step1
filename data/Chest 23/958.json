    "en": "A 15-year-old boy is evaluated for fever, headache, malaise, and cough 3 weeks after returning from summer camp. Lung auscultation is unremarkable. Chest x-ray reveals nodular infiltrates. The patient's blood samples are collected for analysis in anticoagulated tubes, which are transported submerged in ice; when taken out several minutes later, turbidity and clumping are noted. Warming the tube to body temperature leads to rapid dissolution of the clumps. Which of the following organisms is most likely responsible for this patient's condition? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is common in adolescents and usually presents with tracheobronchitis or walking pneumonia. The pathogen attaches to the respiratory epithelium using surface antigens (I-antigen) that are also present on the plasma membrane of erythrocytes. Therefore, patients with *M. pneumoniae* typically develop cross-reactive IgM antibodies that can attach to red blood cells, activate the complement system, and cause erythrocyte lysis. These cross-reacting antibodies are called **cold agglutinins** because they bind to erythrocytes most strongly at temperatures **below core body temperature**. Testing for cold agglutinins can be done at the bedside by drawing blood into an edetate disodium-containing tube and placing it in a cup of ice. Removing the tube after several seconds will reveal clumping/agglutination that resolves as the tube warms.\n\nCold agglutinins are often asymptomatic, but some patients develop mild intravascular **hemolytic anemia** that usually resolves after 6-8 weeks (when IgM antibody titers fall). Patients who have infectious mononucleosis and certain hematologic malignancies also commonly develop cold agglutinins.",
    "zh": "肺炎支原体感染在青少年中很常见，通常表现为气管支气管炎或非典型肺炎。该病原体使用表面抗原（I抗原）附着在呼吸道上皮细胞上，这些抗原也存在于红细胞的质膜上。因此，*肺炎支原体*感染的患者通常会产生交叉反应性IgM抗体，这些抗体可以附着在红细胞上，激活补体系统并导致红细胞溶解。这些交叉反应性抗体被称为**冷凝集素**，因为它们在**低于核心体温**的温度下与红细胞结合最强。可以在床边通过将血液抽取到含有依地酸二钠的试管中并将其放入装有冰的杯子中来进行冷凝集素检测。几秒钟后取出试管将显示凝集/凝集，这些凝集物会在试管加热时溶解。\n\n冷凝集素通常无症状，但一些患者会出现轻度血管内**溶血性贫血**，通常在6-8周后（当IgM抗体滴度下降时）消退。患有传染性单核细胞增多症和某些血液系统恶性肿瘤的患者也常发生冷凝集素。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of atypical pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and its association with cold agglutinins. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation and the characteristic laboratory finding of cold agglutination.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the patient's age, symptoms suggestive of atypical pneumonia, and the description of cold agglutinins (clumping of blood in cold temperatures that resolves with warming). This points towards Mycoplasma pneumoniae as the most likely causative organism.",
