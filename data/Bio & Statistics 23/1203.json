  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The scenario described above is a good example of prospective cohort study. Initially a group of subjects is selected (i.e., cohort) and their exposure status is determined (smoker/non-smoker). The cohort is then followed for a certain period of time and observed for development of the outcome (breast cancer). Sometimes, the exposure status is determined retrospectively and then patients are tracked from that point of time, typically using medical records (Choice B)\n\n(Choice C) A case-control study is designed by selecting patients with a particular disease (cases) and without that disease (controls) and then determining their previous exposure status.\n\n(Choice D) A cross-sectional study is also known as a prevalence study. It is characterized by the simultaneous measurement of exposure and outcome. It is a snapshot study design that frequently uses surveys. They are relatively inexpensive and easy to perform.\n\n(Choice E) A randomized clinical trial directly compares two or more treatments. Usually, the subjects are randomly assigned to an exposure (e.g., a medication) or placebo and then followed for the development of the outcome of interest.\n\nEducational Objective:\nProspective cohort studies are organized by selecting a group of individuals (i.e., cohort), determining their exposure status, and then following them over time for development of the disease of interest.",
    "zh": "上述情景是前瞻性队列研究的一个很好的例子。最初，选择一组受试者（即队列），并确定他们的暴露状态（吸烟者/非吸烟者）。然后，对队列进行一段时间的随访，并观察结局（乳腺癌）的发展。有时，暴露状态是回顾性确定的，然后从那时起跟踪患者，通常使用医疗记录（选项B）。\n\n（选项C）病例对照研究是通过选择患有特定疾病的患者（病例）和未患有该疾病的患者（对照），然后确定他们之前的暴露状态来设计的。\n\n（选项D）横断面研究也称为患病率研究。它的特点是同时测量暴露和结局。它是一种快照研究设计，经常使用调查。它们相对便宜且易于执行。\n\n（选项E）随机临床试验直接比较两种或多种治疗方法。通常，受试者被随机分配到暴露（例如，药物）或安慰剂，然后随访感兴趣结局的发展。\n\n教学目标：\n前瞻性队列研究是通过选择一组个体（即队列）、确定他们的暴露状态，然后随访他们一段时间以观察感兴趣疾病的发展来组织的。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of different study designs, specifically prospective cohort studies. It requires differentiating between prospective cohort, retrospective cohort, case-control, cross-sectional, and randomized clinical trial designs.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key features of the study design described in the scenario. Focus on whether the exposure is determined before or after the outcome, and whether there is a comparison group or intervention.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对不同研究设计的理解，特别是前瞻性队列研究。它需要区分前瞻性队列、回顾性队列、病例对照、横断面和随机临床试验设计。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要确定情景中描述的研究设计的主要特征。重点关注暴露是在结局之前还是之后确定的，以及是否有对照组或干预措施。"
