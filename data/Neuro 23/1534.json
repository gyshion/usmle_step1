    "en": "A 22-year-old man comes to the office due to occasional dull headaches that awaken him from sleep. The patient has no associated neurologic deficits. There is no history of migraines in the family. His temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, pulse is 60/min, and respirations are 12/min. On physical examination, there are several 3- to 5-cm flat, pigmented spots on his trunk. There are also multiple, subcentimeter, soft, fleshy, cutaneous tumors located on his trunk and neck. The predominant cells forming these tumors most likely originated from which of the following structures? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient has clinical features of neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen disease), an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder caused by mutations in the *NF1* tumor suppressor gene. Patients typically develop hyperpigmented macules (Café-au-lait spots) over the trunk soon after birth and are at increased risk of developing central nervous system neoplasms (eg, optic gliomas, pilocytic astrocytomas), which can cause elevated intracranial pressure and headache.\n\n**Cutaneous neurofibromas** usually manifest during early adolescence as multiple, raised, fleshy tumors (<2 cm) that often increase in size and number with age. These are benign nerve sheath neoplasms predominantly comprised of **Schwann cells**, which are embryologically derived from the **neural crest**.\n\n(Choice A) The endoderm gives rise to thyroid follicular cells (derived from the primitive tongue) and the epithelial linings of the gastrointestinal tract, middle ear, lungs, bladder, and most of the urethra. It also gives rise to the bulk of the liver and pancreas, as these structures form from outpouchings of the primitive gut tube.\n\n(Choice B) The mesoderm is divided into paraxial, intermediate, and lateral sections and gives rise to muscles, bones, blood, connective tissue, dermis, and the kidneys/ureters.\n\n(Choice D) The neural tube gives rise to neurons of the central nervous system and the neurohypophysis, retina, pineal gland, preganglionic autonomic fibers, astrocytes, and ependymal cells.\n\n(Choice E) The notochord almost completely regresses in humans, and its only major derivative is the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc. Vertebrae are derived from the paraxial mesoderm.\n\n(Choice F) The surface ectoderm gives rise to the epidermis, lens of the eye, outer layer of the cornea, nasal and oral epithelium, and anal epithelium below the dentate line.",
    "zh": "该患者具有I型神经纤维瘤病（von Recklinghausen病）的临床特征，这是一种常染色体显性神经皮肤病，由*NF1*抑癌基因突变引起。患者通常在出生后不久出现躯干上的色素沉着斑（牛奶咖啡斑），并且发生中枢神经系统肿瘤（例如，视神经胶质瘤、毛细胞星形细胞瘤）的风险增加，这可能导致颅内压升高和头痛。\n\n**皮肤神经纤维瘤**通常在青春期早期表现为多个隆起、肉质的肿瘤（<2 cm），其大小和数量通常随年龄增长而增加。这些是良性神经鞘肿瘤，主要由**施万细胞**组成，这些细胞在胚胎学上源自**神经嵴**。\n\n（选项A）内胚层产生甲状腺滤泡细胞（源自原始舌）以及胃肠道、中耳、肺、膀胱和大多数尿道的上皮内衬。它还产生大部分肝脏和胰腺，因为这些结构由原始肠管的向外突出部分形成。\n\n（选项B）中胚层分为轴旁、中间和侧部，产生肌肉、骨骼、血液、结缔组织、真皮以及肾脏/输尿管。\n\n（选项D）神经管产生中枢神经系统的神经元和神经垂体、视网膜、松果体、节前自主神经纤维、星形胶质细胞和室管膜细胞。\n\n（选项E）脊索在人类中几乎完全退化，其唯一的主要衍生物是椎间盘的髓核。椎骨来源于轴旁中胚层。\n\n（选项F）表面外胚层产生表皮、晶状体、角膜外层、鼻和口腔上皮，以及齿状线下方的肛门上皮。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of embryological origins of different tissues, specifically the origin of Schwann cells in neurofibromas. It requires understanding the derivatives of the neural crest, endoderm, mesoderm, neural tube, notochord, and surface ectoderm.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the clinical presentation of neurofibromatosis type 1, identify the key cell type in neurofibromas (Schwann cells), and then remember that Schwann cells are derived from the neural crest.",
