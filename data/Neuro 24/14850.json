    "en": "A 42-year-old woman is hospitalized for surgical removal of a mediastinal mass. The patient has had intermittent episodes of double vision, difficulty chewing food, and weakness of the extremities for the past several months. During evaluation she was found to have a circumscribed anterior mediastinal mass. Preoperative nerve conduction studies demonstrated a decremental response to repetitive motor nerve stimulation. The patient has no other medical conditions and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. She has no drug allergies. Compared to a healthy individual, which of the following anesthesia-related medications is most likely to have increased potency in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient has an anterior mediastinal mass and a nerve conduction study consistent with MYASTHENIA GRAVIS (MG), a disease caused by autoantibodies against postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors found within the neuromuscular junction. Antibody-induced degradation leads to FEWER FUNCTIONAL RECEPTORS, which may be insufficient to generate muscle action potentials despite normal acetylcholine release. Weakness most commonly affects the extraocular, bulbar, and proximal muscles, worsening with repetitive nerve stimulation (fatigability) due to depletion of acetylcholine stores in the presynaptic nerve terminal. THYMIC ABNORMALITIES (eg, thymoma, thymic hyperplasia) are common and may appear as an anterior mediastinal mass on imaging; thymectomy can often improve symptoms.\n\nNeuromuscular blocking agents are used to induce skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery by competing with acetylcholine at the postsynaptic membrane. They can be subclassified by their effects:\n\n*   NONDEPOLARIZING AGENTS (eg, vecuronium, rocuronium) are competitive antagonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Because of the low number of functioning receptors, patients with MG are EXTREMELY SENSITIVE to these agents; very small doses can induce paralysis with loss of airway patency.\n*   Depolarizing agents (eg, succinylcholine) are competitive agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; persistent depolarization leads to desensitization of the motor end plate. Because the low number of functioning receptors tends to inhibit end-plate depolarization, patients with MG are often RESISTANT to these agents; extremely large doses are required to induce muscle relaxation.\n\n(Choice A) Atropine is a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist often used before general anesthesia to decrease salivary and bronchial secretions (helping maintain airway patency) and to prevent myocardial depression (minimizing risk for hypotension). It has no effect on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junctions.\n\n(Choices B and C) Isoflurane is a general anesthetic (acting centrally on multiple receptors) that can cause malignant hyperthermia in those with genetic predispositions. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine (acting on the GABA A receptor) that produces sedation. These medications are not contraindicated in MG.\n\n(Choice D) Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (eg, neostigmine, pyridostigmine) hinder the degradation of acetylcholine in the synapse, thereby increasing the amount available to stimulate nicotinic receptors. They are often used to hasten recovery from nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade and to improve muscle strength in patients with MG. Because such patients have fewer functional receptors, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors typically exhibit decreased potency.\n\nEducational objective:\nMyasthenia gravis (MG) is caused by autoantibodies against postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, leading to fewer functional receptors and fatigable muscle weakness. Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (eg, vecuronium) are competitive antagonists of nicotinic receptors; because of the depletion of receptors, patients with MG are extremely sensitive to these agents.",
    "zh": "该患者患有前纵隔肿块，神经传导研究结果与重症肌无力 (MG) 相符，这是一种由针对神经肌肉接头内突触后烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体的自身抗体引起的疾病。抗体诱导的降解导致功能受体减少，尽管乙酰胆碱释放正常，但可能不足以产生肌肉动作电位。无力最常影响眼外肌、延髓肌和近端肌肉，重复神经刺激时恶化（易疲劳），这归因于突触前神经末梢乙酰胆碱储存的耗竭。胸腺异常（如胸腺瘤、胸腺增生）很常见，在影像学检查中可能表现为前纵隔肿块；胸腺切除术通常可以改善症状。\n\n神经肌肉阻滞剂用于在手术过程中通过与突触后膜上的乙酰胆碱竞争来诱导骨骼肌松弛。它们可以根据其作用进行分类：\n\n*   非去极化剂（如维库溴铵、罗库溴铵）是烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体的竞争性拮抗剂。由于功能受体数量少，MG 患者对这些药物极其敏感；很小的剂量即可诱发麻痹，导致气道通畅性丧失。\n*   去极化剂（如琥珀酰胆碱）是烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体的竞争性激动剂；持续去极化会导致运动终板脱敏。由于功能受体数量少，往往会抑制终板去极化，MG 患者通常对这些药物具有耐药性；需要极大的剂量才能诱导肌肉松弛。\n\n（选项 A）阿托品是一种毒蕈碱型乙酰胆碱受体拮抗剂，常用于全身麻醉前以减少唾液和支气管分泌物（帮助维持气道通畅性）并预防心肌抑制（使低血压风险最小化）。它对神经肌肉接头中的烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体没有影响。\n\n（选项 B 和 C）异氟烷是一种全身麻醉剂（作用于多个受体），可对具有遗传易感性的人引起恶性高热。咪达唑仑是一种苯二氮卓类药物（作用于GABA A受体），可产生镇静作用。这些药物在 MG 中没有禁忌症。\n\n（选项 D）乙酰胆碱酯酶抑制剂（如新斯的明、吡啶斯的明）阻碍突触中乙酰胆碱的降解，从而增加刺激烟碱型受体的量。它们常用于加速非去极化神经肌肉阻滞的恢复，并改善 MG 患者的肌力。由于此类患者的功能受体较少，乙酰胆碱酯酶抑制剂通常表现出效力降低。\n\n教育目标：\n重症肌无力 (MG) 是由针对突触后烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体的自身抗体引起的，导致功能受体减少和易疲劳的肌无力。非去极化神经肌肉阻滞剂（如维库溴铵）是烟碱型受体的竞争性拮抗剂；由于受体耗竭，MG 患者对这些药物极其敏感。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of how myasthenia gravis affects the response to neuromuscular blocking agents used in anesthesia. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of MG and its underlying pathophysiology related to reduced nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the signs and symptoms suggestive of myasthenia gravis, including the decremental response on nerve conduction studies.
