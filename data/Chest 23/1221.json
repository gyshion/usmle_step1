    "en": "A 48-year-old man dies in a motor vehicle crash. He had a history of intravenous drug use and had recently been released from prison. The patient's other medical conditions included hepatitis C and hypertension. On autopsy, he is found to have a small, fibrotic focus in the upper portion of the lower lobe of the right lung and a calcified right hilar lymph node. These autopsy findings are most consistent with which of the following?",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Primary infection with *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* begins with the inhalation of contaminated respiratory droplets into the lower lobe of the lung. Initially, the organism replicates in an unchecked fashion within the alveoli due to virulence factors (eg, cord factor) that prevent bacterial destruction by alveolar macrophages. The pathogen is also carried by infected macrophages through the draining lymphatic system to ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes. These initial areas of infection (lower lobe, ipsilateral hilar lymph node) are collectively referred to as a Ghon complex. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nAfter a few weeks, the display of mycobacterial antigens by antigen presenting cells leads to stimulation of CD4 cells, with subsequent cytokine-mediated activation of macrophages. Activated macrophages control the infection (in >95% of patients) by forming mature phagolysosomes to kill intracellular mycobacteria and by differentiating into epithelioid and Langhans giant cells that wall off extracellular mycobacteria within granulomas. Over time, granulomas become fibrosed and calcified, which reinforces their structure. It also allows areas of primary infection to be visualized on X-ray or gross pathology. A fibrosed and calcified Ghon complex is referred to as a Ranke complex.\n\n(Choices A and C) Most patients with primary tuberculosis contain the infection, but those with ineffective immunity (eg, extremes of age, immunosuppression) can develop progressive illness with hematogenous spread to distant areas (eg, Potts disease, meningitis). Widespread, massive hematogenous dissemination can also occur, resulting in innumerable, small, millet seed-like lesions in multiple organs (miliary tuberculosis).\n\n(Choices B and E) Primary tuberculosis infections are usually contained within granulomas but not fully eliminated. If the walls of the granuloma weaken, *M tuberculosis* can escape and cause reactivation (secondary) disease. This is most common in the setting of acquired immunosuppression (eg, HIV, tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors) and usually presents with symptoms (eg, weight loss, cough, fever) and apical cavitary lesions.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe Ghon complex describes the two initial sites (lower lobe of lung, ipsilateral hilar lymph node) of primary tuberculosis infection. Over time, these sites become calcified and fibrosed and can be visualized on gross pathology and radiographic imaging (Ranke complex). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "原发性结核分枝杆菌感染始于吸入被污染的呼吸道飞沫进入肺下叶。最初，由于毒力因子（例如，索状因子）阻止肺泡巨噬细胞对细菌的破坏，病原体在肺泡内以不受控制的方式复制。病原体也通过受感染的巨噬细胞通过引流淋巴系统转移到同侧肺门淋巴结。这些最初的感染区域（下叶、同侧肺门淋巴结）统称为Ghon复合体。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n几周后，抗原呈递细胞呈现分枝杆菌抗原，导致CD4细胞受到刺激，随后细胞因子介导的巨噬细胞活化。活化的巨噬细胞通过形成成熟的吞噬溶酶体杀死细胞内分枝杆菌，并通过分化为上皮样细胞和朗汉斯巨细胞，将细胞外分枝杆菌隔离在肉芽肿内，从而控制感染（>95%的患者）。随着时间的推移，肉芽肿纤维化并钙化，从而加强其结构。它也使原发感染区域能够在X射线或大体病理学上被可视化。纤维化和钙化的Ghon复合体被称为Ranke复合体。\n\n（选项A和C）大多数原发性结核病患者会控制感染，但免疫力低下者（例如，年龄极端、免疫抑制）可能会出现进行性疾病，并向远处区域血行播散（例如，脊柱结核病、脑膜炎）。也可能发生广泛的、大规模的血行播散，导致多个器官中出现无数的小的、粟粒状病灶（粟粒性结核病）。\n\n（选项B和E）原发性结核病感染通常被限制在肉芽肿内，但未完全清除。如果肉芽肿壁变弱，结核分枝杆菌会逸出并引起再激活（继发性）疾病。这种情况最常见于获得性免疫抑制（例如，HIV、肿瘤坏死因子-α抑制剂），通常表现为症状（例如，体重减轻、咳嗽、发烧）和肺尖空洞病灶。\n\n教学目标：\nGhon复合体描述了原发性结核病感染的两个初始部位（肺下叶、同侧肺门淋巴结）。随着时间的推移，这些部位会钙化和纤维化，并可以在大体病理学和放射影像学上被可视化（Ranke复合体）。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathogenesis and characteristic findings of primary tuberculosis infection, specifically the Ghon complex. It also requires understanding the difference between primary and secondary tuberculosis.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the fibrotic focus in the lower lobe and calcified hilar lymph node are consistent with a Ghon complex, which is characteristic of primary tuberculosis. Rule out other options based on their association with disseminated or secondary disease.",
