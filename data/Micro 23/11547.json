    "en": "A 24-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to swelling of his left leg after his dog bit him yesterday. The dog is fully vaccinated and has lived with him for the past year. The bite caused a break in the skin and bleeding. The patient irrigated the wound with bottled water and soap and managed his pain with acetaminophen. Today, the area around the wound is warm, red, and swollen. Temperature is 36.4 C (97.5 F). Physical examination shows an open wound on the left leg with surrounding erythema, warmth, and tenderness. No wound drainage or crepitation is present. The distal pulses are palpable. Wound cultures grow gram-negative coccobacilli; the culture has a mouse-like odor.",

    "en": "This patient with localized erythema, warmth, and tenderness has a skin and soft tissue infection at the site of a recent dog bite. Pathogens in animal bite wound infections include animal oral flora and/or human skin flora, and infections are often polymicrobial. One of the most frequently identified pathogens after a cat or dog bite is Pasteurella multocida; Pasteurella canis is also common in dogs.\n\nPasteurella species are part of the normal upper respiratory tract flora in many healthy wild and domestic animals regardless of vaccine status. The bacteria are gram-negative coccobacilli with a mouse-like odor (due to indole positivity), as noted in this case. Other common pathogens in dog bite infections include human skin flora (eg, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus), anaerobes, and Capnocytophaga canimorsus.\n\nInfection typically develops within 24 hours after inoculation and often presents as cellulitis (eg, erythema, warmth, tenderness). Management includes wound care and antibiotics (eg, amoxicillin-clavulanate).\n\n(Choice A) Infection with Bartonella henselae, a gram-negative bacterium causing catscratch disease, typically causes a pustule/nodule with regional lymphadenopathy several days after infection. However, B henselae is transmitted via a scratch or bite from an infected cat (transmission from dogs is not common).\n\n(Choice B) Campylobacter jejuni is usually transmitted via contaminated food and causes a diarrheal illness, not cellulitis.\n\n(Choice C) Skin infection with Clostridium perfringens (found in soil) usually occurs after penetrating trauma (eg, stab wound) and leads to myonecrosis and gas gangrene.\n\n(Choice D) Exposure to animals infected with Coxiella burnetii (eg, cattle, sheep) can cause Q fever resulting in a mild flu-like illness or pneumonia.\n\n(Choice E) Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is commonly found in domestic and marine animals and can cause a localized cutaneous infection (erysipeloid) typically following occupational exposure (eg, fishery, slaughterhouse). However, it is a gram-positive rod (not a gram-negative coccobacillus).\n\n(Choice F) Francisella tularensis is a gram-negative bacterium that causes tularemia, a zoonotic infection that usually presents with regional lymphadenopathy and an ulcerative lesion at the inoculation site. This infection typically occurs following contact with animals such as rabbits and rodents, not dogs.\n\n(Choice G) Fusobacterium is an anaerobe that is part of normal oral flora and can be seen in soft tissue infections after a dog bite. However, infection with Pasteurella is more common, particularly in this patient whose cultures have a mouse-like odor.\n\n(Choice I) Proteus mirabilis is a common cause of urinary tract infections, not cellulitis.\n\nEducational objective:\nSoft tissue infections following cat and dog bites are typically due to animal oral flora, the most common of which is Pasteurella.",
    "zh": "这位患者局部红斑、发热和压痛，表明在最近被狗咬伤的部位发生了皮肤和软组织感染。动物咬伤伤口感染的病原体包括动物口腔菌群和/或人类皮肤菌群，并且感染通常是多菌性的。猫或狗咬伤后最常确定的病原体之一是多杀性巴斯德菌；犬巴斯德菌在犬中也很常见。\n\n巴斯德菌属是许多健康的野生和家养动物（无论疫苗接种状态如何）正常上呼吸道菌群的一部分。细菌是革兰氏阴性杆菌，具有类似老鼠的气味（由于吲哚阳性），如本例所示。狗咬伤感染中的其他常见病原体包括人类皮肤菌群（例如，葡萄球菌、链球菌）、厌氧菌和犬咬二氧化碳噬纤维菌。\n\n感染通常在接种后24小时内发生，并且常表现为蜂窝织炎（例如，红斑、发热、压痛）。治疗包括伤口护理和抗生素（例如，阿莫西林-克拉维酸钾）。\n\n(选项A) 汉赛巴尔通体，一种引起猫抓病的革兰氏阴性菌，通常在感染几天后引起脓疱/结节伴区域淋巴结病。然而，B henselae通过受感染的猫的抓伤或咬伤传播（狗传播并不常见）。\n\n(选项B) 空肠弯曲菌通常通过受污染的食物传播，引起腹泻疾病，而不是蜂窝织炎。\n\n(选项C) 产气荚膜梭菌（存在于土壤中）引起的皮肤感染通常发生在穿透性创伤（例如，刺伤）后，并导致肌坏死和气性坏疽。\n\n(选项D) 接触感染伯氏考克斯体（例如，牛、绵羊）的动物可引起Q热，导致轻度流感样疾病或肺炎。\n\n(选项E) 猪丹毒丝菌常见于家养和海洋动物中，可引起局部皮肤感染（丹毒），通常在职业暴露（例如，渔业、屠宰场）后发生。然而，它是一种革兰氏阳性杆菌（不是革兰氏阴性杆菌）。\n\n(选项F) 土拉弗朗西斯菌是一种革兰氏阴性菌，可引起土拉热，这是一种人畜共患病，通常表现为区域淋巴结病和接种部位的溃疡性病变。这种感染通常发生在接触兔子和啮齿动物等动物后，而不是狗。\n\n(选项G) 梭杆菌属是一种厌氧菌，是正常口腔菌群的一部分，可以在狗咬伤后见于软组织感染。然而，多杀性巴斯德菌的感染更为常见，尤其是在该患者的培养物具有类似老鼠气味的情况下。\n\n(选项I) 奇异变形杆菌是尿路感染的常见原因，而不是蜂窝织炎。\n\n教育目标：\n猫和狗咬伤后的软组织感染通常是由于动物口腔菌群引起的，其中最常见的是巴斯德菌。"

It requires recognizing Pasteurella multocida as the most likely causative organism based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's history of a dog bite, the rapid onset of cellulitis, and the gram-negative coccobacilli with a mouse-like odor on culture.
