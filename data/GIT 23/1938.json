    "en": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the office due to 6 months of persistent diarrhea. She has had 8-10 episodes a day of tea-colored, odorless, watery stools. The symptoms have persisted despite a lactose-free diet and a fasting trial. The patient has had no abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F). Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Sampling of her gastric contents shows a total lack of gastric acid secretion. Somatostatin treatment promptly relieves the symptoms. An excess of which of the following hormones is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?",

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has secretory diarrhea, distinguished from inflammatory diarrhea by the absence of blood or pus and from osmotic diarrhea (eg, due to lactose intolerance) by its failure to improve with dietary modification. Excess vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) secretion due to a pancreatic islet cell tumor called VIPoma can result in watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria (WDHA) syndrome (pancreatic cholera). VIP stimulates pancreatic bicarbonate and chloride secretion, and its binding to intestinal epithelial cells leads to adenylate cyclase activation and increased cyclic AMP production, causing sodium, chloride, and water secretion into the bowel (secretory watery diarrhea, often >3 L/day).\n\nSomatostatin (octreotide) decreases the production of many gastrointestinal (GI) hormones (eg, gastrin, glucagon, cholecystokinin [CCK]). Its inhibition of VIP production by this VIPoma is responsible for the resolution of this patient's symptoms.\n\n(Choice A) CCK causes increased secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bicarbonate, gallbladder contraction, and inhibition of gastric emptying. It does not cause WDHA syndrome. CCK is produced by I cells of the proximal small bowel mucosa in response to fatty acids and amino acids.\n\n(Choice B) Gastrin is produced by G cells in the stomach mucosa. It stimulates gastric acid production and growth of the gastric mucosa. Gastrinomas classically cause intractable peptic ulcer disease (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), not WDHA syndrome.\n\n(Choice C) Ghrelin is produced in the stomach and regulates food intake. Levels increase in fasting states and fall after eating. Ghrelin antagonists are being investigated as drug targets.\n\n(Choice D) A glucagonoma is a pancreatic alpha cell tumor that hypersecretes glucagon and can cause secondary diabetes mellitus and necrolytic migratory erythema of the skin.\n\n(Choice E) Motilin is produced by the duodenal mucosa and stimulates smooth muscle contraction in the upper GI tract. The antibiotic erythromycin acts as an agonist at motilin receptors in the stomach and duodenum, contributing to the drug's GI side effects.\n\nEducational objective:\nVIPomas are pancreatic islet cell tumors that hypersecrete vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which increases intestinal chloride loss into the stool and causes excess losses of the accompanying water, sodium, and potassium. VIP also inhibits gastric acid secretion. Somatostatin inhibits the secretion of VIP and is used to treat the symptoms of VIPoma.",
    "zh": "该患者患有分泌性腹泻，其特点是无血液或脓液，区别于炎症性腹泻，并且通过饮食调整后症状未改善，区别于渗透性腹泻（例如，由于乳糖不耐受）。由于称为VIPoma的胰岛细胞肿瘤引起的血管活性肠肽（VIP）分泌过多可导致水样腹泻、低钾血症和无胃酸症（WDHA）综合征（胰腺霍乱）。VIP刺激胰腺碳酸氢盐和氯离子的分泌，其与肠上皮细胞的结合导致腺苷酸环化酶激活和环磷酸腺苷（cAMP）产生增加，从而导致钠、氯离子和水向肠道分泌（分泌性水样腹泻，通常>3 L/天）。\n\n生长抑素（奥曲肽）可减少许多胃肠道（GI）激素（例如，胃泌素、胰高血糖素、胆囊收缩素[CCK]）的产生。它对该VIPoma产生的VIP的抑制是该患者症状缓解的原因。\n\n（选项A）CCK引起胰酶和碳酸氢盐分泌增加、胆囊收缩和胃排空抑制。它不会引起WDHA综合征。CCK由近端小肠粘膜的I细胞产生，以响应脂肪酸和氨基酸。\n\n（选项B）胃泌素由胃粘膜中的G细胞产生。它刺激胃酸的产生和胃粘膜的生长。胃泌素瘤通常引起顽固性消化性溃疡病（Zollinger-Ellison综合征），而不是WDHA综合征。\n\n（选项C）生长素释放肽在胃中产生并调节食物摄入。禁食状态下水平升高，进食后下降。生长素释放肽拮抗剂正在被研究作为药物靶点。\n\n（选项D）胰高血糖素瘤是一种胰腺α细胞肿瘤，过度分泌胰高血糖素，可导致继发性糖尿病和皮肤坏死性游走性红斑。\n\n（选项E）胃动素由十二指肠粘膜产生，刺激上消化道的平滑肌收缩。抗生素红霉素在胃和十二指肠的胃动素受体上充当激动剂，导致该药物的胃肠道副作用。\n\n教育目标：\nVIPoma是胰岛细胞肿瘤，过度分泌血管活性肠肽（VIP），从而增加肠道氯离子向粪便中的丢失，并导致伴随的水、钠和钾的过度丢失。VIP还抑制胃酸分泌。生长抑素抑制VIP的分泌，并用于治疗VIPoma的症状。"
