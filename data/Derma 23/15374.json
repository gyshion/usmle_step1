    "en": "This patient has typical features of **acne vulgaris**. Acne usually appears in adolescence and can present with a variety of lesions, including comedones, papules, pustules, or inflammatory nodules, often with lesions in different stages concurrently. Nodular (sometimes called nodulocystic) acne, as in this patient, is often painful, difficult to treat, and can lead to the formation of sinus tracts and residual scarring.\n\nAcne vulgaris is characterized by inflammation of **pilosebaceous follicles**. Contributing factors include **hyperkeratinization** and obstruction of follicles; sebaceous gland enlargement with **increased sebum secretion**; colonization of the gland by *Propionibacterium (Cutibacterium) acnes*, which metabolizes lipids in sebum and produces proinflammatory factors; and follicular and perifollicular inflammation with follicular rupture.\n\n(Choice A) Dermatitis herpetiformis most commonly occurs in patients with celiac disease and is characterized by microabscesses containing fibrin and neutrophils at the dermal papillae tips. Clinical manifestations include pruritic papules, vesicles, and bullae that appear symmetrically on the extensor surfaces (eg, elbows, knees), upper back, and buttocks.\n\n(Choice B) Eccrine sweat glands produce watery sweat in response to exertion, high ambient temperature, and emotional stress. The secretions from eccrine glands have little lipid content and do not support heavy colonization by *P. acnes*; therefore, these glands do not have a prominent role in the pathogenesis of acne.\n\n(Choice C) Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by an autoimmune process that causes the epidermis to separate from the dermis, forming subepidermal blisters. It presents with tense, fluid-filled bullae on the inner thighs, forearms, axillae, groin, and abdomen.\n\n(Choice D) Melanocyte disorders typically present with hyperpigmentation (eg, melasma) or hypopigmentation (eg, vitiligo).\n\n(Choice F) Erythema nodosum—characterized by painful, subcutaneous nodules, typically in the lower legs—is a form of panniculitis (inflammation of the subcutaneous adipose tissue) caused by a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to antigens associated with various conditions (eg, herpes simplex). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}",
    "zh": "该患者具有**寻常痤疮**的典型特征。痤疮通常出现在青春期，可表现为多种皮损，包括粉刺、丘疹、脓疱或炎性结节，通常同时存在不同阶段的皮损。结节性（有时称为囊肿性）痤疮，如该患者，通常疼痛，难以治疗，并可导致窦道形成和残留瘢痕。\n\n寻常痤疮的特征是**毛囊皮脂腺**炎症。促成因素包括**过度角化**和毛囊阻塞；皮脂腺增大伴**皮脂分泌增加**；*痤疮丙酸杆菌（Cutibacterium acnes）*对腺体的定植，该菌代谢皮脂中的脂质并产生促炎因子；以及毛囊和毛囊周围炎症，伴有毛囊破裂。\n\n(选项A) 疱疹样皮炎最常发生在患有乳糜泻的患者中，其特征是在真皮乳头尖端存在含有纤维蛋白和中性粒细胞的微脓肿。临床表现包括瘙痒性丘疹、水疱和大疱，对称性地出现在伸展面（如肘部、膝盖）、上背部和臀部。\n\n(选项B) 外泌汗腺在运动、高温和情绪应激时产生水样汗液。外泌汗腺的分泌物脂质含量很少，不支持*痤疮丙酸杆菌*的重度定植；因此，这些腺体在痤疮的发病机制中没有显著作用。\n\n(选项C) 大疱性类天疱疮的特征是自身免疫过程导致表皮与真皮分离，形成表皮下水疱。其表现为大腿内侧、前臂、腋窝、腹股沟和腹部出现紧张的、充满液体的水疱。\n\n(选项D) 黑素细胞疾病通常表现为色素沉着过度（如黄褐斑）或色素减退（如白癜风）。\n\n(选项F) 结节性红斑——其特征是通常在小腿出现的疼痛性皮下结节——是一种脂膜炎（皮下脂肪组织炎症），由对与各种情况（如单纯疱疹）相关的抗原的迟发型超敏反应引起。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}}"

Specifically, it assesses understanding that acne vulgaris is an inflammatory disorder of the pilosebaceous follicles.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of acne vulgaris (recurrent red and painful skin bumps) and recall that the pilosebaceous follicles are the primary site of inflammation and pathology in acne.",
