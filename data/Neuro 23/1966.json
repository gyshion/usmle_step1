  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This child has clinical evidence of meningitis (fever, headache, vomiting, stiff neck). Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows normal glucose, marginally elevated protein (generally <150 mg/dL), and pleocytosis with a lymphocytic predominance. This pattern suggests aseptic meningitis, which is usually viral in etiology.\n\nEnteroviruses (eg, coxsackievirus, echovirus, poliovirus) are responsible for >90% of cases. Clinical symptoms are similar to meningitis caused by bacterial or fungal pathogens. However, aseptic meningitis is generally less severe, and focal neurologic signs, seizures, and alterations in mental status are absent. The presence of any of these should prompt consideration of other conditions, including bacterial meningitis, encephalitis, and intracranial hemorrhage. A negative Gram stain and sterile culture will further support the diagnosis of aseptic meningitis.\n\n(Choice A) Coronaviruses are a common cause of cold symptoms and have caused fatal respiratory illnesses (eg, severe acute respiratory syndromes). They are not a common cause of viral meningitis.\n\n(Choice B) Cryptococcus neoformans is a common cause of meningitis in immunocompromised patients (eg, AIDS patients). The diagnosis is made by testing for cryptococcal antigens or by identifying India ink-stained organisms in the CSF.\n\n(Choice D) The mumps virus can cause aseptic meningitis, but this would be extremely unlikely in this fully immunized child. Meningitis caused by mumps is accompanied by parotitis in 50% of cases.\n\n(Choices E, F, and G) Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis are the most common causes of bacterial meningitis in adults; S agalactiae (group B Streptococcus) is the most common cause of meningitis in neonates. Bacterial and viral meningitis both cause fever, nuchal rigidity, and headache. However, this patient's CSF analysis is more suggestive of aseptic meningitis.\n\nEducational objective:\nFever; meningeal signs (eg, headache, neck stiffness); and cerebrospinal fluid that shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, a modestly elevated protein level (<150 mg/dL), and normal glucose are suggestive of aseptic meningitis. Enteroviruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis.",
    "zh": "该儿童有脑膜炎的临床证据（发烧、头痛、呕吐、颈部僵硬）。脑脊液（CSF）分析显示葡萄糖正常，蛋白质轻度升高（通常<150 mg/dL），并且以淋巴细胞为主的细胞增多。这种模式提示无菌性脑膜炎，通常由病毒引起。\n\n肠道病毒（例如，柯萨奇病毒、埃可病毒、脊髓灰质炎病毒）导致了超过90％的病例。临床症状与细菌或真菌病原体引起的脑膜炎相似。然而，无菌性脑膜炎通常较轻，并且缺乏局灶性神经体征、癫痫发作和精神状态改变。如果出现上述任何一项，应考虑其他疾病，包括细菌性脑膜炎、脑炎和颅内出血。革兰氏染色阴性和无菌培养将进一步支持无菌性脑膜炎的诊断。\n\n（选项 A）冠状病毒是感冒症状的常见原因，并已导致致命的呼吸系统疾病（例如，严重急性呼吸系统综合征）。它们不是病毒性脑膜炎的常见原因。\n\n（选项 B）新型隐球菌是免疫功能低下患者（例如，艾滋病患者）脑膜炎的常见原因。诊断是通过检测隐球菌抗原或通过鉴定脑脊液中墨汁染色的生物体来进行的。\n\n（选项 D）腮腺炎病毒可引起无菌性脑膜炎，但在该完全免疫的儿童中极不可能发生。腮腺炎引起的脑膜炎伴有50％的病例出现腮腺炎。\n\n（选项 E、F 和 G）肺炎链球菌和脑膜炎奈瑟菌是成人细菌性脑膜炎最常见的原因；无乳链球菌（B群链球菌）是新生儿脑膜炎最常见的原因。细菌性和病毒性脑膜炎都会引起发烧、颈项强直和头痛。然而，该患者的脑脊液分析更提示无菌性脑膜炎。\n\n教育目标：\n发烧；脑膜征（例如，头痛、颈部僵硬）；以及显示淋巴细胞增多、蛋白质水平适度升高（<150 mg/dL）和葡萄糖正常的脑脊液提示无菌性脑膜炎。肠道病毒是无菌性脑膜炎最常见的原因。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the etiology and diagnosis of aseptic meningitis, specifically the interpretation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings. It requires differentiating between viral and bacterial causes of meningitis based on CSF glucose, protein, and cell counts. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the CSF pattern of normal glucose, slightly elevated protein, and lymphocytic pleocytosis, which is characteristic of aseptic (viral) meningitis.
