    "en": "The image demonstrates a Kayser-Fleischer ring, an ophthalmologic finding most strongly associated with Wilson's disease (although it can also be seen in chronic cholestatic diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis). Kayser-Fleischer rings are best identified on slit-lamp examination, but they can be observed grossly, especially with long-standing, untreated disease. The rings are formed through the granular deposition of copper within Descemet's membrane in the cornea.\n\nWilson's disease is a rare, autosomal recessive disease most often identified in individuals 5-40 years old. The genetic mutations associated with Wilson's disease hinder copper metabolism by reducing the formation and secretion of ceruloplasmin and decreasing hepatic secretion of copper into the biliary system. Copper is a pro-oxidant and causes damage to hepatic tissue through the generation of free radicals. Eventually, it leaks from injured hepatocytes into the circulation to be deposited in various tissues, including the cornea and basal ganglia. Atrophy of the basal ganglia then ensues.\n\nTreatment is life-long and focuses on removing accumulated copper in the tissues and preventing its re-accumulation. First-line medications include copper chelators such as d-penicillamine and trientine.\n\n(Choice A) Pulmonary emphysema commonly develops in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.\n\n(Choice B) Diabetes mellitus commonly develops in patients with advanced hemochromatosis. It has no association with Wilson's disease.\n\n(Choice D) Renal cancer (clear cell carcinoma) occurs more frequently in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease, not Wilson's disease.\n\n(Choice E) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy presenting in childhood and adolescence is an autosomal dominant disease involving the cardiac sarcomere. It is not associated with Wilson's disease.\n\n(Choice F) Congenital deafness can develop secondary to numerous hereditary and nonhereditary conditions. Wilson's disease has no association with congenital deafness.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe Kayser-Fleischer ring is an ophthalmologic finding most strongly associated with Wilson's disease. It is seen most frequently in patients with neuropsychiatric complications. Basal ganglia atrophy is typically present in these patients.",
    "zh": "该图像显示 Kayser-Fleischer 环，这是一种与 Wilson 病密切相关的眼科发现（尽管它也可见于慢性胆汁淤积性疾病，例如原发性胆汁性肝硬化）。Kayser-Fleischer 环最好通过裂隙灯检查确定，但也可以通过肉眼观察到，尤其是在长期未治疗的疾病中。这些环是通过铜颗粒沉积在角膜的 Descemet 膜中形成的。\n\nWilson 病是一种罕见的常染色体隐性遗传病，通常在 5-40 岁的个体中被识别。与 Wilson 病相关的基因突变通过减少 ceruloplasmin 的形成和分泌以及减少肝脏向胆道系统分泌铜来阻碍铜的代谢。铜是一种促氧化剂，通过产生自由基对肝组织造成损害。最终，它从受损的肝细胞泄漏到循环系统中，沉积在各种组织中，包括角膜和基底神经节。然后发生基底神经节萎缩。\n\n治疗是终身的，重点是清除组织中积累的铜并防止其再次积累。一线药物包括铜螯合剂，如青霉胺和曲恩汀。\n\n（选项 A）肺气肿通常发生在α-1 抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症患者中。\n\n（选项 B）糖尿病通常发生在晚期血色病患者中。它与 Wilson 病无关。\n\n（选项 D）肾癌（透明细胞癌）更常见于 von Hippel-Lindau 病患者，而非 Wilson 病患者。\n\n（选项 E）在儿童和青少年时期出现的肥厚型心肌病是一种常染色体显性遗传病，涉及心脏肌节。它与 Wilson 病无关。\n\n（选项 F）先天性耳聋可继发于多种遗传性和非遗传性疾病。Wilson 病与先天性耳聋无关。\n\n教育目标：\nKayser-Fleischer 环是一种与 Wilson 病密切相关的眼科发现。它最常见于有神经精神病学并发症的患者。这些患者通常存在基底神经节萎缩。"
