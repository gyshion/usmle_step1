    "en": "The figure shows the volume of the intracellular (ICF) and extracellular (ECF) fluid compartments (x-axis) and the osmolarity of the fluid in those compartments (y-axis). {{exhibit_2}}\n\nThis patient's recent head trauma is consistent with CENTRAL DIABETES INSIPIDUS due to hypothalamic/pituitary damage. The resulting decrease in vasopressin secretion leads to EXCESSIVE FREE WATER EXCRETION by the kidneys, causing HYPEROSMOTIC VOLUME CONTRACTION. This condition occurs when the loss of free water exceeds the loss of electrolytes, resulting in INCREASED OSMOLARITY and CONTRACTED VOLUMES in both the ICF and ECF compartments. Hyperosmotic volume contraction can occur in the setting of diabetes insipidus, decreased fluid intake (dehydration), and profuse sweating (due to the hypotonic nature of sweat).\n\n(Choice A) Acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage (or diarrhea) would cause an isotonic loss of ECF volume, with no effects on osmolarity or ICF volume. This is referred to as isotonic volume contraction.\n\n(Choice B) The lack of aldosterone in adrenal insufficiency causes loss of NaCl with ECF volume depletion (hyposmotic volume contraction). The low osmolarity of the ECF results in shifting of free water into the ICF compartment, causing ICF expansion.\n\n(Choice D) Infusion of large amounts of hypertonic saline leads to hypertonic volume expansion. Both the volume and osmolarity of the ECF are increased. The high osmolarity of the ECF leads to shifting of water from the ICF, further increasing the ECF volume.\n\n(Choice E) Primary polycipsia (excessive water consumption) and SIADH (inappropriately high vasopressin levels) both cause retention of free water in the body. This leads to expansion of the ICF compartment and a decrease in the osmolarity of both compartments (hyposmotic volume expansion). Expansion of the ECF compartment is limited in these conditions due to compensatory secretion of aldosterone and natriuretic peptides, which help to normalize the extracellular fluid volume. Thus, affected patients are clinically euvolemic.\n\nEducational objective:\nVolume contraction and expansion can be divided into isosmotic, hyposmotic, and hyperosmotic states. Hyperosmotic volume contraction is caused by a loss of free water (with retention of electrolytes). It can occur in patients with diabetes insipidus or as a result of decreased fluid intake/excessive sweating. {{exhibit_3}}, {{exhibit_4}}, {{exhibit_5}}, {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "该图显示了细胞内液 (ICF) 和细胞外液 (ECF) 隔室的体积（x 轴）以及这些隔室中液体的渗透压（y 轴）。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n该患者最近的头部外伤与中枢性尿崩症一致，这与下丘脑/垂体损伤有关。由此导致的血管加压素分泌减少导致肾脏过度排出游离水，引起高渗性容量收缩。这种情况发生在游离水的损失超过电解质的损失时，导致ICF和ECF隔室的渗透压升高和体积收缩。高渗性容量收缩可发生在尿崩症、饮水减少（脱水）和大量出汗（由于汗液的低渗性质）的情况下。\n\n(选项 A) 急性胃肠道出血（或腹泻）会导致ECF体积等渗性流失，对渗透压或ICF体积无影响。这被称为等渗性容量收缩。\n\n(选项 B) 肾上腺皮质功能不全时缺乏醛固酮会导致NaCl的流失，伴随ECF容量减少（低渗性容量收缩）。ECF的低渗性导致游离水转移到ICF隔室中，引起ICF扩张。\n\n(选项 D) 输注大量高渗盐水会导致高渗性容量扩张。ECF的体积和渗透压均升高。ECF的高渗透压导致水分从ICF转移，进一步增加ECF体积。\n\n(选项 E) 原发性烦渴症（过度饮水）和SIADH（血管加压素水平异常升高）都会导致体内游离水潴留。这导致ICF隔室扩张，并降低两个隔室的渗透压（低渗性容量扩张）。在这些情况下，由于醛固酮和利钠肽的代偿性分泌，ECF隔室的扩张受到限制，这有助于使细胞外液量正常化。因此，受影响的患者在临床上呈正常血容量。\n\n教育目标：\n容量收缩和扩张可分为等渗、低渗和高渗状态。高渗性容量收缩是由游离水流失（伴随电解质潴留）引起的。它可发生在尿崩症患者或由于饮水减少/过度出汗的情况下。{{exhibit_3}}，{{exhibit_4}}，{{exhibit_5}}，{{exhibit_6}}"
