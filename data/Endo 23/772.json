    "en": "A 52-year-old, post-menopausal woman comes to the office for a follow-up appointment. Six months ago, the patient was evaluated for recurrent, brief episodes of excessive warmth and sweating, which were interfering with her usual activities. Thyroid hormone levels were normal, and the patient was subsequently diagnosed with menopausal hot flashes. Treatment with estrogen-containing hormone replacement therapy was begun with significant symptom improvement. She has no other medical conditions and takes no other medications.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Circulating thyroid hormone consists of 2 fractions: an inert protein-bound fraction and a free fraction that is available to enter target cells via a carrier-mediated mechanism. More than 99% of circulating thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins, creating a large circulating reservoir of thyroid hormone. Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) accounts for approximately 70% of thyroid hormone binding with an additional share bound by albumin and transthyretin.\n\nAn increase in estrogen activity (eg, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy) raises circulating TBG levels, causing a corresponding reduction in free T4 and T3 levels. In patients with a normal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, this reduction will result in a transient increase in TSH, leading to increased thyroid hormone production until the additional TBG becomes saturated with thyroid hormone and free T4 and T3 levels are restored (ie, patients remain euthyroid). Therefore, an increase in the TBG level leads to an increase in total T4 and T3 (bound plus free fractions) {{exhibit_1}}.\n\n(Choice A) Estrogen does not affect the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Medications that decrease the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 include propylthiouracil, glucocorticoids, and nonselective beta blockers.\n\n(Choices B and C) Thyroid iodine uptake increases transiently due to the temporary rise in TSH that occurs with increased TBG synthesis. However, iodine uptake normalizes once the newly synthesized TBG becomes saturated with thyroid hormone and TSH returns to normal.\n\n(Choice D) Increased circulating TBG levels cause a transient drop in free T4 and T3 levels as the existing pool of thyroid hormone becomes more protein-bound. However, free T4 and T3 levels quickly normalize as the thyroid synthesizes an appropriate quantity of new thyroid hormone to saturate the additional TBG.\n\nEducational objective:\nIn an increase in estrogen activity, as seen in pregnancy or postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy, increases the level of thyroxine-binding globulin. This leads to an increase in total thyroid hormone levels, but feedback control maintains normal levels of free (biologically active) thyroid hormone.",
    "zh": "循环甲状腺激素由 2 个部分组成：惰性蛋白结合部分和游离部分，后者可通过载体介导机制进入靶细胞。超过 99% 的循环甲状腺激素与血浆蛋白结合，形成甲状腺激素的大型循环储存库。甲状腺素结合球蛋白 (TBG) 约占甲状腺激素结合的 70%，另有部分与白蛋白和 transthyretin 结合。\n\n雌激素活性增加（例如，妊娠、口服避孕药使用、绝经后激素替代疗法）会升高循环 TBG 水平，导致游离 T4 和 T3 水平相应降低。在下丘脑-垂体-甲状腺轴正常的患者中，这种降低会导致 TSH 瞬时升高，从而导致甲状腺激素产生增加，直到额外的 TBG 被甲状腺激素饱和，并且游离 T4 和 T3 水平恢复（即，患者保持甲状腺功能正常）。因此，TBG 水平升高会导致总 T4 和 T3（结合和游离部分）升高 {{exhibit_1}}。\n\n（选项 A）雌激素不影响 T4 向 T3 的外周转化。降低 T4 向 T3 外周转化的药物包括丙硫氧嘧啶、糖皮质激素和非选择性 β 受体阻滞剂。\n\n（选项 B 和 C）由于 TSH 暂时升高，甲状腺摄碘会短暂增加，这种升高发生于 TBG 合成增加时。然而，一旦新合成的 TBG 被甲状腺激素饱和并且 TSH 恢复正常，碘摄取就会恢复正常。\n\n（选项 D）循环 TBG 水平升高会导致游离 T4 和 T3 水平瞬时下降，因为现有的甲状腺激素池变得更多地与蛋白质结合。然而，当甲状腺合成适量的新甲状腺激素以使额外的 TBG 饱和时，游离 T4 和 T3 水平会迅速恢复正常。\n\n教育目标：\n在雌激素活性增加时，如妊娠或绝经后雌激素替代疗法中可见，会增加甲状腺素结合球蛋白的水平。这会导致总甲状腺激素水平升高，但反馈控制会维持游离（具有生物活性）甲状腺激素的正常水平。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the effects of estrogen on thyroid hormone levels, specifically how estrogen increases thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) and subsequently affects total and free thyroid hormone concentrations. It requires knowledge of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and the regulation of thyroid hormone production.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that estrogen increases TBG, leading to a transient decrease in free T4 and T3, which stimulates TSH release. This results in increased thyroid hormone production until TBG is saturated, leading to an increase in total T4 and T3, while free hormone levels are maintained within normal limits.",
