    "en": "Pancreatic enzymes (except amylase and lipase) are synthesized and secreted in inactive form to protect the pancreas from autodigestion. These proenzymes (zymogens) are then activated by trypsin in the duodenal lumen after trypsinogen is converted into its active form, trypsin, by the action of duodenal enterokinase. Trypsin can also activate other trypsinogen molecules; therefore, even small amounts of it can result in an activation cascade. Because of trypsin's central role in the activation of pancreatic digestive proenzymes, multiple protective mechanisms exist to limit the amount of trypsinogen that becomes prematurely activated:\n\n•\tSerine peptidase inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1) is secreted by pancreatic acinar cells and functions as a trypsin inhibitor. It impedes the activity of trypsinogen molecules that become prematurely activated within the pancreas.\n•\tIn addition to functioning as its own activator, trypsin can serve as its own inhibitor by cleaving active trypsin molecules at a second site, rendering them inactive.\n\nHereditary pancreatitis is a rare disorder that results from mutations involving the trypsinogen or SPINK1 gene. The most common mutation leads to the production of abnormal trypsin that is not susceptible to inactivating cleavage by trypsin. Because a small amount of trypsinogen normally activates prematurely within the pancreatic acini and ducts, these protective mechanisms are critical for preventing recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis.\n\n(Choices A and E) Peptic ulcer disease and gastric adenocarcinoma are strongly associated with Helicobacter pylori infection.\n\n(Choice B) Patients with mutations affecting the serum protease inhibitor, alpha-1-antitrypsin, can have emphysema and liver cirrhosis. However, there is no association between cirrhosis and trypsinogen gene mutations.\n\n(Choice C) Megaloblastic anemia is due to deficiencies of vitamin B₁₂ and folate. It is also associated with a number of drugs (eg, methotrexate, phenytoin) and certain inborn metabolic errors.",
    "zh": "胰腺酶（淀粉酶和脂肪酶除外）以非活性形式合成和分泌，以保护胰腺免受自身消化。 这些酶原（zymogens）在十二指肠腔中被胰蛋白酶激活，胰蛋白酶原在十二指肠肠激酶的作用下转化为其活性形式，即胰蛋白酶。 胰蛋白酶还可以激活其他胰蛋白酶原分子； 因此，即使少量胰蛋白酶也会导致激活级联反应。 由于胰蛋白酶在激活胰腺消化酶原中起着核心作用，因此存在多种保护机制来限制过早激活的胰蛋白酶原的数量：\n\n•\tKazal型丝氨酸肽酶抑制剂1 (SPINK1) 由胰腺腺泡细胞分泌，并作为胰蛋白酶抑制剂发挥作用。 它阻碍在胰腺内过早激活的胰蛋白酶原分子的活性。\n•\t除了充当其自身的激活剂外，胰蛋白酶还可以通过在第二个位点切割活性胰蛋白酶分子来充当其自身的抑制剂，从而使其失活。\n\n遗传性胰腺炎是一种罕见的疾病，由涉及胰蛋白酶原或SPINK1基因的突变引起。 最常见的突变导致产生异常的胰蛋白酶，该胰蛋白酶不易被胰蛋白酶灭活切割。 由于少量胰蛋白酶原通常会在胰腺腺泡和导管内过早激活，因此这些保护机制对于预防急性胰腺炎的复发至关重要。\n\n（选项A和E）消化性溃疡病和胃腺癌与幽门螺杆菌感染密切相关。\n\n（选项B）影响血清蛋白酶抑制剂α-1-抗胰蛋白酶的突变的患者可患有肺气肿和肝硬化。 然而，肝硬化与胰蛋白酶原基因突变之间没有关联。\n\n（选项C）巨幼细胞性贫血是由于维生素B₁₂和叶酸缺乏引起的。 它也与许多药物（例如甲氨蝶呤、苯妥英）和某些先天性代谢错误有关。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of the role of trypsinogen and trypsin in pancreatic enzyme activation and the pathophysiology of hereditary pancreatitis. It also tests understanding of the protective mechanisms that prevent premature activation of trypsinogen within the pancreas.\n\nTo solve this question, understand that trypsinogen is the inactive precursor to trypsin, a key enzyme in activating other pancreatic enzymes. A mutation preventing trypsin inactivation leads to premature activation and autodigestion, resulting in pancreatitis.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了胰蛋白酶原和胰蛋白酶在胰腺酶激活中的作用以及遗传性胰腺炎的病理生理学知识。 它还考察了对防止胰腺内胰蛋白酶原过早激活的保护机制的理解。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要理解胰蛋白酶原是胰蛋白酶的非活性前体，胰蛋白酶是激活其他胰腺酶的关键酶。 阻止胰蛋白酶失活的突变会导致过早激活和自身消化，从而导致胰腺炎。"
