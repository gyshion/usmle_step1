    "en": "Addressing medication errors promptly is important in solving recurrent problems and preventing further harm to patients. The first step of the committee should be to conduct a step-by-step analysis of what occurred and why. Typically, the best approach is to employ a ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS, which aims to identify what, how, and why an undesirable outcome occurred.\n\nThe first step in a root cause analysis involves collecting data to obtain complete information about the event or events. This involves interviewing multiple staff members involved to understand why and how the adverse outcomes occurred. For example, interviews may uncover root causes such as understaffing in the pharmacy stemming from budget cuts or a hostile hierarchical culture that led nursing staff to be reluctant to point out problems to the medical staff. Only when investigators determine why an event occurred can they recommend specific corrective measures to prevent future occurrences (Choices A and B).\n\n(Choice C) Increasing the hospital's risk management staffing may improve its ability to handle potential lawsuits but would not directly address the recurrent issue of not recognizing expired medication orders.\n\n(Choice E) Although interviewing the patients involved can sometimes yield information about the course of events, this is not typically a key step in conducting a root cause analysis. The most important step is interviewing staff members on the units where these incidents occurred.\n\nEducational objective:\nRoot cause analysis is a quality improvement measure that identifies what, how, and why a preventable adverse outcome occurred. The first step involves collecting data mainly through interviewing multiple individuals involved in the steps leading to the outcome.",
    "zh": "及时处理用药错误对于解决反复出现的问题和防止对患者的进一步损害至关重要。委员会的第一步应该是逐步分析发生了什么以及为什么会发生。通常，最好的方法是采用根本原因分析，其目的是确定不良结果发生的原因、方式和原因。\n\n根本原因分析的第一步是收集数据以获取有关事件的完整信息。这包括采访多名相关工作人员，以了解不良结果的原因和方式。例如，访谈可能会揭示根本原因，例如药房因预算削减而人手不足，或导致护理人员不愿向医疗人员指出问题的敌对等级文化。只有在调查人员确定了事件发生的原因后，他们才能建议采取具体的纠正措施来防止未来发生（选项 A 和 B）。\n\n（选项 C）增加医院的风险管理人员配备可能会提高其处理潜在诉讼的能力，但不会直接解决未识别过期药物医嘱的反复出现的问题。\n\n（选项 E）虽然采访相关患者有时可以提供有关事件过程的信息，但这通常不是进行根本原因分析的关键步骤。最重要的一步是采访发生这些事件的病房的工作人员。\n\n教育目标：\n根本原因分析是一种质量改进措施，用于确定可预防的不良结果的原因、方式和原因。第一步主要通过采访参与导致结果的步骤的多个个人来收集数据。"
