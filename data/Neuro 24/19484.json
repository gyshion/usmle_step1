    "en": "A 62-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up. The patient has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Over the past 2 years, he has had burning pain and pins and needle sensations in his feet, which is worse at nighttime. Nortriptyline was prescribed, and the dosage was gradually increased. Currently, the patient takes the maximal recommended dose but states the symptoms are not well controlled. He reports no drug adverse effects. Other medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Blood pressure is 124/70 mm Hg and pulse is 68/min. Physical examination shows decreased light touch and pain sensation in the feet. Ankle reflexes are decreased bilaterally. His most recent hemoglobin A1c level is 7.0%. Appropriate foot care is advised, and additional pharmacotherapy for the patient's symptoms is planned.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient has painful diabetic neuropathy, which is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. The first-line pharmacologic treatments for neuropathic pain include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and anticonvulsants. The patient is currently taking nortriptyline, a TCA, which is not providing adequate pain relief. Therefore, an additional medication with a different mechanism of action should be considered. \n\n(A) Amitriptyline is a TCA, similar to nortriptyline. Combining two TCAs is not recommended due to the risk of additive toxicity and lack of additional benefit. \n(B) Desipramine is also a TCA and should not be used concurrently with nortriptyline. \n(C) Duloxetine is an SNRI. While SNRIs are a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain, combining an SNRI with a TCA is generally avoided due to potential for additive side effects, particularly related to serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. \n(D) Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant that works by decreasing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters. It has a different mechanism of action than TCAs and is often used as an adjunct therapy for neuropathic pain. It does not typically interact with TCAs in a way that increases toxicity. \n(E) Venlafaxine is an SNRI, similar to duloxetine. Combining it with a TCA is generally avoided. \n\nTherefore, gabapentin is the most appropriate choice as it offers a different mechanism of action and is less likely to cause drug-drug interactions with nortriptyline. \n\n**Key Pearls:** \n* First-line agents for painful diabetic neuropathy include TCAs, SNRIs, and anticonvulsants. \n* When a patient is not responding to a first-line agent, consider adding a medication from a different class. \n* Avoid combining medications with similar mechanisms of action or additive toxicities (e.g., two TCAs, or a TCA and an SNRI). \n* Gabapentin and pregabalin are anticonvulsants commonly used for neuropathic pain.",
    "zh": "患者患有糖尿病性神经病变，这是糖尿病常见的并发症。神经病理性疼痛的一线药物治疗包括三环类抗抑郁药（TCAs）、5-羟色胺-去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂（SNRIs）和抗惊厥药。患者目前正在服用去甲替林，一种三环类抗抑郁药，但未能提供足够的疼痛缓解。因此，应考虑使用具有不同作用机制的附加药物。\n\n(A) 阿米替林是一种三环类抗抑郁药，与去甲替林相似。不建议同时使用两种三环类抗抑郁药，因为存在累加毒性和无额外益处的风险。\n(B) 地昔帕明也是一种三环类抗抑郁药，不应与去甲替林同时使用。\n(C) 度洛西汀是一种SNRI。虽然SNRIs是神经病理性疼痛的一线治疗药物，但通常避免将SNRI与三环类抗抑郁药联合使用，因为可能产生累加的副作用，特别是与5-羟色胺和去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制有关。\n(D) 加巴喷丁是一种抗惊厥药，通过减少兴奋性神经递质的释放发挥作用。它具有与三环类抗抑郁药不同的作用机制，通常用作神经病理性疼痛的辅助治疗。它通常不会以增加毒性的方式与三环类抗抑郁药相互作用。\n(E) 文拉法辛是一种SNRI，与度洛西汀相似。通常避免与三环类抗抑郁药联合使用。\n\n因此，加巴喷丁是最合适的选择，因为它提供了不同的作用机制，并且不太可能与去甲替林引起药物相互作用。\n\n**关键要点：**\n* 糖尿病性神经病变的一线药物包括三环类抗抑郁药、SNRIs和抗惊厥药。\n* 当患者对一线药物无反应时，考虑添加来自不同类别的药物。\n* 避免联合使用具有相似作用机制或累加毒性的药物（例如，两种三环类抗抑郁药，或一种三环类抗抑郁药和一种SNRI）。\n* 加巴喷丁和普瑞巴林是常用于神经病理性疼痛的抗惊厥药。"
