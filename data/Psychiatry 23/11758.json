    "en": "A 26-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police after assaulting customers in a restaurant. He explains that he meant no harm and was just trying to talk to people and touch them to \"heal their pain.\" The patient has been up all night for the past 10 days devising a global strategy to end world hunger and has written a hundred-page manifesto documenting his ideas. Over the same period, he began hearing a voice telling him that he is \"God's true son\" and will need to sacrifice his life. The patient has no psychiatric or medical history. He drinks alcohol socially but does not use illicit drugs. Physical examination is normal. On mental status examination, the patient paces continuously. His mood is very irritable, and his speech is loud, rapid, and difficult to interrupt.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's symptoms of irritable mood, impulsivity, hyperactivity, pressured speech, decreased need for sleep, and grandiose delusions lasting ≥1 week meet the criteria for a MANIC EPISODE. Although an elevated mood typifies a manic episode, an irritable mood is commonly seen. Patients with ≥1 manic episodes are diagnosed with BIPOLAR I DISORDER; although most bipolar I patients will experience both major depressive and manic episodes, depressive episodes are not required for diagnosis of bipolar I. Manic episodes can occur with or without psychotic features (eg, delusions, hallucinations).\n\nBipolar disorder with psychotic features may be differentiated from a primary psychotic disorder (eg, schizoaffective disorder bipolar type) based on the temporal relationship between the mood disturbance and the psychosis. In psychotic disorders, psychotic symptoms must persist in the absence of mood symptoms. This patient's psychosis has occurred only in the presence of severe manic symptoms, making bipolar I disorder the more likely diagnosis.\n\n(Choice B) Bipolar II disorder involves hypomanic episodes (less severe than mania and without psychotic features) and major depressive episodes.\n\n(Choice C) Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by acute onset of ≥1 psychotic symptoms lasting ≥1 days but <1 month, with eventual complete resolution. The diagnosis cannot be made when psychotic symptoms occur only in the context of a manic episode, as in this patient.\n\n(Choice D) Delusional disorder is characterized by ≥1 delusions in the absence of other psychotic symptoms. Functioning may be normal apart from the direct impact of the delusion. Mood symptoms, if present, are not prominent.\n\n(Choice E) In schizophreniform disorder, symptoms of schizophrenia (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior, negative symptoms) are present for >1 month but <6 months. This patient's psychotic symptoms have occurred only in the context of a manic episode and have been present for <1 month.\n\n(Choice F) Substance-induced disorders should be ruled out prior to diagnosing primary psychiatric illness. The extent of this patient's alcohol use would be unlikely to cause his current symptoms. Cocaine and stimulants are more likely to induce manic symptoms.\n\nEducational objective:\nBipolar I disorder is diagnosed in patients with ≥1 episodes of mania. Manic episodes are characterized by elevated/irritable mood, impulsivity, hyperactivity, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, and grandiosity and may occur with psychotic features.",
    "zh": "该患者的症状包括易怒情绪、冲动、多动、语速过快、睡眠需求减少以及持续≥1周的夸大妄想，符合躁狂发作的标准。虽然情绪高涨是躁狂发作的典型特征，但易怒情绪也很常见。≥1次躁狂发作的患者被诊断为双相I型障碍；尽管大多数双相I型患者会同时经历重度抑郁发作和躁狂发作，但诊断双相I型障碍不需要抑郁发作。躁狂发作可能伴有或不伴有精神病性特征（例如，妄想、幻觉）。\n\n伴有精神病性特征的双相障碍可以根据情绪障碍和精神病之间的时序关系与原发性精神病性障碍（例如，分裂情感性障碍双相型）区分开来。在精神病性障碍中，精神病性症状必须在不存在情绪症状的情况下持续存在。该患者的精神病仅在出现严重躁狂症状时发生，因此双相I型障碍是更有可能的诊断。\n\n（选项B）双相II型障碍涉及轻躁狂发作（不如躁狂严重，且无精神病性特征）和重度抑郁发作。\n\n（选项C）短暂性精神病性障碍的特征是急性起病≥1个精神病性症状，持续≥1天但<1个月，最终完全缓解。当精神病性症状仅在躁狂发作的背景下发生时，如本患者，则无法做出诊断。\n\n（选项D）妄想症的特征是在没有其他精神病性症状的情况下存在≥1个妄想。除了妄想的直接影响外，功能可能正常。如果存在情绪症状，则不明显。\n\n（选项E）在分裂样精神障碍中，精神分裂症的症状（妄想、幻觉、思维和行为紊乱、阴性症状）持续存在>1个月但<6个月。该患者的精神病性症状仅在躁狂发作的背景下发生，并且持续时间<1个月。\n\n（选项F）在诊断原发性精神疾病之前，应排除物质诱发性障碍。该患者的饮酒量不太可能引起他目前的症状。可卡因和兴奋剂更容易诱发躁狂症状。\n\n教育目标：\n双相I型障碍的诊断依据是患者有≥1次躁狂发作。躁狂发作的特征是情绪高涨/易怒、冲动、多动、睡眠需求减少、语速过快和夸大，并可能伴有精神病性特征。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the diagnostic criteria for bipolar I disorder, specifically the presence of manic episodes with psychotic features. It requires differentiating this diagnosis from other psychotic and mood disorders based on the duration and context of symptoms.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the core features of a manic episode (elevated or irritable mood, increased energy, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, pressured speech, impulsivity) and recognize that psychotic features occurring exclusively during a manic episode are characteristic of bipolar I disorder with psychotic features. The duration of symptoms is also crucial for differentiating from brief psychotic disorder and schizophreniform disorder.",
