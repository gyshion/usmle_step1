    "en": "This patient with untreated systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has normocytic anemia with low serum iron and low total iron-binding capacity, raising strong suspicion for ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE (ACD). Most cases arise in those with CHRONIC ELEVATION of INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES due to underlying rheumatologic disease (eg, SLE), chronic infection, or malignancy. Although a number of inflammatory cytokines contribute to the development of ACD, the primary mediator is hepcidin, a small peptide released by the liver in response to inflammation.\n\nHepcidin binds to and inactivates iron channels (ferroportin) on enterocytes and reticuloendothelial macrophages, which results in reduced iron absorption in the gut and INCREASED IRON SEQUESTRATION in the reticuloendothelial system. Because reticuloendothelial macrophages recycle senescent erythrocytes and provide >95% of daily iron for erythrocytosis, sequestration of iron in the reticuloendothelial system dramatically REDUCES SERUM IRON CONCENTRATION. This limits the amount of iron available for the generation of new erythrocytes and typically results in a normocytic (or slightly microcytic) anemia with a low reticulocyte response. In ACD, TOTAL IRON-BINDING CAPACITY is generally normal or slightly reduced due to cytokine-mediated suppression of transferrin.\n\n(Choices A and E) Patients with SLE can develop immune-mediated hemolysis due to the generation of autoantibodies against the erythrocyte membrane; however, this typically results in extravascular hemolysis, which increases the intracellular enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. The presence of normal lactate dehydrogenase in this case makes hemolysis less likely. Patients with SLE also sometimes develop gastrointestinal bleeding from serositis (or chronic NSAID use), which can lead to iron deficiency anemia. However, iron deficiency anemia is typically associated with microcytic anemia and a high total iron-binding capacity (because transferrin levels are markedly increased).\n\n(Choices B and C) Conditions associated with rapid cell turnover can result in folate deficiency due to increased folate use during the generation of new cells. Intrinsic factor antibodies are a common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency. However, folate and vitamin B12 deficiency are generally marked by macrocytic anemia with a normal or high serum iron level.\n\nEducational objective:\nAnemia of chronic disease is a consequence of chronically elevated inflammatory cytokines, most importantly hepcidin. This peptide inactivates iron channels on enterocytes and reticuloendothelial macrophages, leading to reduced iron absorption and reduced iron release from the reticuloendothelial system. The net result is normocytic or slightly microcytic anemia with low reticulocyte response, low serum iron level, and normal or low total iron-binding capacity.",
    "zh": "这位未治疗的系统性红斑狼疮 (SLE) 患者患有正细胞性贫血，血清铁和总铁结合力低，高度怀疑为慢性病贫血 (ACD)。大多数病例发生在那些因潜在的风湿病（例如，SLE）、慢性感染或恶性肿瘤而导致炎症细胞因子慢性升高的患者中。尽管许多炎症细胞因子有助于 ACD 的发展，但主要介质是铁调素，这是一种肝脏响应炎症而释放的小肽。\n\n铁调素与小肠细胞和网状内皮巨噬细胞上的铁通道 (铁转运蛋白) 结合并使其失活，这导致肠道中铁的吸收减少和网状内皮系统中的铁隔离增加。由于网状内皮巨噬细胞回收衰老的红细胞并提供 >95% 的每日铁用于红细胞生成，因此铁在网状内皮系统中的隔离会显着降低血清铁浓度。这限制了生成新红细胞的可用铁量，通常导致正细胞性（或轻度小细胞性）贫血，网织红细胞反应低。在 ACD 中，由于细胞因子介导的转铁蛋白抑制，总铁结合力通常正常或略有降低。\n\n（选项 A 和 E）SLE 患者可能会由于产生针对红细胞膜的自身抗体而发生免疫介导的溶血；然而，这通常会导致血管外溶血，从而增加细胞内酶乳酸脱氢酶。在这种情况下，乳酸脱氢酶正常，溶血的可能性较小。SLE 患者有时也会因浆膜炎（或长期使用 NSAID）而发生胃肠道出血，这可能导致缺铁性贫血。然而，缺铁性贫血通常与小细胞性贫血和总铁结合力高相关（因为转铁蛋白水平显着升高）。\n\n（选项 B 和 C）与细胞快速更新相关的疾病可能导致叶酸缺乏症，因为在生成新细胞期间叶酸的利用增加。内因子抗体是维生素 B12 缺乏症的常见原因。然而，叶酸和维生素 B12 缺乏症通常以大细胞性贫血为特征，血清铁水平正常或高。\n\n教育目标：\n慢性病贫血是慢性升高的炎症细胞因子（最重要的是铁调素）的结果。这种肽会使小肠细胞和网状内皮巨噬细胞上的铁通道失活，导致铁吸收减少和铁从网状内皮系统释放减少。最终结果是正细胞性或轻度小细胞性贫血，网织红细胞反应低，血清铁水平低，总铁结合力正常或低。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of anemia of chronic disease (ACD) and its pathophysiology related to inflammatory cytokines and hepcidin. It also tests the ability to differentiate ACD from other causes of anemia based on laboratory findings. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's history of SLE and the laboratory findings of normocytic anemia, low serum iron, and low total iron-binding capacity.
