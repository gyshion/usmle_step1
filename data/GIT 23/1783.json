She also has fluctuating diarrhea but has not seen blood in the stool. The patient has no nausea, vomiting, constipation, urinary frequency, dysuria, or vaginal symptoms. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She does not use tobacco or alcohol. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 90/min. On examination, the abdomen is tender without guarding or rebound. There is a draining fistula near her coccyx. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "en": "Crohn disease {{exhibit_1}}\n\nThis patient likely has Crohn disease (CD) complicated by a perianal fistula. CD can involve the gastrointestinal tract anywhere from the mouth to the anus but often spares the rectum. Patients typically present insidiously (over the course of years) with bouts of crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constitutional symptoms (eg, fatigue, weight loss, fever). Fecal occult blood testing is often positive; however, grossly bloody stool is less commonly seen unless the colon is involved.\n\nPatients are prone to developing fistulas and abscesses due to the transmural inflammation that occurs in CD. Fistulas are abnormal connections between 2 epithelial-lined organs. They are usually formed between the bowel and nearby structures that include the skin (enterocutaneous), urinary bladder (enterovesical), vagina (enterovaginal), or bowel (enteroenteric). Perianal disease other than fistulas is also common and may include skin tags and fissures.\n\n(Choice B) Diverticulitis is characterized by inflammation of saclike protrusions (diverticula) that typically form in the sigmoid colon of older patients. It can present with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, low-grade fever, and fistulas; however, this patient's young age makes the diagnosis less likely.\n\n(Choice C) Intergluteal pilonidal disease is a common skin condition involving the upper natal cleft of the buttocks. Although patients may present with draining sinus tracts in the intergluteal region, abdominal pain/tenderness and diarrhea are not characteristic.\n\n(Choice D) Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by chronic abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits (eg, diarrhea and/or constipation). Pain is often relieved with bowel movements. IBS is not an inflammatory condition and does not cause fistulas.\n\n(Choice E) Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the colonic mucosa that almost always affects the rectum and often presents with grossly bloody stool. Fistulas are not commonly seen as inflammation does not involve the full thickness of the bowel wall.\n\nEducational objective:\nCrohn disease typically presents with the insidious onset of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constitutional symptoms (eg, weight loss, fever). Patients are prone to developing fistulas/abscesses as the lesions affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall. Perianal disease (eg, skin tags, fissures) is also common.",
    "zh": "克罗恩病 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n这位患者可能患有克罗恩病（CD），并伴有肛周瘘管。CD可累及胃肠道的任何部位，从口腔到肛门，但通常不累及直肠。患者通常隐匿起病（几年内），表现为阵发性痉挛性腹痛、腹泻和全身症状（如疲劳、体重减轻、发烧）。粪便隐血检测通常呈阳性；然而，除非累及结肠，否则通常较少看到肉眼可见的血便。\n\n由于CD中发生的全层炎症，患者容易发生瘘管和脓肿。瘘管是2个上皮内衬器官之间的异常连接。它们通常形成于肠道和附近的结构之间，包括皮肤（肠皮瘘）、膀胱（肠膀胱瘘）、阴道（肠阴道瘘）或肠道（肠肠瘘）。除瘘管外，肛周疾病也很常见，可能包括皮赘和裂隙。\n\n（选项B）憩室炎的特征是囊状突起（憩室）的炎症，这些突起通常形成于老年患者的乙状结肠中。它可表现为左下腹疼痛、腹泻或便秘、低烧和瘘管；然而，这位患者的年轻使得该诊断的可能性降低。\n\n（选项C）臀间部藏毛窦病是一种常见的皮肤病，涉及臀部的上部臀裂。尽管患者可能表现为臀间区域引流窦道，但腹痛/压痛和腹泻并非特征性表现。\n\n（选项D）肠易激综合征（IBS）的特征是与肠道习惯改变（如腹泻和/或便秘）相关的慢性腹痛。疼痛通常在排便后缓解。IBS不是一种炎症性疾病，不会引起瘘管。\n\n（选项E）溃疡性结肠炎是一种结肠黏膜的炎症性疾病，几乎总是影响直肠，并且通常表现为肉眼可见的血便。瘘管不常见，因为炎症不涉及肠壁的全层。\n\n教育目标：\n克罗恩病通常表现为腹痛、腹泻和全身症状（如体重减轻、发烧）的隐匿性起病。患者容易发生瘘管/脓肿，因为病变会影响肠壁的整个厚度。肛周疾病（如皮赘、裂隙）也很常见。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize Crohn's disease based on clinical presentation, specifically the presence of a perianal fistula in a young woman with chronic abdominal pain and diarrhea. It also requires differentiating Crohn's disease from other conditions with similar symptoms.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the significance of the perianal fistula in the context of chronic abdominal pain and diarrhea. This should prompt consideration of Crohn's disease, which is known for transmural inflammation and fistula formation. Ruling out other options based on age, location of symptoms, and presence of blood in stool is also crucial.",
