    "en": "This preterm infant with increased work of breathing and hypoxia has diffuse ground-glass opacities and air bronchograms on imaging. These findings are consistent with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). RDS is caused by immaturity of type 2 pneumocytes, which normally produce alveolar surfactant. Lack of surfactant causes decreased compliance and increased surface tension of alveoli, leading to alveolar collapse at the end of expiration. This diffuse atelectasis results in the characteristic reticular or ground-glass opacities on chest x-ray. Unlike alveoli, larger airways remain patent and filled with air due to their cartilaginous walls, making them visible (air bronchograms) against the reticular background. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}} {{exhibit_10}} Management of RDS is respiratory support (to maintain alveolar pressure and prevent collapse) and surfactant (to reduce surface tension). During the first week of life, type 2 pneumocytes begin to release endogenous surfactant, and respiratory distress typically begins to improve.\n\n(Choice A) Pneumothorax is characterized by air leakage into the pleural space with subsequent respiratory distress. However, x-ray would show a visceral pleural line with absent distal lung markings.\n\n(Choice B) Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which causes tachypnea, retractions, and hypoxia, is classically caused by prolonged (>1 month) mechanical ventilation, leading to lung injury and diffuse fibrosis. Another form of BPD is caused by an arrest of pulmonary development, leading to a decreased number and function of alveoli and pulmonary capillaries. Although this infant is at risk for developing both forms of BPD due to prematurity, this condition is diagnosed at age >1 month, not immediately after birth.\n\n(Choice D) Occlusion of the bronchioles by meconium causes meconium aspiration syndrome. In contrast to this patient, affected infants have patchy bilateral infiltrates and lung hyperexpansion due to air trapping. In addition, this patient's amniotic fluid is clear, making this diagnosis unlikely.\n\n(Choice E) Retained extracellular fluid is seen in transient tachypnea of the newborn. X-ray findings include streaky interstitial fluid collections and fluid in the minor fissures, neither of which are seen in this patient.",
