    "en": "An 8-week-old boy is evaluated for nystagmus first noted 2 weeks ago. The patient was born at 37 weeks gestation with no complications during delivery. He has been exclusively breastfed. Vital signs are normal. Weight and height are at the 50th percentile. On examination, iris transillumination is present, and there are no apparent foveae on funduscopic examination. Optic nerves are small and gray. The anterior fontanelle is open and soft with overlying fine, white hair. This patient's condition is most likely due to a defect in which of the following enzymes?",

    "en": "This patient's eye findings and white hair are consistent with oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), an autosomal recessive disorder of melanin production or distribution. The most common defect {{exhibit_1}} is in the enzyme tyrosinase, which converts tyrosine to DOPA in the first step of the melanin biosynthetic pathway.\n\nMelanin is produced in melanosomes (specialized organelles within melanocytes), which are then transferred to keratinocytes to provide ultraviolet protection. In patients with OCA, lack of this pigment results in the characteristic white hair and skin and translucent, light-colored irides. Iris transillumination occurs due to the reflection of light off the retina, causing the iris to appear red. Because the translucent irides allow in excess light, patients often have photophobia (light sensitivity).\n\nIn addition to pigmentation, melanin plays a role in guiding embryologic development of ocular structures. Without melanin, patients have misrouted and underdeveloped optic nerve fibers and hypoplastic or absent foveae, as seen in this infant. This leads to findings of decreased visual acuity and, in turn, strabismus (ie, ocular misalignment) and/or nystagmus.\n\n(Choice A) Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, which converts galactose into glucose, is deficient in galactosemia. Galactitol deposition in the lens leads to cataract formation, not foveal hypoplasia or optic nerve abnormalities. Early manifestations of galactosemia include jaundice, vomiting, hepatomegaly, and failure to thrive, none of which are seen here.\n\n(Choice B) A defect in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase causes methylmalonic acidemia, an organic acidemia that presents in newborns with vomiting, lethargy, respiratory distress, and metabolic acidosis. Eye findings do not occur.\n\n(Choice C) Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is a urea cycle disorder characterized by hyperammonemia and encephalopathy (eg, vomiting, lethargy, seizures), not pigmentation defects.\n\n(Choice D) Sphingomyelinase deficiency is responsible for Niemann-Pick disease, a lysosomal storage disorder that causes progressive neurodegeneration and hepatosplenomegaly. A cherry-red macula is characteristic on eye examination.\n\nEducational objective:\nOculocutaneous albinism is an autosomal recessive disorder of melanin biosynthesis typically due to defective tyrosinase activity. Patients have reduced or absent melanin pigment in the skin, hair, and eye, as well as abnormal development of the fovea and optic nerve fibers, leading to reduced visual acuity and nystagmus. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}",
    "zh": "该患者的眼部表现和白发与眼皮肤白化病 (OCA) 相符，这是一种黑素生成或分布的常染色体隐性遗传病。最常见的缺陷 {{exhibit_1}} 是在酪氨酸酶中，该酶在黑素生物合成途径的第一步将酪氨酸转化为 DOPA。\n\n黑素在黑素体（黑素细胞内的特殊细胞器）中产生，然后转移到角质形成细胞以提供紫外线防护。在患有 OCA 的患者中，缺乏这种色素会导致特征性的白发和皮肤以及半透明的浅色虹膜。虹膜透照是由于光线从视网膜反射，导致虹膜呈现红色。由于半透明的虹膜允许过多的光线进入，患者通常会出现畏光（光敏感）。\n\n除了色素沉着外，黑素在引导眼部结构的胚胎发育中也起着作用。没有黑素，患者的视神经纤维会错位和发育不良，并有发育不全或缺失的凹陷，如本婴儿所示。这会导致视力下降，进而导致斜视（即眼球错位）和/或眼球震颤。\n\n(选项 A) 半乳糖-1-磷酸尿苷酰转移酶将半乳糖转化为葡萄糖，在半乳糖血症中缺乏。半乳糖醇在晶状体中沉积会导致白内障形成，而不是凹陷发育不全或视神经异常。半乳糖血症的早期表现包括黄疸、呕吐、肝肿大和生长迟缓，此处均未见。\n\n(选项 B) 甲基丙二酰辅酶 A 变位酶的缺陷会导致甲基丙二酸血症，这是一种有机酸血症，表现为新生儿呕吐、嗜睡、呼吸窘迫和代谢性酸中毒。不会出现眼部表现。\n\n(选项 C) 鸟氨酸氨甲酰转移酶缺乏症是一种尿素循环障碍，其特征是高氨血症和脑病（例如，呕吐、嗜睡、癫痫发作），而不是色素沉着缺陷。\n\n(选项 D) 鞘磷脂酶缺乏症是尼曼-匹克病的原因，这是一种溶酶体贮积病，会导致进行性神经退行性变和肝脾肿大。樱桃红色斑点是眼部检查的特征。\n\n教育目标：\n眼皮肤白化病是一种黑素生物合成的常染色体隐性遗传病，通常是由于酪氨酸酶活性缺陷所致。患者的皮肤、头发和眼睛中黑素色素减少或缺失，并且凹陷和视神经纤维发育异常，导致视力下降和眼球震颤。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}}"
