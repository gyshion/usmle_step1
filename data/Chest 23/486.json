    "en": "A 32-year-old man is hospitalized due to nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain. He has a history of heavy alcohol use and was admitted to the hospital for acute pancreatitis a year ago. He has continued to drink alcohol since his last hospitalization and had a party last weekend, during which he consumed an entire 750-mL bottle of liquor. Temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 20/min. Abdominal examination is notable for marked tenderness in the epigastric region. Serum lipase is 2,392 U/L. The patient is admitted and started on intravenous fluids, analgesics, and antiemetics with subsequent improvement in his symptoms. His vital signs remain stable with adequate urine output. However, on the second day of hospitalization, the patient develops progressive shortness of breath and hypoxemia. Chest x-ray reveals new bilateral opacities.",

    "en": "This patient with pancreatitis (abdominal pain, elevated lipase, recent heavy alcohol intake) has developed hypoxic respiratory failure with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. In a young patient without a history of cardiac disease, this is highly suggestive of ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS). Direct (eg, irritant chemicals, trauma, gastric aspiration) or indirect (eg, pancreatitis, sepsis) pulmonary insults cause excessive cytokine release, leading to endothelial activation, neutrophilic migration to the lungs, and degranulation with release of toxic mediators. This process worsens the pulmonary alveolar and endothelial injury, leading to increased pulmonary capillary permeability, leakage of fluid into the alveoli, and pulmonary edema (Choice A). \n\nARDS-associated interstitial edema and hyaline membrane formation along with fluid-filled alveoli collapse and atelectasis result in decreased lung compliance and increased work of breathing (Choices B and E). The fluid-filled, collapsed alveoli are unable to deliver oxygen despite continuing to receive adequate blood flow, resulting in ventilation/perfusion mismatch (ie, physiologic shunting) and hypoxia (Choice D).\n\nNoncardiogenic pulmonary edema (eg, ARDS, high-altitude pulmonary edema) can be distinguished from cardiogenic pulmonary edema (eg, decompensated left ventricular failure, volume overload) by a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (6-12 mm Hg). Other distinguishing features include the clinical history (pneumonia/sepsis or pancreatitis suggests ARDS) and physical exam (peripheral edema and jugular venous distension suggest a cardiogenic source). {{exhibit_1}}\n\nEducational objective:\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome is characterized by hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and is associated with pneumonia, sepsis, trauma, and pancreatitis. The associated pulmonary edema is noncardiogenic in nature, so the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure will be within the normal range (6-12 mm Hg).",
    "zh": "这位胰腺炎患者（腹痛、脂肪酶升高、近期大量饮酒）出现了低氧性呼吸衰竭，伴有双侧肺部浸润。对于没有心脏病病史的年轻患者，这高度提示急性呼吸窘迫综合征 (ARDS)。直接（例如，刺激性化学物质、创伤、胃内容物误吸）或间接（例如，胰腺炎、脓毒症）的肺部损伤会导致细胞因子过度释放，从而导致内皮激活、中性粒细胞向肺部迁移以及脱颗粒，并释放有毒介质。此过程会加重肺泡和内皮损伤，导致肺毛细血管通透性增加，液体渗入肺泡，以及肺水肿（选项A）。\n\nARDS 相关性间质性水肿和透明膜形成，以及充满液体的肺泡塌陷和肺不张导致肺顺应性降低和呼吸功增加（选项 B 和 E）。充满液体的、塌陷的肺泡无法输送氧气，尽管它们持续接受充足的血流，导致通气/血流比失调（即生理分流）和低氧血症（选项 D）。\n\n可以通过正常的肺毛细血管楔压（6-12 mmHg）来区分非心源性肺水肿（例如，ARDS、高原肺水肿）与心源性肺水肿（例如，失代偿性左心室衰竭、容量超负荷）。其他鉴别特征包括病史（肺炎/脓毒症或胰腺炎提示 ARDS）和体格检查（外周水肿和颈静脉扩张提示心源性来源）。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n教育目标：\n急性呼吸窘迫综合征的特征是低氧血症和双侧肺部浸润，并且与肺炎、脓毒症、创伤和胰腺炎有关。相关的肺水肿是非心源性的，因此肺毛细血管楔压将在正常范围内（6-12 mmHg）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology and clinical features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), specifically how it differs from cardiogenic pulmonary edema. It assesses the ability to differentiate ARDS from other causes of respiratory distress based on clinical presentation and hemodynamic parameters.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the clinical scenario as ARDS due to pancreatitis. ARDS is a noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, which means the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure will be normal. Eliminate options that are typically abnormal in ARDS, such as capillary permeability, lung compliance, ventilation/perfusion matching, and work of breathing.",
