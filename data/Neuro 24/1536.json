    "en": "A 68-year-old man with a history of Parkinson disease is hospitalized for pneumonia and sepsis. The patient is treated with intravenous (IV) fluids and antibiotics. He is also started on an infusion of IV dopamine for hemodynamic support. Although the manifestations of Parkinson disease are attributed to dopaminergic neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra, IV dopamine does not improve this patient's Parkinson symptoms. Which of the following cell structures accounts for this lack of responsiveness?",

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's Parkinson symptoms do not improve with intravenous dopamine infusion because dopamine is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. The BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER is formed by tight junctions between nonfenestrated capillary endothelial cells that prevent the PARACELLULAR passage of fluid and solutes. TIGHT JUNCTIONS, also known as zonulae occludentes, are composed of transmembrane proteins (eg, claudins and occludins) that associate with actin filaments, forming a BELTLIKE SEAL around the apical intercellular space. This seal only permits the passage of substances from the blood to the brain via transcellular movement.\n\nTranscellular movement of dopamine is limited by the molecule's low lipid solubility and the lack of dopamine-specific transport carriers in capillary endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier. L-DOPA (dopamine precursor) also has low lipid solubility, but it is able to enter the brain due to its high affinity for the large neutral amino acid transporter.\n\n(Choice A) Desmosomes (maculae adherentes) are spotlike junctions that anchor adjacent cells together via keratin intermediate filament interactions. Autoantibodies against desmosomes in the stratum spinosum of the skin cause pemphigus vulgaris.\n\n(Choice B) Fenestrae are small pores within endothelial cells that allow free fluid exchange between the intravascular and extravascular spaces. They are found in capillaries perfusing the intestine, renal tubules, and endocrine glands.\n\n(Choice C) Gap junctions are composed of connexin proteins that create channels between cells, permitting the free passage of small ions (eg, Ca2+) and molecules.\n\n(Choice D) Hemidesmosomes are similar to desmosomes but bind the basal layer of epithelial cells to the basement membrane. Autoantibodies against hemidesmosomes in the skin cause bullous pemphigoid.\n\n(Choice E) Intermediate junctions (zonula adherens or belt desmosomes) are located below tight junctions and form a beltlike anchor between adjacent cells in association with actin microfilaments.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe blood-brain barrier is formed by tight junctions between nonfenestrated capillary endothelial cells that prevent the paracellular passage of fluid and solutes. This barrier only permits the passage of substances from the blood to the paracellular via transcellular movement across the endothelial plasma membrane, which is limited by diffusion or carrier-mediated transport.",
    "zh": "该患者的帕金森病症状未因静脉注射多巴胺而改善，因为多巴胺无法穿过血脑屏障。血脑屏障由非开窗毛细血管内皮细胞之间的紧密连接构成，可阻止液体和溶质的旁细胞通路。紧密连接，也称为闭锁小带，由跨膜蛋白（例如，claudins和occludins）组成，这些蛋白与肌动蛋白丝相关联，在顶端细胞间隙周围形成带状密封。这种密封仅允许物质通过细胞转运从血液进入大脑。\n\n多巴胺的细胞转运受到该分子低脂溶性和血脑屏障毛细血管内皮细胞中缺乏多巴胺特异性转运载体的限制。左旋多巴（多巴胺前体）也具有低脂溶性，但由于其对大中性氨基酸转运体的亲和力高，因此能够进入大脑。\n\n(选项A) 桥粒（maculae adherentes）是点状连接，通过角蛋白中间丝相互作用将相邻细胞锚定在一起。针对皮肤棘层桥粒的自身抗体可引起寻常型天疱疮。\n\n(选项B) 孔是内皮细胞内的小孔，允许血管内和血管外空间之间自由交换液体。它们存在于灌注肠道、肾小管和内分泌腺的毛细血管中。\n\n(选项C) 间隙连接由连接蛋白组成，这些蛋白在细胞之间形成通道，允许小离子（例如，Ca2+）和分子自由通过。\n\n(选项D) 半桥粒与桥粒相似，但将上皮细胞的基底层与基底膜结合。针对皮肤半桥粒的自身抗体可引起大疱性类天疱疮。\n\n(选项E) 中间连接（粘附带或带状桥粒）位于紧密连接下方，并与肌动蛋白微丝相关联，形成相邻细胞之间的带状锚定。\n\n教育目标：\n血脑屏障由非开窗毛细血管内皮细胞之间的紧密连接构成，可阻止液体和溶质的旁细胞通路。该屏障仅允许物质通过细胞转运穿过内皮质膜从血液进入旁细胞，这受到扩散或载体介导转运的限制。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the blood-brain barrier's structure and function, specifically how it restricts the passage of certain molecules like dopamine into the central nervous system. It assesses knowledge of the different types of cell junctions and their roles in maintaining tissue integrity and regulating transport.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the primary barrier preventing dopamine entry into the brain and recall the specific cell junction responsible for forming this barrier. Understanding the paracellular versus transcellular routes of transport and the properties of dopamine (low lipid solubility) is crucial for eliminating other options.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对血脑屏障的结构和功能的理解，特别是它如何限制某些分子（如多巴胺）进入中枢神经系统。它评估了对不同类型细胞连接及其在维持组织完整性和调节转运中的作用的知识。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须确定阻止多巴胺进入大脑的主要屏障，并回忆起负责形成该屏障的特定细胞连接。了解旁细胞与细胞转运途径以及多巴胺的特性（低脂溶性）对于排除其他选项至关重要。"
