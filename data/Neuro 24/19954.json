    "en": "A 28-year-old man experiences worsening tinnitus and hearing loss. MRI of the brain reveals bilateral vestibular schwannomas. Genetic testing confirms a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 2. Additional imaging reveals a small meningioma at the C5 spinal level impinging upon the medial portion of the dorsal columns. Which of the following is the most likely earliest clinical manifestation of this lesion?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's lesion is affecting the DORSAL COLUMNS, which convey VIBRATION and PROPRIOCEPTION sensation as well as FINE TOUCH (ie, 2-point discrimination). They are formed by incoming afferent axons of first-order neurons and are ARRANGED TOPOGRAPHICALLY (ie, medial fibers from lower spinal levels, lateral fibers from higher spinal levels):\n\n* Gracile fasciculus, located medially, which carries afferent information that enters the spinal cord BELOW T6 (lower half of the body) to the gracile nucleus in the medulla\n\n* Cuneate fasciculus, located laterally, which carries afferent information that enters the spinal cord ABOVE T6 (upper half of the body) to the cuneate nucleus in the medulla\n\nTherefore, this patient's MIDLINE LESION would affect the most medial fibers (gracile fasciculus) first, resulting in LOSS OF VIBRATION SENSATION IN THE TOES.\n\n(Choice A) A decreased biceps tendon reflex is more commonly associated with radiculopathy (C5 or C6) or other conditions affecting the lower motor neurons. This patient's posterior midline mass is most likely to affect the dorsal columns first before affecting the C5 motor neurons in the anterior horn.\n\n(Choices B and C) Loss of crude touch sensation can occur with lesions involving the anterior spinothalamic tract; loss of pain sensation can occur with lesions of the lateral spinothalamic tract. These are located in the anterior portion of the spinal cord.\n\n(Choice D) Loss of position sensation in the fingers could occur with a lesion affecting the lateral portion of the dorsal columns (ie, cuneate fasciculus). However, this patient's lesion is located medially and would compress the medial aspect first (eg, toe sensation).\n\nEducational objective:\nThe dorsal columns are located in the posterior spinal cord and convey vibration, proprioception, and light touch sensation. Sensation from the lower limbs is carried in the gracile fasciculus, which is located in the medial aspect; sensation from the upper limbs is carried in the cuneate fasciculus, which is located in the lateral aspect.",
    "zh": "该患者的病变影响后索，后索传递振动觉和本体感觉，以及精细触觉（即，两点辨别觉）。它们由传入的一级神经元的传入轴突形成，并按解剖位置排列（即，来自较低脊髓水平的内侧纤维，来自较高脊髓水平的侧方纤维）：\n\n* 薄束，位于内侧，携带进入 T6 以下（身体下半部分）脊髓的传入信息，到达延髓的薄核\n\n* 楔束，位于侧方，携带进入 T6 以上（身体上半部分）脊髓的传入信息，到达延髓的楔束核\n\n因此，该患者的正中线病变将首先影响最内侧的纤维（薄束），导致脚趾振动觉丧失。\n\n（选项 A）肱二头肌腱反射减弱更常见于神经根病（C5 或 C6）或其他影响下运动神经元的疾病。该患者的后正中线肿块最有可能首先影响后索，然后影响前角的 C5 运动神经元。\n\n（选项 B 和 C）粗触觉丧失可发生在涉及前脊髓丘脑束的病变中；痛觉丧失可发生在侧脊髓丘脑束的病变中。这些位于脊髓的前部。\n\n（选项 D）手指位置觉丧失可发生在影响后索侧方的病变（即，楔束）中。然而，该患者的病变位于内侧，将首先压迫内侧部分（例如，脚趾感觉）。\n\n教育目标：\n后索位于脊髓后部，传递振动觉、本体感觉和轻触觉。来自下肢的感觉由位于内侧的薄束携带；来自上肢的感觉由位于侧方的楔束携带。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the somatotopic organization of the dorsal columns in the spinal cord and how a midline lesion would selectively affect specific sensory modalities and dermatomes. It requires correlating the location of the lesion with the specific sensory pathways involved.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the location of the lesion (medial dorsal columns) and recall the somatotopic organization of the gracile and cuneate fasciculi. The medial fibers (gracile fasciculus) carry sensation from the lower body, and vibration sensation is typically affected earliest by midline lesions.",
    "zh": "此题考察对脊髓后索的体位组织的理解，以及正中线病变如何选择性地影响特定的感觉模式和皮节。它需要将病变的位置与所涉及的特定感觉通路相关联。\n\n要解决这个问题，确定病变的位置（内侧后索），并回忆薄束和楔束的体位组织。内侧纤维（薄束）携带来自下半身的感觉，而振动觉通常最先受到正中线病变的影响。"
