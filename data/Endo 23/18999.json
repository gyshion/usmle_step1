    "en": "A 66-year-old man comes to the office to discuss his sexual health. He thinks that he has symptoms of low testosterone, similar to those described in an article he recently read in a health magazine. The patient has normal sexual desire but reduced spontaneous erections and reduced semen volume with ejaculation. He requires more stimulation to achieve a satisfactory erection and has a longer sexual refractory period than before. The patient has no known medical conditions and takes no medications. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are normal. BMI is 24.5 kg/m2. Physical examination, including examination of the testes, is normal. After laboratory testing is completed, the physician finds no evidence of organic disease and concludes that the results are consistent with normal aging. Compared to a healthy young man, which of the following sets of test results would be most consistent with the physician's conclusion?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Changes in male hormone levels with age\n\nUnlike women, who typically experience a precipitous drop in sex hormone levels at menopause, men generally experience slower, more variable declines with aging. Typical findings seen in normal aging include the following:\n\n•\tSlow decline in gonadal testosterone production with lower total and free testosterone levels\n•\tA compensatory rise in circulating LH levels\n•\tIncreased hepatic synthesis (and rising serum levels) of sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG)\nCompared to women of similar age, men often report higher levels of sexual functioning, activity, and satisfaction as they age. However, men commonly experience mild, nonspecific changes in sexual function, including the following:\n\n•\tDecreased ejaculate volume\n•\tIncreased erectile latency and sexual refractory period (ie, time from orgasm until another orgasm is possible)\n•\tModerately impaired erectile function with increased stimulation needed to achieve an erection\nAt very advanced age (eg, >80), very low testosterone levels can lead to specific hypogonadal symptoms (eg, loss of libido, erectile failure). However, this patient has nonspecific symptoms that are common in aging and do not suggest underlying gonadal failure.\n\n(Choice B) Certain synthetic androgen analogues (eg, danazol) and progestins (eg, levonorgestrel) can displace testosterone from SHBG, increasing free testosterone without a significant change in SHBG levels. However, this pattern is not seen in normal aging.\n\n(Choice C) SHBG levels are suppressed in patients with insulin resistance, diabetes, and obesity. If the pituitary-gonadal axis is intact, total testosterone levels are reduced, but free testosterone levels are relatively preserved. However, this patient has a normal weight, and SHBG is likely increased at age 66.\n\n(Choice D) Testosterone suppresses SHBG synthesis. Excessive, unregulated testosterone (eg, exogenous androgen abuse) would usually be associated with low SHBG levels, but these values would not be seen in normal aging.\n\n(Choice E) Hyperthyroidism often causes increased production of SHBG independent of any total testosterone increases to saturate the increased steroid hormone-binding sites, and free testosterone is unchanged. Although this patient likely has increased SHBG levels, his total and free testosterone levels are more likely decreased due to the effects of aging.\n\nEducational objective:\nNormal aging in men is associated with a slow decline in gonadal testosterone production, a compensatory rise in LH, and rising serum levels of sex hormone–binding globulin. Common, nonspecific symptoms include decreased ejaculate volume, increased erectile latency and sexual refractory time, and moderately impaired erectile function.",
    "zh": "男性激素水平随年龄变化\n\n与女性在更年期通常经历性激素水平急剧下降不同，男性通常随着年龄的增长经历更缓慢、更具变异性的下降。在正常衰老中观察到的典型发现包括以下内容：\n\n•\t性腺睾酮产生缓慢下降，总睾酮和游离睾酮水平降低\n•\t循环LH水平代偿性升高\n•\t肝脏合成性激素结合球蛋白（SHBG）增加（血清水平升高）\n与年龄相仿的女性相比，男性在衰老时通常报告更高的性功能、活动和满意度。然而，男性通常会经历轻微的、非特异性的性功能变化，包括以下内容：\n\n•\t射精量减少\n•\t勃起潜伏期和性不应期延长（即，从性高潮到另一次性高潮可能发生的时间）\n•\t勃起功能中度受损，需要增加刺激才能达到勃起\n在非常晚的年龄（例如，>80岁），非常低的睾酮水平会导致特定的性腺功能减退症状（例如，性欲减退、勃起障碍）。然而，该患者的症状是非特异性的，在衰老中很常见，并不提示潜在的性腺功能衰竭。\n\n（选项B）某些合成的雄激素类似物（例如，达那唑）和孕激素（例如，左炔诺孕酮）可以从SHBG中置换睾酮，增加游离睾酮，而SHBG水平没有显着变化。然而，这种模式在正常衰老中是看不到的。\n\n（选项C）SHBG水平在胰岛素抵抗、糖尿病和肥胖患者中受到抑制。如果垂体-性腺轴完整，总睾酮水平降低，但游离睾酮水平相对保留。然而，该患者体重正常，并且在66岁时SHBG可能升高。\n\n（选项D）睾酮抑制SHBG的合成。过量、不受调节的睾酮（例如，外源性雄激素滥用）通常与低SHBG水平相关，但这些值在正常衰老中是看不到的。\n\n（选项E）甲状腺功能亢进通常会导致SHBG的产生增加，与总睾酮的增加无关，从而饱和增加的类固醇激素结合位点，并且游离睾酮保持不变。虽然该患者的SHBG水平可能升高，但由于衰老的影响，他的总睾酮和游离睾酮水平更有可能降低。\n\n教育目标：\n男性正常衰老与性腺睾酮产生缓慢下降、LH代偿性升高以及性激素结合球蛋白的血清水平升高有关。常见的、非特异性的症状包括射精量减少、勃起潜伏期和性不应期延长以及勃起功能中度受损。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the hormonal changes associated with normal aging in men, specifically the changes in total testosterone, free testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). It also assesses the ability to differentiate normal age-related changes from pathological conditions causing similar symptoms. \n\nThe key to solving this question is understanding that normal aging in men is associated with a decrease in both total and free testosterone levels, along with an increase in SHBG. Recognizing these hormonal shifts allows for the selection of the correct answer choice that reflects this pattern.",
