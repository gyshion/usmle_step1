    "en": "An 18-year-old man comes to the clinic for evaluation of fatigue that began several months ago and has progressively worsened. The patient takes no medications. He does not use alcohol or recreational drugs but smokes a pack of cigarettes daily. Examination shows conjunctival pallor. The abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly. Laboratory evaluation shows hemoglobin is 8.5 g/dL, and stool testing for blood is positive. Further work-up reveals mild hemorrhaging within the ileum; just proximal to the site of hemorrhage is a 5-cm outpouching of intestine. The pouch is surgically resected and microscopic findings are shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}.",

    "en": "Histologic examination of this patient's intestinal outpouching shows gastric mucosa {{exhibit_2}}. This finding is consistent with a Meckel diverticulum, the most common congenital anomaly of the small intestine.\n\nIn utero, the midgut lumen and yolk sac cavity normally are connected via the vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct, which is obliterated in the first trimester. Failure of vitelline duct obliteration results in a Meckel diverticulum, which is usually located in the ileum within 2 feet of the ileocecal valve. If symptomatic, a Meckel diverticulum often presents by age 2 (ie, rule of 2s); however, it can cause complications at any age.\n\nVarious ectopic (heterotopic) tissues (ie, misplaced but functionally normal cells) can be present within a Meckel diverticulum, including gastric, pancreatic, or colonic mucosa. The most common is gastric tissue, as seen in this patient. Because HYDROCHLORIC ACID secreted by gastric parietal cells causes ulceration and erosion of adjacent intestinal mucosa. Meckel diverticulum most commonly presents with brisk but painless lower GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING and ANEMIA (eg, fatigue, pallor).\n\n(Choices A and B) Anaplasia refers to poorly differentiated cells that have lost the characteristics of mature tissue; whereas dysplasia refers to disordered growth with loss of cell uniformity. Dysplasia can occur with benign and precancerous lesions, whereas anaplasia is indicative of malignant transformation.\n\n(Choice D) Hypertrophy is an increase in the size of the cells in a tissue or organ. It can be physiologic (eg, exercise-induced skeletal muscle growth) or pathologic (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).\n\n(Choice E) Metaplasia is an acquired transformation (ie, not present at birth) of one differentiated cell type to another differentiated cell type not typical for the location. For example, chronic reflux esophagitis can trigger the replacement of normal squamous epithelium in the distal esophagus with metaplastic columnar epithelium (ie, Barrett esophagus). In contrast, Meckel diverticulum is a congenital lesion.\n\nEducational objective:\nMeckel diverticulum is a congenital outpouching of the intestine that commonly contains ectopic (heterotopic) gastric mucosa. Hydrochloric acid production by gastric epithelium can lead to intestinal ulceration and subsequent lower gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者肠道憩室的组织学检查显示胃黏膜 {{exhibit_2}}。这一发现与 Meckel 憩室相符，Meckel 憩室是小肠最常见的先天性异常。\n\n在子宫内，中肠腔和卵黄囊腔通常通过卵黄管（脐肠管）相连，该管在妊娠早期被闭塞。卵黄管闭塞失败导致 Meckel 憩室，其通常位于回肠内，距离回盲瓣 2 英尺以内。如果出现症状，Meckel 憩室通常在2岁时出现（即，2 的法则）；然而，它可以在任何年龄引起并发症。\n\n各种异位（异位）组织（即，错位但功能正常的细胞）可以存在于 Meckel 憩室内，包括胃黏膜、胰腺黏膜或结肠黏膜。最常见的是胃组织，如本例患者所示。因为胃壁细胞分泌的盐酸会导致邻近肠黏膜的溃疡和侵蚀。Meckel 憩室最常见的表现是急性的但无痛的下消化道出血和贫血（例如，疲劳、苍白）。\n\n（选项A和B）间变是指分化不良的细胞，这些细胞已经失去了成熟组织的特征；而异型增生是指细胞生长紊乱，细胞均匀性丧失。异型增生可发生在良性和癌前病变中，而间变则提示恶性转化。\n\n（选项D）肥大是指组织或器官中细胞大小的增加。它可以是生理性的（例如，运动引起的骨骼肌生长）或病理性的（例如，肥厚型心肌病）。\n\n（选项E）化生是一种后天获得的转变（即，非出生时存在），即一种分化细胞类型转变为另一种与该位置不典型的分化细胞类型。例如，慢性反流性食管炎可以触发正常鳞状上皮细胞在远端食管中被化生性柱状上皮细胞（即，Barrett 食管）取代。相比之下，Meckel 憩室是一种先天性病变。\n\n教育目标：\nMeckel 憩室是肠道的先天性憩室，通常包含异位（异位）胃黏膜。胃上皮细胞产生的盐酸可导致肠道溃疡，继而导致下消化道出血和贫血。 {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Meckel diverticulum, a congenital anomaly, and its common presentation with ectopic gastric mucosa leading to gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia. It also tests the understanding of different pathological processes like anaplasia, dysplasia, ectopia, hypertrophy, and metaplasia.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's age, symptoms of anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding, and the presence of an intestinal outpouching with gastric mucosa. This points towards Meckel diverticulum, which involves ectopic tissue. Rule out other options based on their definitions and whether they are congenital or acquired.",
