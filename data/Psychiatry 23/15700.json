    "en": "A 24-year-old woman comes to the office due to recurrent episodes of chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath over the past few months. During some episodes, she experiences dizziness, diaphoresis, and paresthesias of the hands. The episodes last 5-10 minutes, and the patient constantly worries about when and where she will have another one. She says, \"This keeps happening and no one has been able to tell me why. I'm scared something might be seriously wrong with me.\" The patient has been to the emergency department twice in the past month for similar episodes; prior evaluation, including complete metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, arterial blood gas analysis, ECG, cardiac enzymes, and chest x-ray, showed no abnormalities. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is defined as a period of intense fear or discomfort that arises abruptly and reaches a peak within minutes, during which time four (or more) of the following symptoms occur: palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; sweating; trembling or shaking; sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; feelings of choking; chest pain or discomfort; nausea or abdominal distress; feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint; chills or heat sensations; paresthesias (numbness or tingling); feelings of unreality or being detached from oneself; fear of losing control or \"going crazy\"; or fear of dying. The patient's symptoms of chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, and paresthesias, lasting 5-10 minutes, are consistent with a panic attack. Her constant worry about future attacks and avoidance of situations where attacks might occur (implied by her distress and seeking medical attention) are also characteristic features. The negative medical workup further supports a diagnosis of panic disorder, as patients with panic disorder often present with somatic symptoms that are not explained by an underlying medical condition.\n\n(Choice A) Conversion disorder (also called functional neurological symptom disorder) involves the development of neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with a known neurological disease. While the patient experiences dizziness and paresthesias, these symptoms occur in the context of abrupt-onset, episodic cardiorespiratory symptoms, which are more characteristic of panic disorder.\n\n(Choice B) Factitious disorder involves intentionally falsifying symptoms to assume the sick role. There is no indication that this patient is fabricating her symptoms; rather, she is distressed by their recurrence and seeks an explanation.\n\n(Choice C) Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent worry about multiple issues (e.g., work, finances, health) that lasts for at least 6 months. While this patient has chronic anxiety related to her episodes, the primary issue is the discrete, intense panic attacks, not pervasive worry about multiple life domains.\n\n(Choice D) Illness anxiety disorder (formerly hypochondriasis) involves excessive worry about having or acquiring a serious illness, with few or no physical symptoms. This patient has multiple physical symptoms and is concerned that they are due to a medical illness because she has not received an accurate diagnosis, but the core issue is the panic attacks themselves, not just the worry about illness.\n\n(Choice F) Somatic symptom disorder involves one or more distressing somatic symptoms that are associated with excessive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to the symptoms. While this patient experiences somatic symptoms, the defining feature is the recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and the associated fear and worry about them, which is more specific to panic disorder. In somatic symptom disorder, the symptoms are often persistent and the focus is on the somatic symptoms themselves, whereas in panic disorder, the focus is on the panic attacks and the fear of having another one.",
    "zh": "惊恐障碍的特征是反复、非预期的惊恐发作。惊恐发作定义为一段突发且在几分钟内达到高峰的强烈恐惧或不适时期，在此期间，会发生以下四种（或更多）症状：心悸、心跳剧烈或心率加快；出汗；震颤或发抖；呼吸短促或窒息感；窒息感；胸痛或不适；恶心或腹部不适；头晕、站不稳、头昏眼花或晕厥；寒战或发热感；感觉异常（麻木或刺痛）；不真实感或与自己分离；害怕失去控制或“发疯”；或害怕死亡。 患者的胸痛、心悸、呼吸短促、头晕和感觉异常的症状，持续5-10分钟，与惊恐发作一致。她不断担心未来的发作以及避免可能发生发作的情况（通过她的痛苦和寻求医疗帮助暗示）也是其特征。阴性的医学检查结果进一步支持了惊恐障碍的诊断，因为患有惊恐障碍的患者通常会出现无法用潜在的医学疾病解释的躯体症状。\n\n（选项A） 转换障碍（也称为功能性神经症状障碍）涉及出现与已知神经系统疾病不一致的神经系统症状。虽然患者会出现头晕和感觉异常，但这些症状发生在突发、阵发性心肺症状的背景下，而这更符合惊恐障碍的特征。\n\n（选项B） 诈病涉及故意伪造症状以扮演病人角色。没有迹象表明该患者在伪造她的症状；相反，她对症状的反复出现感到痛苦并寻求解释。\n\n（选项C） 广泛性焦虑症的特征是对多个问题（例如，工作、财务、健康）的持续担忧，这种担忧至少持续6个月。虽然该患者有与她的发作相关的慢性焦虑，但主要问题是离散的、强烈的惊恐发作，而不是对多个生活领域的普遍担忧。\n\n（选项D） 疾病焦虑症（原称疑病症）涉及过度担心患有或获得严重疾病，几乎没有或没有身体症状。该患者有多种身体症状，并且担心这些症状是由于一种医学疾病引起的，因为她没有得到准确的诊断，但核心问题是惊恐发作本身，而不仅仅是担心疾病。\n\n（选项F） 躯体症状障碍涉及一种或多种令人痛苦的躯体症状，这些症状与过度思考、感觉和与这些症状相关的行为有关。虽然该患者经历了躯体症状，但决定性特征是反复、非预期的惊恐发作以及与之相关的恐惧和担忧，这更具体地针对惊恐障碍。在躯体症状障碍中，症状通常是持续存在的，重点在于躯体症状本身，而在惊恐障碍中，重点在于惊恐发作以及对再次发作的恐惧。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder and its differentiation from other anxiety-related disorders and somatic symptom disorders. It requires recognizing the characteristic symptoms of a panic attack, the associated fear and worry, and the importance of a negative medical workup.\n\nTo solve this question, one should first identify the core symptoms presented by the patient, which are recurrent episodes of chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, and paresthesias. Then, evaluate the duration and context of these episodes, noting the patient's fear and worry about future attacks. Finally, consider the differential diagnoses, particularly other anxiety disorders and somatic symptom disorders, and rule them out based on the specific diagnostic criteria.",
