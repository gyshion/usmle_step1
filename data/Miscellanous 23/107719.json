    "en": "Researchers are studying embryologic development of the eye. They observe reciprocal signaling interactions between the optic vesicle and surface ectoderm. The optic vesicle sends inductive signals to the surface ectoderm, resulting in its development into a lens. Reciprocally, the developing lens sends inductive signals to the optic vesicle, resulting in its development into the optic cup, which contributes to the retina. The differentiation of either structure cannot occur without this reciprocal signaling interaction. This type of embryologic signaling interaction also occurs between which of the following?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Organogenesis relies on coordinated embryologic signaling between tissues for normal development. RECIPROCAL INDUCTION is a type of signaling that occurs between two tissues; both must be present to induce normal development.\n\nEye development is an example of reciprocal induction, in which signaling molecules from the optic vesicle bind receptors on the surface ectoderm, which induces lens formation via various intracellular signal transduction pathways. The developing lens then acts as the inducer by signaling development of the optic vesicle into the optic cup.\n\nReciprocal induction also occurs between the METANEPHRIC BLASTEMA and the URETERIC BUD, which are embryologic structures that give rise to the mature kidneys and collecting system, respectively:\n\n*   The metanephric blastema induces formation of the ureteric bud, which then induces the metanephric blastema to condense and epithelialize.\n*   In sequential iterations, the metanephric blastema then induces the ureteric bud to branch and elongate into the renal collecting system and ureters, whereas the ureteric bud induces formation of segmented nephrons, ultimately forming mature renal parenchyma.\n\nNormal KIDNEY and URINARY TRACT development depends on this reciprocal interaction because neither the metanephric blastema nor the ureteric bud would develop normally if isolated from the other (eg, defects in ureteric bud branching can result in renal agenesis).\n\n(Choice A) The endoderm induces splanchnic mesoderm development into primitive endothelial cells that join together to form blood vessels; however, no reciprocal signaling exists from the splanchnic mesoderm to the endoderm.\n\n(Choice C) Neural crest cells differentiate into enteric ganglia in response to signaling from the foregut, but the foregut develops into the intestines independent of neural crest cells. For example, Hirschsprung disease is a disorder of neural crest cell migration characterized by a segment of aganglionic colon, although the intestine itself develops normally otherwise.\n\n(Choice D) Sertoli cells in the fetal testis signal primordial germ cells to develop into mature gametes (ie, sperm), but no reciprocal signaling exists from germ cells to Sertoli cells.\n\nEducational objective:\nReciprocal induction is a type of signaling that occurs between two tissues that requires both be present to induce normal development. Reciprocal induction occurs in development of the kidney (ie, between metanephric blastema and ureteric bud) and the eye (ie, between optic vesicle and surface ectoderm).",
    "zh": "器官发生依赖于组织间协调的胚胎信号传导来实现正常发育。相互诱导是发生在两种组织之间的一种信号传导类型；两者都必须存在才能诱导正常发育。\n\n眼睛的发育是相互诱导的一个例子，其中来自视泡的信号分子与表面外胚层上的受体结合，通过各种细胞内信号转导途径诱导晶状体形成。然后，发育中的晶状体通过信号传导将视泡发育为视杯，从而充当诱导物。\n\n相互诱导也发生在后肾胚基和输尿管芽之间，它们分别是产生成熟肾脏和收集系统的胚胎结构：\n\n*   后肾胚基诱导输尿管芽的形成，然后输尿管芽诱导后肾胚基凝结并上皮化。\n*   在连续的迭代中，后肾胚基随后诱导输尿管芽分支并延伸到肾脏收集系统和输尿管中，而输尿管芽诱导节段性肾单位的形成，最终形成成熟的肾实质。\n\n正常的肾脏和泌尿道发育依赖于这种相互作用，因为如果后肾胚基或输尿管芽彼此分离，则无法正常发育（例如，输尿管芽分支的缺陷会导致肾脏缺失）。\n\n（选项 A）内胚层诱导脏层中胚层发育为原始内皮细胞，这些细胞连接在一起形成血管；然而，没有来自脏层中胚层到内胚层的相互信号传导。\n\n（选项 C）神经嵴细胞响应于来自前肠的信号传导而分化为肠神经节，但前肠独立于神经嵴细胞而发育成肠。例如，先天性巨结肠病是一种神经嵴细胞迁移障碍，其特征在于一段无神经节的结肠，尽管肠本身的其他部位发育正常。\n\n（选项 D）胎儿睾丸中的支持细胞向原始生殖细胞发出信号，使其发育成成熟的配子（即精子），但没有来自生殖细胞到支持细胞的相互信号传导。\n\n教育目标：相互诱导是发生在两种组织之间的一种信号传导类型，它要求两者都存在才能诱导正常发育。相互诱导发生在肾脏（即，后肾胚基和输尿管芽之间）和眼睛（即，视泡和表面外胚层之间）的发育中。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of reciprocal induction in embryologic development, specifically identifying other organ systems where this type of signaling interaction is crucial for normal development, beyond the example of eye development provided.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall the key examples of reciprocal induction in embryogenesis and differentiate them from unidirectional signaling or other developmental processes.
