    "en": "Acute mesenteric ischemia is characterized by severe abdominal pain caused by sudden blockage of intestinal blood flow. Diagnosis can be made using abdominal CT angiography, which in this patient reveals an occluded superior mesenteric artery (likely due to atrial or ventricular thromboembolism given his irregular rhythm and reduced ejection fraction).\n\nImpaired intestinal blood flow in acute mesenteric ischemia leads to tissue ischemia, thereby creating an anaerobic environment that inhibits the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. As a result, NADH produced during glycolysis begins to accumulate, with relative depletion of NAD+ (a cofactor necessary for glycolysis).\n\nTo maintain limited ATP production, ischemic cells regenerate NAD+ by switching to anaerobic glycolysis:\n\n•\tThe high NADH/NAD+ ratio leads to regulatory inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase, thereby shunting pyruvate away from aerobic metabolism (ie, conversion to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrial matrix).\n\n•\tExcess NADH also stimulates lactate dehydrogenase (Choice B), which converts pyruvate to lactic acid, regenerating NAD+ in the process.\n\nWith significant tissue ischemia, lactate begins to accumulate in the circulation and can lead to lactic acidosis (ie, metabolic acidosis). In addition to lactic acidosis, untreated ischemia in patients with acute mesenteric ischemia can lead to intestinal necrosis, perforation/peritonitis, and sepsis.\n\n(Choices A and E) Enolase converts 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, which is subsequently metabolized by pyruvate kinase into pyruvate. Because these glycolytic reactions can take place under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, they are not affected by tissue ischemia.\n\n(Choice C) Pyruvate can also be converted to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase. This enzyme is involved in regeneration of glucose from pyruvate during the process of gluconeogenesis, which typically occurs in a fasted (not ischemic) state.\n\nEducational objective:\nImpaired intestinal blood flow (eg. acute mesenteric ischemia) creates an anaerobic environment that leads to an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio. This decreases activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (converts pyruvate → acetyl-CoA) while stimulating lactate dehydrogenase (converts pyruvate → lactate), shunting the metabolic fate of pyruvate toward lactate production. Patients with significant tissue ischemia are therefore at risk of lactic acidosis. {{exhibit_2}}",
