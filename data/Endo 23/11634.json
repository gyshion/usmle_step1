    "en": "A 68-year-old man reports myalgia and fatigue during a follow-up office visit. The patient has been taking high-intensity statin therapy since he had an acute myocardial infarction several weeks ago. His other medical problems include hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. On examination, there is mild generalized muscle tenderness. Serum creatine kinase level is 456 U/L. Vitamin D and TSH levels are within normal range. The patient's statin therapy is discontinued, and he is started on a medication that inhibits cholesterol absorption at the brush border of the small intestine. {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Ezetimibe reduces intestinal absorption of cholesterol by inhibiting the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) transporter protein, which transports dietary cholesterol from the gastrointestinal lumen into intestinal enterocytes. As a result, the total amount of dietary cholesterol reaching the liver decreases, lowering intrahepatocyte cholesterol levels. To compensate, the liver increases LDL receptor expression, which draws cholesterol out of the circulation. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) Bile acid sequestrants (eg, colesevelam) bind bile salts in the intestine, decreasing their reabsorption. Subsequent depletion of the bile acid pool causes upregulation of cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase, which converts cholesterol into bile acids.\n\n(Choice C) Fibrates activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha transcription factors, which leads to stimulation of lipoprotein lipase activity and a decrease in triglyceride levels.\n\n(Choice D) Nicotinic acid inhibits hepatic triglyceride synthesis, which in turn reduces the liver's availability to synthesize VLDL particles that are subsequently metabolized into LDL in the circulation.\n\n(Choice E) Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) increases degradation of hepatic LDL receptors. Alirocumab is a monoclonal antibody against PCSK9 that blocks this effect, resulting in increased availability of LDL receptors on hepatocyte membranes and subsequently increased clearance of LDL from the blood.\n\nEducational objective:\nEzetimibe reduces intestinal absorption of cholesterol. As a result, the amount of dietary cholesterol reaching the liver decreases. To compensate, the liver increases LDL receptor expression, which draws cholesterol out of the circulation. {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "依折麦布通过抑制Niemann-Pick C1样1 (NPC1L1) 转运蛋白来减少肠道对胆固醇的吸收，该转运蛋白将膳食胆固醇从胃肠腔转运到肠上皮细胞。因此，到达肝脏的膳食胆固醇总量减少，降低了肝细胞内胆固醇水平。为了代偿，肝脏增加了LDL受体的表达，从而将胆固醇从循环系统中吸出。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n(选项A) 胆汁酸螯合剂（如考来维仑）在肠道内结合胆汁盐，减少其再吸收。随后胆汁酸库的耗竭导致胆固醇7-α-羟化酶上调，该酶将胆固醇转化为胆汁酸。\n\n(选项C) 贝特类药物激活过氧化物酶体增殖物激活受体-α转录因子，这导致脂蛋白脂酶活性刺激并降低甘油三酯水平。\n\n(选项D) 烟酸抑制肝脏甘油三酯合成，进而减少肝脏合成VLDL颗粒的可用性，这些颗粒随后在循环中代谢为LDL。\n\n(选项E) 前蛋白转化酶枯草杆菌蛋白酶kexin 9 (PCSK9) 增加肝脏LDL受体的降解。阿利西单抗是一种针对PCSK9的单克隆抗体，可阻断这种作用，导致肝细胞膜上LDL受体可用性增加，随后增加血液中LDL的清除率。\n\n教育目标：\n依折麦布减少肠道对胆固醇的吸收。因此，到达肝脏的膳食胆固醇量减少。为了代偿，肝脏增加了LDL受体的表达，从而将胆固醇从循环系统中吸出。{{exhibit_3}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of lipid-lowering agents and their mechanisms of action, specifically focusing on ezetimibe and its role in inhibiting cholesterol absorption in the small intestine. It also requires understanding of the compensatory mechanisms that occur in response to reduced cholesterol absorption.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key information: the patient's statin therapy was discontinued due to myalgia, and a new medication was started to inhibit cholesterol absorption at the brush border of the small intestine. Recall that ezetimibe is the drug that specifically targets cholesterol absorption in the small intestine.",
