    "en": "A 24-year-old primigravid woman at 36 weeks gestation comes to the office due to light-headedness and nausea at bedtime. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated, and medical history is unremarkable. The patient takes folic acid daily but has been unable to tolerate oral iron. Blood pressure is 115/75 mm Hg when sitting, 110/70 mm Hg when standing, and 80/60 mm Hg when supine. Physical examination shows a uterus consistent in size with 36 weeks gestation.",

    "en": "Compression of the inferior vena cava (IVC) occurs in most pregnancies and begins when the gravid uterus reaches the level of the umbilicus (ie, 20 weeks gestation). The degree of obstruction is most prominent during the third trimester and is worse when the mother lies in the supine or right lateral decubitus position.\n\nIVC compression reduces venous return (ie, cardiac preload), which subsequently decreases cardiac output. Most patients compensate for this physiologic change with increased collateral flow primarily through the azygous vein (connecting the iliac veins to the superior vena cava), which completely bypasses the IVC and maintains venous return. Because of significant anatomic variation of the azygous vein, some lack this robust collateral circulation. These patients are particularly sensitive to the decrease in venous return occurring in the supine or right lateral decubitus position, a condition known as supine hypotension syndrome (or aortocaval compression syndrome).\n\nA significant drop in blood pressure can develop and/or heart rate can increase when patients with supine hypotension syndrome are placed in the supine position; corresponding symptoms include pallor, sweating, nausea, and light-headedness. In severe cases, loss of consciousness and even fetal demise can occur.\n\n(Choices B and E) Hemodilution is normal in pregnancy because of a relatively greater physiologic increase in plasma volume compared to red blood cell mass. Hemodilution may be increased in patients who cannot tolerate oral iron but is unlikely to significantly contribute to hypotension. True intravascular volume depletion is a common cause of hypotension, which worsens with standing and tends to improve with supine positioning (ie, orthostatic hypotension).\n\n(Choice C) Increased parasympathetic activity drives the hypotension that occurs with a vasovagal response. Such a response is typically triggered by emotional stress or prolonged standing but not by supine positioning.\n\n(Choice D) Peripheral arterial resistance is reduced beginning in early pregnancy due to rising progesterone levels. This causes a slight decrease in blood pressure but does not explain isolated supine hypotension.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients at >20 weeks gestation experience compression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus while in the supine or right lateral decubitus position. Without substantial collateral blood flow, the consequent reduction in venous return and cardiac output can cause severe hypotension (supine hypotension syndrome).",
    "zh": "在大多数妊娠中，下腔静脉 (IVC) 受压，当妊娠子宫到达脐水平（即孕20周）时开始。这种阻塞程度在妊娠晚期最为明显，当母亲仰卧或右侧卧位时会更糟。\n\nIVC受压降低静脉回流（即，心脏前负荷），进而降低心输出量。大多数患者通过增加侧支循环来代偿这种生理变化，主要是通过奇静脉（连接髂静脉到上腔静脉），该静脉完全绕过IVC并维持静脉回流。由于奇静脉的解剖变异很大，一些患者缺乏这种强大的侧支循环。这些患者对仰卧或右侧卧位时静脉回流的减少特别敏感，这种情况被称为仰卧位低血压综合征（或主动脉腔静脉压迫综合征）。\n\n当仰卧位低血压综合征患者处于仰卧位时，血压会显著下降和/或心率会增加；相应的症状包括苍白、出汗、恶心和头晕。在严重情况下，可能出现意识丧失甚至胎儿死亡。\n\n（选项B和E）由于血浆容量的生理性增加相对于红细胞质量更大，因此妊娠期血液稀释是正常的。不能耐受口服铁剂的患者，血液稀释可能增加，但不太可能显著导致低血压。真正的血管内容量减少是低血压的常见原因，站立时会恶化，仰卧位时趋于改善（即，直立性低血压）。\n\n（选项C）副交感神经活性增加驱动与血管迷走神经反应相关的低血压。这种反应通常由情绪压力或长时间站立触发，而不是仰卧位。\n\n（选项D）由于孕酮水平升高，外周动脉阻力在妊娠早期开始降低。这会导致血压略有下降，但不能解释孤立的仰卧位低血压。\n\n教学目标：\n孕>20周的患者在仰卧或右侧卧位时，妊娠子宫会压迫下腔静脉。如果没有足够的侧支血流，静脉回流和心输出量的减少会导致严重的低血压（仰卧位低血压综合征）。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of supine hypotension syndrome, a common condition in late pregnancy caused by the gravid uterus compressing the inferior vena cava. It assesses the ability to correlate patient presentation with the underlying pathophysiology.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the patient's gestational age and position associated with hypotension. Recall the anatomical changes in late pregnancy that lead to decreased venous return and cardiac output when supine, and differentiate this from other causes of hypotension.",
