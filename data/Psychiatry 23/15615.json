    "en": "A 31-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by the police after he assaulted a stranger who he thought was following him. The police report indicates that when the patient was arrested, he was shouting, \"You don't understand. I'm the one who needs protection—the Russians are after my secrets!\" In the emergency department, the patient is diaphoretic and tremulous. He is very easily distracted and cannot give a clear history. {{exhibit_1}} Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 164/102 mm Hg, and pulse is 112/min with a normal rhythm. Extraocular movements are intact, and the pupils are dilated. His speech is loud, rapid, and difficult to interrupt. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions, paranoia), pressured speech, and signs of sympathetic stimulation (eg, diaphoresis, tremulousness, tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis) are most consistent with cocaine intoxication. In high doses, cocaine and other stimulants (eg, methamphetamine) may cause paranoid delusions that are often indistinguishable from those found in primary psychotic disorders (eg, schizophrenia). Auditory, visual, or tactile hallucinations (eg, insects crawling under the skin) may also occur. Patients under the influence of stimulants frequently exhibit euphoria, hyperactivity, agitation, and grandiosity that may resemble an acute manic episode.\n(Choice A) Anticholinergic toxicity may cause tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis, and psychosis. However, anticholinergic toxicity is characterized by both dry skin and mucous membranes rather than diaphoresis and presents with other classic anticholinergic effects (eg, urinary retention, decreased bowel sounds, hyperthermia).\n(Choice B) Dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and tremors are not expected in a primary manic episode of bipolar disorder. A diagnosis of bipolar disorder cannot be made if there is evidence that symptoms can be attributed to the physiological effects of a substance (eg, cocaine).\n(Choices D and G) Delusional disorder is characterized by ≥1 delusions lasting for ≥1 month that are not accompanied by other psychotic symptoms. Schizophreniform disorder may be diagnosed in patients who meet symptomatic criteria for schizophrenia for >1 month and <6 months. Neither diagnosis explains this patient's physical findings.\n(Choice E) Opioid withdrawal presents with gastrointestinal distress (eg, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramping), myalgias, mydriasis, piloerection, and lacrimation. Psychotic features are not seen.\n(Choice F) Phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication may cause psychotic symptoms and violent behavior. It typically presents with prominent nystagmus, a finding notably absent in this patient.",
    "zh": "该患者的精神病性症状（如，妄想、偏执）、言语快速、交感神经兴奋体征（如，出汗、震颤、心动过速、高血压、瞳孔散大）与可卡因中毒最为一致。高剂量时，可卡因和其他兴奋剂（如甲基苯丙胺）可引起偏执性妄想，通常与原发性精神病性疾病（如精神分裂症）中的妄想难以区分。也可能出现听觉、视觉或触觉幻觉（如，皮肤下爬虫）。在兴奋剂影响下的患者经常表现出欣快感、多动、激动和夸大，可能类似于急性躁狂发作。\n（选项A）抗胆碱能毒性可引起心动过速、高血压、瞳孔散大和精神病。然而，抗胆碱能毒性的特征是皮肤和粘膜干燥，而不是出汗，并伴有其他典型的抗胆碱能作用（如，尿潴留、肠蠕动音减弱、体温过高）。\n（选项B）在双相情感障碍的原发性躁狂发作中，不会出现瞳孔散大、出汗和震颤。如果存在证据表明症状可归因于物质的生理效应（如，可卡因），则不能诊断为双相情感障碍。\n（选项D和G）妄想症的特征是≥1个妄想持续≥1个月，且未伴有其他精神病性症状。对于符合精神分裂症症状标准的患者，可诊断为分裂样精神障碍，病程>1个月且<6个月。这两种诊断都无法解释该患者的体征。\n（选项E）阿片类药物戒断表现为胃肠道不适（如，恶心、腹泻、腹部绞痛）、肌痛、瞳孔散大、竖毛和流泪。未见精神病性特征。\n（选项F）苯环利定 (PCP) 中毒可引起精神病性症状和暴力行为。它通常表现为明显的眼球震颤，而该患者并未出现这一发现。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "The patient presents with psychotic symptoms, paranoia, pressured speech, diaphoresis, tremulousness, tachycardia, hypertension, and dilated pupils. These findings are most consistent with cocaine intoxication, as stimulants can induce paranoid delusions and signs of sympathetic stimulation. Other diagnoses are less likely due to the absence of specific symptoms or the presence of contradictory findings.",
    "zh": "患者出现精神病性症状、偏执、言语快速、出汗、震颤、心动过速、高血压和瞳孔散大。这些发现与可卡因中毒最为一致，因为兴奋剂可诱发偏执性妄想和交感神经兴奋体征。由于缺乏特异性症状或存在矛盾的发现，其他诊断的可能性较小。"
