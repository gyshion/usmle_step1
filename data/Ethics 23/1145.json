  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "In this case, the physician has just delivered serious news and must respond sensitively to a crying patient. The most appropriate response is to acknowledge the patient's distress, express empathy, and allow the patient time to process the news. The patient should be allowed to cry without redirection of the conversation or assumption about how much information she wants to know at this point. Once the patient is able to converse, the physician can gently explore her feelings and respond to any questions, allowing the patient to take the lead in the discussion (eg, ask the patient how much information she would like to know at this point).\n\nModels have been developed to guide clinicians in delivering serious news. The SPIKES protocol, originally developed for cancer patients, can be adapted to conversations with patients in many situations (eg, medical futility discussion, STI results).\n\n(Choice A) This response immediately redirects the focus of the visit to discussion of results and does not allow the patient time to process the news and express her emotions. Instead, the physician should follow the patient's lead and answer any questions that arise.\n\n(Choice C) This response prematurely redirects the visit to discussing the patient's support system rather than allowing the patient to express her emotions and immediate needs.\n\n(Choice D) This statement uses optimism and reassurance by changing the focus to recent advances in treatment. This may have the unintended consequence of discouraging the patient from expressing her emotions and fears about the illness. After acknowledging the patient's emotions, it is preferable to gently explore how much she wants to know about the diagnosis and treatment options at this point.\n\n(Choice E) This response makes the inappropriate assumption that the patient is not ready or does not want to receive additional information during this visit. Instead, the patient should be allowed to express the full range of her emotions and invited to ask any questions. Depending on her response, the physician can educate her about the condition and her options.",
    "zh": "在这种情况下，医生刚刚传达了坏消息，必须对哭泣的患者做出敏感的回应。最合适的回答是承认患者的痛苦，表达同情，并允许患者有时间处理这个消息。应该允许患者哭泣，而不要转移谈话的方向，也不要假设她想知道多少信息。一旦患者能够交谈，医生可以温和地探索她的感受并回答任何问题，让患者在讨论中占据主导地位（例如，询问患者她想知道多少信息）。\n\n已经开发出一些模型来指导临床医生传递坏消息。最初为癌症患者开发的SPIKES协议可以适用于许多情况下的患者对话（例如，医疗无用讨论，性传播感染结果）。\n\n(选项A) 这种回应立即将访问的重点转移到讨论结果，不允许患者有时间处理这个消息和表达她的情绪。相反，医生应该跟随患者的引导，回答出现的任何问题。\n\n(选项C) 这种回应过早地将访问转移到讨论患者的支持系统，而不是让患者表达她的情绪和直接需求。\n\n(选项D) 这种陈述使用乐观和安慰的方式，将重点转移到最近的治疗进展。这可能会产生意想不到的后果，即阻止患者表达她对疾病的情绪和恐惧。在承认患者的情绪之后，最好是温和地探索她在这个时候想知道多少关于诊断和治疗方案的信息。\n\n(选项E) 这种回应作出了不恰当的假设，即患者还没有准备好或不想在这次访问中接收额外的信息。相反，应该允许患者表达她所有的情绪，并邀请她提出任何问题。根据她的回应，医生可以向她介绍病情和她的选择。"
