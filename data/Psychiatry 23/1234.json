He has no medical symptoms but says, \"I'm just feeling stressed and not like myself.\" The patient is going through a contentious divorce. He is outraged that his wife is pursuing full custody of their children and says, \"I can't believe she is doing this to me.\" His job as a legal researcher had been a welcome distraction from his upsetting personal life until yesterday when he was called to his supervisor's office for yelling at the receptionist when the copy machine ran out of ink.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's redirection of his anger from his wife to the receptionist is an example of the defense mechanism DISPLACEMENT. In displacement, emotions are unconsciously TRANSFERRED from their actual target to someone or something else that is LESS threatening. In this case, the patient is angry with his wife but cannot express it directly as it may impact the child custody proceedings. Instead, he unconsciously transfers the emotion to the receptionist, resulting in his angry outburst over a minor incident.\n\n(Choice A) Acting out refers to the expression of unacceptable thoughts or impulses through actions (eg, if this patient were to react to his wife's pursuit of full custody by vandalizing her car).\n(Choice B) In denial, an individual avoids awareness of external realities that are difficult to face (eg, if this patient were to insist that his marriage is conflict-free).\n(Choice D) In intellectualization, an individual focuses on nonemotional aspects of a distressing situation to make it more tolerable (eg, if this patient were solely preoccupied with thinking about the legal, not the emotional, aspects of his divorce).\n(Choice E) Reaction formation involves transforming unacceptable feelings into their opposite (eg, if this patient, who is angry at his wife, were to act in an overly loving manner toward her).\n(Choice F) Splitting involves experiencing the self or others in extremes, either positive or negative, which allows \"bad\" qualities to be completely separated from the \"good\" (eg, if this patient were to view his wife as a horrible person with no redeeming qualities).\n(Choice G) Sublimation involves transforming unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable behaviors (eg, if this patient were to take up boxing as a means of venting frustration).\n\nEducational objective:\nIn displacement, emotions are transferred from the person causing the negative emotions to a more neutral, less threatening person or object.",
    "zh": "该患者将对妻子的愤怒转移到接待员身上，是防御机制“移置”的一个例子。在移置中，情绪会无意识地从实际目标转移到其他不那么具有威胁性的人或事物上。在这种情况下，患者对妻子感到愤怒，但无法直接表达，因为这可能会影响孩子的监护权诉讼。相反，他无意识地将情绪转移到接待员身上，导致他因为一件小事而愤怒爆发。\n\n（选项A）行动化是指通过行动表达不可接受的想法或冲动（例如，如果该患者对妻子追求全部监护权的回应是破坏她的汽车）。\n（选项B）在否认中，个体避免意识到难以面对的外部现实（例如，如果该患者坚持认为他的婚姻没有冲突）。\n（选项D）在理智化中，个体专注于令人痛苦的情况的非情绪性方面，使其更易于忍受（例如，如果该患者只专注于思考离婚的法律方面，而不是情绪方面）。\n（选项E）反向形成包括将不可接受的情绪转化为其对立面（例如，如果该患者对妻子感到愤怒，却对她表现出过分友好的方式）。\n（选项F）分裂是指以极端方式体验自己或他人，要么积极，要么消极，这允许将“坏”品质与“好”品质完全分开（例如，如果该患者将妻子视为一个没有优点的可怕的人）。\n（选项G）升华包括将不可接受的冲动转化为社会可接受的行为（例如，如果该患者开始练习拳击作为发泄挫败感的一种方式）。\n\n教育目标：\n在移置中，情绪会从导致负面情绪的人转移到更中立、威胁性更小的人或物体上。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of defense mechanisms, specifically identifying displacement as the mechanism by which a patient redirects anger from its original source to a less threatening target. It requires differentiating displacement from other common defense mechanisms like acting out, denial, intellectualization, reaction formation, splitting, and sublimation.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully analyzing the patient's situation, identifying the source of his distress and anger, and then determining where that anger was ultimately directed. By comparing the patient's behavior to the definitions of various defense mechanisms, the most appropriate explanation can be selected.",
