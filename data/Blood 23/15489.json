    "en": "An 18-year-old man with a history of recurrent hemarthroses and severe mucosal bleeding due to hemophilia A comes to the office for follow-up. He has had occasional breakthrough bleeding despite receiving prophylactic factor VIII infusions. Testing reveals the patient now has inhibitor alloantibodies against factor VIII, and factor replacement products can no longer be used. Treatment with a novel medication that prevents bleeding by mimicking the function of factor VIII is initiated.",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Hemophilia A is an X-linked, recessive bleeding disorder caused by mutations to the gene that encodes clotting factor VIII. Factor VIII is part of the intrinsic coagulation cascade; it acts as a bridging protein that brings together the catalytic component of factor IXa (the protease) with factor X (the substrate), thereby amplifying formation of factor Xa, which promotes fibrin clots.\n\nPatients with hemophilia A have severe reductions in factor VIII and are unable to form fibrin clots at sites of minor trauma, leading to potentially life-threatening hemarthroses and mucosal bleeding. Treatment with factor VIII replacement products (eg, factor VIII concentrate from plasma) can prevent or treat bleeding in these patients. However, long-term efficacy is often limited by the formation of neutralizing antibodies (factor VIII inhibitors).\n\nEmicizumab, a bispecific monoclonal antibody, mimics the normal physiologic function of factor VIII and can be used to prevent or treat bleeding in patients who have factor VIII inhibitors. This antibody has 2 binding sites; one site binds to factor IXa and the other binds to factor X, which brings them into close proximity {{exhibit_1}} and allows factor IXa to cleave factor X into its active form (Xa).\n\n(Choice A) Von Willebrand factor, a large glycoprotein produced by the endothelium, aids platelet clot formation by binding platelets to subendothelial collagen at sites of injury. It is also a carrier protein for factor VIII; therefore, patients with Von Willebrand factor deficiency often have mild or moderate reductions in factor VIII. However, serious bleeding (eg, hemarthroses) is very uncommon.\n\n(Choice B) Activation of factor X to Xa can also occur via the extrinsic (tissue factor pathway) in response to tissue trauma. In this case, factor VIIa in combination with tissue factor activates factor X. This pathway does not require factor VIII and is unaffected in those with hemophilia A.\n\n(Choice C) Ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers produced by the endothelium are cleaved to smaller subunits by the metalloprotease ADAMTS13. Loss of ADAMTS13 activity leads to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\n(Choice D) Factor XIIIa cross-links loose fibrin molecules into a dense network, thereby forming stable fibrin clots. Factor XIIIa is unaffected in those with hemophilia A.",
    "zh": "血友病A是一种X连锁隐性出血性疾病，由编码凝血因子VIII的基因突变引起。凝血因子VIII是内源性凝血级联反应的一部分；它充当桥接蛋白，将凝血因子IXa（蛋白酶）的催化成分与凝血因子X（底物）结合在一起，从而增强凝血因子Xa的形成，进而促进纤维蛋白凝块的形成。\n\n血友病A患者的凝血因子VIII严重减少，无法在轻微创伤部位形成纤维蛋白凝块，从而导致可能危及生命的关节积血和黏膜出血。使用凝血因子VIII替代产品（例如，来自血浆的凝血因子VIII浓缩物）可以预防或治疗这些患者的出血。然而，长期疗效常常受到中和抗体（凝血因子VIII抑制剂）形成的限制。\n\nEmicizumab是一种双特异性单克隆抗体，它模拟凝血因子VIII的正常生理功能，可用于预防或治疗凝血因子VIII抑制剂患者的出血。这种抗体有两个结合位点；一个位点与凝血因子IXa结合，另一个位点与凝血因子X结合，使它们紧密靠近 {{exhibit_1}}，并允许凝血因子IXa将凝血因子X切割成其活性形式（Xa）。\n\n(选项A) 血管性血友病因子，一种由内皮细胞产生的大型糖蛋白，通过将血小板与损伤部位的内皮下胶原结合来帮助血小板凝块的形成。它也是凝血因子VIII的载体蛋白；因此，血管性血友病因子缺乏症患者通常有轻度或中度的凝血因子VIII减少。然而，严重出血（例如，关节积血）非常罕见。\n\n(选项B) 凝血因子X激活为Xa也可以通过外源性（组织因子途径）在组织损伤后发生。在这种情况下，凝血因子VIIa与组织因子结合激活凝血因子X。该途径不需要凝血因子VIII，并且不受血友病A患者的影响。\n\n(选项C) 内皮细胞产生的超大血管性血友病因子多聚体被金属蛋白酶ADAMTS13切割成较小的亚基。ADAMTS13活性丧失会导致血栓性血小板减少性紫癜。\n\n(选项D) 凝血因子XIIIa将松散的纤维蛋白分子交联成致密网络，从而形成稳定的纤维蛋白凝块。凝血因子XIIIa不受血友病A患者的影响。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hemophilia A pathophysiology and the mechanism of action of emicizumab, a bispecific antibody used to treat hemophilia A patients with factor VIII inhibitors. Emicizumab mimics factor VIII function by binding factors IXa and X, bringing them into close proximity to facilitate factor X activation.\n\nThe key to solving this question is understanding that factor VIII acts as a bridge between factors IXa and X in the coagulation cascade. Emicizumab mimics this function, so the correct answer must involve linking these two factors. Eliminate options that do not relate to factor VIII's role in the intrinsic coagulation pathway.",
