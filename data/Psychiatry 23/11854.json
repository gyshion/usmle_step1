    "en": "A 28-year-old man comes to the office due to persistent fatigue. For the past several weeks, he has been having trouble sleeping and is frequently late for work as he has difficulty getting out of bed. At work, his mind wanders, and his supervisor has commented that the quality of his work has deteriorated. The patient says, \"I've been feeling down and don't feel like doing anything. My appetite is poor. I no longer go out with my friends and haven't gone to the gym in weeks.\" The patient has no significant medical or psychiatric history. He has 1 or 2 alcoholic drinks several days a week but does not use illicit drugs. Routine laboratory evaluation, including thyroid function tests and serum B12 level, is normal. Physical examination is unremarkable. Mental status examination shows a cooperative man with sad affect. No delusions are elicited. The patient says he sometimes wishes he could \"go to sleep and not wake up,\" but has no suicidal intent or plan. First-line pharmacotherapy for this patient most likely involves a drug with which of the following mechanisms of action? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient's several-week history of depressed mood, loss of interest, fatigue, impaired sleep, poor concentration and appetite, and thoughts of death is consistent with major depressive disorder. The major neurotransmitters involved in the pathophysiology of depression are thought to be serotonin and norepinephrine (and dopamine to a lesser extent). Most available antidepressant medications affect serotonin or both serotonin and norepinephrine at the synapse. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered first-line antidepressants that work by inhibiting the serotonin transporter (SERT) protein, which is normally responsible for transporting serotonin out of the synaptic cleft back into the presynaptic neuron. The inhibition of SERT prevents the normal reuptake of serotonin, resulting in increased availability of serotonin in the synaptic cleft. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者数周的抑郁情绪史、兴趣丧失、疲劳、睡眠障碍、注意力不集中和食欲不振以及死亡念头，与重度抑郁症相符。 参与抑郁症病理生理学的主要神经递质被认为是5-羟色胺和去甲肾上腺素（以及多巴胺，程度较轻）。 大多数现有的抗抑郁药物影响突触处的5-羟色胺或5-羟色胺和去甲肾上腺素。 选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂 (SSRIs) 被认为是 一线抗抑郁药，通过抑制5-羟色胺转运蛋白 (SERT) 发挥作用，SERT 通常负责将5-羟色胺从突触间隙转运回突触前神经元。抑制 SERT 可防止5-羟色胺的正常再摄取，从而导致突触间隙中5-羟色胺的可用性增加。{{exhibit_2}}"
