    "en": "An 80-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his son due to acute shortness of breath. The patient reports a chronic cough and a 13.6-kg (30-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. Chest x-ray demonstrates a large mass in the right lung and an associated pleural effusion. The patient is hospitalized and undergoes bronchoscopy with biopsy; the pathology report comes back as bronchogenic carcinoma. When the physician initiates a private discussion about the biopsy results, the patient says, \"I prefer not to be told anything. You can discuss everything with my son. I trust his judgment.\" The patient is cognitively intact without signs of mental illness. Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Patients have the right to preemptively refuse to receive medical information. This patient has expressed a clear preference and has the capacity to make health care decisions. It is important to respect his wishes by withholding the information. In this case, respecting PATIENT AUTONOMY means respecting his decision not to know and to defer decision-making to his son.\n\nReasons for refusing to receive medical information are varied and complex and include PERSONAL VALUES (eg, fatalism), psychological concerns (eg, fears of bad news and mortality), and CULTURAL BELIEFS (eg, cultural preference for the family to make treatment decisions). In some cultures, direct disclosure of a serious illness to a family elder may be considered unnecessarily cruel or disrespectful, and it is customary for family members to make health care decisions for the patient. Other cultural reasons for nondisclosure include the belief that open discussion may cause unnecessary anxiety, depression, or hopelessness or that speaking aloud about a condition makes death or terminal illness more certain. Physicians should respond to different individual and cultural values with an open, sensitive approach that conveys respect for the preferences of the patient and family.\n\n(Choice A) This statement may be perceived as judgmental and impair rapport. A patient has no obligation to hear the results of an intervention and has the right to refuse procedures or information at any time.\n\n(Choices B and E) The patient has decision-making capacity, and his preference not to be informed should be respected. Questioning the patient's decision and consulting with the chaplain or the patient's son are not necessary and may be perceived as disrespectful.\n\n(Choice C) This response puts pressure on the patient to accept the information when he has clearly stated that he does not want to know.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients have the right to refuse to receive medical information for individual or cultural reasons. In some cultures, family members may make health care decisions to avoid perceived harm, disrespect, or mental distress caused by direct disclosure to the patient.",
    "zh": "患者有权预先拒绝接收医疗信息。该患者表达了明确的偏好，并有能力做出医疗保健决定。通过不提供信息来尊重他的意愿非常重要。在这种情况下，尊重患者自主权意味着尊重他不希望知道并将其决定权交给儿子的决定。\n\n拒绝接收医疗信息的原因是多种多样的，包括个人价值观（例如，宿命论）、心理问题（例如，害怕坏消息和死亡率）和文化信仰（例如，文化上倾向于由家庭做出治疗决定）。在某些文化中，直接向家庭长辈披露严重疾病可能被认为是不必要的残酷或不尊重，由家庭成员为患者做出医疗保健决定是惯例。不披露的其他文化原因包括，认为公开讨论可能导致不必要的焦虑、抑郁或绝望，或者大声谈论病情会使死亡或终末期疾病更加确定。医生应以开放、敏感的方式回应不同的个人和文化价值观，传达对患者及其家属偏好的尊重。\n\n（选项A）这种说法可能被认为是带有评判性质的，并损害医患关系。患者没有义务听取干预的结果，并且有权随时拒绝接受程序或信息。\n\n（选项B和E）患者具有决策能力，应尊重其不被告知的偏好。质疑患者的决定并咨询牧师或患者的儿子是不必要的，并且可能被认为是不尊重的。\n\n（选项C）当患者明确表示他不想知道时，这种回应会给患者施加压力，要求其接受信息。\n\n教育目标：\n患者有权以个人或文化原因拒绝接收医疗信息。在某些文化中，家庭成员可能会做出医疗保健决定，以避免因直接向患者披露而造成的感知到的伤害、不尊重或精神困扰。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ethical principle of patient autonomy and the right of a patient to refuse medical information, even if it is about their own health. It also touches on cultural considerations in healthcare decision-making.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the option that most directly respects the patient's stated wishes and avoids pressuring them to receive information they do not want. Recognize that the patient has the right to make their own decisions, even if those decisions seem counterintuitive.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了患者自主权的伦理原则以及患者拒绝医疗信息的权利，即使这些信息与他们自己的健康有关。它还涉及医疗保健决策中的文化考量。\n\n最好的方法是找出最直接尊重患者声明意愿并避免强迫他们接受他们不希望的信息的选项。认识到患者有权做出自己的决定，即使这些决定看起来违反直觉。"
