    "en": "Menopause is defined by the permanent cessation of menses for 12 months and is a normal event of aging caused by exhaustion of ovarian follicles. The mean age of menopause in the United States is 51. Ovarian failure before age 35 is considered premature. During the menopausal transition, FSH levels increase due to resistant ovarian follicles and lack of feedback from inhibin. Absence of menstrual cycles with associated hypoestrogenic symptoms (eg, hot flashes, vaginal dryness) is highly suggestive of menopause. Menopause is typically diagnosed clinically. However, if the diagnosis is unclear, an elevated serum FSH level can be used for diagnosis as it is a reliable early indicator. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nCyclic and continuous oral contraceptive (OC) regimens are not associated with irregular menses or amenorrhea, and premenopausal patients who stop taking OCs should expect spontaneous return of menses. This patient's age and vaginal dryness make menopausal transition the most likely cause of amenorrhea. OCs may mask vasomotor symptoms that are typical of menopausal transition, and the patient was likely having iatrogenic withdrawal bleeding.\n\n(Choice A) A urine pregnancy test should be performed for any female of reproductive age with amenorrhea. A negative test is a reliable indicator that the patient is not pregnant. Serum β-hCG testing is indicated in cases when the absolute value of the β-hCG would aid in diagnosis and treatment, such as in ectopic or molar pregnancies.\n\n(Choices B and D) Estradiol and progesterone levels gradually decrease during the menopausal transition due to decreasing ovarian function. Serum estradiol measurement is not a reliable indicator of menopause due to typical fluctuations and gradual decline. After menopause, estrone is produced outside the ovaries and replaces estradiol as the predominant circulating estrogen.\n\n(Choice E) Serum prolactin levels are much less significantly changed during menopause than are FSH levels. Amenorrhea due to a prolactinoma would be diagnosed by detecting an elevated prolactin level. Additional symptoms can include galactorrhea and headache, which this patient does not have.\n\nEducational objective:\nMenopause occurs on average at age 51 and is diagnosable retrospectively after 12 months of amenorrhea. An elevated serum FSH level confirms the diagnosis.",
    "zh": "更年期的定义是月经永久停止12个月，是由于卵巢卵泡耗竭而引起的正常衰老事件。美国更年期的平均年龄为51岁。35岁之前出现卵巢功能衰竭被认为是过早的。在更年期过渡期间，由于卵巢卵泡的抵抗和抑制素缺乏反馈，FSH水平升高。月经周期缺失，伴有低雌激素症状（如潮热、阴道干燥），高度提示更年期。更年期通常通过临床诊断。但是，如果诊断不明确，可以使用血清FSH水平升高来诊断，因为它是一个可靠的早期指标。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n周期性和持续性口服避孕药 (OC) 方案与月经不规律或闭经无关，停用 OC 的绝经前患者应预期月经会自发恢复。该患者的年龄和阴道干燥使更年期过渡成为闭经最可能的原因。OC 可能会掩盖更年期过渡的典型血管舒缩症状，并且患者很可能出现医源性撤退性出血。\n\n（选项 A）对于任何育龄期闭经的女性都应进行尿妊娠试验。阴性结果是患者未怀孕的可靠指标。在 β-hCG 的绝对值有助于诊断和治疗的情况下，应进行血清 β-hCG 检测，例如在宫外孕或葡萄胎的情况下。\n\n（选项 B 和 D）由于卵巢功能下降，在更年期过渡期间，雌二醇和孕酮水平逐渐降低。血清雌二醇测量不是更年期的可靠指标，因为它具有典型的波动和逐渐下降。更年期后，雌酮在卵巢外产生，取代雌二醇成为主要的循环雌激素。\n\n（选项 E）在更年期，血清催乳素水平的变化远没有 FSH 水平变化那么显著。由于催乳素瘤引起的闭经将通过检测催乳素水平升高来诊断。其他症状可能包括溢乳和头痛，但该患者没有这些症状。\n\n教育目标：\n更年期平均发生在51岁，在闭经12个月后可以回顾性诊断。血清FSH水平升高证实了诊断。"
