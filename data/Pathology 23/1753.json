She has had several sexual partners and takes oral contraceptive pills for birth control. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination, including pelvic examination, is normal. A Pap test is performed and shows a squamous intraepithelial lesion that is positive for human papillomavirus. A cervical biopsy is performed and reveals low-grade dysplasia.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of the cervical squamous epithelium can lead to dysplasia (ie, CERVICAL INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA [CIN]), a premalignant lesion. Squamous dysplasia is characterized by a breakdown in the normal, organized progression from tall cells in the basal layer to flattened cells on the epithelial surface. Individual dysplastic cells are often pleomorphic (ie, differing in shape and size), have enlarged and hyperchromatic (ie, dark staining) nuclei, and are associated with numerous mitotic figures (normally found only in the basal layer). The grade of CIN describes the degree of epithelial disruption:\n\nLow-grade CIN: Dysplasia involves the lower third of the epithelium (ie, CIN 1)\nHigh-grade CIN: Dysplasia has advanced beyond the lower third of the epithelium (sometimes involving the entire thickness) but does not penetrate the basement membrane (ie, CIN 2 or 3)\nIn contrast to malignancy (eg, invasive carcinoma), dysplastic changes (if mild to moderate) may reverse when the causal factor is withdrawn. Most cases of low-grade CIN regress spontaneously once the HPV infection is cleared by the immune system. {{exhibit_1}}\n(Choices A, B, C, D, and E) Abundant mitoses, disordered maturation, loss of cell polarity, nuclear abnormalities, and pleomorphism can be seen in both dysplasia and invasive carcinoma.\n\nEducational objective:\nDysplasia, characterized by the disruption of organized epithelial cell differentiation with atypical cells, does not always progress to malignancy. Mild to moderate dysplastic changes may reverse when the causal factor is withdrawn.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cervical dysplasia and how it differs from cervical malignancy. The key difference is that dysplasia, particularly low-grade dysplasia, can be reversible, whereas malignancy is not.\n\nTo solve this question, understand the characteristics of dysplasia and malignancy. Focus on the reversibility aspect of dysplasia as the distinguishing feature from malignancy.",
