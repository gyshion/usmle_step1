    "en": "A research scientist is studying biochemical reactions that take place in the liver. He cultures hepatocytes in a growth media enriched with glutamate labeled with nitrogen isotopes. After some time, he finds that the nitrogen isotopes are transferred to oxaloacetate, forming aspartate in the process.",

    "en": "PYRIDOXINE (vitamin B6) is necessary for the transamination and decarboxylation of amino acids, for gluconeogenesis, and for other essential biochemical processes. TRANSMINATION reactions typically occur between an AMINO ACID and an α-KETO ACID. The amino group is transferred to the α-keto acid from the amino acid, and the α-keto acid thereby becomes an amino acid. For example, glutamate (amino acid) reacts with oxaloacetate (α-keto acid) to form aspartate (the resulting amino acid) and α-ketoglutarate (the resulting α-keto acid). Transaminases (aminotransferases) are the enzymes that catalyze transamination reactions, and pyridoxal phosphate (active vitamin B6) serves as an essential cofactor for the transaminase.",
    "zh": "吡哆醇（维生素B6）是氨基酸转氨和脱羧、糖异生以及其他必需生化过程所必需的。转氨反应通常发生在氨基酸和α-酮酸之间。氨基从氨基酸转移到α-酮酸，α-酮酸从而变成氨基酸。例如，谷氨酸（氨基酸）与草酰乙酸（α-酮酸）反应形成天冬氨酸（生成的氨基酸）和α-酮戊二酸（生成的α-酮酸）。转氨酶（氨基转移酶）是催化转氨反应的酶，吡哆醛磷酸盐（活性维生素B6）作为转氨酶的必需辅酶。"
