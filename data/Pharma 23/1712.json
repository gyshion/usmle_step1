    "en": "The rate and extent of drug metabolism normally varies from person to person. These slight interpersonal variations in the ability to metabolize drugs are typically reflected graphically by a unimodal distribution, usually in the shape of a bell curve, when plasma levels of drug are measured at a fixed time following a fixed dose of drug. This is the method that was used to generate the graph given in the question stem. With most drugs, the majority of people fall within one standard deviation and 95% of people fall within two standard deviations of the population mean of plasma concentration. A single peak in this type of graph indicates that the population being tested possesses a similar genetic drug metabolizing capacity.\n\nA bimodal (discontinuous, polymorphic) curve, as shown in the question stem, results from the presence of two apparently distinct groups within the study population and suggests a pharmacogenetic polymorphism in drug metabolizing capacity. In other words, the two peaks indicate two sets of responders to the drug within the population: one that rapidly converts the drug into its metabolite (considered normals) and another that converts the drug slowly, leading to accumulation of the original drug in the plasma.\n\nIsoniazid is metabolized by acetylation to N-acetyl-isoniazid in the hepatic microsomal system by the enzyme N-acetyl transferase and is subsequently excreted in the urine. The first and second peaks in the above graph represent fast and slow acetylators, respectively. Slow acetylators of isoniazid also metabolize (acetylate) dapsone, hydralazine, and procainamide slowly, causing accumulation of these drugs as well. Slow acetylators of these drugs are at increased risk of toxic effects, while fast acetylators may require much higher therapeutic doses to achieve a therapeutic effect.\n\n(Choice A) Methylation is an important drug biotransformation method to consider when prescribing drugs such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, drugs used in the treatment of some inflammatory disorders of the bowel and skin.\n\n(Choice B) Glucuronidation is a biotransformation pathway utilized for the metabolism of numerous drugs as well as endogenous substances such as bilirubin. No bimodality has been described with this pathway, but conditions such as Gilbert syndrome involve dysfunction of the glucuronyl transferase system that can lead to toxic accumulation of some drugs.\n\n(Choice C) Hydrolysis occurs with enzymes such as esterases and amidases. Isoniazid is not metabolized by this pathway, and hydrolysis does not exhibit polymorphic metabolism.\n\n(Choice E) Amine oxidation is usually undertaken by monoamine oxidases or by cytochrome oxidative deamination. Neither process metabolizes isoniazid nor exhibits bimodality.\n\nEducational Objective:\nIsoniazid is metabolized by acetylation. The speed with which a patient is able to acetylate drugs depends on whether they are genetically \"fast\" or \"slow\" acetylators. The presence of fast and slow acetylators within the same population results in a bimodal distribution of the speed of isoniazid metabolism. Slow acetylators are at increased risk of adverse side effects.",
    "zh": "药物代谢的速率和程度通常因人而异。在固定时间给药固定剂量后测量药物血浆水平时，这种在代谢药物能力上的轻微的个体间差异通常通过单峰分布（通常呈钟形曲线）来反映。 这是用于生成问题干中给出的图表的方法。对于大多数药物，大多数人落在标准差范围内，95% 的人落在血浆浓度总体平均值的两个标准差范围内。这种类型的图中的单个峰值表明被测试的人群具有相似的遗传药物代谢能力。\n\n如问题干中所示的双峰（不连续、多态）曲线是由于研究人群中存在两个明显不同的组，并提示了药物代谢能力的药理遗传多态性。换句话说，这两个峰值表示人群中对药物的两组应答者：一组迅速将药物转化为其代谢物（被认为是正常人），另一组缓慢转化药物，导致原始药物在血浆中积累。\n\n异烟肼通过肝微粒体系统中的乙酰化作用被 N-乙酰转移酶代谢为 N-乙酰异烟肼，随后通过尿液排出。上图中第一个和第二个峰值分别代表快和慢乙酰化者。异烟肼的慢乙酰化者也会缓慢代谢（乙酰化）氨苯砜、肼屈嗪和普鲁卡因酰胺，导致这些药物的积累。这些药物的慢乙酰化者发生毒性作用的风险增加，而快乙酰化者可能需要更高的治疗剂量才能达到治疗效果。\n\n(选项 A) 甲基化是一种重要的药物生物转化方法，在处方如硫唑嘌呤和 6-巯基嘌呤等药物时需要考虑，这些药物用于治疗某些肠道和皮肤炎症性疾病。\n\n(选项 B) 葡萄糖醛酸化是一种用于代谢多种药物以及内源性物质（如胆红素）的生物转化途径。该途径尚未描述双峰性，但如 Gilbert 综合征等情况涉及葡萄糖醛酸转移酶系统的功能障碍，这可能导致某些药物的毒性积累。\n\n(选项 C) 水解作用发生在酯酶和酰胺酶等酶的作用下。异烟肼不通过此途径代谢，并且水解不表现出多态性代谢。\n\n(选项 E) 胺氧化通常由单胺氧化酶或细胞色素氧化性脱氨作用进行。这两种过程均不代谢异烟肼，也不表现出双峰性。\n\n教学目标：\n异烟肼通过乙酰化代谢。患者乙酰化药物的速度取决于他们是否是遗传性“快”或“慢”乙酰化者。在同一人群中存在快和慢乙酰化者导致异烟肼代谢速度呈双峰分布。慢乙酰化者发生不良反应的风险增加。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of pharmacogenetics and drug metabolism, specifically the concept of genetic polymorphisms leading to bimodal distributions in drug plasma concentrations. It assesses the ability to interpret a bimodal curve and identify the metabolic pathway responsible for isoniazid biotransformation.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recognize that a bimodal distribution in drug concentration indicates the presence of two distinct metabolic phenotypes within a population. The question then requires knowledge of isoniazid metabolism, identifying acetylation as the primary pathway and understanding that genetic variations in the acetylating enzyme lead to fast and slow acetylators, thus explaining the bimodal curve.",
