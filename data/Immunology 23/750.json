    "en": "A 23-year-old man comes to the physician with dysuria and increased urinary frequency. He is an active duty member of the US military and recently returned from sub-Saharan Africa, where he had been stationed for the last year. The patient's symptoms have persisted for several months and have failed to resolve following antibiotic treatment. His blood eosinophil count is elevated. Urine microscopy shows schistosome eggs. He is started on praziquantel and experiences improvement in his symptoms. The elevated eosinophils in this patient contribute to the host defense against schistosomiasis through which of the following mechanisms? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "Parasitic killing by eosinophils\n\nEosinophils perform the following functions:\n\nParasitic defense: Eosinophil proliferation and activation during multicellular parasitic infection is stimulated by IL-5 produced by Tₕ2 and mast cells (not to be confused with IL-4, which stimulates IgE production). When a parasite invades the mucosa or enters the bloodstream, it is coated by IgG and IgA antibodies that bind the Fc receptors located on the eosinophil cell surface. This triggers eosinophil degranulation and release of cytotoxic proteins (eg, MAJOR BASIC PROTEIN) and reactive oxygen intermediates, substances that damage and destroy antibody-bound parasites. This mechanism is an example of ANTIBODY-DEPENDENT CELL-MEDIATED CYTOTOXICITY (ADCC), which is also used by macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells.\n\nType I hypersensitivity reactions: Eosinophils also synthesize prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cytokines that contribute to the inflammation seen in late-phase type I hypersensitivity and chronic allergic reactions.\n\n(Choice B) Eosinophils contain a diverse number of immunomodulatory cytokines that are important for directing the Tₕ2 immune response; but they do not significantly affect B cell chemotaxis.\n\n(Choice C) Complement activation is an important step in antibody-mediated (type II) and immune complex mediated (type III) hypersensitivity reactions. Complement does not play a prominent role in the destruction of parasites by eosinophils.\n\n(Choice D) Immediate (type I) hypersensitivity reactions are primarily mediated by mast cells and basophils. These cells possess Fc receptor-bound IgE on their membranes. Eosinophils contribute to late-phase type I hypersensitivity, but this is an allergic response that would not be protective against schistosomiasis.\n\n(Choice E) Eosinophils can phagocytose parasitic antigens and present them in association with MHC class II molecules to stimulate helper T lymphocytes. In contrast, MHC class I antigen processing is involved in inducing a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response against intracellular pathogens (eg, viruses).\n\nEducational objective:\nEosinophils play a role in host defense during multicellular parasitic infection. When stimulated by antibodies bound to a parasitic organism, they destroy the parasite via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity with enzymes from their cytoplasmic granules. Another function of eosinophils is regulation of type I hypersensitivity reactions.",
    "zh": "嗜酸性粒细胞杀伤寄生虫\n\n嗜酸性粒细胞执行以下功能：\n\n寄生虫防御：多细胞寄生虫感染期间嗜酸性粒细胞的增殖和活化受到Tₕ2细胞和肥大细胞产生的IL-5的刺激（不要与刺激IgE产生的IL-4混淆）。当寄生虫侵入黏膜或进入血流时，它会被IgG和IgA抗体包被，这些抗体与位于嗜酸性粒细胞表面的Fc受体结合。这会触发嗜酸性粒细胞脱颗粒并释放细胞毒性蛋白（例如，主要碱性蛋白）和活性氧中间体，这些物质会损伤和破坏与抗体结合的寄生虫。这种机制是抗体依赖性细胞介导的细胞毒作用(ADCC)的一个例子，巨噬细胞、中性粒细胞和自然杀伤细胞也使用这种机制。\n\nI型超敏反应：嗜酸性粒细胞还会合成前列腺素、白三烯和细胞因子，这些物质有助于在I型超敏反应的迟相和慢性过敏反应中出现的炎症。\n\n(选项B) 嗜酸性粒细胞含有多种免疫调节细胞因子，这些细胞因子对于指导Tₕ2免疫反应很重要；但它们不会显著影响B细胞趋化性。\n\n(选项C) 补体激活是抗体介导的（II型）和免疫复合物介导的（III型）超敏反应的重要步骤。补体在嗜酸性粒细胞破坏寄生虫方面没有发挥主要作用。\n\n(选项D) 速发型（I型）超敏反应主要由肥大细胞和嗜碱性粒细胞介导。这些细胞在其细胞膜上具有Fc受体结合的IgE。嗜酸性粒细胞有助于I型超敏反应的迟相，但这是一种对血吸虫病没有保护作用的过敏反应。\n\n(选项E) 嗜酸性粒细胞可以吞噬寄生虫抗原，并将它们与MHC II类分子结合呈递，以刺激辅助T淋巴细胞。相比之下，MHC I类抗原呈递涉及诱导细胞毒性T淋巴细胞对细胞内病原体（例如，病毒）的反应。\n\n教育目标：\n嗜酸性粒细胞在多细胞寄生虫感染期间的宿主防御中发挥作用。当受到与寄生虫结合的抗体的刺激时，它们通过抗体依赖性细胞介导的细胞毒性，利用其细胞质颗粒中的酶来破坏寄生虫。嗜酸性粒细胞的另一个功能是调节I型超敏反应。"

    "en": "This question tests the mechanism by which eosinophils contribute to host defense against parasitic infections like schistosomiasis, specifically through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). It requires understanding the role of eosinophils in parasitic infections and their interaction with antibodies. \n\nThe best approach is to recall the function of eosinophils in parasitic infections. Eosinophils bind to antibody-coated parasites and release cytotoxic substances, leading to parasite destruction. Eliminate options that do not align with this mechanism, such as those involving complement activation or MHC class I antigen processing.",
