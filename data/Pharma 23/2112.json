    "en": "A new antibiotic developed for the treatment of infections caused by resistant gram-positive cocci has a volume of distribution of 11L. It is eliminated by first-order kinetics and has a half-life of 10 hours. If given by a continuous infusion, approximately how much time would it require for the drug to achieve a 95% plasma steady state concentration?",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "During continuous infusion of a drug metabolized by first-order kinetics (i.e. a constant fraction of the drug is eliminated per unit time), the steady state concentration is reached in 4 to 5 half-lives. Thus, it would take approximately 40 hours, or four times the half-life of 10 hours, for the drug in question to reach approximately 95% steady-state concentration.\n\nEducational objective:\nDuring continuous infusion of a drug metabolized by first-order kinetics, the steady state concentration is reached in 4 to 5 half-lives.",
    "zh": "在使用一级动力学（即单位时间内消除的药物恒定比例）代谢的药物进行持续输注期间，稳态浓度在4到5个半衰期内达到。因此，对于本题中的药物来说，大约需要40小时，也就是10小时半衰期的四倍，才能达到大约95%的稳态浓度。\n\n教育目标：\n在使用一级动力学代谢的药物进行持续输注期间，稳态浓度在4到5个半衰期内达到。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of pharmacokinetic principles, specifically the time required to reach steady-state concentration during a continuous infusion of a drug that follows first-order elimination kinetics.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall that steady-state concentration is achieved after approximately 4 to 5 half-lives for drugs eliminated by first-order kinetics. The provided half-life can then be multiplied by 4 or 5 to estimate the time to reach 95% steady-state.",
    "zh": "本题测试对药代动力学原理的理解，特别是药物以一级消除动力学进行持续输注时达到稳态浓度所需的时间。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须记住，对于以一级动力学消除的药物，稳态浓度大约在4到5个半衰期后达到。然后，可以将所提供的半衰期乘以4或5，以估计达到95%稳态浓度的时间。"
