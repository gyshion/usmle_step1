    "en": "A 28-year-old man comes to the office at his wife's insistence. He reports severe insomnia but otherwise feels physically healthy. His wife is concerned that the patient is having a difficult time since returning from military duty. She says, \"He used to be so upbeat and easygoing. Now his moods fluctuate between really tense and on edge to detached and numb.\" The patient cannot fall asleep at night because, as soon as he closes his eyes, he sees the horrific scene of his friend being blown up after stepping on a landmine. During the day, he is hypersensitive to loud sounds such as firecrackers or a car backfiring. The patient says, \"Sometimes I feel as if I'm back in combat and have to duck and take cover.\" Vital signs are within normal limits, and physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, the patient has an anxious mood and blunted affect.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's sleep disturbance, tense moods, feelings of detachment, intrusive images, hypervigilance, and flashbacks are characteristic of POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD). First-line treatment consists of trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy and antidepressant medication. SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SSRIs) have the best evidence for efficacy, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are also commonly used. Although patients with PTSD commonly experience anxiety, hyperarousal, and insomnia, there is little evidence to support the use of benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (Choices B and E).\n\n(Choice A) Antipsychotics are not a first-line treatment for PTSD. They may have a limited role as augmentation in patients who have inadequate response to an SSRI/SNRI.\n\n(Choices C and G) The older antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants) are used as second-line treatments for depression, but they have not been shown to be effective in PTSD.\n\n(Choice D) Mood stabilizers (eg, lithium, anticonvulsants with mood-stabilizing properties) have a major role in treating bipolar disorders, but they have not proven effective in treating PTSD.\n\nEducational objective:\nFirst-line treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder includes trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy and antidepressant medication. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have the best evidence for efficacy.",
    "zh": "该患者的睡眠障碍、紧张情绪、脱离感、侵入性画面、过度警觉和闪回是创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）的特征。一线治疗包括以创伤为中心的认知行为疗法和抗抑郁药。选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂 (SSRIs) 具有最佳的疗效证据，血清素-去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂 (SNRIs) 也被广泛使用。尽管PTSD患者常有焦虑、过度兴奋和失眠，但很少有证据支持使用苯二氮卓类药物和非苯二氮卓类催眠药（选项B和E）。\n\n（选项A）抗精神病药不是PTSD的一线治疗。对于对SSRIs/SNRIs反应不佳的患者，它们可能仅作为辅助治疗。\n\n（选项C和G）较老的抗抑郁药（单胺氧化酶抑制剂和三环类抗抑郁药）被用作治疗抑郁症的二线治疗方法，但尚未证明对PTSD有效。\n\n（选项D）情绪稳定剂（如锂盐、具有情绪稳定特性的抗惊厥药）在治疗双相情感障碍中起主要作用，但已被证明对治疗PTSD无效。\n\n教育目标：\n创伤后应激障碍的一线治疗包括以创伤为中心的认知行为疗法和抗抑郁药。选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂具有最佳的疗效证据。"

It requires identifying the clinical presentation of PTSD and selecting the most appropriate first-line medication based on evidence-based treatment guidelines.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the classic symptoms of PTSD, such as intrusive memories, hypervigilance, and avoidance, and then recalling that SSRIs are the primary pharmacologic treatment for this condition, often used in conjunction with psychotherapy.",
