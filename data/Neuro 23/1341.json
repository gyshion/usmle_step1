    "en": "A 4-day-old girl is brought to the office for a routine newborn visit. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via an uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery to a gravida 5 para 5 woman. The patient has been breastfed exclusively but has had increasing difficulty feeding over the past 24 hours. Her parents say that she is \"too sleepy to eat\" and has been vomiting. The infant has 3 healthy, living siblings; a brother died in infancy from \"low sugar in his blood.\" Physical examination is notable for tachypnea and signs of dehydration. The patient is responsive to painful stimuli only. After acute treatment and stabilization, urine testing reveals a significantly elevated methylmalonic acid level. Which of the following sets of laboratory findings is most likely to be found in this patient? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Methylmalonic acidemia is an autosomal recessive organic acidemia caused by deficiency of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, an enzyme involved in the propionic acid pathway. This metabolic pathway funnels specific amino acids (isoleucine, valine, threonine, methionine) and odd-chain fatty acids into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (propionyl-CoA → methylmalonyl-CoA → succinyl-CoA → TCA cycle).\n\nMutations in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase result in the ACCUMULATION of organic acids (eg, propionic acid, methylmalonic acid), leading to the following characteristic signs of organic acidemia:\n\n*   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS with respiratory compensation (ie, tachypnea)\n*   Altered glucose metabolism resulting in HYPOGLYCEMIA with increased ketone production (can worsen the metabolic acidosis)\n*   HYPERAMMONEMIA (organic acids impair urea cycle function)\n\nThese severe metabolic derangements frequently develop within the first 1 to 2 weeks of life, causing altered mental status (ie, obtundation, poor feeding) and vomiting (ie, dehydration). Diagnosis is suggested by elevated urine propionic acid and methylmalonic acid. Propionic acidemia is another branched-chain organic acidemia/aciduria that presents similarly to methylmalonic acidemia, but urine methylmalonic acid levels are not elevated.\n\n(Choices A and E) Ketone production in the presence of hypoglycemia is a normal response to a fasted state. However, this patient's elevated urine methylmalonic acid level and notable family history make methylmalonic aciduria more likely.\n\n(Choice C) Fatty acid oxidation disorders (eg, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) can present with hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and metabolic acidosis. However, propionic acid and ketone levels would not be elevated.\n\n(Choice D) Urea cycle defects typically present with hyperammonemia without hypoglycemia, ketosis, or abnormal propionic acid levels. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "甲基丙二酸血症是一种常染色体隐性遗传性有机酸血症，由甲基丙二酰辅酶 A 变位酶缺乏引起，这是一种参与丙酸途径的酶。该代谢途径将特定的氨基酸（异亮氨酸、缬氨酸、苏氨酸、蛋氨酸）和奇数链脂肪酸导入三羧酸 (TCA) 循环（丙酰-CoA → 甲基丙二酰-CoA → 琥珀酰-CoA → TCA 循环）。\n\n甲基丙二酰辅酶 A 变位酶的突变导致有机酸（例如，丙酸、甲基丙二酸）的积累，从而导致有机酸血症的以下特征性体征：\n\n*   代谢性酸中毒伴呼吸代偿（即呼吸急促）\n*   葡萄糖代谢改变导致低血糖伴酮体生成增加（可加重代谢性酸中毒）\n*   高氨血症（有机酸损害尿素循环功能）\n\n这些严重的代谢紊乱常在出生后 1 至 2 周内发生，导致精神状态改变（即，迟钝、喂养不良）和呕吐（即，脱水）。通过尿丙酸和甲基丙二酸升高提示诊断。丙酸血症是另一种支链有机酸血症/酸尿，其表现与甲基丙二酸血症相似，但尿甲基丙二酸水平不升高。\n\n（选项 A 和 E）在低血糖存在下酮体的产生是对禁食状态的正常反应。然而，该患者的尿甲基丙二酸水平升高和显着的家族史使得甲基丙二酸尿症更有可能。\n\n（选项 C）脂肪酸氧化障碍（例如，中链酰基辅酶 A 脱氢酶缺乏症）可表现为低血糖、高氨血症和代谢性酸中毒。然而，丙酸和酮体水平不会升高。\n\n（选项 D）尿素循环缺陷通常表现为高氨血症，没有低血糖、酮症或丙酸水平异常。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of organic acidemias, specifically methylmalonic acidemia, and its characteristic laboratory findings in newborns. It assesses the ability to recognize the metabolic derangements associated with this condition.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the key features of organic acidemias: metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and elevated organic acids (propionic and methylmalonic).
