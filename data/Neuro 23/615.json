    "en": "A 12-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother due to headaches and gait instability. The headaches wake the patient and are associated with nausea and vomiting. Symptoms began several months ago and have progressively worsened. The patient has lost 2.7 kg (6 lb) since his last well visit 6 months ago. On physical examination, gait is unsteady, and there is dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing. MRI of the brain is shown in the image below. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "Brain tumors are the second most common childhood cancer (after leukemia) and the most common solid organ tumors of childhood. This patient with a mixed solid/cystic, well-circumscribed cerebellar mass most likely has a PILOCYTIC ASTROCYTOMA (PCA), the most common type of brain tumor in children. {{exhibit_2}} PCAs are low-grade gliomas that occur most frequently in the cerebellum. Patients typically have headaches (increased intracranial pressure) and cerebellar findings (eg, loss of balance, incoordination). Imaging studies often reveal a well-demarcated, prominent CYSTIC LESION with solid components that avidly enhance following contrast administration. {{exhibit_3}} Due to the slow-growing (benign) nature, the majority of patients can be treated with surgical resection and have a favorable prognosis.\n(Choice A) Ependymomas arise from the ependymal lining and grow into the ventricles. In children, they commonly occupy the fourth ventricle and can extend through the foramina of Luschka and Magendie, causing obstructive hydrocephalus.\n(Choice B) Glioblastoma is the most common primary adult brain tumor and is typically located within the cerebral hemispheres (often crossing the corpus callosum).\n(Choice C) Medulloblastoma is another common pediatric brain tumor that primarily involves the cerebellum. However, imaging typically reveals a SOLID LESION; cystic components, if present, are usually small and multiple (unlike this patient). Leptomeningeal dissemination (eg, drop metastases) is also frequently seen due to the malignant nature of the tumor. {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}\n(Choice D) Oligodendrogliomas typically present as calcified masses within the frontal lobe; they are rarely seen in children.",
    "zh": "脑肿瘤是儿童期第二常见的癌症（仅次于白血病），也是儿童期最常见的实体器官肿瘤。这位患者出现混合性实性/囊性、边界清楚的脑室小脑肿块，最有可能患有毛细胞星形细胞瘤（PCA），这是儿童中最常见的脑肿瘤类型。{{exhibit_2}} PCA是低级别神经胶质瘤，最常发生在小脑。患者通常有头痛（颅内压增高）和小脑体征（如平衡失调、协调障碍）。影像学研究常显示有界限清晰、突出的囊性病变，并有实性成分，在对比剂给药后可明显增强。{{exhibit_3}} 由于生长缓慢（良性），大多数患者可以通过手术切除治疗，预后良好。\n(选项A) 室管膜瘤起源于室管膜内壁，并生长到脑室中。在儿童中，它们通常占据第四脑室，并可以延伸通过Luschka孔和Magendie孔，引起梗阻性脑积水。\n(选项B) 胶质母细胞瘤是最常见的成人原发性脑肿瘤，通常位于大脑半球内（通常会穿过胼胝体）。\n(选项C) 髓母细胞瘤是另一种常见的儿童脑肿瘤，主要累及小脑。然而，影像学检查通常显示实性病变；如果存在囊性成分，通常很小且多发（与该患者不同）。由于肿瘤的恶性性质，也经常看到软脑膜播散（例如，转移灶）。{{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}\n(选项D) 少突胶质细胞瘤通常表现为额叶内的钙化肿块；它们很少见于儿童。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of common pediatric brain tumors, their typical locations, imaging characteristics, and clinical presentations. It requires differentiating between various types of gliomas based on the provided clinical vignette and MRI findings.\nTo solve this question, one should first identify the patient's age and symptoms suggestive of a posterior fossa mass (headaches, vomiting, gait instability, dysmetria). Then, analyze the MRI findings, noting the presence of a mixed solid and cystic lesion in the cerebellum. Finally, compare these findings with the characteristic features of the given differential diagnoses to select the most likely tumor.",
