    "en": "An 18-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her parents for altered mental status that began today. Two months ago, the patient began restricting her dietary intake due to fear of being overweight. Since then, she has experienced notable weight loss and has felt weaker overall. The patient's parents have been encouraging her to eat, and today, she agreed to eat watermelon and pineapple for breakfast. Afterward, she fell while walking and appeared very somnolent. The patient is otherwise healthy with no chronic medical conditions and takes no medications. BMI is 16 kg/m², decreased from 18.5 kg/m² a few months ago. The patient is oriented to name only and has a poor attention span. Pupils are equal and reactive, but she has nystagmus and lateral gaze palsy. Strength and sensations are equal in the bilateral extremities. The patient walks in short steps and has difficulty maintaining her balance. Abdominal and skin examinations are unremarkable. Head imaging reveals no hemorrhage. This patient's clinical findings are most likely due to which of the following?",
    "zh": "一名18岁女性由父母带到急诊科，主诉今天开始出现精神状态改变。两个月前，由于害怕超重，患者开始限制饮食摄入。从那时起，她经历了明显的体重减轻，并且整体感觉虚弱。患者的父母一直在鼓励她进食，今天，她同意吃西瓜和菠萝作为早餐。之后，她在行走时摔倒并显得非常嗜睡。患者其他方面健康，无慢性病史，未服用任何药物。BMI为16 kg/m²，几个月前为18.5 kg/m²。患者仅能对自己的名字做出反应，注意力不集中。瞳孔等大，对光反射正常，但她有眼球震颤和外展神经麻痹。双侧肢体的力量和感觉相等。患者步幅短小，难以保持平衡。腹部和皮肤检查无异常发现。头部影像学检查未发现出血。该患者的临床表现最可能由以下哪项引起？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has anorexia (eg, restricted diet, BMI of 16 kg/m²) and acutely developed encephalopathy, ataxia, and oculomotor dysfunction after ingesting glucose, findings suspicious for Wernicke encephalopathy (WE). WE is a complication of THIAMINE (VITAMIN B1) DEFICIENCY and most commonly occurs in patients with chronic malnutrition (eg, chronic alcohol use, anorexia).\n\nThiamine is a COFACTOR for several enzymes involved in GLUCOSE METABOLISM, and deficiency results in decreased glucose use and impaired ATP production. In patients with low glucose intake, thiamine deficiency may be asymptomatic. However, this patient ingested a LARGE QUANTITY OF GLUCOSE, which likely RAPIDLY DEPLETED her limited thiamine stores.\n\nWithout thiamine, cerebral energy production is impaired, increasing neuronal susceptibility to oxidative stress and causing disruption of the tight junctions that form the blood-brain barrier. The resulting neuronal injury primarily affects areas of the brain with the highest metabolic demand and leads to the classic triad of WE:\n\n*   Encephalopathy (mammillary bodies): somnolence, confusion, inattention\n*   Ataxia (cerebellum): gait and balance disturbances\n*   Oculomotor dysfunction: nystagmus, lateral gaze palsy\n\n(Choice A) Anorexia increases the risk for deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin E, an antioxidant that protects the cerebellum from reactive oxygen species. Deficiency may result in ataxia, but encephalopathy and oculomotor dysfunction would not be expected.\n\n(Choice B) Encephalopathy is common in patients with impaired hepatic clearance of ammonia; ataxia and nystagmus can also occur. However, symptoms are usually insidious, not acute, in onset, and jaundice and asterixis would be expected.\n\n(Choice D) Vitamin K is synthesized by gut microflora and is a cofactor for carboxylase enzymes involved in coagulation factor synthesis. Patients with vitamin K deficiency are at increased risk for bleeding, such as a hemorrhagic stroke causing focal neurologic findings and/or altered mental status. However, this patient's lack of hemorrhage on imaging is inconsistent with this diagnosis.\n\n(Choice E) Clostridium botulinum is a spore-forming bacterium that produces a neurotoxin upon germinating which can cause cranial nerve motor dysfunction (eg, lateral gaze palsy) and descending muscle weakness. However, this patient has normal extremity strength, and spore ingestion is mostly associated with infant botulism.",
    "zh": "该患者患有厌食症（例如，饮食限制，BMI为16 kg/m²），并在摄入葡萄糖后急性出现脑病、共济失调和动眼神经功能障碍，这些发现提示韦尼克脑病（WE）。WE是硫胺素（维生素B1）缺乏症的并发症，最常见于慢性营养不良患者（例如，长期饮酒、厌食症）。\n\n硫胺素是参与葡萄糖代谢的几种酶的辅助因子，缺乏会导致葡萄糖利用减少和ATP产生受损。在葡萄糖摄入量低的患者中，硫胺素缺乏可能无症状。然而，该患者摄入了大量葡萄糖，这可能迅速耗尽了她有限的硫胺素储存。\n\n如果没有硫胺素，大脑的能量产生就会受损，增加神经元对氧化应激的敏感性，并导致形成血脑屏障的紧密连接的破坏。由此产生的神经元损伤主要影响大脑中代谢需求最高的区域，并导致WE的经典三联征：\n\n*   脑病（乳头体）：嗜睡、意识模糊、注意力不集中\n*   共济失调（小脑）：步态和平衡障碍\n*   动眼神经功能障碍：眼球震颤、外展神经麻痹\n\n（选项A）厌食症增加了脂溶性维生素（如维生素E，一种保护小脑免受活性氧的抗氧化剂）缺乏的风险。缺乏可能导致共济失调，但预计不会出现脑病和动眼神经功能障碍。\n\n（选项B）脑病在肝脏对氨清除受损的患者中很常见；也可能发生共济失调和眼球震颤。然而，症状通常是隐匿性的，而不是急性的，并且预计会出现黄疸和扑翼样震颤。\n\n（选项D）维生素K由肠道菌群合成，是参与凝血因子合成的羧化酶的辅助因子。维生素K缺乏症患者发生出血的风险增加，例如导致局灶性神经系统表现和/或精神状态改变的出血性卒中。然而，该患者影像学上没有出血，这与该诊断不符。\n\n（选项E）肉毒梭菌是一种形成孢子的细菌，在发芽后会产生神经毒素，从而导致颅神经运动功能障碍（例如，外展神经麻痹）和下降性肌无力。然而，该患者的肢体力量正常，并且孢子摄入主要与婴儿肉毒中毒有关。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of Wernicke encephalopathy, its pathophysiology, and clinical presentation, particularly in the context of thiamine deficiency precipitated by a high glucose load in a patient with anorexia and malnutrition.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the classic triad of symptoms (encephalopathy, ataxia, oculomotor dysfunction) in a patient with risk factors for malnutrition and a precipitating event (high glucose intake), and then differentiating this from other causes of altered mental status and neurologic deficits.",
