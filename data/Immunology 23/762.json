  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Helper T cells that have not yet contacted antigens are called **naive (Th0) cells** and have T-cell receptors (TCRs) and CD4 proteins on their surface. An **antigen-MHC class II complex** on an antigen-presenting cell (eg, macrophage, dendritic cell) can activate a naive Th cell by interacting with both TCR and CD4. The activated T cell then differentiates into either a Th1 or Th2 cell.\n\nIf the antigen is presented by a macrophage, the macrophage will produce **IL-12**, which stimulates differentiation into **Th1** cells. A deficiency of IL-12 receptors on naive T cells prevents differentiation into Th1 cells, which produce interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). IFN-γ is responsible for activation of the macrophage and CD8+ cytotoxic response against intracellular organisms, such as **mycobacteria**. Therefore, individuals with an IL-12 receptor deficiency are susceptible to severe, persistent mycobacterial infections. Administration of IFN-γ improves the immune response to mycobacterium in these patients.\n\n(Choices A and B) Both complement and GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) play a part in the immune response against pathogens such as mycobacterium. However, patients with an IL-12 receptor deficiency are unable to produce sufficient IFN-γ and therefore would not be able to mount a sufficient immune response to mycobacterium without IFN-γ supplementation.\n\n(Choices C and E) Formation of Th2 cells is induced by IL-4, which also plays a role in B cell differentiation and the production of immunoglobulins. Administration of immunoglobulins or IL-4 would improve the immune response against extracellular bacteria or viruses but would not be effective in stimulating an immune response against intracellular bacteria such as mycobacterium.\n\nEducational objective:\nIL-12 stimulates the differentiation of naive Th0 cells into Th1 cells. Patients with IL-12 receptor deficiency are susceptible to severe mycobacterial infections due to the inability to mount a strong cell-mediated granulomatous immune response; therefore, they require treatment with IFN-γ.",
    "zh": "尚未接触抗原的辅助 T 细胞被称为 **初始 (Th0) 细胞**，其表面具有 T 细胞受体 (TCR) 和 CD4 蛋白。抗原呈递细胞（例如巨噬细胞、树突状细胞）上的 **抗原-MHC II 类复合物** 可以通过与 TCR 和 CD4 相互作用来激活初始 Th 细胞。激活的 T 细胞随后分化为 Th1 或 Th2 细胞。\n\n如果抗原由巨噬细胞呈递，则巨噬细胞将产生 **IL-12**，从而刺激分化为 **Th1** 细胞。初始 T 细胞上 IL-12 受体缺乏会阻止分化为 Th1 细胞，而 Th1 细胞会产生干扰素-γ (IFN-γ)。IFN-γ 负责激活巨噬细胞和针对细胞内生物（如 **分枝杆菌**）的 CD8+ 细胞毒性反应。因此，IL-12 受体缺陷的个体容易受到严重、持续的分枝杆菌感染。给予 IFN-γ 可改善这些患者对分枝杆菌的免疫反应。\n\n(选项 A 和 B) 补体和 GM-CSF（粒细胞-巨噬细胞集落刺激因子）都在针对分枝杆菌等病原体的免疫反应中发挥作用。然而，IL-12 受体缺陷的患者无法产生足够的 IFN-γ，因此在没有 IFN-γ 补充的情况下无法对分枝杆菌产生足够的免疫反应。\n\n(选项 C 和 E) Th2 细胞的形成由 IL-4 诱导，IL-4 也在 B 细胞分化和免疫球蛋白的产生中发挥作用。给予免疫球蛋白或 IL-4 可改善针对细胞外细菌或病毒的免疫反应，但对于刺激针对细胞内细菌（如分枝杆菌）的免疫反应无效。\n\n教育目标：\nIL-12 刺激初始 Th0 细胞分化为 Th1 细胞。IL-12 受体缺陷的患者容易受到严重的分枝杆菌感染，原因是无法产生强大的细胞介导的肉芽肿性免疫反应；因此，他们需要用 IFN-γ 治疗。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of T cell differentiation and the role of IL-12 and IFN-gamma in cell-mediated immunity, specifically in the context of mycobacterial infections. It requires understanding how deficiencies in these cytokines can lead to increased susceptibility to intracellular pathogens.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the missing component in the Th1 pathway due to the IL-12 receptor deficiency. Recognize that IL-12 is crucial for stimulating IFN-gamma production, which is essential for macrophage activation and control of intracellular bacteria like mycobacteria.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对 T 细胞分化以及 IL-12 和 IFN-γ 在细胞介导免疫中的作用的了解，特别是在分枝杆菌感染的背景下。它需要理解这些细胞因子缺陷如何导致对细胞内病原体的易感性增加。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要确定由于 IL-12 受体缺陷而导致的 Th1 通路中缺失的成分。认识到 IL-12 对于刺激 IFN-γ 的产生至关重要，而 IFN-γ 对于巨噬细胞活化和控制细胞内细菌（如分枝杆菌）至关重要。"
