    "en": "This patient has occlusion of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), which arises from the vertebral artery. Occlusion of the PICA results in lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome {{exhibit_2}}. This disorder classically results in a constellation of symptoms because of damage to specific areas:\n\n*   Vertigo and nystagmus (vestibular nucleus)\n*   Ataxia (inferior cerebellar peduncle)\n*   Loss of pain and temperature sensation in the ipsilateral face (spinal trigeminal nucleus) and contralateral body (spinothalamic tract)\n*   Bulbar weakness (eg, dysphagia, dysarthria) (nucleus ambiguus)\n\nHorner syndrome (ie, miosis, ptosis, anhidrosis) may also occur in the ipsilateral eye due to damage to descending sympathetic nervous system fibers.\n\n(Choice A) Damage to the oculomotor nerve (CN III) can lead to impaired extraocular movements with a down-and-out eye due to unopposed action of the superior oblique muscle (innervated by the trochlear nerve [CN IV]) and the lateral rectus muscle (innervated by the abducens nerve [CN VI]). When this finding (ie, down-and-out eye) is accompanied by contralateral lower facial weakness and hemiplegia, it is suggestive of midbrain infarction due to occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery (ie, Weber syndrome).\n\n(Choice B) Hemiparesis of the arm and leg with an upper motor neuron pattern of facial weakness (ie, only involves the lower face) is the classic presentation of an internal capsule stroke. The internal capsule is supplied by the lenticulostriate arteries, which are branches of the MCA.\n\n(Choice C) Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (ie, loss of conjugate lateral gaze) is caused by damage to the medial longitudinal fasciculus, which can occur with occlusion affecting the pontine arteries. Bilateral loss of conjugate gaze is more likely with other etiologies (eg, multiple sclerosis plaques) because bilateral ischemic injury to the same area is uncommon.\n\n(Choice E) Homonymous hemianopia (ie, vision loss in the same half of the visual field in both eyes) with macular sparing is classically caused by occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery; the macula is spared due to collateral blood supply from the middle cerebral artery. Homonymous hemianopia without macular sparing can occur due to damage of the optic tract or optic radiation, which can occur with occlusion of several different vessels (eg, anterior choroidal, middle cerebral artery).\n\nEducational objective:\nPosterior inferior cerebellar artery occlusion causes lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome. This disorder is characterized by vertigo/nystagmus, ipsilateral cerebellar signs, loss of pain/temperature sensation in the ipsilateral face and contralateral body, bulbar weakness, and ipsilateral Horner syndrome. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者右侧后下小脑动脉 (PICA) 闭塞，该动脉源自椎动脉。PICA 闭塞会导致外侧髓质（Wallenberg）综合征 {{exhibit_2}}。由于特定区域的损伤，这种疾病通常会导致一系列症状：\n\n*   眩晕和眼球震颤（前庭神经核）\n*   共济失调（小脑下脚）\n*   同侧面部（脊髓三叉神经核）和对侧身体（脊髓丘脑束）的疼痛和温度感觉丧失\n*   延髓无力（例如，吞咽困难、构音障碍）（疑核）\n\n由于损伤了下降的交感神经系统纤维，同侧眼部也可能发生 Horner 综合征（即，瞳孔缩小、上睑下垂、无汗症）。\n\n(选项 A) 动眼神经 (CN III) 受损会导致眼外肌运动障碍，眼睛向下和向外，这是由于上斜肌（由滑车神经 [CN IV] 支配）和外直肌（由外展神经 [CN VI] 支配）的对抗作用。当这种表现（即，眼睛向下和向外）伴有对侧面部下部无力和偏瘫时，提示由于大脑后动脉闭塞导致中脑梗死（即，Weber 综合征）。\n\n(选项 B) 上肢和下肢偏瘫，伴有面部无力（即，仅涉及面部下部）的上运动神经元模式是内囊卒中的典型表现。内囊由豆纹动脉供应，豆纹动脉是大脑中动脉的 ​​分支。\n\n(选项 C) 核间性眼肌麻痹（即，共轭侧视丧失）是由内侧纵束损伤引起的，可能发生在影响脑桥动脉的闭塞中。双侧共轭凝视丧失更有可能与其他病因有关（例如，多发性硬化斑块），因为双侧同一区域的缺血性损伤并不常见。\n\n(选项 E) 同侧偏盲（即，双眼视野同一半部分的视力丧失）伴有黄斑保留，通常由大脑后动脉闭塞引起；由于来自大脑中动脉的侧支血供，黄斑得以保留。无黄斑保留的同侧偏盲可因视束或视辐射损伤而发生，这可能发生在多种不同血管闭塞的情况下（例如，前脉络丛、大脑中动脉）。\n\n教育目标：\n后下小脑动脉闭塞引起外侧髓质（Wallenberg）综合征。这种疾病的特征是眩晕/眼球震颤、同侧小脑体征、同侧面部和对侧身体的疼痛/温度感觉丧失、延髓无力以及同侧 Horner 综合征。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"
