    "en": "A 64-year-old woman is evaluated for episodic urinary incontinence. Urodynamic studies reveal an overactive bladder. Symptoms persist after behavioral interventions, and the patient is unable to tolerate medical treatment. Low-amplitude electrical stimulation therapy that helps modulate neural control of the urinary bladder muscle, urethral sphincter, and pelvic muscles is planned. A stimulating electrode is most likely to be placed close to which of the following structures during this procedure?",

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is F. Urge incontinence can be treated with neuromodulation directed toward the S2-S4 nerve roots, which innervate the pelvic floor muscles and external urethral sphincter. These muscles are crucial for maintaining continence. Somatic innervation of the pelvic floor muscles helps stabilize the urethra against the anterior vaginal wall, decreasing the angle between the bladder neck and urethra, thereby stopping urine flow and maintaining continence. The external urethral sphincter (EUS) is also under somatic control via the pudendal nerve (S2-S4), and stimulation of these nerve roots increases EUS tone to improve urinary continence. The pelvic splanchnic nerves, derived from S2-S4, provide parasympathetic input to the bladder and urethral sphincter, promoting bladder contraction and potentially worsening incontinence. However, neuromodulation can also inhibit the bladder stretch-contraction reflex, which contributes to urge incontinence. Therefore, targeting the S2-S4 nerve roots is the most appropriate approach for treating urge incontinence unresponsive to other therapies.\n\n(Choice A) The nucleus accumbens is part of the basal ganglia involved in reward and pleasure and is targeted for addiction treatment, not urinary incontinence.\n(Choice B) Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus is used for Parkinson disease rigidity and is not relevant to urinary incontinence.\n(Choice C) The vagus nerve (CN X) is primarily involved in gastrointestinal regulation and has no direct role in micturition or urinary continence.\n(Choice D) The T6 nerve root contributes to the greater splanchnic nerve, which provides sympathetic innervation to the foregut. Sympathetic stimulation of the bladder inhibits detrusor contraction but originates from T10-L2, not T6.\n(Choice E) The L5 nerve root contributes to somatic innervation of lower limb muscles but does not innervate the pelvic floor, bladder, or urethral sphincters. The nerves controlling these structures are primarily sacral.\n\nKey clinical pearls: Neuromodulation for urinary incontinence targets the SACRAL nerve roots (S2-S4) that innervate the pelvic floor muscles and external urethral sphincter. The pudendal nerve, a branch of the sacral plexus, is key for somatic control of continence.",
    "zh": "正确答案是F。急迫性尿失禁可以通过神经调节治疗，其靶点是支配盆底肌肉和尿道外括约肌的S2-S4神经根。这些肌肉对于维持控尿至关重要。盆底肌肉的躯体神经支配有助于稳定尿道，使其抵住阴道前壁，从而减小膀胱颈和尿道之间的角度，从而阻止尿流并维持控尿。尿道外括约肌（EUS）也受阴部神经（S2-S4）的躯体控制，刺激这些神经根可以增加EUS的张力，从而改善尿失禁。源自S2-S4的盆腔内脏神经为膀胱和尿道括约肌提供副交感神经输入，促进膀胱收缩，并可能使尿失禁恶化。然而，神经调节也可以抑制膀胱牵张收缩反射，这有助于急迫性尿失禁。因此，针对S2-S4神经根是治疗对其他疗法无反应的急迫性尿失禁的最合适方法。\n\n（选项A）伏隔核是参与奖赏和愉悦的基底神经节的一部分，是成瘾治疗的靶点，与尿失禁无关。\n（选项B）丘脑底核的脑深部刺激用于治疗帕金森病的僵硬，与尿失禁无关。\n（选项C）迷走神经（CN X）主要参与胃肠道调节，在排尿或尿控方面没有直接作用。\n（选项D）T6神经根有助于构成较大的内脏神经，为前肠提供交感神经支配。膀胱的交感神经刺激抑制逼尿肌收缩，但起源于T10-L2，而不是T6。\n（选项E）L5神经根有助于下肢肌肉的躯体神经支配，但不支配盆底、膀胱或尿道括约肌。控制这些结构的神经主要是骶神经。\n\n关键临床要点：用于尿失禁的神经调节疗法针对支配盆底肌肉和尿道外括约肌的骶神经根（S2-S4）。阴部神经是骶丛的一个分支，是躯体控制控尿的关键。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the neuroanatomy of urinary continence and the principles of neuromodulation for treating urge incontinence. It requires knowledge of which nerve roots innervate the pelvic floor muscles and external urethral sphincter, as these are the targets for electrical stimulation therapy.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the specific neural structures responsible for bladder control and continence. Understanding the somatic and autonomic innervation of the bladder, urethra, and pelvic floor muscles is crucial. The question then requires correlating this knowledge with the therapeutic approach of neuromodulation, specifically identifying the sacral nerve roots (S2-S4) as the primary targets.",
