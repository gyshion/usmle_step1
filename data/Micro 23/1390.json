    "en": "Severe pharyngitis with exudates and cervical lymphadenopathy in a group of people with unknown vaccination status should raise suspicion for respiratory diphtheria infection. Diphtheria toxin can cause severe myocarditis and heart failure, which occurred in one of the patients in the vignette. Diphtheria toxin acts in a similar manner to exotoxin A, which is produced by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.\n\n*P. aeruginosa* produces several extracellular products, including exotoxin A, collagenase, elastase, fibrinolysin, phospholipase C, and DNAse. These substances assist in its invasion and dissemination in human tissues. Although they are structurally different, both diphtheria toxin and exotoxin A ribosylate and inactivate elongation factor-2 (EF-2), halting human cell protein synthesis and causing cell death. Exotoxin A is a major virulence factor and is responsible for the high mortality associated with *P. aeruginosa* septicemia.",
    "zh": "一组疫苗接种史不明的人群出现伴有渗出物和颈部淋巴结肿大的严重咽炎，应引起对呼吸道白喉感染的怀疑。白喉毒素可引起严重的心肌炎和心力衰竭，这种情况发生在案例中的一名患者身上。白喉毒素的作用方式与铜绿假单胞菌产生的外毒素A相似。\n\n*铜绿假单胞菌*产生几种细胞外产物，包括外毒素A、胶原酶、弹性蛋白酶、纤维蛋白溶酶、磷脂酶C和DNA酶。这些物质有助于其在人体组织中的侵袭和扩散。尽管它们的结构不同，但白喉毒素和外毒素A都会核糖基化并使延伸因子-2 (EF-2) 失活，从而阻止人体细胞蛋白质合成并导致细胞死亡。外毒素A是一种主要的毒力因子，是导致与*铜绿假单胞菌*败血症相关的高死亡率的原因。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of bacterial toxins, specifically diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, and their shared mechanism of action involving inhibition of elongation factor-2 (EF-2).\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation suggestive of diphtheria and recall that diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin A both inhibit EF-2 via ribosylation, leading to cell death.",
