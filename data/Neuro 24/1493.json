    "en": "A 19-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after sustaining a traumatic brain injury during a motor vehicle collision. On arrival, the patient is comatose and has a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3. His blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 114/min. Pupils are miotic, equal, and reactive to light. Ecchymosis is present behind the ear, but the remainder of the trauma survey is unremarkable. Rapid-sequence intubation is performed, and the patient is mechanically ventilated. A noncontrast head CT scan demonstrates bifrontal contusions and a basilar skull fracture. One day later, a repeat head CT scan reveals diffuse cerebral edema. The ventilator respiratory rate is adjusted to achieve a PaCO₂ level of 26-30 mm Hg.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The brain has little room for expansion as it is enclosed in the cranium. A small volume change in any of the cranial compartments (eg, brain tissue, blood, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]) can produce significant changes in intracranial pressure (ICP). Therefore, even small increases in cerebral blood volume can raise ICP and cause brain compression.\n\nThe main factors influencing cerebral circulation are systemic blood pressure and arterial blood gas levels. When systemic blood pressure is 60-140 mm Hg, it has little effect on cerebral blood volume because autoregulation (via cerebral blood vessel dilation and contraction) keeps blood flow constant. Blood pressure >150 mm Hg increases cerebral vascular volume and blood flow, causing a corresponding increase in ICP. In contrast, blood pressure <50 mm Hg causes cerebral hypoperfusion and potential ischemia.\n\nArterial blood gases also have a powerful effect on cerebral blood flow, with PaCO₂ being the most important regulator. A drop in PaCO₂ due to hyperventilation causes VASOCONSTRICTION. The resulting reduction in cerebral blood volume (Choice C) leads to decreased ICP. Lowering PaCO₂ is one of the measures employed to REDUCE ICP in mechanically ventilated patients with cerebral edema.\n\n(Choice A) The brain has a very large oxygen requirement, about 20% of all O₂ consumed by the body. Induced sedation and therapeutic hypothermia can decrease brain metabolic demand, exerting a neuroprotective effect and improving ICP by reducing cerebral blood volume.\n\n(Choice B) The vasoconstriction induced by hyperventilation can cause a decrease in local cerebral perfusion that can worsen neurologic injury in patients with acute traumatic brain injury or stroke. Therefore, hyperventilation should be used with caution in these patients, and the PaCO₂ should be maintained ≥30 mm Hg.\n\n(Choice E) The thecal sac is a sheath of dura mater that contains CSF and surrounds the spinal cord. Increased ICP can cause displacement of CSF from the brain into the thecal sac. However, the drop in ICP caused by hyperventilation reduces CSF displacement.\n\nEducational objective:\nCarbon dioxide is a potent vasodilator of cerebral vasculature. Tachypnea causes hypocapnia and cerebral vasoconstriction, thereby decreasing cerebral blood volume and intracranial pressure.",
    "zh": "由于大脑被包裹在颅腔内，几乎没有扩张空间。颅腔内任何隔室（如脑组织、血液、脑脊液[CSF]）的微小容积变化都会导致颅内压（ICP）的显着变化。因此，即使脑血容量略有增加，也会升高ICP并导致脑部受压。\n\n影响脑循环的主要因素是全身血压和动脉血气水平。当全身血压为60-140 mmHg时，它对脑血容量的影响很小，因为自动调节（通过脑血管扩张和收缩）使血流量保持恒定。血压>150 mmHg会增加脑血管容积和血流量，导致ICP相应升高。相比之下，血压<50 mmHg会导致脑灌注不足和潜在的缺血。\n\n动脉血气也会对脑血流产生强大影响，其中PaCO₂是最重要的调节因素。由于过度通气导致PaCO₂下降会引起血管收缩。由此导致的脑血容量减少（选项C）导致ICP降低。降低PaCO₂是用于降低机械通气脑水肿患者ICP的措施之一。\n\n（选项A）大脑对氧气的需求量很大，约占全身消耗O₂的20%。诱导镇静和治疗性低温可以降低脑代谢需求，发挥神经保护作用，并通过减少脑血容量来改善ICP。\n\n（选项B）过度通气引起的血管收缩可导致局部脑灌注减少，这可能会加重急性创伤性脑损伤或中风患者的神经系统损伤。因此，在这些患者中应谨慎使用过度通气，并且PaCO₂应维持在≥30 mmHg。\n\n（选项E）硬膜囊是包含CSF并包绕脊髓的硬脑膜鞘。ICP升高可导致CSF从大脑转移到硬膜囊中。然而，过度通气引起的ICP下降会减少CSF的转移。\n\n教育目标：\n二氧化碳是脑血管的强效血管扩张剂。呼吸急促会导致低碳酸血症和脑血管收缩，从而降低脑血容量和颅内压。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the physiological effects of hyperventilation on cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure in the context of traumatic brain injury and cerebral edema. It specifically assesses the relationship between arterial carbon dioxide levels and cerebral vascular resistance.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow and the role of PaCO₂ as a potent regulator. Identifying that the intervention is hyperventilation leading to hypocapnia is key, and then understanding that hypocapnia causes cerebral vasoconstriction, which in turn reduces cerebral blood volume and thus intracranial pressure.",
