    "en": "The odds of an event are related to the probability P of that event, with odds = P / (1 – P). For example, the probability of rolling a single die and getting a 1 is 1/6, but the odds of rolling a 1 is 1/5. The odds ratio (OR) is a measure of association used in case-control studies to compare the odds of exposure in cases (ie, individuals with disease) relative to controls (ie, individuals without disease).\n\nOR = (odds of exposure in cases) / (odds of exposure in controls)\n\nIn this study, the disease of interest is gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), so cases are women with GDM, and controls are women without GDM. The exposure of interest is probiotic yogurt intake before or during pregnancy. More specifically, the OR of interest is the odds of high intake of yogurt in cases (ie, women with GDM) relative to the odds of high intake of yogurt in controls (ie, women without GDM).\n\nA shortcut to calculate the OR when a contingency table has a standard format (ie, exposure of interest in the first row of exposure status and cases in the first column of disease status) is the following:\n\nOR = (a/c) / (b/d)\n\nThe given table is incorrectly formatted (ie, high intake should be in the first row rather than in the second row of exposure status), so it is necessary to reformat the table.\n\nThe odds of high intake of yogurt in women with GDM and women without GDM are:\n\nOdds of high intake of yogurt in cases: a/c = 41/82 = 0.50\nOdds of high intake of yogurt in controls: b/d = 66/60 = 1.10\nTherefore, the OR is:\n\nOR = (odds of exposure in cases) / (odds of exposure in controls) = (a/c) / (b/d) = 0.50 / 1.10 = 0.45\n\nThe OR is <1: this indicates that a high intake of probiotic yogurt during pregnancy has a PROTECTIVE effect against GDM.\n\nThis example calculated the OR of exposure (ie, odds of exposure among cases relative to controls). The OR is sometimes described as the odds of disease among exposed individuals relative to nonexposed individuals, given by (a/b) / (c/d). Both OR definitions are mathematically equivalent and reduce to OR = (ad) / (bc).\n\nEducational objective:\nThe odds ratio (OR) is a measure of association calculated as: OR = (odds of exposure in cases) / (odds of exposure in controls). For a correctly formatted contingency table: OR = (ad) / (bc).",

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of odds ratio calculation in a case-control study, specifically in the context of gestational diabetes mellitus and probiotic yogurt intake. It requires the ability to correctly identify cases, controls, exposure, and non-exposure, and then apply the formula for odds ratio.\n\nTo solve this question, first identify the cases (women with GDM) and controls (women without GDM). Then, determine the exposure of interest (high probiotic yogurt intake). Calculate the odds of exposure in cases and controls, and finally, calculate the odds ratio by dividing the odds of exposure in cases by the odds of exposure in controls.",
