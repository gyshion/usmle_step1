    "en": "A 22-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to acute vision disturbances and headache. About an hour ago the patient experienced a small area of visual loss, which she describes as a hole in the visual field. The vision disturbance gradually expanded to a C-shape in her peripheral vision and spontaneously resolved after 15-20 minutes. A progressively worsening, severe, right-sided headache of pulsating quality quickly followed. The patient has had similar headaches in the past but not of such severity. She has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. Blood pressure is 150/86 mm Hg and pulse is 92/min. On physical examination, the patient is lying still in bed with eyes closed. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Funduscopic examination reveals no abnormalities. Bilateral upper and lower extremity muscle strength, deep tendon reflexes, and sensation are normal.",

    "en": "This young woman with a pulsating, unilateral headache preceded by visual loss has migraine with aura. Migraines are an episodic neurological disorder that results in severe, unilateral, throbbing headaches often associated with photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea/vomiting. Migraines typically last 4-72 hours and have a strong genetic predisposition; women are affected more frequently than men.\nMigraines are thought to be triggered by a self-propagating wave of depolarization spreading across neurons in the cerebral cortex, resulting in activation and sensitization of trigeminal nerve nociceptors. Up to 25% of patients also develop a focal, reversible neurologic symptom that precedes or accompany the headache, known as an aura. Auras may be due to the spread of depolarization into other areas of the brain, where they are interpreted as \"positive\" (eg, bright spots, noises, paresthesia, movements) or \"negative\" (eg, vision/hearing/sensation loss) symptoms. Auras typically develop progressively over a period of minutes.\n(Choice A) Acute angle-closure glaucoma causes headache and decreased vision associated with elevated intraocular pressures. However, patients are typically older (age >60), and severe eye pain and conjunctival erythema are common. Vision would not be expected to improve without intervention.\n(Choice B) Cluster headache causes severe unilateral headaches; however, ipsilateral autonomic symptoms (eg, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, flushing, diaphoresis) are expected. The disease is also more common in men and is not associated with aura.\n(Choice D) Optic neuritis is a demyelinating disorder that causes vision loss, but it is typically unilateral and progresses over a period of weeks. Patients have eye pain that is worse with movement, color vision is often affected, and an afferent pupillary defect is present.\n(Choice E) Simple partial seizure may be preceded by an aura, but seizures typically cause positive symptoms (eg, lip smacking, arm movement, seeing bright lights) rather than the negative symptoms seen in this patient, and typically last <2 minutes. Unilateral headache is more suggestive of migraine with aura.\n(Choice F) Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) also cause focal neurologic deficits; however, these typically have an acute onset, with maximal symptoms at onset rather than the progressive visual field deficit seen in this patient. In addition, TIAs typically occur in older patients with vascular risk factors (eg, smoking, hyperlipidemia) and would be very uncommon in an otherwise healthy young woman.",
    "zh": "这位出现搏动性单侧头痛并伴有视力丧失的年轻女性患有偏头痛伴先兆。偏头痛是一种阵发性神经系统疾病，会导致严重的、单侧的搏动性头痛，常伴有畏光、畏声和恶心/呕吐。偏头痛通常持续4-72小时，且具有很强的遗传易感性；女性受影响的频率高于男性。\n偏头痛被认为是由在脑皮质神经元中传播的自传播去极化波触发的，导致三叉神经伤害感受器的激活和敏化。高达25%的患者还会出现局灶性、可逆性的神经系统症状，先于或伴随头痛，称为先兆。先兆可能是由于去极化扩散到大脑的其他区域，在那里它们被解释为“阳性”（例如，亮点、噪音、感觉异常、运动）或“阴性”（例如，视力/听力/感觉丧失）症状。先兆通常在几分钟内逐渐发展。\n（选项A）急性闭角型青光眼引起头痛和视力下降，与眼内压升高有关。然而，患者通常年龄较大（>60岁），且严重眼痛和结膜充血常见。如果不进行干预，视力预计不会改善。\n（选项B）丛集性头痛引起严重的单侧头痛；然而，预计会出现同侧自主神经症状（例如，流泪、流鼻涕、潮红、出汗）。该病在男性中也更常见，并且与先兆无关。\n（选项D）视神经炎是一种脱髓鞘疾病，会导致视力丧失，但它通常是单侧的，并且会在几周内进展。患者有眼痛，且运动时加重，色觉也常受到影响，并存在传入性瞳孔缺陷。\n（选项E）单纯部分性发作可能以先兆为先，但癫痫发作通常会引起阳性症状（例如，咂嘴、手臂运动、看到亮光），而不是该患者出现的阴性症状，并且通常持续<2分钟。单侧头痛更提示偏头痛伴先兆。\n（选项F）短暂性脑缺血发作 (TIA) 也会引起局灶性神经功能缺损；然而，这些通常具有急性起病，症状在起病时达到最大值，而不是该患者出现的进行性视野缺损。此外，TIA通常发生在有血管危险因素（例如，吸烟、高脂血症）的较年长患者中，对于其他方面健康的年轻女性来说，这非常罕见。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation and diagnosis of migraine with aura, differentiating it from other causes of headache and visual disturbances. It assesses the ability to recognize the characteristic prodromal visual symptoms (aura) followed by a severe headache.\nTo solve this question, one should identify the key features of the patient's presentation: visual disturbances preceding a severe headache, the nature of the visual disturbance (C-shape, peripheral), and the characteristics of the headache (pulsating, unilateral, severe). These features should then be matched against the typical presentations of the provided differential diagnoses, paying close attention to the presence or absence of aura and associated symptoms.",
