    "en": "A 42-year-old man comes to the office with rectal bleeding. He used to have occasional streaks of blood on the tissue after wiping, but for the past several days he has seen blood dripping into the toilet at the end of defecation. The patient reports chronic constipation and has to strain while having a bowel movement but has no rectal or abdominal pain. He works as a truck driver, and his diet consists mainly of hamburgers and French fries. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. There is no mass or tenderness on digital rectal examination, but anoscopy shows bulging purplish-blue mucosal lesions above the dentate line. Rubber band ligation of the lesions is most likely to involve which of the following? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "Hemorrhoids are classified based on their relation to the dentate line in the anal canal, with internal hemorrhoids originating above the line and external hemorrhoids below. They result from abnormal distension of the anal arteriovenous plexus, which normally forms the anal cushions (composed of venous sinusoids and connective tissue) that are important for maintaining fecal continence. Chronically increased venous pressure due to prolonged straining or breakdown of supporting tissue due to advancing age can cause the cushions to bulge into the anal canal, where they can become inflamed, thrombose, or prolapse.\n\nHemorrhoids can be treated with rubber band ligation, which cuts off the blood supply to the lesions and causes them to degenerate. The venous components of internal hemorrhoids drain into the superior rectal vein, which communicates with the inferior mesenteric vein. External hemorrhoids drain via the inferior rectal vein into the internal pudendal vein, which communicates with the internal iliac veins (Choice D). Internal hemorrhoids have no somatic sensory innervation and cannot cause pain; however, external hemorrhoids are innervated by the same nerves that cover the perianal area and can be very sensitive to pain.\n\n(Choice A) Branches of the deep external pudendal artery supply the scrotum (labia majora in females) and the perineum.\n\n(Choice B) The external iliac vein receives drainage from the inferior epigastric and deep circumflex iliac veins, which serve the anterior abdominal wall and iliac crest, respectively.\n\n(Choice E) The left colic artery branches off the inferior mesenteric artery to supply the transverse and descending colon.\n\n(Choice F) The superior vesical artery and its branches supply portions of the urinary bladder and ductus deferens.\n\nEducational objective:\nHemorrhoids result from abnormal distension of a portion of the anal arteriovenous plexus. The vascular components of internal hemorrhoids drain into the superior rectal vein, which subsequently drains into the inferior mesenteric vein. Band ligation of hemorrhoids cuts off their blood supply, causing them to degenerate. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "痔疮根据其与肛管齿状线的关系进行分类，内痔起源于齿状线以上，外痔起源于齿状线以下。它们是由于肛门动静脉丛异常扩张引起的，肛门动静脉丛通常形成肛垫（由静脉窦和结缔组织组成），这对维持大便的自持至关重要。由于长期用力或支持组织因年龄增长而分解，慢性静脉压升高可导致肛垫膨胀到肛管内，在那里它们会发炎、血栓形成或脱垂。\n\n痔疮可以用橡皮筋结扎治疗，这会切断病变的血液供应，导致它们退化。内痔的静脉成分引流入直肠上静脉，直肠上静脉与肠系膜下静脉相通。外痔通过直肠下静脉引流入阴部内静脉，阴部内静脉与髂内静脉相通（选项D）。内痔没有躯体感觉神经支配，不会引起疼痛；然而，外痔受支配会阴区域的相同神经支配，并且对疼痛非常敏感。\n\n（选项A）深外阴动脉的分支供应阴囊（女性的大阴唇）和会阴。\n\n（选项B）髂外静脉接收来自腹壁下静脉和旋髂深静脉的引流，分别服务于腹前壁和髂嵴。\n\n（选项E）左结肠动脉从肠系膜下动脉分支出，供应横结肠和降结肠。\n\n（选项F）膀胱上动脉及其分支供应膀胱和输精管的一部分。\n\n教育目标：\n痔疮是由于肛门动静脉丛的一部分异常扩张引起的。内痔的血管成分引流入直肠上静脉，然后引流入肠系膜下静脉。痔疮的橡皮筋结扎会切断其血液供应，导致其退化。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the venous drainage of internal hemorrhoids and the vessels involved in rubber band ligation. Specifically, it assesses understanding that internal hemorrhoids drain into the superior rectal vein, which communicates with the inferior mesenteric vein.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the lesions are above the dentate line, indicating internal hemorrhoids. Recall the venous drainage pathway of internal hemorrhoids to identify the inferior mesenteric vein as the most likely vessel involved in rubber band ligation.",
