    "en": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department with anterior chest pain. He had felt well until the pain developed 4 days ago. The patient says the pain is sharp and makes it difficult to take a deep breath. Since yesterday, he has also felt out of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. The patient's father died of a heart attack at age 52, and his mother suffers from rheumatoid arthritis. He does not use alcohol or tobacco. Temperature is 37.4 C (99.3 F), blood pressure is 112/65 mm Hg, and pulse is 103/min and regular. Bedside ultrasound examination demonstrates a moderate pericardial effusion. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current condition?",

    "en": "This patient most likely has ACUTE VIRAL PERICARDITIS; viral infection is the most common cause of pericarditis and many viruses (eg, adenovirus, coxsackievirus, echovirus, influenza virus) have been implicated. Because the viral infection often cannot be confirmed, presumed viral pericarditis is sometimes referred to as idiopathic. Pericarditis typically presents with substernal pleuritic chest pain that may radiate to the bilateral scapulae posteriorly. The pain is typically worse when lying flat and improves with sitting up and leaning forward. Fever is common but often not present. \n\nCardiac auscultation in acute viral pericarditis classically reveals a triphasic pericardial friction rub (occurring during atrial systole, ventricular systole, and early ventricular diastole); however, the rub may be absent, especially in the presence of significant pericardial effusion. Mild to moderate-sized pericardial effusion is common and can rarely lead to cardiac tamponade. ECG characteristically demonstrates diffuse ST elevation caused by inflammation of the ventricular myocardium.\n\n(Choice A) Autoimmune disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis) is a potential cause of pericarditis, but it is less common than viral pericarditis and is less likely in the absence of a personal history of autoimmune disease (pericarditis is only rarely the presenting manifestation of autoimmune disease).\n\n(Choice B) Myocardial infarction due to coronary artery disease (CAD) can lead to peri-infarction pericarditis (a localized reaction to transmural myocardial necrosis) within 2-4 days or to Dressler syndrome (an autoimmune response to infarction-induced antigens) within weeks to months. Despite a family history of CAD, myocardial infarction is relatively unlikely in this man age <40.\n\n(Choice C) Gram-positive cocci (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae) in rare cases can cause pericarditis (purulent pericarditis) via direct extension of pneumonia or hematogenous bacterial spread. Affected patients are typically quite ill and present with high fever and sepsis.\n\n(Choice D) Malignant pericarditis can occur in the setting of metastatic cancer (eg, lung cancer, breast cancer); however, it is less likely to present with pain and inflammation and more likely to present with symptoms of fluid accumulation (ie, dyspnea due to subacute cardiac tamponade). Malignant pericarditis is also relatively uncommon compared to viral pericarditis and less likely in this relatively young man.\n\nEducational objective:\nViral infection is the most common cause of acute pericarditis. It causes a fibrinous or serofibrinous pericarditis that is often characterized by pleuritic chest pain, a friction rub on cardiac auscultation, diffuse ST elevation on ECG, and mild to moderate-sized pericardial effusion. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有急性病毒性心包炎；病毒感染是心包炎最常见的原因，许多病毒（例如，腺病毒、柯萨奇病毒、埃可病毒、流感病毒）都与之有关。由于病毒感染通常无法确认，推测的病毒性心包炎有时被称为特发性心包炎。心包炎通常表现为胸骨下胸膜炎性胸痛，可能放射至双侧肩胛骨后部。平躺时疼痛通常会加剧，坐直并向前倾斜时会缓解。发烧很常见，但通常不存在。\n\n急性病毒性心包炎的心脏听诊经典表现为三相性心包摩擦音（发生在心房收缩期、心室收缩期和心室舒张早期）；然而，摩擦音可能缺失，尤其是在存在明显的心包积液时。轻度至中度心包积液很常见，很少会导致心脏压塞。心电图的特征表现为弥漫性ST段抬高，由心室心肌炎症引起。\n\n（选项A）自身免疫性疾病（例如，系统性红斑狼疮、类风湿性关节炎）是心包炎的潜在原因，但不如病毒性心包炎常见，并且在没有自身免疫性疾病的个人病史的情况下不太可能（心包炎很少是自身免疫性疾病的首发表现）。\n\n（选项B）由于冠状动脉疾病（CAD）引起的心肌梗死可在2-4天内导致心梗周围心包炎（对透壁心肌坏死的局部反应），或在数周至数月内导致Dressler综合征（对梗死诱导的抗原的自身免疫反应）。尽管有CAD家族史，但对于这位年龄小于40岁的男性来说，心肌梗死相对不太可能。\n\n（选项C）革兰氏阳性球菌（例如，金黄色葡萄球菌、肺炎链球菌）在极少数情况下可引起心包炎（化脓性心包炎），通过肺炎的直接蔓延或血源性细菌传播。受影响的患者通常病得很重，并伴有高烧和脓毒症。\n\n（选项D）恶性心包炎可发生在转移性癌症（例如，肺癌、乳腺癌）的情况下；然而，它不太可能表现为疼痛和炎症，而更有可能表现为体液积聚的症状（即，由于亚急性心脏压塞引起的呼吸困难）。与病毒性心包炎相比，恶性心包炎也相对不常见，并且在这个相对年轻的男性中不太可能。\n\n教育目标：\n病毒感染是急性心包炎最常见的原因。它会导致纤维蛋白性或浆液纤维蛋白性心包炎，通常的特征是胸膜炎性胸痛、心脏听诊摩擦音、心电图上弥漫性ST段抬高以及轻度至中度心包积液。{{exhibit_1}}"
