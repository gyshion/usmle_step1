    "en": "An 8-month-old girl is brought to the office due to irritability and regression of motor skills. The patient's birth was unremarkable and her development had appeared normal, but she can no longer sit or roll over. Her parents have also noticed that she startles easily at loud noises. Head circumference measurement is consistent with macrocephaly. Bilateral funduscopic evaluation shows a bright red fovea centralis that is surrounded by a contrasting white macula. Peripheral vision is decreased. Abdominal examination is normal. Accumulation of which of the following metabolites is most likely present in this patient's tissues?",

    "en": "This patient's loss of motor skills, excessive startle response, and ophthalmic findings are most likely due to Tay-Sachs disease, an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder commonly seen in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Tay-Sachs is caused by β-hexosaminidase A deficiency, which results in lysosomal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside, a glycolipid component of cell membranes.\n\nInfants with Tay-Sachs disease typically develop normally for the first few months of life because the gradual buildup of ganglioside in neuronal lysosomes does not initially cause cellular dysfunction. However, by age 6 months the accumulation of glycolipids in the brain results in neuronal destruction. Subsequent neurologic degeneration typically manifests as developmental regression, as seen in this patient who is no longer able to sit or roll over.\n\nProgressive destruction of neurons in the brain and spinal cord leads to macrocephaly, seizures, and spasticity, with an exaggerated startle reflex with acoustic stimuli is the result of brainstem injury. Ganglioside accumulation also occurs in the retina but spares the fovea, which lacks ganglion cells. This leads to the characteristic funduscopic finding of a cherry-red macular spot, or a bright red unaffected fovea (which reflects the underlying choroid) that is accentuated due to surrounding opacification of the affected macula. Progressive neurodegeneration typically leads to death by age 2-5.\n\n(Choice A) Krabbe disease (galactocerebroside accumulation) is a lysosomal storage disease that causes progressive neurodegeneration. However, affected infants have optic atrophy, which is visualized as optic nerve pallor rather than a bright red fovea.\n\n(Choice B) Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder in which glucocerebroside accumulation results in bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone marrow suppression (eg, anemia, thrombocytopenia). This patient's normal abdominal examination and bright red fovea makes Gaucher disease unlikely.\n\n(Choice D) Mucopolysaccharidoses (eg, Hurler syndrome, Hunter syndrome) are lysosomal storage disorders characterized by the build-up of glycosaminoglycans such as heparan and dermatan sulfate. Patients have neurocognitive decline, but coarse facial features and hepatosplenomegaly are also expected. Although Hurler syndrome is associated with corneal clouding, neither mucopolysaccharidosis causes a cherry-red macula.\n\n(Choice E) Neurodegeneration and a cherry-red macular spot occur in Niemann-Pick disease, which is characterized by sphingomyelin accumulation. However, hepatosplenomegaly would be present and is not seen here.\n\nEducational objective:\nTay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by β-hexosaminidase A deficiency, which results in GM2 ganglioside accumulation in neuronal lysosomes. Key clinical features include progressive neurodegeneration (eg, developmental regression), an exaggerated startle reflex, and a cherry-red macular spot.",
    "zh": "该患者的运动技能丧失、过度惊吓反应和眼科表现最可能与Tay-Sachs病有关，这是一种常在亚什肯纳兹犹太人群中发现的常染色体隐性神经退行性疾病。Tay-Sachs病是由β-己糖胺酶A缺乏症引起的，导致溶酶体中GM2神经节苷脂（细胞膜的糖脂成分）的积累。\n\n患有Tay-Sachs病的婴儿通常在生命的头几个月正常发育，因为神经元溶酶体中神经节苷脂的逐渐积累最初不会引起细胞功能障碍。然而，到6个月大时，大脑中糖脂的积累会导致神经元破坏。随后的神经系统退化通常表现为发育迟缓，如该患者无法再坐或翻身。\n\n大脑和脊髓中神经元的进行性破坏导致巨头畸形、癫痫发作和痉挛，对声学刺激的夸张惊吓反射是脑干损伤的结果。神经节苷脂的积累也发生在视网膜中，但保留了中央凹，中央凹缺乏神经节细胞。这导致了特征性的眼底镜检查发现，即樱桃红色黄斑点，或鲜红色的未受影响的中央凹（反映了潜在的脉络膜），由于受影响黄斑周围的混浊而增强。进行性神经退行性变通常会导致2-5岁死亡。\n\n(选项 A) Krabbe病（半乳糖脑苷脂积累）是一种溶酶体贮积病，可引起进行性神经退行性变。然而，受影响的婴儿有视神经萎缩，表现为视神经苍白，而不是鲜红色的中央凹。\n\n(选项 B) Gaucher病是一种溶酶体贮积病，其中葡糖脑苷脂的积累导致骨痛、肝脾肿大和骨髓抑制（例如，贫血，血小板减少症）。该患者正常的腹部检查和鲜红色的中央凹使Gaucher病不太可能。\n\n(选项 D) 粘多糖贮积症（例如，Hurler综合征、Hunter综合征）是溶酶体贮积病，其特征是乙酰肝素和硫酸软骨素等糖胺聚糖的积累。患者会出现神经认知能力下降，但预计也会出现粗糙的面部特征和肝脾肿大。虽然Hurler综合征与角膜混浊有关，但两种粘多糖贮积症都不会引起樱桃红色黄斑。\n\n(选项 E) 神经退行性变和樱桃红色黄斑点发生在Niemann-Pick病中，其特征是鞘磷脂的积累。然而，肝脾肿大会出现，这里没有看到。\n\n教育目标：\nTay-Sachs病是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，由β-己糖胺酶A缺乏症引起，导致GM2神经节苷脂在神经元溶酶体中积累。关键临床特征包括进行性神经退行性变（例如，发育迟缓）、夸张的惊吓反射和樱桃红色黄斑点。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of lysosomal storage diseases, specifically Tay-Sachs disease, and its characteristic clinical presentation and underlying biochemical defect. It requires the ability to correlate symptoms such as developmental regression, macrocephaly, exaggerated startle reflex, and the pathognomonic cherry-red macular spot with the specific metabolite that accumulates due to a particular enzyme deficiency.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key clinical features presented in the vignette that are suggestive of a specific lysosomal storage disorder. Recall the enzyme deficiencies and the accumulating substrates for common lysosomal storage diseases. Tay-Sachs disease is strongly suggested by the combination of neurodegeneration, startle reflex, and cherry-red macula, pointing to GM2 ganglioside accumulation.",
