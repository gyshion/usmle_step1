    "en": "A 45-year-old woman brings her stepson to the office for a well-child visit. She never wanted children due to her unhappy childhood and wishes her marriage did not include being a stepmother to her husband's 5-year-old son. In the waiting room, the woman seems excessively concerned when the boy accidentally trips and is clearly uninjured. During the visit, she tells the physician that she adores the child and describes her elaborate preparations for his birthday party.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Reaction formation is a defense mechanism in which an individual transforms unacceptable feelings or impulses into their extreme opposites. This woman does not want to be a stepmother, and her resentment toward the child is masked with declarations of love. Her negative feelings toward the child are transformed into oversolicitous behavior in response to his tripping and excessive preparations for his birthday party.\n(Choice A) Displacement is the inappropriate transfer of feelings or impulses toward a less threatening object (eg, if this woman yelled at her dog instead of the child).\n(Choice B) Projection involves attributing unacceptable impulses or behavior to another person or situation (eg, if this woman accused her husband of disliking the child).\n(Choice C) In rationalization, an individual makes excuses for unacceptable feelings or behavior (eg, if this woman explained that she is much too old to be caring for a young child).\n(Choice E) Splitting is an immature defense mechanism in which an individual is unable to integrate mixed feelings (eg, if this woman alternately felt the boy was \"all bad\" and \"all good\"). It is commonly seen in personality disorder.\n(Choice F) Suppression is the voluntary withholding of unpleasant thoughts or feelings from one's mind in order to cope with reality (eg, if this woman acknowledged her resentment toward the child but chose to put it aside for the sake of her marriage).\n\nEducational objective:\nReaction formation is a defense mechanism that involves replacing unacceptable feelings and impulses with their extreme opposites.",
    "zh": "反向形成是一种防御机制，个体将不可接受的感觉或冲动转化为其极端对立面。这位女性不想成为继母，她对孩子的怨恨被爱意的表达所掩盖。她对孩子的负面情绪转化为过度殷勤的行为，以回应他绊倒和为他的生日派对所做的过度准备。\n(选项A) 移置是将感觉或冲动不适当地转移到威胁较小的对象上（例如，如果这位女性对她的狗大吼大叫而不是对孩子）。\n(选项B) 投射涉及将不可接受的冲动或行为归因于另一个人或情境（例如，如果这位女性指责她的丈夫不喜欢孩子）。\n(选项C) 在合理化中，个体为不可接受的感觉或行为找借口（例如，如果这位女性解释说她太老了，不能照顾一个小孩）。\n(选项E) 分裂是一种不成熟的防御机制，个体无法整合混合的感觉（例如，如果这位女性交替地认为这个男孩“一无是处”和“很好”）。这在人格障碍中很常见。\n(选项F) 压抑是自愿地从一个人的头脑中抑制不愉快的想法或感觉，以应对现实（例如，如果这位女性承认她对孩子的怨恨，但为了她的婚姻而选择将其搁置一旁）。\n\n教育目标：\n反向形成是一种防御机制，涉及用其极端对立面取代不可接受的感觉和冲动。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of various defense mechanisms and their application to clinical scenarios. It requires differentiating between similar defense mechanisms based on the patient's presentation and underlying emotional conflicts.\nTo solve this question, identify the patient's underlying unacceptable feelings or impulses and then determine which defense mechanism transforms these into their opposite. Analyze the patient's behavior and statements to infer the true emotions being masked and the mechanism used to achieve this transformation.",
