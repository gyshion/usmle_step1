    "en": "A 67-year-old man admitted for right lower lobe pneumonia subsequently develops hypotension and lactic acidosis. He is started on a norepinephrine intravenous drip. A few hours later, the antecubital vein being used for the infusion blanches and the tissues surrounding the IV site become cold, hard, and pale. Local injection of the affected tissues with which of the following agents is most likely to be of greatest benefit?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Development of venous blanching along with induration and pallor of the tissues surrounding the norepinephrine infusion site are signs of NOREPINEPHRINE EXTRAVASATION. The norepinephrine leak causes intense α₁ receptor mediated vasoconstriction which can lead to local TISSUE NECROSIS. Such necrosis can be prevented by infiltration (using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle) throughout the affected area with phentolamine, an α receptor blocker leading to vasodilation (thus counteracting the vasoconstrictive effects of norepinephrine). This antidote must be given within 12 hours of extravasation to be effective.\n\n(Choice A) Calcium gluconate is administered for severe hypocalcemia and for severe hyperkalemia (acts as a cardioprotective agent that prevents arrhythmias); it would not lead to the desired effect of vasodilation.\n\n(Choice C) Heparin is indicated if there is an arterial thrombosis (cold, pulseless, painful limb), but this patient does not have any risk factors for arterial thrombosis (eg, atrial fibrillation, arterial catheterization) and norepinephrine extravasation is a much more likely cause of his limb symptoms.\n\n(Choice D) Isoproterenol can mediate vasodilation via β₂ receptor activation, particularly in striated muscle, renal, and mesenteric vascular beds, leading to decreased peripheral vascular resistance with increased cardiac output. Subcutaneous tissue blood vessels have a relatively low β₂ receptor density compared to α1 receptors, thus, an alpha blocker would likely be more effective in reversing α₁ receptor mediated vasoconstriction.\n\n(Choice E) Lidocaine can relax vascular smooth muscle via blockade of Na⁺-current mediated action potentials. However, in this case, extravasation of norepinephrine is responsible for the vasoconstriction; nerve blockade would not reverse the ischemia.\n\nEducational objective:\nBlanching of a vein into which norepinephrine is being infused together with induration and pallor of the tissues surrounding the IV site are signs of norepinephrine extravasation and resulting vasoconstriction. Tissue necrosis is best prevented by local injection of an α receptor blocking drug, such as phentolamine.",
    "zh": "去甲肾上腺素输注部位周围静脉发白，伴有硬结和组织苍白，是去甲肾上腺素外渗的征象。去甲肾上腺素渗漏会引起强烈的α₁受体介导的血管收缩，这可能导致局部组织坏死。这种坏死可以通过使用酚妥拉明（一种α受体阻滞剂，导致血管舒张，从而抵消去甲肾上腺素的血管收缩作用）渗透（使用带有细皮下针头的注射器）到受影响区域来预防。这种解毒剂必须在外渗12小时内给予才能有效。\n\n（选项A）葡萄糖酸钙用于严重低钙血症和严重高钾血症（作为一种预防心律失常的心脏保护剂）；它不会导致所需的血管舒张作用。\n\n（选项C）如果存在动脉血栓形成（肢体冰冷、无脉搏、疼痛），则适用肝素，但该患者没有任何动脉血栓形成的危险因素（例如，房颤、动脉导管插入术），并且去甲肾上腺素外渗更有可能是他肢体症状的原因。\n\n（选项D）异丙肾上腺素可以通过β₂受体激活介导血管舒张，尤其是在横纹肌、肾脏和肠系膜血管床中，导致外周血管阻力降低，心输出量增加。皮下组织血管的β₂受体密度相对于α1受体较低，因此，α受体阻滞剂可能更有效地逆转α₁受体介导的血管收缩。\n\n（选项E）利多卡因可以通过阻断Na⁺电流介导的动作电位来松弛血管平滑肌。然而，在这种情况下，去甲肾上腺素外渗是血管收缩的原因；神经阻滞不会逆转缺血。\n\n教育目标：\n静脉注射去甲肾上腺素的静脉变白，以及输液部位周围组织的硬结和苍白，是去甲肾上腺素外渗和血管收缩的征象。组织坏死最好通过局部注射α受体阻滞剂（如酚妥拉明）来预防。"
