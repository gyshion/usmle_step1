    "en": "A 5-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to poor feeding, weakness, and complete loss of extremity muscle tone. He has had no fever or vomiting, but stool frequency has decreased. Vaccinations are up to date, and there is no significant medical history. The patient receives formula as his sole source of nutrition except for occasional fruit juice and honey. Physical examination reveals an alert but floppy infant who has a weak cry and diminished gag reflex.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This 5-month-old patient has consumed honey, a food notorious for contamination with Clostridium botulinum spores. Because infants have an immature digestive system compared to older children/adults, the pathogenic bacteria are more likely to germinate, colonize, and produce botulinum toxin, which is absorbed systemically and blocks the release of acetylcholine from cholinergic presynaptic terminals. In contrast, adult foodborne botulism usually results from ingestion of the preformed toxin (eg, contaminated canned foods).\n\nThe first manifestation of infant botulism is usually constipation followed days to weeks later by weakness, lethargy, and reduced feeding. In severe cases, infants can have a weak suck and cry, diminished gag reflex, and symmetric, descending flaccid paralysis (including extremities) with loss of head control that can cause the infant to appear floppy. Mental status is typically normal, as in this alert child, and fever is rare.\n\nThe diagnosis of infant botulism is clinical, but identification of C botulinum spores or toxin in stool is confirmatory. Treatment with botulinum antibodies is started before confirmatory testing is complete.\n\n(Choice A) Bacterial meningitis can cause poor feeding, weakness, and hypotonia; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture is diagnostic. In this patient, meningitis is less likely than botulism because of the lack of fever or bulging fontanelle plus the history of honey ingestion. If obtained, CSF culture in botulism is normal.\n\n(Choice B) Hyper-IgM syndrome primarily increases the risk for recurrent sinopulmonary and opportunistic infections (eg, Pneumocystis jiroveci), neither of which has been seen in this previously healthy child. Enteroviral meningoencephalitis risk is also increased in this condition, but patients are usually febrile with altered mental status (eg, lethargy).\n\n(Choice D) Certain inborn errors of metabolism (eg, maple syrup urine disease) can manifest with hypotonia, weakness, and poor feeding; urine amino acids and/or ketones are typically elevated. In contrast to this case, however, symptom onset is usually in the neonatal period, vomiting is a typical finding, and paralysis would not be expected.\n\n(Choice E) Ketonuria with glucosuria can occur in diabetic ketoacidosis, but this diagnosis would be extremely unlikely in a young infant and would not cause complete loss of tone. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "这名5个月大的患者食用了蜂蜜，蜂蜜因被肉毒梭菌孢子污染而臭名昭著。由于婴儿的消化系统与年龄较大的儿童/成人相比不成熟，病原菌更容易萌发、定植并产生肉毒毒素，该毒素会被全身吸收并阻断乙酰胆碱从胆碱能突触前末梢的释放。相比之下，成人食源性肉毒中毒通常是由于摄入了预先形成的毒素（例如，被污染的罐头食品）所致。\n\n婴儿肉毒中毒的第一个表现通常是便秘，几天到几周后会出现虚弱、嗜睡和喂养减少。在严重的情况下，婴儿可能会出现吸吮和哭泣无力、咽反射减弱以及对称性、下降性弛缓性麻痹（包括四肢），并丧失头部控制能力，这可能导致婴儿看起来松弛。精神状态通常是正常的，就像这个警觉的孩子一样，并且发烧很少见。\n\n婴儿肉毒中毒的诊断是临床诊断，但粪便中肉毒梭菌孢子或毒素的鉴定具有确诊意义。在确诊检测完成之前，就开始用肉毒杆菌抗体治疗。\n\n（选项A）细菌性脑膜炎可引起喂养不良、虚弱和肌张力减退；脑脊液（CSF）培养具有诊断意义。对于该患者，脑膜炎不如肉毒中毒的可能性大，因为没有发烧或囟门膨出，加上有食用蜂蜜的病史。如果获得，肉毒中毒的脑脊液培养是正常的。\n\n（选项B）高IgM综合征主要增加复发性呼吸道和机会性感染（例如，肺孢子虫病）的风险，在这名既往健康的儿童中均未出现。在这种情况下，肠道病毒性脑膜脑炎的风险也会增加，但患者通常会发烧并出现精神状态改变（例如，嗜睡）。\n\n（选项D）某些先天性代谢错误（例如，枫糖尿病）可表现为肌张力减退、虚弱和喂养不良；尿氨基酸和/或酮体通常升高。然而，与此病例相反，症状通常发生在新生儿期，呕吐是典型发现，并且不会出现麻痹。\n\n（选项E）糖尿病酮症酸中毒可发生酮尿和糖尿，但这种诊断在年幼婴儿中极不可能发生，也不会导致肌张力完全丧失。{{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of infant botulism, including its etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic confirmation. Infant botulism results from ingestion of Clostridium botulinum spores, commonly found in honey, leading to toxin production and neuromuscular blockade.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic presentation of infant botulism: constipation, weakness, poor feeding, and hypotonia in an infant who has consumed honey. The most definitive diagnostic test is identifying C botulinum spores or toxin in the stool.",
