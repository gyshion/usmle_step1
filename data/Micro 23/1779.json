    "en": "An epidemiologic study is conducted after a sudden increase in the rate of severe postoperative infections in a rural hospital. It is determined that all the patients who developed the infection were operated on with surgical instruments sterilized by a specific autoclave machine. The machine was found to be inadequately sterilizing the equipment due to a malfunction limiting the temperature to 100 C (212 F) during the 15 minute cycle. These patients most likely developed infection from which of the following bacteria?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Autoclave machines are pressure cookers that use heated steam at temperatures of 134 C (273.2 F) to rapidly destroy pathogenic bacteria, fungi, viruses, and spores. Lower temperatures are often associated with inadequate sterilization due to the presence of spore-forming bacteria, which can survive at temperatures past the boiling point of water (100 C [212 F]). Bacterial spores are often found in soil and water and are resistant to chemical disinfectants, irradiation, desiccation, and temperatures as high as 120 C (248 F). Bacillus (eg, Bacillus anthracis) and Clostridium (eg, Clostridium perfringens, C botulinum) species are among the most common spore-forming pathogenic bacteria.\n\n(Choices A, C, D, and E) These organisms do not form spores; vegetative bacteria are usually destroyed by temperatures >70 C (158 F).",
    "zh": "高压灭菌器是压力蒸煮器，使用134°C（273.2°F）的加热蒸汽来快速破坏病原菌、真菌、病毒和孢子。较低的温度通常与消毒不充分有关，这归因于存在形成孢子的细菌，这些细菌可以在超过水的沸点（100°C [212°F]）的温度下存活。细菌孢子经常存在于土壤和水中，并且对化学消毒剂、辐照、干燥和高达120°C（248°F）的温度具有抵抗力。芽孢杆菌（例如，炭疽芽孢杆菌）和梭菌（例如，产气荚膜梭菌、肉毒梭菌）是其中最常见的形成孢子的病原菌。\n\n（选项 A、C、D 和 E）这些生物体不形成孢子；营养型细菌通常在>70°C（158°F）的温度下被破坏。"
