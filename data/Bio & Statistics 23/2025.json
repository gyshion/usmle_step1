    "en": "A 12-year-old boy is evaluated in the clinic due to excessive bleeding following a tooth extraction. The patient also develops large bruises after only minor injury but has had no major bleeding episodes in the past. His maternal uncle died from an intracranial hemorrhage. Laboratory testing reveals decreased coagulation factor VIII activity levels. A referral is made to a clinical geneticist, who suspects that the patient has a deletion mutation in the enhancer sequence of the factor VIII gene. This mutation has resulted in decreased transcription of factor VIII by RNA polymerase II.",

    "en": "This patient has hemophilia A, an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by easy bruising and excessive bleeding due to a deficiency in coagulation factor VIII. The disorder can be caused by a variety of different mutations in the factor VIII gene, including deletions in the enhancer sequence. \n\nIn eukaryotic gene transcription, nuclear RNA polymerase II uses a DNA template to generate complementary mRNA, which is then processed and translated into protein. Eukaryotic genes have associated promoter and enhancer sequences that mediate transcription. Promoter sequences directly bind general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II upstream from the gene locus, which is necessary for the initiation of transcription (Choices C and E). There are 2 types of eukaryotic promoter regions: the TATA, or Hogness, box, which is located approximately 25 bases upstream from the gene being transcribed; and the CAAT box, which is 70-80 bases upstream from the gene. \n\nIn contrast to promoters, enhancer sequences bind activator proteins that facilitate bending of DNA. DNA bending allows activator proteins to interact with general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II at the promoter, increasing the rate of transcription (Choice D). Enhancers can be located upstream or downstream from the gene being transcribed and may be near the gene or thousands of base pairs away (Choice B). They have also been identified both within introns of the gene being transcribed as well as on separate chromosomes. Silencers are similar to enhancers, but they decrease transcription rates by binding repressor proteins. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nEducational objective:\nEnhancers and silencers may be located upstream, downstream, or within a transcribed gene; these gene sequences function to increase and decrease the rate of transcription, respectively. In contrast, promoter regions are typically located 25 or 75 bases upstream from their associated genes and function to initiate transcription.",
    "zh": "该患者患有血友病A，这是一种X连锁隐性遗传病，其特征是由于凝血因子VIII缺乏而导致的易于瘀伤和过度出血。该疾病可由因子VIII基因中的多种不同突变引起，包括增强子序列中的缺失。\n\n在真核基因转录中，核RNA聚合酶II使用DNA模板生成互补的mRNA，然后mRNA被加工并翻译成蛋白质。真核基因具有相关的启动子和增强子序列，这些序列介导转录。启动子序列直接与一般转录因子和RNA聚合酶II结合，位于基因位点上游，这对于转录的启动是必需的（选项C和E）。真核启动子区域有两种类型：TATA盒（或Hogness盒），位于转录基因上游大约25个碱基处；以及CAAT盒，位于基因上游70-80个碱基处。\n\n与启动子相反，增强子序列结合激活蛋白，从而促进DNA弯曲。DNA弯曲使激活蛋白能够与启动子上的一般转录因子和RNA聚合酶II相互作用，从而增加转录速率（选项D）。增强子可以位于转录基因的上游或下游，并且可以靠近基因或数千个碱基对之外（选项B）。它们也已在被转录基因的内含子内以及在单独的染色体上被鉴定出来。沉默子与增强子相似，但它们通过结合抑制蛋白来降低转录速率。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n教育目标：\n增强子和沉默子可以位于转录基因的上游、下游或内部；这些基因序列分别用于增加和降低转录速率。相反，启动子区域通常位于其相关基因上游25或75个碱基处，并起动转录的作用。"
