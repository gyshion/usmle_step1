    "en": "A 27-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up regarding a herniated disc. He first injured the disc 3 months ago while at work. Nonsurgical treatment options, including physical therapy and as-needed NSAIDs and tramadol, were recommended. The patient has completed physical therapy, and follow-up MRI indicates that the herniated disc has regressed. He reports a significant amount of ongoing pain and asks for a dose increase and refill of his pain medication. In the past month, the patient has been to the emergency department on 2 occasions to request pain medication due to running out before his next scheduled refill. Vital signs are within normal limits, and physical examination is unremarkable.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Pain is subjective, and physicians must use clinical judgment to balance effective pain management with prevention of drug overuse and misuse. Prescription opioid misuse has become an increasing occurrence in recent years. Signs of misuse include not taking medication as prescribed, requesting early refills, accessing drugs from multiple physicians or illicit sources, requesting higher doses, and refusing alternate pain-management strategies.\n\nThis patient is showing signs suggestive of opioid use disorder: running out of medication early; obtaining prescriptions in emergency departments rather than from the primary prescriber; tolerance (ie, requiring higher doses to attain the same effect); and dependence. However, confronting the patient about misuse at this point is unlikely to be helpful. The most appropriate initial action is a patient-centered approach: validating the patient's concern about pain control; engaging the patient in a nonjudgmental, collaborative discussion of how he is using the medication; and exploring reasons for the escalating use.\n\n(Choice A) This statement may be interpreted as confrontational and put the patient on the defensive. It fails to validate the patient's subjective experience of pain and instead focuses on the physician's concerns about dependence.\n\n(Choices B and E) These statements reject the patient's request for more medication without discussion and prematurely shut down the conversation. This approach is likely to frustrate the patient, making it less likely that he will be receptive to alternate approaches to pain management.\n\n(Choice C) This response prematurely switches the focus of the conversation to mood, ignoring the patient's concerns. Raising the possibility of self-medication of mood symptoms would be more appropriate once the patient has already engaged in a collaborative discussion of how he is using the medication.\n\nEducational objective:\nWhen misuse of prescription opioids is suspected, physicians should first engage patients in a nonjudgmental, collaborative discussion to understand the reasons for the misuse.",
    "zh": "疼痛是主观的，医生必须运用临床判断，平衡有效的疼痛管理与预防药物过度使用和滥用。处方阿片类药物的滥用近年来已变得越来越普遍。滥用的迹象包括未按处方服药、要求提前补充药物、从多个医生或非法渠道获取药物、要求更高剂量以及拒绝替代疼痛管理策略。\n\n该患者表现出提示阿片类药物使用障碍的迹象：过早用完药物；从急诊科而不是主要处方医生那里获得处方；耐受性（即需要更高剂量才能达到相同的效果）；和依赖性。然而，此时就滥用问题与患者对质不太可能有所帮助。最合适的初始行动是采取以患者为中心的方法：验证患者对疼痛控制的担忧；让患者参与关于他如何使用药物的非评判性、合作性讨论；并探讨使用量增加的原因。\n\n(选项A) 这种说法可能被解释为对抗性的，并使患者处于防御状态。它未能验证患者对疼痛的主观体验，而是侧重于医生对依赖性的担忧。\n\n(选项B和E) 这些说法在未经讨论的情况下拒绝了患者对更多药物的要求，并过早地结束了对话。这种方法可能会使患者感到沮丧，从而降低他接受替代疼痛管理方法的可能性。\n\n(选项C) 这种回应过早地将谈话的重点转移到情绪上，而忽略了患者的担忧。在患者已经参与了关于他如何使用药物的合作性讨论之后，提出自我用药情绪症状的可能性会更合适。\n\n教育目标：\n当怀疑滥用处方阿片类药物时，医生应首先让患者参与非评判性、合作性讨论，以了解滥用的原因。"
