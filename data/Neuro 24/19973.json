  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a mass compressing the inferior pons (eg, pontine glioma). Major nuclei in the pons include the following:\n\n* CN V: trigeminal motor nucleus (innervation to the muscles of mastication) and the main trigeminal nucleus (sensory innervation to the face and jaw)\n* CN VI: abducens nucleus (motor innervation to the lateral rectus muscle)\n* CN VII: facial nucleus (motor innervation to the muscles of facial expression)\n* CN VIII: dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei (hearing) and the vestibular nucleus (head position and movement)\n\nThe vestibular portion of CN VIII conveys information about head position and movement and is involved in the vestibulocochlear reflex (VOR), which stabilizes the gaze during head movement. Therefore, damage to the vestibular nuclei of CN VIII can lead to nystagmus due to impairment of the VOR.\n\n(Choice A) Asymmetric pupils can occur with damage to nuclei of the oculomotor nerve (CN III). The oculomotor nucleus provides motor innervation to the extraocular muscles, and the accessory nucleus (ie, Edinger-Westphal) provides parasympathetic input to the iris and lens (eg, pupillary constriction, iris accommodation). Both nuclei are located in the midbrain rather than the pons.\n\n(Choice C) Tongue atrophy can occur with damage to the nucleus of the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII). The hypoglossal nucleus is located in the medulla.\n\n(Choice D) The trapezius muscle is innervated by the accessory nerve (CN XI), which has fibers coming from the spinal accessory nucleus (located in the spinal cord) and the nucleus ambiguus (located in the medulla).\n\n(Choice E) Vertical diplopia can occur with damage to the nucleus of the trochlear nerve (CN IV), which innervates the superior oblique, or the oculomotor nucleus (CN III). Both nuclei are located in the midbrain.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe nuclei of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) are located in the pons. The vestibular portion of CN VIII conveys information about head position and movement and helps to stabilize the gaze during head movement; damage can lead to nystagmus.",
    "zh": "该患者患有压迫桥脑下部的肿块（例如，脑桥胶质瘤）。脑桥中的主要核包括：\n\n* CN V：三叉神经运动核（支配咀嚼肌）和三叉神经主感觉核（面部和下颌的感觉支配）\n* CN VI：外展神经核（支配外直肌的运动）\n* CN VII：面神经核（支配面部表情肌的运动）\n* CN VIII：背侧和腹侧耳蜗核（听觉）和前庭核（头部位置和运动）\n\nCN VIII 的前庭部分传递关于头部位置和运动的信息，并参与前庭-眼反射 (VOR)，从而稳定头部运动期间的注视。因此，CN VIII 的前庭核受损可导致眼球震颤，原因是 VOR 受损。\n\n(选项 A) 瞳孔不对称可发生在动眼神经 (CN III) 核受损时。动眼神经核为眼外肌提供运动支配，副核（即，Edinger-Westphal 核）为虹膜和晶状体提供副交感神经输入（例如，瞳孔收缩、虹膜调节）。这两个核均位于中脑而非脑桥。\n\n(选项 C) 舌萎缩可发生在舌下神经 (CN XII) 核受损时。舌下神经核位于延髓。\n\n(选项 D) 斜方肌由副神经 (CN XI) 支配，其纤维来自脊髓副核（位于脊髓）和疑核（位于延髓）。\n\n(选项 E) 垂直复视可发生在滑车神经 (CN IV)（支配上斜肌）或动眼神经核 (CN III) 受损时。这两个核都位于中脑。\n\n教育目标：\n前庭蜗神经 (CN VIII) 的核位于脑桥。CN VIII 的前庭部分传递关于头部位置和运动的信息，并有助于稳定头部运动期间的注视；损伤可导致眼球震颤。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of cranial nerve nuclei located in the pons and the clinical manifestations of their involvement by a pontine mass lesion. It requires correlating anatomical location of cranial nerve nuclei with their functions and potential deficits.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the location of the lesion (pons) and recall the cranial nerves whose nuclei reside in this brainstem region. Then, determine which of the given clinical signs is a direct consequence of damage to these specific nuclei.",
