    "en": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to fever, headache, vomiting, and confusion. He has no prior medical conditions and is up to date with immunizations. The patient has not traveled recently, and his parents report no exposure to individuals with similar symptoms or ingestion of anything out of the ordinary. They recently noticed several dead birds around their neighborhood. Temperature is 39 C (102.2 F). Physical examination shows neck rigidity and right lower extremity weakness with fasciculations. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a leukocyte count of 200/mm³ with 20% neutrophils and 80% lymphocytes.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "West Nile virus is an enveloped RNA virus that is found in warm climates worldwide. The virus replicates extensively within birds and is passed to mosquitoes (Culex species) during blood feeding. Viral accumulation in mosquito salivary glands can lead to human transmission.\n\nMost infected patients develop low-level viremia that is neutralized within a week by the immune system; these individuals typically remain asymptomatic. However, a minority of patients (particularly the young, elderly, or immunosuppressed) are unable to mount an effective immune response and develop significant clinical manifestations, including:\n\n*   West Nile fever – a self-limited, flu-like illness that is often associated with a maculopapular rash\n*   Neuroinvasive disease – the virus is neurotropic and often causes meningitis (eg, fever, headache, neck stiffness), encephalitis (eg, confusion, tremors, seizures), and/or flaccid paralysis (eg, asymmetric weakness of limbs, fasciculations). Cerebrospinal fluid usually shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis.\n\nMost patients recover completely with supportive care, but neuroinvasive disease may lead to long-term neurologic sequelae or death.\n\n(Choice A) Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus found in bird feces, can cause meningoencephalitis. However, the vast majority of infections occur in those with severe immunosuppression (eg, advanced AIDS). In addition, most patients with Cryptococcus meningitis have slowly progressive headache, lethargy, personality changes, and memory impairment (not focal neurologic deficits with fasciculations).\n\n(Choice B) Herpes simplex virus is a leading cause of sporadic encephalitis; it is usually characterized by confusion, focal neurologic deficits (eg, hemiparesis, dysphasia, cranial nerve defects), and seizures. It is not harbored in birds; cerebrospinal fluid usually shows elevated erythrocytes (in addition to lymphocytic pleocytosis); lower-motor neuron signs (eg, fasciculations) would not be seen.\n\n(Choice C) Nonpolio enteroviruses (eg, Coxsackievirus, echovirus) often cause aseptic (viral) meningitis and can occasionally cause encephalitis. However, these viruses are not associated with bird vectors and do not typically cause lower-motor neuron signs.\n\n(Choice D) Polio virus is a common cause of acute, asymmetric flaccid paralysis. Patients that have received age-appropriate vaccinations are very unlikely to develop the infection.\n\nEducational objective:\nWest Nile virus is harbored in birds and transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Most patients are asymptomatic, but the virus can cause an influenza-like illness or neuroinvasive disease with meningitis, encephalitis, and flaccid paralysis.",
    "zh": "西尼罗病毒是一种包膜 RNA 病毒，存在于全球温暖气候中。该病毒在鸟类中大量复制，并通过蚊子（库蚊）在吸血时传播。病毒在蚊子唾液腺中的积聚可导致人类传播。\n\n大多数感染患者会发生低水平的病毒血症，这种病毒血症在一周内会被免疫系统清除；这些个体通常保持无症状。然而，少数患者（尤其是年轻人、老年人或免疫功能低下者）无法产生有效的免疫反应，并出现明显的临床表现，包括：\n\n*   西尼罗热——一种自限性、流感样疾病，常伴有斑丘疹\n*   神经侵袭性疾病——该病毒具有神经嗜性，常引起脑膜炎（如发烧、头痛、颈部僵硬）、脑炎（如意识模糊、震颤、癫痫发作）和/或弛缓性麻痹（如肢体不对称性无力、肌束震颤）。脑脊液通常显示淋巴细胞增多。\n\n大多数患者通过支持性治疗可完全康复，但神经侵袭性疾病可能导致长期神经系统后遗症或死亡。\n\n（选项 A）新型隐球菌是一种存在于鸟粪中的真菌，可引起脑膜脑炎。然而，绝大多数感染发生在严重免疫抑制者（如晚期艾滋病）中。此外，大多数隐球菌性脑膜炎患者会出现缓慢进展的头痛、嗜睡、人格改变和记忆障碍（不是伴有肌束震颤的局灶性神经功能缺损）。\n\n（选项 B）单纯疱疹病毒是散发性脑炎的主要原因；其通常表现为意识模糊、局灶性神经功能缺损（如偏瘫、失语、颅神经缺陷）和癫痫发作。它不寄生于鸟类；脑脊液通常显示红细胞升高（除了淋巴细胞增多症）；不会出现下运动神经元体征（如肌束震颤）。\n\n（选项 C）非脊髓灰质炎肠道病毒（如柯萨奇病毒、埃可病毒）常引起无菌性（病毒性）脑膜炎，偶尔可引起脑炎。然而，这些病毒与鸟类媒介无关，并且通常不会引起下运动神经元体征。\n\n（选项 D）脊髓灰质炎病毒是急性、不对称性弛缓性麻痹的常见原因。接种过相应年龄疫苗的患者极不可能发生感染。\n\n教育目标：西尼罗病毒寄生于鸟类，通过蚊子传播给人类。大多数患者无症状，但该病毒可引起流感样疾病或神经侵袭性疾病，伴有脑膜炎、脑炎和弛缓性麻痹。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of West Nile virus infection, including its transmission, clinical presentation (especially neuroinvasive disease), and CSF findings. It also requires differentiating West Nile virus from other causes of meningitis and encephalitis.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's symptoms (fever, headache, confusion, neck rigidity, weakness, fasciculations), CSF findings (lymphocytic pleocytosis), and exposure history (dead birds).
