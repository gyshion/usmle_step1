    "en": "A 68-year-old woman is evaluated for vision impairment. The patient has a decrease in both distant and near vision and has had occasional floaters. She has had no pain or redness in her eyes, headache, focal weakness, or sensory loss. Medical history is notable for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Blood pressure is 138/84 mm Hg and pulse is 76/min. The pupils are equal and reactive to light bilaterally. Anterior chambers are clear, and there are no opacities of the cornea or lens. Funduscopic examination reveals scattered retinal microaneurysms, dot-and-blot hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots, as well as new blood vessel formation.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's presentation of decreased vision, floaters, and funduscopic findings of scattered retinal microaneurysms, dot-and-blot hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and new blood vessel formation is classic for PROLIFERATIVE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY (PDR). This condition is a result of chronic hyperglycemic injury to the small retinal vessels and is considered a microangiopathic complication of diabetes. The prevalence and severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR) are proportional to the duration of diabetes and the degree of hyperglycemia. \n\nDiabetic retinopathy is categorized as nonproliferative (early disease) and proliferative (advanced disease). Nonproliferative DR involves thickening of the basement membrane and failure of the blood-retinal barrier, leading to edema and lipid exudates. Ischemic injury manifests as cotton-wool spots and microaneurysms. Proliferative DR is characterized by progressive retinal ischemia, which stimulates the production of angiogenic factors, leading to the formation of new, fragile blood vessels (neovascularization). These vessels can extend into the vitreous, leading to vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and vision loss.\n\n(Choice A) Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) typically presents with slowly progressive central vision loss due to oxidative damage to the RPE and choriocapillaris. While some forms of AMD can involve neovascularization, the funduscopic findings described are more characteristic of diabetic retinopathy.\n\n(Choice C) Open-angle glaucoma is characterized by ganglion cell death due to elevated intraocular pressure, leading to peripheral vision loss. The funduscopic findings in glaucoma include optic disc cupping and thinning of the rim, which are not described here.\n\n(Choice D) Retinal arterial occlusion from atherosclerotic disease can cause sudden, painless vision loss, often with a cherry-red spot at the macula. While atherosclerosis can coexist with diabetes, the specific findings of microaneurysms, dot-and-blot hemorrhages, and neovascularization point more strongly to diabetic retinopathy.\n\n(Choice E) Vascular injury from increased intraluminal pressure is a general term. While hypertension (which this patient has) can contribute to vascular damage, the specific pattern of findings is most consistent with the microvascular complications of diabetes.\n\nKey clinical pearls:\n- DIABETIC RETINOPATHY is a leading cause of blindness in working-age adults.\n- PROLIFERATIVE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY is characterized by NEOVASCULARIZATION.\n- Cotton-wool spots indicate retinal ischemia.\n- Microaneurysms and dot-and-blot hemorrhages are signs of microvascular damage.",
    "zh": "患者表现为视力下降、飞蚊症，以及眼底检查发现散在的视网膜微动脉瘤、点状和斑状出血、棉絮斑和新生血管形成，这是增生性糖尿病视网膜病变 (PDR) 的典型表现。这种情况是慢性高血糖对视网膜小血管损伤的结果，被认为是糖尿病的微血管病变并发症。糖尿病视网膜病变 (DR) 的患病率和严重程度与糖尿病病程和高血糖程度成正比。\n\n糖尿病视网膜病变分为非增生性（早期疾病）和增生性（晚期疾病）。非增生性 DR 涉及基底膜增厚和血-视网膜屏障破坏，导致水肿和脂质渗出。缺血性损伤表现为棉絮斑和微动脉瘤。增生性 DR 的特点是进行性视网膜缺血，这会刺激血管生成因子的产生，导致形成新的、脆弱的血管（新生血管形成）。这些血管可以延伸到玻璃体，导致玻璃体出血、视网膜脱离和视力丧失。\n\n(选项 A) 与年龄相关的黄斑变性 (AMD) 通常表现为由于 RPE 和脉络膜毛细血管的氧化损伤引起的缓慢进展的中心视力丧失。虽然某些形式的 AMD 可能涉及新生血管形成，但所描述的眼底检查结果更具糖尿病视网膜病变的特征。\n\n(选项 C) 开角型青光眼的特征是由于眼内压升高引起的神经节细胞死亡，导致周边视力丧失。青光眼的眼底检查结果包括视盘凹陷和边缘变薄，此处未描述。\n\n(选项 D) 动脉粥样硬化性疾病引起的视网膜动脉阻塞可引起突发性、无痛性视力丧失，常伴有黄斑中心出现樱桃红点。虽然动脉粥样硬化可与糖尿病并存，但微动脉瘤、点状和斑状出血以及新生血管形成的特定发现更强烈地指向糖尿病视网膜病变。\n\n(选项 E) 血管内压升高引起的血管损伤是一个通用术语。虽然高血压（该患者患有）可能导致血管损伤，但特定的发现模式与糖尿病的微血管并发症最为一致。\n\n关键临床要点：\n- 糖尿病视网膜病变是工作年龄成人失明的主要原因。\n- 增生性糖尿病视网膜病变的特征是新生血管形成。\n- 棉絮斑表明视网膜缺血。\n- 微动脉瘤和点状斑状出血是微血管损伤的征象。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, specifically differentiating between nonproliferative and proliferative stages based on clinical findings. It assesses the ability to link chronic hyperglycemia to microvascular injury in the retina and its sequelae.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the key funduscopic findings (microaneurysms, dot-and-blot hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, neovascularization) and correlate them with the patient's history of diabetes mellitus. Recognize that these findings are indicative of diabetic retinopathy, and the presence of neovascularization signifies the proliferative stage, which is driven by chronic hyperglycemia-induced microvascular injury.",
