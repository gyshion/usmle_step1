    "en": "A 46-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to severe anal pain. He has a history of chronic constipation and on several occasions has noticed streaks of blood on the tissue paper after wiping. He has no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss and has no family history of malignancy. His temperature is 36.7 C (98 F). On examination, there are several large, purplish-blue sacs bulging into the anal canal, one of which originates below the dentate line and is extremely tender. Excision of the tender lesion under local anesthesia is planned. The anesthetic agent most likely blocks sensory impulses carried by which of the following structures?",
    "zh": "一名46岁男性因剧烈肛门疼痛就诊于急诊科。 他有慢性便秘病史，并且在几次擦拭后注意到卫生纸上有血丝。 他没有腹痛、恶心、呕吐或体重减轻，也没有恶性肿瘤家族史。 他的体温为36.7摄氏度（98华氏度）。 体格检查显示，肛管内有几个大的、紫蓝色的囊状物隆起，其中一个起源于齿状线以下，并且极度触痛。 计划在局部麻醉下切除压痛病灶。 这种麻醉剂最有可能阻断由以下哪个结构携带的传入感觉冲动？"

    "en": "This patient has both internal and external hemorrhoids, which each have a distinct epithelial lining and innervation. Internal hemorrhoids originate above the dentate line and are covered by columnar epithelium. They have autonomic innervation from the inferior hypogastric plexus, which is only sensitive to stretch and not pain, temperature, or touch.\n\nExternal hemorrhoids, which originate below the dentate line, are covered by modified squamous epithelium and have cutaneous (somatic) nervous innervation from the inferior rectal nerve, a branch of the pudendal nerve. Branches of the pudendal nerve supply the perineum and external genitalia in males and females and are very sensitive to touch, temperature, and pain. External hemorrhoids are generally asymptomatic but can become exquisitely painful if they thrombose, as in this case. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) The ilioinguinal nerve is mostly sensory, derived from L1, and carries sensation from skin of the upper and medial part of the thigh, the root of the penis and upper part of the scrotum in males, and the mons pubis and labia majora in females.\n\n(Choice B) The inferior gluteal nerve, composed of branches of L5, S1, and S2, is the main nerve supplying motor functions to the gluteus maximus muscle.\n\n(Choice C) The inferior hypogastric plexus, which has both sympathetic and parasympathetic components, innervates the internal pelvic viscera but not the external perirectal area.\n\n(Choice D) The pelvic splanchnic nerves are derived from S2, S3, and S4 and provide parasympathetic innervation to the pelvic and genital organs.\n\nEducational objective:\nExternal hemorrhoids, which originate below the dentate line, are covered by modified squamous epithelium and have cutaneous (somatic) nervous innervation from the inferior rectal nerve, a branch of the pudendal nerve.",
    "zh": "该患者患有内痔和外痔，两者都有不同的上皮衬里和神经支配。 内痔起源于齿状线以上，并由柱状上皮覆盖。 它们来自下腹下丛的自主神经支配，仅对牵张敏感，而对疼痛、温度或触觉不敏感。\n\n外痔起源于齿状线以下，由变异鳞状上皮覆盖，并由来自直肠下神经（阴部神经的分支）的皮肤（躯体）神经支配。 阴部神经的分支支配男性和女性的会阴和外生殖器，对触觉、温度和疼痛非常敏感。 外痔通常无症状，但如果血栓形成，则会变得非常疼痛，如本例所示。 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项A) 髂腹股沟神经主要是感觉神经，源于L1，并携带来自大腿上部和内侧部分皮肤、男性阴茎根部和阴囊上部的感觉，以及女性的阴阜和大阴唇。\n\n(选项B) 臀下神经由L5、S1和S2的分支组成，是支配臀大肌运动功能的主要神经。\n\n(选项C) 下腹下丛具有交感神经和副交感神经成分，支配盆腔内脏，但不支配肛周外区域。\n\n(选项D) 盆内脏神经源自S2、S3和S4，为盆腔和生殖器官提供副交感神经支配。\n\n教育目标：\n外痔起源于齿状线以下，由变异鳞状上皮覆盖，并由来自直肠下神经（阴部神经的分支）的皮肤（躯体）神经支配。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of the innervation of the anal canal and perianal region, specifically the difference between internal and external hemorrhoids and their respective nerve supplies. It requires understanding that external hemorrhoids are innervated by the pudendal nerve, which carries somatic sensory information including pain and temperature.\n\nTo solve this question, identify that the tender lesion is an external hemorrhoid (below the dentate line). Recall that external hemorrhoids are innervated by the pudendal nerve. Therefore, an anesthetic agent would need to block the pudendal nerve to alleviate the pain.",
    "zh": "此题考察对肛管和肛周区域神经支配的知识，特别是内痔和外痔的区别及其各自的神经供应。 它需要理解外痔由阴部神经支配，该神经携带躯体感觉信息，包括疼痛和温度。\n\n为了解决这个问题，确定压痛病灶是外痔（在齿状线以下）。 回忆一下外痔是由阴部神经支配的。 因此，麻醉剂需要阻断阴部神经以缓解疼痛。"
