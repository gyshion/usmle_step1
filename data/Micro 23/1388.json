    "en": "A 62-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to 3 days of severe sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and hoarseness. He has no chronic medical conditions but has not seen a physician for many years. The patient received recommended childhood vaccinations but has had none since then. He is a farmer and has not traveled recently but has been in contact with migrant farmworkers. Temperature is 38.3 C (101 F), blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg, and pulse is 116/min. Physical examination reveals pharyngeal erythema and edema with coalescing, gray exudate. Bilateral cervical lymph nodes are enlarged and tender. A rapid streptococcal test result is negative. Throat swab culture grows non-spore-forming, gram-positive rods.",

    "en": "Diphtheria is caused by infection with toxigenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a non-spore-forming, gram-positive rod that is transmitted by aerosolized droplets. Cases are rare in the United States due to widespread vaccination efforts. However, infections can occur in those who received inadequate childhood vaccines or who did not receive booster vaccination every 10 years.\n\nThe manifestations of diphtheria are due to the elaboration of diphtheria toxin (DT), an exotoxin that irreversibly inhibits host protein synthesis by ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor-2. Local effects include pharyngitis and tonsillitis, often with thick, grey-white pseudomembranes. Systemic effects are caused by the absorption of DT into the bloodstream and include potentially life-threatening cardiac (eg, myocarditis) and neurologic complications.\n\nThe primary treatment for diphtheria is the urgent administration of diphtheria antitoxin, which contains preformed, neutralizing antibodies that binds and inactivates circulating toxin. Because it cannot inhibit the toxin that has already entered cells, it should be administered as soon as possible. Antibiotic therapy (eg, penicillin, erythromycin) is also given to reduce continued elaboration of DT from the nasopharyngeal tissue.\n\n(Choice A) Inhaled, racemic epinephrine can be used in the treatment of croup, which usually presents with cough, inspiratory stridor, and/or hoarseness. Epinephrine could reduce airway swelling in patients with diphtheria, but it would not inhibit the local and systemic effects of the toxin.\n\n(Choice B) C diphtheriae is noninvasive and does not typically enter the bloodstream. Although antibiotics are administered in acute infection, this component of therapy is less important than providing antitoxin to neutralize DT.\n\n(Choice C) Corticosteroids are sometimes used in the treatment of epiglottitis to reduce airway inflammation and limit the risk of airway compromise. Epiglottitis manifestations typically include stridor, drooling, respiratory distress, and the assumption of the \"tripod\" position. Most cases are caused by infection with Haemophilus influenzae type B in unvaccinated individuals.\n\n(Choice E) Active immunization with the diphtheria toxoid (given as part of the childhood DTaP vaccine) prevents diphtheria. Diphtheria toxoid can also be given as part of tetanus boosters in adults. However, the immune response to vaccination is slow; in undervaccinated patients who are acutely ill, administration of preformed antitoxin antibodies is preferred.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe primary treatment for diphtheria is diphtheria antitoxin (passive immunization), which inactivates circulating toxin. Antibiotics should also be administered to reduce continued production of toxin.",
    "zh": "白喉由产毒性C. diphtheriae菌株感染引起，这是一种非产孢革兰氏阳性杆菌，通过气溶胶飞沫传播。由于广泛的疫苗接种工作，在美国病例很少见。然而，感染可能发生在那些接种了不充分的儿童疫苗或每10年未接种加强疫苗的人中。\n\n白喉的临床表现是由于白喉毒素（DT）的产生，这是一种外毒素，通过ADP-核糖基化延伸因子-2不可逆地抑制宿主蛋白质合成。局部影响包括咽炎和扁桃体炎，通常伴有厚厚的灰白色假膜。全身影响是由DT吸收到血液中引起的，包括潜在的危及生命的cardiac（如心肌炎）和神经系统并发症。\n\n白喉的主要治疗方法是紧急给予白喉抗毒素，其中包含预制的、中和抗体，可结合并灭活循环毒素。由于它不能抑制已经进入细胞的毒素，因此应尽快给药。抗生素治疗（如青霉素、红霉素）也可用于减少鼻咽组织中DT的持续产生。\n\n（选项A）吸入，外消旋肾上腺素可用于治疗哮吼，通常表现为咳嗽、吸气性喘鸣和/或声音嘶哑。肾上腺素可以减轻白喉患者的气道肿胀，但它不会抑制毒素的局部和全身影响。\n\n（选项B）C. diphtheriae不具有侵袭性，通常不会进入血液。尽管在急性感染中给予抗生素，但这种治疗方法不如提供抗毒素以中和DT重要。\n\n（选项C）有时使用皮质类固醇治疗会厌炎，以减轻气道炎症并限制气道受损的风险。会厌炎的临床表现通常包括喘鸣、流涎、呼吸窘迫和“三脚架”姿势。大多数病例是由未接种疫苗的个体感染B型流感嗜血杆菌引起的。\n\n（选项E）用白喉类毒素（作为儿童DTaP疫苗的一部分给予）进行主动免疫可预防白喉。白喉类毒素也可作为成人破伤风加强针的一部分给予。然而，对疫苗接种的免疫反应很慢；在未充分接种疫苗的急性病人中，首选给予预制抗毒素抗体。\n\n教育目标：\n白喉的主要治疗方法是白喉抗毒素（被动免疫），可灭活循环毒素。还应给予抗生素以减少毒素的持续产生。"
