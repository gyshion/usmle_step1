The patient is exclusively breastfed, with height and weight tracking along the 50th percentiles. Vital signs are normal. Skin examination is shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable. Which of the following conditions is this patient at increased risk for developing?",

    "en": "This infant with erythematous and pruritic patches on her cheeks has atopic dermatitis (eczema), a common childhood condition that typically begins in infancy or early childhood. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nThe pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis is multifactorial and includes genetically mediated skin barrier dysfunction (eg, filaggrin mutation) resulting in loss of epidermal water content, increased permeability to environmental allergens/irritants, and skin inflammation. In addition, immune dysfunction, characterized by an underlying Th2 skewed response, promotes IL-4 and IL-13 release, which stimulates IgE production by plasma cells. {{exhibit_3}}\n\nPatients with atopic dermatitis and elevated IgE levels are at increased risk for other atopic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, and food allergies. A compromised skin barrier facilitates allergen penetration (eg, from food) and subsequent sensitization, facilitating the development of food-induced urticaria and anaphylaxis. An earlier onset of atopic dermatitis (eg, infancy) is associated with a higher risk for developing these associated conditions. {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choice A) Kawasaki disease, a medium-sized vessel vasculitis, is associated with coronary artery aneurysms. Patients have a polymorphous rash, in addition to fever, mucocutaneous inflammation, cervical lymphadenopathy, and extremity changes (eg, edema), none of which are seen in this case.\n\n(Choice B) Disabling arthritis can be associated with plaque psoriasis, which classically presents with thick, silvery scales involving the knees, elbows, scalp, and lower back, features not seen in this patient.\n\n(Choice D) Proximal muscle weakness is characteristic of juvenile dermatomyositis, which can cause facial erythema but classically presents with a heliotrope rash on the upper eyelids. In addition, the onset typically occurs in school-aged children, not infants.\n\n(Choice E) Parvovirus B19 can cause transient anemia due to viral destruction of erythrocyte progenitor cells, typically in patients with red blood cell disorders (eg, sickle cell anemia). Initial symptoms include a nonspecific prodrome (eg, fever, coryza), followed by a nonpruritic, malar rash (ie, slapped cheeks) in school-aged children. This patient’s age, lack of prodromal symptoms, and pruritus make this diagnosis unlikely.\n\nEducational objective:\nAtopic dermatitis increases the risk for allergic rhinitis, asthma, and food allergies, likely because of an immune response that favors IgE production. In addition, skin barrier dysfunction facilitates food allergen penetration and sensitization, increasing the risk for food allergies. {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "这位婴儿脸颊上有红斑和瘙痒斑块，患有特应性皮炎（湿疹），这是一种常见的儿童疾病，通常始于婴儿期或幼儿期。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n特应性皮炎的发病机制是多因素的，包括基因介导的皮肤屏障功能障碍（例如，聚丝蛋白突变），导致表皮水分含量下降、对环境过敏原/刺激物的通透性增加和皮肤炎症。此外，免疫功能障碍，其特征是潜在的Th2偏向反应，促进IL-4和IL-13的释放，从而刺激浆细胞产生IgE。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n患有特应性皮炎和IgE水平升高的患者，发生其他特应性疾病（如过敏性鼻炎、哮喘和食物过敏）的风险增加。受损的皮肤屏障促进过敏原（例如，来自食物）的渗透，并随后发生致敏，促进食物诱发的荨麻疹和过敏性休克的发生。特应性皮炎的早期发病（例如，婴儿期）与发生这些相关病症的风险较高相关。{{exhibit_4}}\n\n（选项A）川崎病，一种中型血管血管炎，与冠状动脉瘤相关。患者除发烧、黏膜皮肤炎症、颈部淋巴结病和肢端改变（例如，水肿）外，还出现多形性皮疹，而本例中均未见。\n\n（选项B）致残性关节炎可与斑块状银屑病相关，后者典型表现为膝盖、肘部、头皮和下背部出现厚而银色的鳞屑，而本患者未见这些特征。\n\n（选项D）近端肌无力是幼年性皮肌炎的特征，可引起面部红斑，但典型表现为上眼睑出现向日葵皮疹。此外，发病通常发生在学龄儿童，而不是婴儿。\n\n（选项E）B19型细小病毒可导致短暂性贫血，这是由于病毒破坏红细胞祖细胞，通常发生在患有红细胞疾病（例如，镰状细胞性贫血）的患者中。最初的症状包括非特异性前驱症状（例如，发烧、鼻炎），随后在学龄儿童中出现非瘙痒性面颊红斑（即，拍打面颊）。该患者的年龄、缺乏前驱症状和瘙痒使其不太可能做出该诊断。\n\n教育目标：\n特应性皮炎会增加发生过敏性鼻炎、哮喘和食物过敏的风险，这可能是因为免疫反应有利于IgE的产生。此外，皮肤屏障功能障碍促进食物过敏原的渗透和致敏，从而增加食物过敏的风险。{{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"
