He makes inappropriate sexual jokes, has little regard for social rules, is often irritable, and is borderline aggressive at times. The patient denies that his personality is any different from normal. When speaking with the patient, the physician notices that he has minimal verbal output and repeats \"it is what it is\" when asked questions about his strange behavior. On physical examination, he appears unkempt but otherwise has no significant findings. This patient most likely has a condition that predominantly involves which of the following structures? {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}}",

    "en": "This patient's personality and behavioral changes (eg, disinhibition, apathy, social inappropriateness, compulsive behaviors) and altered speech patterns (eg, paucity of speech, repeated phrases) are consistent with a diagnosis of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Personality and behavioral changes present early in the disease course with neurocognitive deficits occurring later. FTD is highly heritable and a common cause of early-onset dementia.\n\nFTD is characterized by initial degeneration of the prefrontal cortex that eventually progresses to include the anterior temporal cortex. Loss of function in the prefrontal cortex can cause inappropriate behavior, impaired judgment, and poor problem-solving skills (ie, executive dysfunction).\n\n(Choice B) The caudate nucleus and putamen are basal ganglia structures that together form the dorsal striatum, which regulates voluntary movements. Huntington disease causes atrophy of the dorsal striatum (there is greater relative atrophy of the caudate) and presents with choreiform movements, psychiatric symptoms (eg, irritability, depression), and dementia. This patient's prominent personality changes and lack of a movement disorder are not characteristic of Huntington disease.\n\n(Choice C) Neuronal loss in the locus ceruleus and substantia nigra is seen in Parkinson disease, which typically presents with tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. The locus ceruleus is a pontine structure that is one of the primary areas of norepinephrine synthesis in the brain. The substantia nigra, located in the midbrain, contains dopaminergic neurons whose axons project to the striatum (nigrostriatal pathway) and participate in regulation of voluntary movements.\n\n(Choice D) Damage to the mammillary bodies and medial thalamus is characteristic of chronic Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome. Both disorders result from chronic THIAMINE DEFICIENCY, most often in the context of heavy alcohol use.\n\n(Choice E) Medial temporal and parietal cortical atrophy is characteristic of Alzheimer disease. The medial temporal lobe contains the hippocampus, a structure involved in the formation of new memories.\n\n(Choice F) Disproportionate atrophy of the parietal and occipital cortices is seen in posterior cortical atrophy, an atypical variant of Alzheimer disease with prominent visual symptoms.\n\nEducational objective:\nFrontotemporal dementia is associated with pronounced atrophy of the prefrontal cortex with later degeneration of the anterior temporal cortex. It manifests initially with changes in personality, social behavior, and language that progress over time to a more global dementia with obvious neurocognitive deficits.",
    "zh": "该患者的性格和行为改变（例如，去抑制、冷漠、社会不适应、强迫行为）和言语模式改变（例如，言语贫乏、重复短语）与行为变异型额颞叶痴呆（FTD）的诊断相符。性格和行为改变在疾病早期出现，神经认知缺陷在后期出现。FTD具有高度遗传性，是早发性痴呆的常见原因。\n\nFTD的特征是前额叶皮质的最初变性，最终进展到包括前颞叶皮质。前额叶皮质的功能丧失会导致不适当的行为、判断力受损和解决问题的能力差（即，执行功能障碍）。\n\n(选项B) 尾状核和壳核是基底神经节结构，它们共同形成背侧纹状体，后者调节自主运动。亨廷顿病引起背侧纹状体萎缩（尾状核相对萎缩更严重），并表现为舞蹈病样运动、精神症状（例如，易怒、抑郁）和痴呆。该患者突出的性格改变和缺乏运动障碍并非亨廷顿病的特征。\n\n(选项C) 蓝斑和黑质的神经元缺失见于帕金森病，其典型表现为震颤、运动迟缓和强直。蓝斑是脑桥结构，是大脑中去甲肾上腺素合成的主要区域之一。黑质位于中脑，含有多巴胺能神经元，其轴突投射到纹状体（黑质纹状体通路）并参与自主运动的调节。\n\n(选项D) 乳头体和丘脑内侧的损伤是慢性韦尼克脑病和柯萨克夫综合征的特征。这两种疾病均由慢性硫胺素缺乏引起，最常见于大量饮酒的情况下。\n\n(选项E) 内侧颞叶和顶叶皮质萎缩是阿尔茨海默病的特征。内侧颞叶包含海马体，海马体是参与新记忆形成的结构。\n\n(选项F) 顶叶和枕叶皮质的非对称萎缩见于后皮质萎缩，这是阿尔茨海默病的一种非典型变异，具有明显的视觉症状。\n\n教育目标：\n额颞叶痴呆与前额叶皮质的明显萎缩以及随后前颞叶皮质的变性有关。它最初表现为性格、社会行为和语言的变化，这些变化会随着时间的推移而发展为更全面的痴呆症，并伴有明显的神经认知缺陷。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the clinical presentation and underlying pathophysiology of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), specifically the behavioral variant. It requires recognizing the early personality and behavioral changes, along with language alterations, as key features of FTD. \n\nThe best approach is to associate the clinical findings (personality changes, disinhibition, altered speech) with the specific brain regions affected in FTD (prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices). Rule out other dementias based on their distinct clinical features and associated brain structures.",
