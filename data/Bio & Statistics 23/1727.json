  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The pedigree shows that only males are affected by the drug intolerance. Specifically, MALE OFFSPRING OF UNAFFECTED PARENTS are affected. There is no evidence of male-to-male transmission. This pattern is most consistent with X-LINKED RECESSIVE inheritance from an asymptomatic carrier female in the first generation. In X-LINKED RECESSIVE inheritance:\n\n1.  Affected males will always produce UNAFFECTED sons and carrier daughters.\n2.  Carrier females have a 50% chance of producing an affected son or carrier daughter.",
    "zh": "家系图显示只有男性受到药物不耐受的影响。具体来说，未受影响的父母的男性后代受到影响。没有证据表明存在男性之间的传播。这种模式与第一代无症状携带者女性的X连锁隐性遗传最为一致。在X连锁隐性遗传中：\n\n1. 受影响的男性将始终产生未受影响的儿子和携带者女儿。\n2. 携带者女性有50%的几率产生受影响的儿子或携带者女儿。"
