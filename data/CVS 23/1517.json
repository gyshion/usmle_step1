    "en": "This patient with an audible snap followed by a rumbling diastolic murmur over the cardiac apex likely has MITRAL STENOSIS, which is most commonly seen due to underlying rheumatic heart disease in patients emigrating from Latin America, Africa, or Asia. The audible snap observed with mitral stenosis is created by the stenotic and calcified valve snapping open (ie, OPENING SNAP) and is heard during mitral valve opening at point 4.\n\nEducational objective:\nMitral stenosis is characterized by an opening snap followed by a rumbling diastolic murmur that is best heard over the cardiac apex. On the left ventricular pressure-volume loop, the opening snap occurs during mitral valve opening at the end of isovolumetric relaxation, and it is followed by a diastolic rumble during diastolic filling.\n\n1.  Isovolumetric contraction: The cardiac cycle begins with initiation of left ventricular contraction and closure of the mitral valve at point 1; an S1 is heard at this time, marking the end of diastole (Choice A). Although intraventricular pressure increases after point 1, initially, no blood leaves the ventricle because both the aortic and mitral valves are closed. At point 2, LV pressure overcomes systemic diastolic pressure and the aortic valve opens (Choice B).\n\n2.  Ventricular ejection: LV volume decreases as blood is ejected into the aorta. The peak of the ejection curve denotes systolic blood pressure and represents the high point of LV afterload (Choice E). LV ejection ends at point 3 with aortic valve closure and an S2 is heard (Choice C). The horizontal distance between point 2 (or point 1) and point 3 represents the stroke volume.\n\n3.  Isovolumetric relaxation: LV pressure rapidly falls from point 3 to point 4. No blood leaves or enters the left ventricle during this time because both the aortic and mitral valves are closed.\n\n4.  Ventricular filling: The mitral valve opens at point 4 and diastolic filling of the left ventricle begins. LV volume and pressure gradually increase until mitral valve closure occurs again at point 1 and the cycle begins anew. Extra heart sounds (ie, an S3 or S4) may be heard during diastolic filling between point 4 and point 1 (Choice F).",
    "zh": "这位患者在心尖部有可听到的“喀嗒”声，随后是隆隆的舒张期杂音，很可能患有二尖瓣狭窄，这最常见于从拉丁美洲、非洲或亚洲移民的患者中，其潜在原因是风湿性心脏病。 在二尖瓣狭窄中观察到的可听到的“喀嗒”声是由狭窄和钙化的瓣膜突然打开（即，开放性喀嗒声）产生的，并且在二尖瓣开放时在点 4 处听到。\n\n教育目标：\n二尖瓣狭窄的特征是开放性喀嗒声，随后是隆隆的舒张期杂音，最好在心尖部听到。 在左心室压力-容积环上，开放性喀嗒声发生在二尖瓣开放期间，即等容舒张结束时，随后在舒张充盈期间出现舒张期隆隆声。\n\n1.  等容收缩：心脏周期始于左心室收缩开始和二尖瓣在点 1 处关闭；此时可听到 S1，标志着舒张期的结束（选项 A）。 虽然心室内压在点 1 后增加，但最初没有血液离开心室，因为主动脉瓣和二尖瓣都已关闭。 在点 2 处，左心室压力克服全身舒张压，主动脉瓣打开（选项 B）。\n\n2.  心室射血：左心室容积减少，血液被射入主动脉。 射血曲线的峰值表示收缩压，代表左心室后负荷的最高点（选项 E）。 左心室射血在点 3 结束，伴有主动脉瓣关闭，并听到 S2（选项 C）。 点 2（或点 1）和点 3 之间的水平距离代表每搏输出量。\n\n3.  等容舒张：左心室压力从点 3 迅速下降到点 4。 在此期间，没有血液离开或进入左心室，因为主动脉瓣和二尖瓣都已关闭。\n\n4.  心室充盈：二尖瓣在点 4 处打开，左心室开始舒张充盈。 左心室容积和压力逐渐增加，直到二尖瓣再次在点 1 处关闭，周期重新开始。 在舒张充盈期间，在点 4 和点 1 之间可能会听到额外的杂音（即 S3 或 S4）（选项 F）。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of cardiac pressure-volume loops and the pathophysiology of mitral stenosis, specifically the timing of the opening snap. It requires understanding the different phases of the cardiac cycle and their corresponding points on the pressure-volume loop.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that the opening snap in mitral stenosis occurs during the opening of the mitral valve, which corresponds to the end of isovolumetric relaxation and the beginning of ventricular filling. Identify the point on the pressure-volume loop that represents this phase.",
