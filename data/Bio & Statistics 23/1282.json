    "en": "A medical student is conducting a chart review of patients admitted to the local emergency department with acute pancreatitis. He is interested in comparing blood glucose levels between mild and severe cases. Before attempting to compare the mean blood glucose levels between the 2 groups of patients, he decides to conduct a descriptive analysis of the variables in each group. Blood glucose levels in patients with severe acute pancreatitis were found to have a strong positively skewed distribution.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The symmetrical bell-shaped curve is usually cited as the prototypical curve describing the distribution of a continuous variable. However, in actual research scenarios, continuous variables often have asymmetrical distributions. When a distribution curve is asymmetric, it is either positively or negatively skewed:\n\n*   In a positively skewed distribution, there is an increased number of observations with larger-than-expected magnitudes (ie, extreme values) that shift the mean toward the right, producing a longer slope of the curve.\n*   In a negatively skewed distribution, there is an increased number of observations with smaller-than-expected magnitudes that shift the mean toward the left, producing a longer slope of the curve (“tail”) on the negative side of the distribution.\n\nIn general, in a positively skewed distribution, the mean is the most shifted in the positive direction, followed by the median and then the mode (mode < median < mean). In such a situation, the median often reflects a central tendency better than the mean does.\n\n(Choices A and B) In perfectly normal distribution curves where there is no skew, all 3 measures of central tendency are precisely equal: mean = median = mode. If a minor skew is present, the 3 measures are approximately equal.\n\n(Choices D and E) In general, in a negatively skewed distribution (with the “tail” on the left), the mean is the most shifted in the negative direction, followed by the median and then the mode.",
    "zh": "对称的钟形曲线通常被引用为描述连续变量分布的原型曲线。然而，在实际研究场景中，连续变量通常具有不对称分布。当分布曲线不对称时，它要么是正偏态，要么是负偏态：\n\n*   在正偏态分布中，具有大于预期值的观测值（即，极端值）数量增加，这会将均值向右移动，从而产生更长的曲线斜率。\n*   在负偏态分布中，具有小于预期值的观测值数量增加，这会将均值向左移动，从而在分布的负侧产生更长的曲线斜率（“尾部”）。\n\n一般来说，在正偏态分布中，均值向正方向移动最多，其次是中位数，然后是众数（众数 < 中位数 < 均值）。在这种情况下，中位数通常比均值更好地反映中心趋势。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）在没有偏度的完全正态分布曲线中，所有 3 个集中趋势的度量值完全相等：均值 = 中位数 = 众数。如果存在轻微的偏度，则这 3 个度量值大致相等。\n\n（选项 D 和 E）一般来说，在负偏态分布中（“尾部”在左侧），均值向负方向移动最多，其次是中位数，然后是众数。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of statistical distributions, specifically positively skewed distributions, and the relationship between mean, median, and mode in such distributions. Understanding how extreme values affect the mean is critical.\n\nTo solve this, recall that in a positively skewed distribution, the mean is pulled towards the tail (right), making it larger than the median and mode. The order from lowest to highest is: mode < median < mean. Eliminating answers that do not reflect this relationship leads to the correct answer.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试了关于统计分布的知识，特别是正偏态分布，以及在这种分布中均值、中位数和众数之间的关系。了解极端值如何影响均值至关重要。\n\n要解决这个问题，请记住，在正偏态分布中，均值被拉向尾部（右侧），使其大于中位数和众数。从最低到最高的顺序是：众数 < 中位数 < 均值。消除不反映这种关系的答案可以得到正确答案。"
