    "en": "A 33-year-old man comes to the office due to back pain. He has a 2-week history of moderate pain in the lumbar area that started after a long day of yard work. There is no associated fever, motor weakness, or urinary symptoms. The patient has no history of acute trauma and medical history is unremarkable. Examination shows normal lower extremity strength, sensation, and reflexes. Straight-leg raising test is negative. The patient says: \"My brother had similar pain last year and his MRI scan showed a bulging disc. Can you order that test for me?\" The clinician offers options for symptomatic relief but recommends against performing any imaging studies.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has acute, uncomplicated low back pain (LBP) with no \"red-flag\" features (eg, fever, neurologic deficits) to suggest a serious cause. Uncomplicated LBP usually resolves spontaneously, and management is directed toward providing temporary symptomatic relief. Imaging (eg, x-ray, MRI scan) is generally not recommended because it does not improve outcomes or provide necessary information for optimal management.\n\nOverutilization refers to provision of unnecessary services that are not expected to improve patient outcomes or meaningfully change management. Patient-centered health care requires care to be delivered with respect to the patients' concerns, preferences, and priorities, but does not require unnecessary testing or treatment if patient input is otherwise solicited and respected when appropriate. MRI in uncomplicated LBP increases overutilization and is therefore not recommended for this patient.\n\n(Choice A) Spinal MRI often identifies nonspecific abnormalities (eg, bulging intervertebral discs) that are not relevant to management but can lead to further unnecessary and potentially harmful diagnostic studies and interventions. Because of the frequency of such abnormalities, even in asymptomatic individuals, it is often not clear whether they are the actual cause of pain or merely an incidental finding. Deferring imaging therefore decreases, rather than increases, diagnostic uncertainty.\n\n(Choice B) Fragmentation of health care refers to breaking up care across multiple providers and facilities without adequate cross communication. Declining to order unnecessary tests does not lead to fragmentation.\n\n(Choice C) Health care disparity refers to differences in access to care or outcomes due to socioeconomic or demographic factors. Careful and appropriate use of diagnostic studies does not increase disparity.\n\n(Choice D) Malpractice liability risk correlates most closely with provider-patient communication and perceived level of concern. Appropriate use of diagnostic studies, especially as it conforms to evidence-based guidelines, does not increase malpractice risk.\n\n(Choice E) Clinical standardization refers to consistency of management decisions within and across provider groups. Care that conforms to established guidelines increases, not decreases, standardization.\n\nEducational objective:\nOverutilization refers to provision of services that are not expected to improve patient outcomes or meaningfully change management. Patient-centered health care requires care to be delivered with respect to patients' concerns, preferences, and priorities, but does not require unnecessary testing or treatment if patient input is otherwise solicited and respected when appropriate.",
    "zh": "该患者患有急性、非复杂性腰痛（LBP），没有“危险信号”特征（如发热、神经功能缺损）提示严重病因。非复杂性腰痛通常会自发缓解，管理旨在提供暂时的对症缓解。通常不推荐影像学检查（如X光、MRI扫描），因为它不能改善预后或为最佳管理提供必要信息。\n\n过度医疗是指提供预期不会改善患者预后或显着改变管理的非必要服务。以患者为中心的医疗保健要求在尊重患者的担忧、偏好和优先事项的情况下提供护理，但如果患者的意见得到征求并在适当时候得到尊重，则不需要不必要的检查或治疗。非复杂性腰痛中的MRI会增加过度医疗，因此不推荐用于该患者。\n\n（选项A）脊柱MRI经常发现非特异性异常（例如，椎间盘膨出），这些异常与管理无关，但可能导致进一步的不必要和潜在有害的诊断研究和干预。由于此类异常的发生频率很高，即使在无症状个体中，也往往不清楚它们是否是疼痛的真正原因，或者仅仅是一个偶然的发现。因此，推迟影像学检查会降低而非增加诊断不确定性。\n\n（选项B）医疗保健碎片化是指在没有充分交叉沟通的情况下，将护理分散在多个提供者和机构之间。拒绝订购不必要的检查不会导致碎片化。\n\n（选项C）医疗保健差异是指由于社会经济或人口因素导致的获得护理或结果的差异。谨慎和适当使用诊断研究不会增加差异。\n\n（选项D）医疗事故责任风险与提供者-患者沟通和感知的关注程度密切相关。适当使用诊断研究，特别是当其符合循证指南时，不会增加医疗事故风险。\n\n（选项E）临床标准化是指在提供者群体内部和之间管理决策的一致性。符合既定指南的护理会增加而非减少标准化。\n\n教育目标：\n过度医疗是指提供预期不会改善患者预后或显着改变管理的服务。以患者为中心的医疗保健要求在尊重患者的担忧、偏好和优先事项的情况下提供护理，但如果患者的意见得到征求并在适当时候得到尊重，则不需要不必要的检查或治疗。"

    "en": "This question tests the concept of overutilization in healthcare, specifically regarding the use of imaging for uncomplicated low back pain. The question requires understanding that ordering unnecessary tests, like an MRI in this case, contributes to overutilization without improving patient outcomes or changing management. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's presentation as acute, uncomplicated low back pain without red flags. Recall that guidelines generally discourage imaging for such cases due to the high likelihood of nonspecific findings and the lack of impact on management. Identify the answer choice that reflects the consequence of avoiding unnecessary testing.",
