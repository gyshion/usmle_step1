    "en": "A 44-year-old man comes to the clinic due to increasing fatigue, trouble sleeping, and palpitations. He has lost 9 kg (20 lb) over the last year despite eating well. The patient says he is under a lot of pressure at work but cannot think of any other precipitating factors for his insomnia. He has no other medical problems and takes no medications. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. His mother has a history of a thyroid problem. Blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg and pulse is 108/min. On physical examination, the thyroid is diffusely enlarged. His serum free thyroxine level is elevated and TSH level is decreased. He is found to have a positive assay for thyrotropin receptor antibodies. Compared to other forms of thyroid disease, which of the following findings would be most specific for this patient's underlying pathophysiologic process?",

    "en": "This patient has symptomatic HYPERTHYROIDISM with elevated serum free thyroxine and suppressed TSH levels. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves disease; however, hyperthyroidism can also be due to other processes such as toxic adenoma, toxic multinodular goiter, and thyroiditis.\n\nThis patient's positive serum assay for THYROTROPIN RECEPTOR ANTIBODIES (TRAb) confirms the diagnosis of GRAVES DISEASE. TRAb bind and activate the TSH receptor, causing increased release of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland, which is responsible for the general symptoms of hyperthyroidism (eg, fatigue, palpitations, weight loss, and insomnia).\n\nThe TSH receptor is also present on fibroblasts and adipocytes in addition to thyroid epithelial cells. THYROID DERMOPATHY is caused by stimulation of fibroblasts by TRAb, leading to excess production of glycosaminoglycans and adipogenesis. This leads to induration and thickening of the skin over the shins (pretibial myxedema) {{exhibit_1}}. Graves ophthalmopathy occurs in a similar manner, with expansion of the retro-orbital tissues displacing the globe forward (proptosis). These processes are directly related to TRAb; they have a high specificity for Graves disease.\n\n(Choices A, B, C, and E) Hyperthyroidism also causes a hypermetabolic/hyperadrenergic state that can present with heat intolerance, tremor, lid lag, tachycardia, or atrial fibrillation. In addition, increased bone turnover can lead to osteoporosis and increased fracture risk. However, these findings are not mediated by TRAb and can be seen in hyperthyroidism of any cause (eg, thyroiditis, toxic multinodular goiter).\n\nEducational objective:\nPretibial myxedema and Graves ophthalmopathy are specific features of Graves disease. They are caused by an autoimmune response directed against the TSH receptor that results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans within the affected tissues.",
    "zh": "该患者有症状性甲状腺功能亢进，血清游离甲状腺素水平升高，TSH水平受到抑制。甲状腺功能亢进最常见的原因是格雷夫斯病；然而，甲状腺功能亢进也可能是由其他过程引起的，例如毒性腺瘤、毒性多结节性甲状腺肿和甲状腺炎。\n\n该患者对促甲状腺激素受体抗体(TRAb)的血清检测呈阳性，证实了格雷夫斯病的诊断。TRAb 结合并激活TSH受体，导致甲状腺释放更多的甲状腺激素，这是引起甲状腺功能亢进的常见症状（例如，疲劳、心悸、体重减轻和失眠）的原因。\n\n除了甲状腺上皮细胞外，成纤维细胞和脂肪细胞也存在TSH受体。甲状腺皮病是由TRAb刺激成纤维细胞引起的，导致糖胺聚糖和脂肪生成的过度产生。这会导致胫前皮肤（胫前黏液性水肿）{{exhibit_1}}的硬化和增厚。格雷夫斯眼病以类似的方式发生，眶后组织扩张，将眼球向前推移（眼球突出）。这些过程与TRAb直接相关；它们对格雷夫斯病具有高度特异性。\n\n（选项 A、B、C 和 E）甲状腺功能亢进也会导致高代谢/高肾上腺素能状态，可能表现为不耐热、震颤、眼睑迟滞、心动过速或心房颤动。此外，骨转换增加会导致骨质疏松和骨折风险增加。但是，这些发现不是由TRAb介导的，可以在任何原因引起的甲状腺功能亢进（例如，甲状腺炎、毒性多结节性甲状腺肿）中看到。\n\n教育目标：\n胫前黏液性水肿和格雷夫斯眼病是格雷夫斯病的特异性特征。它们是由针对TSH受体的自身免疫反应引起的，导致糖胺聚糖在受影响的组织内积聚。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Graves' disease and its specific manifestations, particularly thyroid dermopathy (pretibial myxedema). The key is to recognize that pretibial myxedema and Graves' ophthalmopathy are highly specific to Graves' disease due to the action of thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) on fibroblasts and orbital tissues.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the findings that are unique to Graves' disease and not simply a result of hyperthyroidism. While other options may be associated with hyperthyroidism, pretibial myxedema is specifically linked to the autoimmune process in Graves' disease.",
    "zh": "此题考察对格雷夫斯病及其特异性表现的了解，特别是甲状腺皮病（胫前黏液性水肿）。关键是要认识到，胫前黏液性水肿和格雷夫斯眼病由于促甲状腺激素受体抗体（TRAb）对成纤维细胞和眶内组织的作用，对格雷夫斯病具有高度特异性。\n\n要解决这个问题，请找出格雷夫斯病独有的发现，而不是仅仅是甲状腺功能亢进的结果。虽然其他选项可能与甲状腺功能亢进相关，但胫前黏液性水肿与格雷夫斯病的自身免疫过程特别相关。"
