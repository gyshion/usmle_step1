    "en": "A 58-year-old homeless man is brought to the emergency department after being found unresponsive on a sidewalk. The patient has been hospitalized on several occasions for alcohol and illicit drug intoxication. He also has a history of hypertension but is not adherent with medical therapy. On arrival, the patient is obtunded, febrile, and hypotensive. Physical examination reveals lung crackles and a new blowing diastolic murmur consistent with aortic regurgitation. Appropriate treatment is started, but the patient dies several days later. Autopsy examination shows symmetric, bilateral wedge-shaped strips of necrosis over the cerebral convexity, parallel and a few centimeters lateral to the interhemispheric cerebral fissure {{exhibit_1}}. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's cerebral findings?",

    "en": "This patient with a history of drug use developed fever and new-onset aortic regurgitation, which are suggestive of endocarditis. His pulmonary edema (crackles) and hypotension are due to subsequent cardiogenic shock. On autopsy, the symmetric, bilateral wedge-shaped strips of necrosis over the cerebral convexity are characteristic of global cerebral ischemia.\n\nProfound systemic hypotension (eg, cardiogenic shock, cardiopulmonary arrest) diminishes blood supply to the entire brain, resulting in neuron cell death in areas that are vulnerable to hypoxia. This includes brain regions with high metabolic demand (eg, hippocampus, cerebellar Purkinje cells) and areas supplied by the distal-most branches of cerebral arteries (watershed zones). These border zones are located between areas supplied by the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries and are vulnerable because of low baseline perfusion pressure. The resulting necrosis occurs in bilateral, wedge-shaped strips that can extend from the frontal to occipital lobe and are located parallel and a few centimeters lateral to the interhemispheric fissure.\n\n(Choice A) Cerebral amyloid angiopathy typically affects patients over the age of 70 and results in lobar hemorrhages (eg, occipital, parietal) rather than ischemia. Amyloidosis can also cause cardiomyopathy, although patients typically develop right-sided heart failure (eg, edema, ascites) rather than valvular insufficiency.\n\n(Choice B) Although infectious endocarditis frequently causes embolization of bacterial vegetations, cardiac embolism would likely cause multiple scattered infarcts in an asymmetric pattern within different major vascular territories (eg, middle and anterior cerebral artery). This patient's symmetric, bilateral infarcts correspond to the cortical watershed regions and are more suggestive of global cerebral ischemia.\n\n(Choice D) Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms form as a result of chronic hypertension, and a rupture causes intracerebral hemorrhage typically involving deep brain structures (eg, basal ganglia, cerebellar nuclei, thalamus, pons).\n\n(Choice E) Saccular aneurysms, which occur at areas of weakness in cerebral arteries, typically cause subarachnoid hemorrhage after a rupture rather than cerebral ischemia. Patients usually have sudden-onset severe (thunderclap) headache and meningismus.\n\nEducational objective:\nSustained cerebral hypoperfusion (eg, hypotension, shock) may cause global cerebral ischemia and watershed infarction. These watershed zones are located at the borders between areas perfused by the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries and typically appear as symmetric, bilateral wedge-shaped strips of necrosis over the cerebral convexity, parallel and adjacent to the interhemispheric fissure.",
    "zh": "该患者有药物使用史，出现发热和新发主动脉瓣关闭不全，提示心内膜炎。他的肺水肿（啰音）和低血压是继发于心源性休克。尸检显示，大脑凸面上的对称性、双侧楔形坏死带是大范围脑缺血的特征。\n\n严重的全身性低血压（例如，心源性休克、心肺骤停）会减少整个大脑的血液供应，导致易受缺氧影响的区域的神经元细胞死亡。这包括代谢需求高的脑区（例如，海马体、小脑浦肯野细胞）以及由脑动脉最远端分支（分水岭区域）供血的区域。这些边界区位于由前、中、后脑动脉供血的区域之间，由于基线灌注压低而易受影响。由此产生的坏死发生在双侧楔形带中，可以从额叶延伸到枕叶，并且与大脑半球间裂平行且外侧几厘米处。\n\n（选项A）脑淀粉样血管病通常影响70岁以上的患者，并导致叶状出血（例如，枕叶、顶叶），而不是缺血。淀粉样变性也会引起心肌病，尽管患者通常会发生右心衰竭（例如，水肿、腹水），而不是瓣膜功能不全。\n\n（选项B）尽管感染性心内膜炎常导致细菌赘生物栓塞，但心脏栓塞可能会导致在不同主要血管区域（例如，大脑中动脉和前动脉）内出现不对称模式的多个散在梗死。该患者的对称性、双侧梗死与皮质分水岭区域相对应，更提示大范围脑缺血。\n\n（选项D）Charcot-Bouchard动脉瘤是慢性高血压的结果，破裂会导致脑出血，通常涉及深部脑结构（例如，基底神经节、小脑核、丘脑、脑桥）。\n\n（选项E）动脉血管壁薄弱部位发生的囊状动脉瘤，破裂后通常会导致蛛网膜下腔出血，而不是脑缺血。患者通常会突然出现严重（雷击样）头痛和脑膜刺激征。\n\n教学目标：\n持续的脑灌注不足（例如，低血压、休克）可能导致大范围脑缺血和分水岭梗死。这些分水岭区位于由前、中、后脑动脉灌注的区域之间的边界，通常表现为大脑凸面上对称、双侧楔形坏死带，与大脑半球间裂平行且相邻。"
