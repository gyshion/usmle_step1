    "en": "A 10-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents due to restlessness and involuntary jerking. He takes no medications and his vaccinations are up-to-date. His parents do not recall any recent injuries or illnesses other than a sore throat 3 months ago. On examination, the patient has rapid, irregular jerking movements involving his face, arms, and legs. This patient is at greatest risk for developing which of the following conditions?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's restlessness and purposeless jerking movements 3 months after having a sore throat are consistent with Sydenham chorea, a hyperkinetic extrapyramidal movement disorder that is the most common acquired chorea of childhood. Sydenham chorea is a neurologic manifestation of ACUTE RHEUMATIC FEVER that occurs 1-8 months after group A β-hemolytic streptococcal infection. It is caused by a delayed onset autoimmune reaction involving anti-streptococcal antibodies that cross-react with the BASAL GANGLIA. Because Sydenham chorea is a manifestation of acute rheumatic fever, patients with this disorder are at risk for CHRONIC RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE.\n\n(Choice A) Although migratory polyarthritis is an early manifestation of acute rheumatic fever, it is generally transient and rarely, if ever, deforming.\n\n(Choice B) Early-onset Alzheimer dementia is associated with Down syndrome (trisomy 21). Increased expression of the amyloid precursor protein gene located on chromosome 21 is thought to be the cause.\n\n(Choice C) Parkinson disease is an extrapyramidal hypokinetic movement disorder consisting of tremor, rigidity, akinesia, and postural instability. Jerking extremity movements are generally not seen in Parkinson disease, except in cases of levodopa overdose.\n\n(Choice D) Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis occurs following infection with specific nephritogenic strains of group A Streptococcus. However, the nephritis manifests within 1-6 weeks and is typically self-limited.\n\nEducational objective: Sydenham chorea presents with involuntary, rapid, irregular jerking movements involving the face, arms, and legs. It occurs months after group A streptococcal infection and is one of the major clinical manifestations of acute rheumatic fever. Patients with this condition carry a high risk of chronic valvular disease.",
    "zh": "该患者在咽喉痛3个月后出现烦躁不安和无目的抽搐运动，这与Sydenham舞蹈病相符，这是一种过度运动的锥体外系运动障碍，是儿童时期最常见的获得性舞蹈病。Sydenham舞蹈病是急性风湿热的神经系统表现，发生在A组β溶血性链球菌感染后1-8个月。它是由涉及抗链球菌抗体与基底神经节发生交叉反应的迟发性自身免疫反应引起的。由于Sydenham舞蹈病是急性风湿热的表现，因此患有此病的患者有发生慢性风湿性心脏病的风险。\n\n(选项A) 尽管游走性多关节炎是急性风湿热的早期表现，但它通常是短暂的，很少甚至从未出现变形。\n\n(选项B) 早发性阿尔茨海默病与唐氏综合征（21三体综合征）有关。位于21号染色体上的淀粉样前体蛋白基因表达增加被认为是病因。\n\n(选项C) 帕金森病是一种锥体外系运动迟缓障碍，包括震颤、僵硬、运动不能和姿势不稳。抽搐的肢体运动通常在帕金森病中看不到，除非在左旋多巴过量的病例中。\n\n(选项D) 链球菌感染后肾小球肾炎发生在感染特定肾毒性A组链球菌株后。然而，肾炎在1-6周内出现，并且通常是自限性的。\n\n教育目标：Sydenham舞蹈病表现为面部、手臂和腿部的不自主、快速、不规则的抽搐运动。它发生在A组链球菌感染数月后，是急性风湿热的主要临床表现之一。患有此病的患者发生慢性瓣膜疾病的风险很高。"

The key to solving this question is recognizing the temporal relationship between a recent streptococcal infection (sore throat) and the development of involuntary jerking movements, which is characteristic of Sydenham chorea, a manifestation of acute rheumatic fever.",
