    "en": "A 40-year-old woman comes to the office due to lesions on her left arm. She developed small, red sores a few weeks ago, and over the past few days, they have increased in number. The patient is very concerned that they will cause an infection because she has had similar lesions on her extremities many times in the past; wound cultures have consistently grown *Escherichia coli*. Most recently, she developed cellulitis 8 months ago and required intravenous antibiotics. The patient says, \"I don't know why my skin keeps getting infected. I've been to so many doctors, and none of them can tell me what's going on.\" She lives alone and works as a traveling nurse. Medical history is otherwise noncontributory.",
    "zh": "一位40岁的女性因左臂出现皮损来就诊。她在几周前出现了小的红色疮，在过去的几天里，疮的数量有所增加。患者非常担心这些疮会引起感染，因为她过去曾多次在四肢出现类似的皮损；伤口培养结果一直显示*大肠杆菌*生长。最近一次，她在8个月前患上了蜂窝组织炎，需要静脉注射抗生素。患者说：“我不知道为什么我的皮肤总是被感染。我看了很多医生，但他们都无法告诉我发生了什么。”她独居，是一名旅行护士。病史无其他特殊。"

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's recurrent skin infections, consistently positive *E. coli* cultures, and history of cellulitis requiring IV antibiotics, despite no clear underlying immunocompromise or other medical history, are highly suggestive of FACTITIOUS DISORDER. Factitious disorder is characterized by the intentional falsification of symptoms or induction of injury. The patient's statement, \"I don't know why my skin keeps getting infected,\" coupled with her history of similar lesions and infections, suggests she may be intentionally causing or exacerbating her symptoms. The goal in factitious disorder is to assume the patient role, not for external gain (which would be malingering). The patient's profession as a traveling nurse may also be relevant, as healthcare workers are sometimes more prone to factitious disorder, possibly due to their familiarity with medical conditions and procedures.\n\n(Choice A) Fear of humiliation and rejection by others is a key feature of social anxiety disorder, not factitious disorder. While patients with factitious disorder may experience distress, their primary motivation is not social avoidance due to fear of judgment.\n\n(Choice B) Frantic efforts to avoid abandonment are characteristic of borderline personality disorder. While self-harm can occur in both conditions, the motivation and presentation differ. In factitious disorder, the self-harm is for the purpose of assuming the sick role.\n\n(Choice D) Persistently high level of anxiety about health is characteristic of illness anxiety disorder (formerly hypochondriasis). While patients with factitious disorder may exhibit high healthcare utilization, their underlying motivation is to deceive and assume the sick role, rather than genuine anxiety about having an illness.\n\n(Choice E) Preoccupation with an inability to function independently is a feature of dependent personality disorder. While patients with factitious disorder may seek care and attention, their primary driver is the induction of illness, not a pervasive need to be cared for due to perceived helplessness.",
    "zh": "患者反复出现的皮肤感染、持续阳性的*大肠杆菌*培养结果，以及需要静脉注射抗生素治疗的蜂窝组织炎病史，尽管没有明确的潜在免疫缺陷或其他病史，高度提示为诈病。诈病以故意伪造症状或造成损伤为特征。患者的陈述“我不知道为什么我的皮肤总是被感染”以及她类似的皮损和感染史表明，她可能故意引起或加重症状。诈病的目标是扮演患者的角色，而不是为了获得外部利益（这将是装病）。患者作为一名旅行护士的职业也可能相关，因为医疗保健工作者有时更容易患诈病，这可能是由于他们熟悉医疗状况和程序。\n\n（选项A）害怕被他人羞辱和拒绝是社交焦虑症的一个关键特征，而不是诈病。虽然诈病患者可能会感到痛苦，但他们的主要动机不是由于害怕评判而导致的社会回避。\n\n（选项B）疯狂地试图避免被抛弃是边缘型人格障碍的特征。虽然自残可能发生在两种情况下，但动机和表现不同。在诈病中，自残的目的是扮演病人角色。\n\n（选项D）对健康的持续高度焦虑是疾病焦虑症（原名为疑病症）的特征。虽然诈病患者可能会表现出高医疗保健利用率，但他们的根本动机是欺骗和扮演病人角色，而不是真正担心患病。\n\n（选项E）专注于无法独立functioning是依赖型人格障碍的一个特征。虽然诈病患者可能会寻求照护和关注，但他们的主要驱动因素是诱发疾病，而不是由于 perceived 无助感而产生的被照护的普遍需求。\n\n关键临床要点：\n- 诈病：故意伪造症状或造成损伤以扮演病人角色。\n- 装病：为了获得外部奖励（经济、法律等）而故意伪造症状。\n- 疾病焦虑症：对患有或获得严重疾病的担忧，且躯体症状很少或没有。\n- 躯体症状障碍：一种或多种令人痛苦的躯体症状，伴有与这些症状相关的过度想法、感觉或行为。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of factitious disorder, its key features, and differentiation from other psychiatric conditions that may involve somatic complaints or self-harm. It requires recognizing the intentional induction of illness for the purpose of assuming the patient role.\n\nTo solve this question, analyze the patient's presentation for evidence of intentional self-harm or symptom exaggeration. Differentiate this from other disorders based on the underlying motivation (sick role vs. external gain vs. genuine anxiety vs. fear of abandonment). Consider the patient's history and statements in the context of diagnostic criteria for factitious disorder.",
