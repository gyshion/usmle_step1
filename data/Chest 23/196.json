    "en": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with lightheadedness and shortness of breath, which started while shopping at a supermarket. During the last 6 months, she had increasing shortness of breath and had to adjust her daily activities. The patient has no other medical problems and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. There is no family history of heart disease, stroke, or blood clots. Her BMI is 25 kg/m2. After initial assessment, the patient reports that she feels “fine,” refuses further evaluation, and insists on being discharged. She dies a month later. At autopsy, her heart has the following appearance (RV, right ventricle; LV, left ventricle): {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "Autopsy reveals significant thickening of the right ventricular free wall (almost 2 cm in thickness; normal, 3-4 mm) compared to the left ventricle. This finding of severe right ventricular hypertrophy in a young woman with progressive dyspnea and sudden death is suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). \n\nPulmonary hypertension can be caused by a number of conditions, including chronic lung disease and left heart failure. Pulmonary hypertension due to primary processes affecting the lung vasculature is referred to as PAH, a condition that most often affects women ages 20-40. PAH is characterized by intimal hyperplasia and fibrosis, medial hypertrophy, and formation of capillary tufts. \n\nLong-standing pulmonary hypertension eventually leads to hypertrophy and/or dilation of the right ventricle (cor pulmonale). Patients typically present with progressive dyspnea, exertional angina, or syncope. As PAH progresses, signs of right-sided heart failure (eg, hepatomegaly, ascites, peripheral edema) can become prominent. The most common cause of death in patients with PAH is right heart failure with circulatory collapse and respiratory failure.\n\n(Choices A and C) Aortic stenosis and essential hypertension cause left ventricular wall thickening and hypertrophy, not right ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n(Choice B) Dilated cardiomyopathy typically increases the size of one or both ventricular chambers. This patient’s ventricular cavities are small and normal in size, not enlarged. Moreover, the left ventricle is relatively normal in shape (elliptical, with a long axis approximately twice that of lateral short axis dimensions), which is not the case with left ventricular dilation.\n\n(Choice D) Myocardial infarctions occur more frequently in older patients (age >65). Morphological changes in the myocardium include an area of reddish-blue discoloration that evolves into a yellow-tan discrete infarct with eventual formation of a white scar.\n\n(Choice F) Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome should be suspected in any case of sudden cardiac death in an otherwise healthy young individual. WPW syndrome is an electrophysiological abnormality of atrioventricular (AV) node conduction that is discernible on histology as small accessory AV impulse conduction pathway(s) anatomically separate from the AV node. There are no consistent gross morphological changes to the ventricles.\n\nEducational objective:\nPulmonary hypertension should be suspected in young and otherwise healthy patients with fatigue, progressive dyspnea, atypical chest pain, or unexplained syncope. Long-standing pulmonary hypertension leads to hypertrophy and/or dilation of the right ventricle (cor pulmonale).",
    "zh": "尸检显示，右心室游离壁明显增厚（厚度接近2厘米；正常厚度为3-4毫米），而左心室则相对正常。在一位出现进行性呼吸困难和猝死的年轻女性中，这种严重的右心室肥厚表现提示肺动脉高压（PAH）。\n\n肺动脉高压可由多种疾病引起，包括慢性肺病和左心衰竭。由于影响肺血管床的原发性过程引起的肺动脉高压被称为PAH，这种情况最常影响20-40岁的女性。PAH的特征是内膜增生和纤维化、中层肥大以及毛细血管簇的形成。\n\n长期肺动脉高压最终导致右心室肥大和/或扩张（肺源性心脏病）。患者通常表现为进行性呼吸困难、劳力性心绞痛或晕厥。随着PAH的进展，右心衰竭的体征（如肝肿大、腹水、外周水肿）会变得明显。PAH患者最常见的死亡原因是右心衰竭伴循环衰竭和呼吸衰竭。\n\n（选项A和C）主动脉瓣狭窄和原发性高血压导致左心室壁增厚和肥大，而不是右心室肥大。\n\n（选项B）扩张型心肌病通常会增加一个或两个心室腔的大小。该患者的心室腔较小且大小正常，并未增大。此外，左心室的形状相对正常（椭圆形，长轴约为侧向短轴尺寸的两倍），而左心室扩张则不然。\n\n（选项D）心肌梗死更常发生在老年患者（年龄>65岁）中。心肌的形态学变化包括一片红蓝色变色区域，其演变成黄色-棕色离散梗死灶，最终形成白色瘢痕。\n\n（选项F）对于任何原本健康的年轻个体发生猝死的情况，都应怀疑预激综合征（WPW）。WPW综合征是房室（AV）结传导的电生理学异常，在组织学上可辨别为与房室结解剖上分离的小的AV冲动传导通路。心室没有一致的肉眼形态学改变。\n\n教育目标：\n对于有疲劳、进行性呼吸困难、非典型胸痛或不明原因晕厥的年轻且健康的患者，应怀疑肺动脉高压。长期的肺动脉高压会导致右心室肥大和/或扩张（肺源性心脏病）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), its clinical presentation in young women, and the associated autopsy findings of right ventricular hypertrophy. It also requires differentiating PAH from other cardiac conditions based on morphological changes. \n\nTo solve this question, focus on the patient's age, progressive dyspnea, sudden death, and the autopsy finding of significant right ventricular hypertrophy.
