    "en": "A 16-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother due to concern about excessive weight loss. The patient has lost 4.5 kg (10 lb) over the past 2 months, but thinks she still appears overweight, and is worried about gaining weight. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Her mother has hypothyroidism. Blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 105/min and regular. There are no orthostatic changes. BMI is 22 kg/m². On examination, the patient appears anxious. The thyroid is small and without palpable nodules. There is a fine tremor seen in the fingers when the arms are outstretched. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ diffusely. The skin is warm and moist. Laboratory results show decreased TSH, elevated free thyroxine (T4), and undetectable thyroglobulin levels. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on thyroid biopsy of this patient?",

    "en": "This patient's symptoms (eg, weight loss, tachycardia, and tremors), elevated free thyroxine (T4), and suppressed TSH are indicative of thyrotoxicosis. However, her thyroid is small and serum thyroglobulin is undetectable, which suggests an exogenous source of thyroid hormone. Thyroglobulin is a glycoprotein produced by thyroid follicular cells that makes up a substantial component of follicular colloid and serves as the substrate for the formation of thyroid hormone. A small amount is released by the thyroid in normal function. Low levels, as in this patient, suggest noninflammatory suppression of thyroid activity.\n\nIn light of her mother's hypothyroidism, which suggests a possible source of levothyroxine tablets, this patient is likely surreptitiously taking thyroid hormone in an attempt to lose weight. Exogenous thyrotoxicosis can also occur in patients taking over-the-counter supplements containing animal thyroid tissue and in erroneous dosing of thyroid replacement therapy. Excess T4 supplementation suppresses TSH, which decreases iodine organification and colloid formation resulting in atrophy of thyroid follicles.\n\n(Choice B) Histopathology in chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis is characterized by a mononuclear infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and plasma cells, often with germinal centers. Hashimoto thyroiditis typically presents with primary hypothyroidism (elevated TSH, low free T4) and goiter; although Hashimoto's can occasionally present with an initial hyperthyroid phase, these patients will have elevated thyroglobulin levels due to inflammatory disruption of thyroid follicles.\n\n(Choice C) Subacute granulomatous (de Quervain) thyroiditis is characterized by disruption of follicles and a mixed cellular infiltrate with occasional multinucleated giant cells. Patients may have hyperthyroidism but typically have a painful, tender thyroid gland and high levels of thyroglobulin due to destructive thyroiditis.\n\n(Choice D) Medullary thyroid cancer is a neuroendocrine tumor that arises from calcitonin-secreting parafollicular C cells. Microscopy shows nests or sheets of polygonal or spindle-shaped cells with extracellular amyloid deposits (derived from calcitonin). Clinical features include diarrhea, flushing, and thyroid nodules, but TSH and free T4 are normal.\n\n(Choice E) Graves disease presents with a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland associated with hyperthyroidism, exophthalmos, and pretibial myxedema. The thyroid follicular epithelium is tall and crowded with hyperactive reabsorption, causing scalloping around the edges of the colloid. However, high serum levels of thyroglobulin would be seen due to increased thyroid metabolic activity.\n\nEducational objective:\nExogenous hyperthyroidism is characterized by elevated free thyroxine (T4), suppressed TSH, and low/undetectable thyroglobulin. It can occur with surreptitious levothyroxine misuse, animal-sourced thyroid supplements, and erroneous dosing of thyroid replacement therapy. Over time, the lack of TSH stimulation causes the thyroid follicles to become atrophic. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "该患者的症状（如体重减轻、心动过速和震颤）、游离甲状腺素（T4）升高和TSH抑制表明存在甲状腺毒症。然而，她的甲状腺较小，血清甲状腺球蛋白无法检测到，这提示甲状腺激素的外源性来源。甲状腺球蛋白是由甲状腺滤泡细胞产生的一种糖蛋白，是滤泡胶体的重要组成部分，并作为甲状腺激素形成的底物。正常功能下，甲状腺会释放少量甲状腺球蛋白。像该患者一样，低水平提示甲状腺活性受到非炎性抑制。\n\n考虑到她母亲的甲状腺功能减退症，这提示了左甲状腺素片剂的可能来源，该患者可能偷偷服用甲状腺激素以试图减肥。外源性甲状腺毒症也可能发生在服用含有动物甲状腺组织的非处方补充剂以及甲状腺替代治疗剂量错误的情况下。过量的T4补充会抑制TSH，这会降低碘的有机化和胶体形成，导致甲状腺滤泡萎缩。\n\n（选项B）慢性自身免疫性（桥本）甲状腺炎的组织病理学特征是单核细胞浸润，由淋巴细胞和浆细胞组成，常伴有生发中心。桥本甲状腺炎通常表现为原发性甲状腺功能减退症（TSH升高，游离T4低）和甲状腺肿；尽管桥本氏病偶有以初始甲状腺功能亢进期为表现的情况，但这些患者由于甲状腺滤泡的炎症破坏而具有升高的甲状腺球蛋白水平。\n\n（选项C）亚急性肉芽肿性（de Quervain）甲状腺炎的特征是滤泡破坏和混合性细胞浸润，偶见多核巨细胞。患者可能患有甲状腺功能亢进症，但通常有疼痛、触痛的甲状腺和由于破坏性甲状腺炎引起的高水平甲状腺球蛋白。\n\n（选项D）髓样甲状腺癌是一种起源于降钙素分泌性滤泡旁C细胞的神经内分泌肿瘤。显微镜下可见多边形或梭形细胞的巢或片，伴有细胞外淀粉样蛋白沉积（源自降钙素）。临床特征包括腹泻、潮红和甲状腺结节，但TSH和游离T4正常。\n\n（选项E）Graves病表现为弥漫性甲状腺肿大，伴有甲状腺功能亢进症、眼球突出和胫前黏液性水肿。甲状腺滤泡上皮高而拥挤，伴有过度吸收，导致胶体边缘呈锯齿状。然而，由于甲状腺代谢活动增加，血清甲状腺球蛋白水平会升高。\n\n教育目标：\n外源性甲状腺功能亢进症的特征是游离甲状腺素（T4）升高、TSH抑制和甲状腺球蛋白低/无法检测到。这种情况可能发生在偷偷滥用左甲状腺素、动物来源的甲状腺补充剂以及甲状腺替代治疗剂量错误的情况下。随着时间的推移，缺乏TSH刺激会导致甲状腺滤泡萎缩。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the etiology of hyperthyroidism, specifically exogenous hyperthyroidism due to surreptitious levothyroxine use, and the expected findings on thyroid biopsy. It also tests the ability to differentiate this condition from other causes of hyperthyroidism based on clinical presentation and laboratory findings. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the signs of hyperthyroidism (weight loss, tachycardia, tremors), the suppressed TSH and elevated T4, and the undetectable thyroglobulin. This combination points to an exogenous source of thyroid hormone. Consider the mother's hypothyroidism as a potential source of levothyroxine, and then select the biopsy finding consistent with chronic TSH suppression (atrophy of thyroid follicles).",
