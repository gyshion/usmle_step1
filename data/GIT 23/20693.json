The patient was born preterm at 35 weeks gestation and had no complications in the newborn nursery. He had been taking a standard cow's milk–based formula until 2 weeks ago when he developed loose stools streaked with blood and mucus. Symptoms resolved after changing the formula.

    "en": "This patient most likely has food protein–induced allergic proctocolitis, a benign condition of early infancy (age <6 months). Affected infants have a non–IgE-mediated reaction to proteins found in breast milk or formula (most common trigger is cow's milk). Painless, blood-streaked stools (which may also be loose and contain mucus) typically develop weeks to months after initial exposure to the food allergen.\n\nDiagnosis is clinical. Although endoscopy is not performed unless symptoms are atypical (eg, severe bleeding, constipation, vomiting), characteristic findings include inflammation (ie, erythema, edema) confined to the distal colon and rectum. Histopathology findings include infiltration of eosinophils within the lamina propria and muscularis mucosa.\n\nManagement includes dietary avoidance of the trigger protein (eg, switching to a hydrolyzed formula, maternal elimination of dairy for breastfed infants). Symptoms typically resolve within weeks, and most infants can tolerate the offending protein by age 1.\n\n(Choice B) Hemorrhagic necrosis of the bowel wall describes necrotizing enterocolitis, a gastrointestinal emergency that can result in gut ischemia and death if untreated (eg, bowel rest, antibiotics). In addition to rectal bleeding, patients often have abdominal distension, poor feeding, and hemodynamic instability, none of which is present in this patient.\n\n(Choices C and D) A Meckel diverticulum can contain heterotopic gastric mucosa in the distal ileum, and neutrophilic crypt abscesses can be seen with ulcerative colitis. Although these conditions, which are both exceedingly rare in the neonatal period, can cause blood in the stool, neither would resolve with a change in formula.\n\nEducational objective:\nFood protein–induced allergic proctocolitis is a non–IgE-mediated reaction that causes inflammation and eosinophilic infiltration of the distal colon. Classic presentation is in early infancy with painless, blood-streaked stools that resolve with dietary avoidance of the offending food protein (cow's milk). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者最有可能患有食物蛋白诱发的过敏性直肠结肠炎，这是一种婴儿早期（年龄<6个月）的良性疾病。受影响的婴儿对母乳或配方奶中发现的蛋白质有非IgE介导的反应（最常见的诱因是牛奶）。无痛、带血丝的粪便（也可能稀便并含有粘液）通常在首次接触食物过敏原后数周至数月出现。\n\n诊断是临床性的。虽然内镜检查只有在症状不典型时（例如，严重出血、便秘、呕吐）才会进行，但特征性发现包括仅限于远端结肠和直肠的炎症（即红斑、水肿）。组织病理学发现包括嗜酸性粒细胞在固有层和黏膜肌层的浸润。\n\n管理包括避免摄入诱发蛋白的食物（例如，改用水解配方奶，母乳喂养的婴儿的母亲避免食用奶制品）。症状通常在数周内缓解，大多数婴儿在1岁时就能耐受致病蛋白。\n\n（选项B）肠壁出血性坏死描述了坏死性小肠结肠炎，这是一种胃肠道急症，如果不治疗（例如，肠道休息、抗生素），可能导致肠道缺血和死亡。除了直肠出血外，患者还经常出现腹胀、喂养不良和血流动力学不稳定，而该患者均无这些症状。\n\n（选项C和D）一个梅克尔憩室可以包含异位胃黏膜在远端回肠，并且在溃疡性结肠炎中可以看到中性粒细胞隐窝脓肿。尽管这些情况在新生儿期都非常罕见，并且可以引起大便带血，但两者都不会随着配方奶的变化而缓解。\n\n教育目标：食物蛋白诱发的过敏性直肠结肠炎是一种非IgE介导的反应，会导致远端结肠的炎症和嗜酸性粒细胞浸润。典型的表现是婴儿早期出现无痛、带血丝的粪便，通过避免食用致病食物蛋白（牛奶）来缓解。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"
