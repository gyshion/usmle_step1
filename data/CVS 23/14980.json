    "en": "A 53-year-old woman comes to the office due to progressive distension and tightness in her right lower extremity for the past year. She has had no shortness of breath, fever, or skin rash. The patient was diagnosed with melanoma of the right thigh approximately 2 years ago and underwent surgical resection. Two of her inguinal lymph nodes tested positive for metastasis, and she subsequently underwent inguinal lymphadenectomy and received adjuvant therapy. Recent imaging revealed no evidence of recurrent malignancy. The patient's medical history also includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows clear lungs and normal heart sounds without murmurs or gallops. No jugular venous distension is present. The right lower extremity is significantly larger in diameter than the left. Edema is present up to the thigh, with mild skin indentation after application of pressure. The skin overlying the involved area is thickened and dry. Laboratory testing, including complete blood count, serum metabolic panel, and urinalysis, is within normal limits. Treatment of this patient's symptoms should include which of the following strategies?",
    "zh": "一名53岁的女性因过去一年右下肢进行性扩张和紧绷感前来就诊。她没有出现呼吸急促、发烧或皮疹。患者大约2年前被诊断为右大腿黑色素瘤，并接受了手术切除。她的两个腹股沟淋巴结检测结果为转移阳性，随后她接受了腹股沟淋巴结清扫术并接受了辅助治疗。最近的影像学检查未发现复发性恶性肿瘤的证据。患者的病史还包括高血压和高脂血症。生命体征在正常范围内。体格检查显示肺部清晰，心脏听诊无杂音或奔马律。无颈静脉扩张。右下肢直径明显大于左下肢。水肿存在于大腿，施加压力后皮肤有轻微压痕。受累区域的皮肤增厚且干燥。包括全血细胞计数、血清代谢组和尿液分析在内的实验室检查均在正常范围内。该患者的症状治疗应包括以下哪种策略？"

    "en": "This patient with chronic swelling and thickened skin of the right leg most likely has chronic lymphedema. Lymphedema can be congenital, but it most commonly results from an acquired disruption of lymphatic drainage that allows for accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial tissue. Malignancy and its treatment (eg, radiation, lymphadenectomy) are frequent underlying causes; other causes include chronic inflammation (eg, recurrent cellulitis, connective tissue disease) and parasitic infection (ie, filariasis due to Wuchereria bancrofti). Obesity is often a strong contributing factor.\n\nLymphedema usually presents with swelling, heaviness, and discomfort in one or more extremities. In early disease, the edema is pitting and the skin remains soft. However, over time there is progressive deposition of subcutaneous collagen and adipose tissue, which leads to firm, dry, and thickened skin and nonpitting edema. Treatment is difficult and typically involves conservative management to increase lymphatic drainage via compression bandages or physiotherapy (ie, manual lymphatic drainage).\n\n(Choice A) Selective estrogen receptor modulators (eg, tamoxifen) block estrogen receptors in breast tissue and can be useful in treating breast cancer. Breast cancer may present with upper extremity lymphedema, but lower extremity lymphedema would be extremely unusual.\n\n(Choice C) Anticoagulants (eg, heparin) facilitate dissolution of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT); however, acute DVT is less likely without active malignancy and would not explain this patient's year-long duration of symptoms.\n\n(Choice D) Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor is useful in the treatment of lymphangiosarcoma, which is a rare complication of lymphedema. Lymphangiosarcoma typically presents as purple maculopapular skin lesions, which are not present in this patient.\n\n(Choice E) Diuretics reduce intravascular volume and are useful in treating lower extremity edema that results from elevated venous hydrostatic pressure in true volume overloaded states (eg, heart failure, cirrhosis). However, they are ineffective and contraindicated for lymphedema because lymphedematous fluid cannot be easily mobilized from the interstitial space into the vasculature. When used for lymphedema, diuretics are likely to cause intravascular volume depletion and consequent acute kidney injury.\n\nEducational objective:\nChronic lymphedema is most commonly caused by an acquired disruption of lymphatic drainage (eg, due to malignancy or lymphadenectomy), and typically presents with swelling and thickened skin in one or more extremities. Treatment is usually conservative and involves compression bandages and physiotherapy; diuretics are ineffective and contraindicated.",
    "zh": "该患者右腿慢性肿胀和皮肤增厚，很可能患有慢性淋巴水肿。淋巴水肿可以是先天性的，但最常见的是由于淋巴引流的获得性中断，导致淋巴液在间质组织中积聚。恶性肿瘤及其治疗（例如，放疗、淋巴结切除术）是常见的基础病因；其他病因包括慢性炎症（例如，复发性蜂窝组织炎、结缔组织疾病）和寄生虫感染（即，由班氏吴策线虫引起的丝虫病）。肥胖通常是一个强有力的促成因素。\n\n淋巴水肿通常表现为一肢或多肢的肿胀、沉重和不适。在疾病早期，水肿呈凹陷性，皮肤保持柔软。然而，随着时间的推移，皮下胶原蛋白和脂肪组织会逐渐沉积，导致皮肤坚硬、干燥和增厚，以及非凹陷性水肿。治疗很困难，通常涉及保守治疗，以通过加压包扎或物理疗法（即，手动淋巴引流）来增加淋巴引流。\n\n（选项A）选择性雌激素受体调节剂（例如，他莫昔芬）阻断乳腺组织中的雌激素受体，可用于治疗乳腺癌。乳腺癌可能表现为上肢淋巴水肿，但下肢淋巴水肿非常罕见。\n\n（选项C）抗凝剂（例如，肝素）有助于溶解急性深静脉血栓形成（DVT）；然而，在没有活动性恶性肿瘤的情况下，急性DVT的可能性较小，并且无法解释该患者长达一年的症状持续时间。\n\n（选项D）抑制血管内皮生长因子可用于治疗淋巴管肉瘤，这是一种罕见的淋巴水肿并发症。淋巴管肉瘤通常表现为紫色斑丘疹皮损，该患者未出现这些症状。\n\n（选项E）利尿剂可减少血管内容量，并可用于治疗因真性容量超负荷状态（例如，心力衰竭、肝硬化）中静脉静水压升高而引起的下肢水肿。然而，它们对淋巴水肿无效且有禁忌症，因为淋巴水肿液不能轻易从间质空间转移到脉管系统。当用于淋巴水肿时，利尿剂可能会导致血管内容量减少，并导致急性肾损伤。\n\n教育目标：\n慢性淋巴水肿最常见的原因是淋巴引流的获得性中断（例如，由于恶性肿瘤或淋巴结切除术），通常表现为一肢或多肢的肿胀和皮肤增厚。治疗通常是保守的，包括加压包扎和物理疗法；利尿剂无效且有禁忌症。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of chronic lymphedema, its etiology (often secondary to lymphatic drainage disruption from malignancy or lymphadenectomy), clinical presentation (swelling, thickened skin), and appropriate management strategies. It also assesses understanding of why other treatments like diuretics or anticoagulants are not indicated. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical features of chronic lymphedema (history of malignancy, lymphadenectomy, chronic extremity swelling, thickened skin).
