    "en": "The graph above combines cardiac and vascular function curves. The cardiac function curve, labeled as cardiac output, illustrates the Frank-Starling effect. The Frank-Starling effect states that as cardiac muscle is increasingly stretched, the cardiac output increases (up to a limit, as illustrated by the flat portion of the curve). This is essentially the same length-tension relationship that is seen in skeletal muscle.\n\nThe venous return curve represents how venous return changes with variations in right atrial pressure. Where the venous return curve intersects with the x-axis, it indicates a venous return of zero. At this point, all circulatory flow ceases, and the pressure throughout the circulatory system equalizes. This average pressure is termed the mean systemic filling pressure, which is a measure of the degree of filling of the circulatory system relative to the circulatory capacity. Increases in blood volume (such as with excessive hydration, dashed line) shift the x-intercept to the right, while decreased blood volume (acute hemorrhage, dashed line) shifts it to the left (Choices A and B). Total peripheral resistance (TPR) affects the slope of both the venous return and cardiac output curves. Increases in the TPR decrease the slope of both curves, as higher vascular resistance restricts venous return and increases afterload.\n\nThe dashed lines in the question image depict decreased cardiac output and an unchanged venous return (unchanged blood volume and TPR). An isolated decrease in cardiac output indicates decreased contractility that is not the result of decreased preload (because the venous return line is unchanged). This indicates inhibited contraction either from the action of a negative inotropic drug or an injury to the myocardium, such as a myocardial infarction.\n\n(Choice C) Chronic anemia causes an increase in cardiac output in an effort to meet the metabolic demands of the tissues. This causes an increase in the slope and height of the cardiac output graph. Venous return also increases somewhat due to decreased blood viscosity.\n\n(Choice E) Anaphylaxis causes widespread venous and arteriolar dilation along with increased capillary permeability and third-spacing of fluids. This results in a serious drop in venous return (shifted down and leftward). Cardiac contractility also increase as the body attempts to maintain blood pressure.\n\nEducational objective:\nMyocardial infarction causes a sharp decrease in cardiac output due to loss of function of a zone of myocardium. On a cardiac function curve, myocardial infarction would decrease both the slope and the maximal height of the line. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "上图结合了心脏和血管功能曲线。标为心输出量的心脏功能曲线说明了 Frank-Starling 效应。 Frank-Starling 效应指出，随着心肌的不断拉伸，心输出量增加（直到一个极限，如曲线的平坦部分所示）。这本质上与骨骼肌中看到的长度-张力关系相同。\n\n静脉回流曲线表示静脉回流如何随右心房压力的变化而变化。静脉回流曲线与 x 轴相交的地方表示静脉回流为零。此时，所有循环血流停止，整个循环系统的压力达到平衡。这种平均压力被称为平均全身充盈压，它是衡量循环系统相对于循环容量的充盈程度的指标。血容量的增加（如过度水合，虚线）使 x 轴截距向右移动，而血容量的减少（急性出血，虚线）则使其向左移动（选项 A 和 B）。总外周阻力 (TPR) 影响静脉回流和心输出量曲线的斜率。 TPR 的增加降低了两个曲线的斜率，因为较高的血管阻力限制了静脉回流并增加了后负荷。\n\n问题图像中的虚线描绘了心输出量降低和静脉回流不变（血容量和 TPR 不变）。心输出量的孤立下降表明收缩力降低，这不是由于前负荷降低（因为静脉回流线未改变）引起的。这表明收缩受到抑制，要么是由于负性肌力药物的作用，要么是由于心肌损伤，如心肌梗死。\n\n（选项 C）慢性贫血会导致心输出量增加，以满足组织的代谢需求。这导致心输出量图的斜率和高度增加。由于血液粘度降低，静脉回流也略有增加。\n\n（选项 E）过敏性休克导致广泛的静脉和微动脉扩张，以及毛细血管通透性增加和体液的第三间隙化。这导致静脉回流严重下降（向下和向左移动）。心脏收缩力也会增加，因为身体试图维持血压。\n\n教育目标：\n心肌梗死由于心肌区域的功能丧失导致心输出量急剧下降。在心脏功能曲线上，心肌梗死将降低线的斜率和最大高度。 {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of cardiac output and venous return curves, and how various conditions affect these curves. Specifically, it assesses the ability to interpret changes in cardiac output and venous return in the context of myocardial infarction.\n\nTo solve this question, analyze the changes in the cardiac output and venous return curves. Recognize that a decrease in cardiac output with unchanged venous return indicates a problem with contractility, which is consistent with myocardial infarction.",
