    "en": "A novel antimicrobial agent that inhibits bacterial glycosyltransferase enzyme is developed. Bacteria grown in a medium containing this antibiotic become spherical, cease to grow, and subsequently lyse. So that the activity of this antibiotic against various bacteria can be determined, disks enriched with the drug are placed on agar plates containing bacterial colonies. The plates are incubated alongside control plates with the same organisms but no antimicrobial disks. The control plates all show organism growth. In the plates with the diffusion disks, resistance to the drug is determined by measuring the zone of complete growth inhibition around the disk.",

    "en": "Peptidoglycan is the main component of the bacterial wall in both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. It is composed of a linear glycan chain of 2 alternating sugars, N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid, that are cross-linked by short peptides, thereby forming a rigid matrix. The enzyme glycosyltransferase is a crucial component of peptidoglycan synthesis; it adds glycan molecules to the growing peptidoglycan chain. Inhibition of this enzyme would result in gaps in the bacterial cell wall, with subsequent loss of bacterial shape and cell lysis from osmotic stress.\n\nAlthough most bacteria have a cell wall composed of peptidoglycan, organisms from the Mycoplasma genus (eg, Ureaplasma urealyticum, M hominis) completely lack a cell wall. These pathogens are separated from the environment by a single phospholipid bilayer membrane composed primarily of cholesterol (similar to human cells). Therefore, antibacterial agents that target the cell wall, including penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, vancomycin, and the drug described in this study, would be ineffective. Mycoplasma is treated primarily by medications that inhibit bacterial ribosomal function such as macrolides and tetracyclines.\n\n(Choice A) Actinomyces israelii is a gram-positive, fungus-like bacterium that has a thick peptidoglycan cell wall. Therefore, it is likely to be inhibited by the drug described in this study. It can be effectively treated with penicillin.\n\n(Choices B and E) Borrelia burgdorferi is the spirochete that causes Lyme disease. Pasteurella multocida is a gram-negative organism that is well-known for causing wound infections following cat bites. Because these organisms have peptidoglycan cell walls, they would likely be inhibited by a drug that blocks glycosyltransferase.\n\n(Choice C) Helicobacter pylori, a gram-negative helical organism with a cell wall, is closely related to the Campylobacter genus. The recommended treatment regimen includes a proton pump inhibitor (eg, omeprazole) combined with clarithromycin and amoxicillin, with or without bismuth (triple or quadruple therapy).\n\nEducational objective:\nAll organisms in the Mycoplasma genus, including Ureaplasma urealyticum, lack peptidoglycan cell walls and are therefore resistant to agents that target the cell wall such as penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and vancomycin. Mycoplasma infections can be treated with antribosomal agents (eg, tetracyclines, macrolides).",
    "zh": "肽聚糖是革兰氏阳性和革兰氏阴性生物体中细菌细胞壁的主要成分。它由2个交替糖的线性聚糖链组成，即N-乙酰葡萄糖胺和N-乙酰胞壁酸，它们通过短肽交联，从而形成刚性基质。糖基转移酶是肽聚糖合成的关键组成部分；它将聚糖分子添加到生长的肽聚糖链中。抑制这种酶会导致细菌细胞壁出现间隙，随后由于渗透压应力而导致细菌形状的丧失和细胞裂解。\n\n尽管大多数细菌都有由肽聚糖组成的细胞壁，但来自支原体属的生物体（例如，解脲支原体、人型支原体）完全缺乏细胞壁。这些病原体与环境分隔开，由主要由胆固醇组成的单磷脂双层膜（类似于人体细胞）。因此，靶向细胞壁的抗菌剂，包括青霉素、头孢菌素、碳青霉烯类、万古霉素以及本研究中描述的药物，将无效。支原体主要通过抑制细菌核糖体功能的药物（如大环内酯类和四环素类）治疗。\n\n(选项 A) 以色列放线菌是一种革兰氏阳性、类似真菌的细菌，具有厚的肽聚糖细胞壁。因此，它很可能被本研究中描述的药物抑制。它可以用青霉素有效治疗。\n\n(选项 B 和 E) 伯氏疏螺旋体是引起莱姆病的螺旋体。多杀性巴斯德菌是一种革兰氏阴性生物体，以引起猫咬伤后的伤口感染而闻名。由于这些生物体具有肽聚糖细胞壁，它们很可能被阻断糖基转移酶的药物抑制。\n\n(选项 C) 幽门螺杆菌是一种革兰氏阴性螺旋生物体，具有细胞壁，与弯曲杆菌属密切相关。推荐的治疗方案包括质子泵抑制剂（例如，奥美拉唑），联合克拉霉素和阿莫西林，可加或不加铋（三联或四联疗法）。\n\n教育目标：\n支原体属中的所有生物体，包括解脲支原体，都缺乏肽聚糖细胞壁，因此对靶向细胞壁的药物（如青霉素、头孢菌素、碳青霉烯类和万古霉素）具有耐药性。支原体感染可以用抗核糖体药物（例如，四环素类、大环内酯类）治疗。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of bacterial cell wall structure and antibiotic mechanisms of action, specifically how drugs targeting peptidoglycan synthesis are ineffective against bacteria lacking a cell wall. The key is to recognize that Mycoplasma species lack a cell wall and therefore are resistant to antibiotics that inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the mechanism of action of the novel antibiotic (inhibiting glycosyltransferase, which is involved in peptidoglycan synthesis). Then, recall which bacteria lack a cell wall. The correct answer will be the bacterium that lacks a cell wall, making it inherently resistant to the antibiotic.",
