Funduscopy shows bilateral lens subluxation. Four years later, the patient dies suddenly of a massive cerebrovascular accident. Autopsy shows middle cerebral artery thrombosis and old renal infarcts. His parents wish to know if anything could have been done to have prevented his death. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "Homocystinuria is most frequently caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase, an enzyme that requires pyridoxine (vitamin B6) as a cofactor. Approximately 50% of affected patients respond to high doses of pyridoxine, which improves residual enzymatic activity and reduces plasma homocysteine levels. Additional treatment includes dietary restriction of methionine. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice A) Vitamin C is a necessary cofactor for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen. Vitamin C deficiency results in decreased strength of collagen fibers and causes scurvy.\n\n(Choice B) Carnitine assists with long-chain fatty acid transport into mitochondria. Deficiencies in carnitine (eg, primary systemic carnitine deficiency) lead to fatty acid oxidation defects in cardiac and skeletal muscle.\n\n(Choice D) Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency can cause dry and wet beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.\n\n(Choice E) Tyrosine is a nonessential amino acid and the precursor for catecholamines such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.\n\n(Choice F) Vitamin K is involved in the post-translational conversion of glutamate to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid. This modification is necessary for the function of many clotting factors and regulatory proteins involved in the coagulation cascade.\n\nEducational objective:\nHomocystinuria is most commonly caused by cystathionine synthase deficiency. Affected individuals have marfanoid habitus, ectopia lentis, and developmental delay. Significant morbidity and mortality are due primarily to thromboembolism. Many patients with homocystinuria respond dramatically to pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation. {{exhibit_3}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of homocystinuria, its clinical presentation (Marfanoid habitus, lens subluxation, thromboembolic events), and its treatment with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation. It also tests understanding of the underlying enzyme deficiency (cystathionine beta-synthase) and the role of pyridoxine as a cofactor.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the classic triad of Marfanoid habitus, lens subluxation (ectopia lentis), and thromboembolic events, which points towards homocystinuria. Knowing that pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is a treatment option for this condition will lead to the correct answer.",
