    "en": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the office due to neck swelling. The patient says her neck has gradually gotten larger, and she does not like how it appears in the mirror. She otherwise feels well and has no hoarseness, trouble swallowing, or shortness of breath. There is no history of head and neck irradiation. The patient has no prior medical conditions and takes no medications. She has a sister with vitiligo. Blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg and pulse is 75/min. On physical examination, the thyroid is diffusely enlarged with no palpable nodules. There is no tracheal deviation. Serum TSH and free thyroxine levels are normal. Antibodies against thyroid peroxidase are present in high titers. {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of iodide, the iodination of thyroglobulin, and the coupling reaction between 2 iodized tyrosine residues. Antibodies against TPO can be seen in a variety of autoimmune thyroid disorders, most commonly chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis (90% of patients). Hashimoto thyroiditis is a common cause of diffuse goiter, as in this patient. Although most patients develop residual hypothyroidism (low T4, elevated TSH), early in the disease they may be euthyroid (normal T4, normal TSH) or briefly hyperthyroid (elevated T4, suppressed TSH).\n\n(Choice A) Uptake of iodide from the blood against its concentration gradient is an energy-dependent process carried out by the sodium-iodide symporter and stimulated by TSH. TPO is not involved in iodide uptake.\n\n(Choice D) Thyroglobulin is a high-molecular-weight, glycosylated protein that is the major component of colloid in the thyroid follicle. TPO is involved in iodination, but not synthesis of thyroglobulin.\n\n(Choice E) As noted above, the thyroid produces both T3 and T4, although most is in the form of T4. T3, the more active form of thyroid hormone, is produced primarily in peripheral tissues by deiodination of T4. This reaction is catalyzed by iodotyrosine deiodinase, not by TPO.\n\nEducational objective:\nThyroid peroxidase (TPO) catalyzes the oxidation of iodide to iodide, the iodination of thyroglobulin tyrosine residues, and the iodotyrosine coupling reaction that forms T3 and T4. Antibodies against TPO are present in >90% of patients with chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis.",
    "zh": "甲状腺过氧化物酶(TPO)是一种多功能酶，催化碘的氧化、甲状腺球蛋白的碘化以及2个碘化酪氨酸残基之间的偶联反应。在各种自身免疫性甲状腺疾病中均可见到抗TPO抗体，最常见的是慢性淋巴细胞性(桥本)甲状腺炎(90%的患者)。桥本甲状腺炎是弥漫性甲状腺肿的常见原因，正如该患者的情况。尽管大多数患者会发展为残余性甲减（低T4，TSH升高），但在疾病早期，他们可能表现为甲状腺功能正常（T4正常，TSH正常）或短暂性甲状腺功能亢进（T4升高，TSH受抑制）。\n\n(选项A) 从血液中摄取碘，违背其浓度梯度，是一个由钠-碘同向转运体执行的、需要能量的过程，并受TSH刺激。TPO不参与碘的摄取。\n\n(选项D) 甲状腺球蛋白是一种高分子量、糖基化蛋白，是甲状腺滤泡内胶体的主要成分。TPO参与碘化，但不参与甲状腺球蛋白的合成。\n\n(选项E) 如上所述，甲状腺产生T3和T4，尽管大多数以T4的形式存在。T3是甲状腺激素的活性形式，主要在周围组织中通过T4的脱碘作用产生。该反应由碘酪氨酸脱碘酶催化，而不是由TPO催化。\n\n教学目标：\n甲状腺过氧化物酶(TPO)催化碘氧化为碘离子、甲状腺球蛋白酪氨酸残基的碘化以及形成T3和T4的碘酪氨酸偶联反应。超过90%的慢性淋巴细胞性(桥本)甲状腺炎患者存在抗TPO抗体。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of thyroid hormone synthesis and the role of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) in the iodination of thyroglobulin. It also assesses understanding of autoimmune thyroid disorders, specifically Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and the significance of anti-TPO antibodies.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the steps of thyroid hormone synthesis and the function of TPO. Recognize that anti-TPO antibodies target the enzyme responsible for iodinating thyroglobulin, a crucial step in producing thyroid hormones.",
    "zh": "此题考察甲状腺激素合成的知识以及甲状腺过氧化物酶(TPO)在甲状腺球蛋白碘化中的作用。同时也评估对自身免疫性甲状腺疾病（特别是桥本甲状腺炎）以及抗TPO抗体重要性的理解。\n\n要解决这个问题，请回忆甲状腺激素合成的步骤以及TPO的功能。认识到抗TPO抗体靶向负责碘化甲状腺球蛋白的酶，这是产生甲状腺激素的关键步骤。"
