    "en": "A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension is brought to the hospital due to sudden-onset vertigo and dizziness that started an hour ago. On physical examination, there is ptosis and pupillary constriction in the left eye. Extracurricular movements are normal in both eyes. Pain and temperature sensations are decreased over the left side of the face, and the direct corneal reflex is absent on the left. Pain and temperature are also decreased over the right side of the body. Muscle strength is 5/5 in all 4 extremities with normal deep tendon reflexes.",

    "en": "This patient with acute vertigo, sensory loss, and abnormal eye findings most likely suffered a stroke affecting the brainstem. The presence of unilateral ptosis and miosis indicates IMPAIRED SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY (ie, Horner syndrome). Sympathetic innervation of the eye follows a complex pathway:\n\n* First order axons originate in the hypothalamus and descend in the LATERAL BRAINSTEM (next to the spinothalamic tract).\n* They exit the spinal cord at T1 and T2 to reach the paravertebral sympathetic chain.\n* Second order axons ascend to the superior cervical ganglion.\n* Third order axons then continue to ascend along the carotid artery via the carotid plexus.\n* They then traverse the ciliary and oculomotor nerves to innervate the:\n    * Pupillary dilator muscle (dilates pupil)\n    * Superior tarsal muscle (elevates upper lid)\n\nThis patient also has a unilateral loss of the direct (afferent) corneal reflex, which is mediated by the ophthalmic nerve (CN V1). In combination with the loss of pain and temperature sensation on the same side of the face, these findings suggest damage to the ipsilateral SPINAL TRIGEMINAL NUCLEUS in the lateral medulla. The patient's vertigo (VESTIBULAR NUCLEUS) and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation of the body (SPINOTHALAMIC TRACT) are further consistent with damage to the lateral medulla (ie, lateral medullary syndrome).\n\n(Choice A) Abnormal neuromuscular junction function can result in myasthenia gravis, which often causes asymmetric fluctuating ptosis. However, patients with myasthenia gravis often have diplopia, the pupils are not affected, and they do not have sensation deficits.\n\n(Choice B) The oculomotor nerve (CN III) provides parasympathetic input to the iris and lens, and also regulates pupillary constriction. However, damage to parasympathetics would lead to abnormal pupillary dilation. In addition, because CN III provides motor innervation to most of the extraocular muscles, dysfunction would also lead to abnormal extraocular movements.\n\n(Choice C) Compression of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) could lead to impaired facial sensation and an absent corneal reflex (due to interruption of the afferent sensory limb of the corneal reflex). However, it would not lead to ptosis or a constricted pupil.\n\n(Choice D) A constricted pupil occurs in Horner syndrome because the normal parasympathetic activity is not balanced by the sympathetic activity. This relative overactivity of sympathetics when compared to the activity of sympathetics leads to pupillary constriction. Decreased parasympathetic activity would be expected to cause a dilated pupil.\n\nEducational objective:\nA stroke in the lateral brainstem can lead to ipsilateral Horner syndrome because sympathetic neurons travel next to the spinothalamic tract in the lateral medulla.",
    "zh": "该患者出现急性眩晕、感觉丧失和眼部异常表现，最有可能患有影响脑干的卒中。单侧眼睑下垂和瞳孔缩小表明交感神经活动受损（即，Horner 综合征）。眼睛的交感神经支配遵循复杂的通路：\n\n* 第一级轴突起源于下丘脑，并在外侧脑干（邻近丘脑束）下降。\n* 它们从 T1 和 T2 出口脊髓，到达椎旁交感神经链。\n* 第二级轴突上升到颈上神经节。\n* 然后第三级轴突继续沿着颈动脉通过颈动脉丛上升。\n* 然后它们穿过睫状神经和动眼神经支配：\n    * 瞳孔扩张肌（扩张瞳孔）\n    * 上睑提肌（抬高上眼睑）\n\n该患者还出现直接（传入）角膜反射的单侧丧失，该反射由眼神经（CN V1）介导。结合面部同一侧疼痛和温度感觉的丧失，这些发现表明同侧外侧延髓的脊髓三叉神经核受损。患者的眩晕（前庭神经核）和身体对侧疼痛和温度感觉的丧失（丘脑束）进一步支持外侧延髓损伤（即，外侧延髓综合征）。\n\n（选项 A）神经肌肉接头功能异常可导致重症肌无力，这通常会导致不对称的波动性眼睑下垂。然而，重症肌无力患者通常有复视，瞳孔不受影响，并且没有感觉缺陷。\n\n（选项 B）动眼神经（CN III）向虹膜和晶状体提供副交感神经输入，并调节瞳孔收缩。然而，副交感神经损伤会导致瞳孔异常扩张。此外，由于 CN III 为大多数眼外肌提供运动神经支配，功能障碍也会导致眼外运动异常。\n\n（选项 C）三叉神经（CN V）受压可能导致面部感觉受损和角膜反射消失（由于角膜反射传入感觉肢中断）。然而，它不会导致眼睑下垂或瞳孔缩小。\n\n（选项 D）Horner 综合征中会出现瞳孔缩小，因为正常的副交感神经活动与交感神经活动不平衡。与交感神经的活动相比，交感神经的这种相对过度活动导致瞳孔收缩。预计副交感神经活动降低会导致瞳孔放大。\n\n教学目标：\n外侧脑干卒中可导致同侧 Horner 综合征，因为交感神经元在外侧延髓中沿着丘脑束走行。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the neuroanatomy of the sympathetic pathway controlling pupillary dilation and the clinical presentation of Horner syndrome, often associated with brainstem strokes. It also assesses the ability to integrate multiple neurological findings to localize a lesion.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the key clinical signs pointing to Horner syndrome (ptosis and miosis) and then considering the differential diagnoses for unilateral pupillary abnormalities. By correlating these signs with other neurological deficits (corneal reflex, sensory loss), the lesion can be localized to the brainstem, specifically the lateral medulla, consistent with impaired sympathetic outflow.",
