    "en": "A 59-year-old man comes to the office due to diplopia and a drooping right eyelid. His symptoms began a day earlier and have since worsened. Physical examination shows a dilated right pupil that is nonreactive to both light and accommodation. There is vertical and horizontal diplopia. When the patient is asked to stare straight ahead, the right eye is directed inferiorly and laterally with respect to the left eye. MRI of the brain reveals an aneurysm involving the right posterior communicating artery.",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a right oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy secondary to a compressive aneurysm. Lesions involving CN III cause ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid) and impair adduction, depression, and elevation of the eye. As a result, diagonal (eg, horizontal and vertical) diplopia is frequently present. The eye rests in a \"down and out\" position due to the unopposed action of the superior oblique (CN IV) and lateral rectus (CN VI) muscles. Pupillary constriction and accommodation can also be affected as CN III carries parasympathetic fibers to the ciliary muscle and the iris sphincter.\n\nCN III palsy can be due to a variety of causes, including intracranial tumors or aneurysms, nerve ischemia, and head trauma. Aneurysms causing CN III palsy most often involve the posterior communicating artery. When due to an aneurysm, symptoms that develop acutely are especially worrisome as they suggest active aneurysmal dilation and possible impending rupture.\n\n(Choices A, B, D, E, and F) All of these muscles are innervated by CN III, so their function will be impaired in this patient.\n\nEducational objective:\nLesions involving the oculomotor nerve (CN III) cause ptosis, a downward and laterally deviated eye, impaired pupillary constriction and accommodation, and diagonal diplopia. The most dreaded cause of CN III palsy is an enlarging intracranial aneurysm.",
    "zh": "该患者患有右侧动眼神经（CN III）麻痹，继发于压迫性动脉瘤。累及CN III的病变引起眼睑下垂（上眼睑下垂），并损害眼的内收、下压和上抬。因此，常出现对角（例如，水平和垂直）复视。由于上斜肌（CN IV）和外直肌（CN VI）的无拮抗作用，眼睛处于“向下和向外”的位置。CN III还携带通往睫状肌和虹膜括约肌的副交感神经纤维，因此瞳孔收缩和调节也会受到影响。\n\nCN III麻痹可由多种原因引起，包括颅内肿瘤或动脉瘤、神经缺血和头部外伤。引起CN III麻痹的动脉瘤最常累及后交通动脉。当由动脉瘤引起时，急性出现的症状尤其令人担忧，因为它们提示主动脉瘤扩张和可能即将破裂。\n\n（选项 A、B、D、E 和 F）所有这些肌肉均由 CN III 支配，因此它们的功能在此患者中会受损。\n\n教育目的：\n累及动眼神经（CN III）的病变引起眼睑下垂、向下和向外偏斜的眼睛、瞳孔收缩和调节受损以及对角复视。CN III麻痹最可怕的原因是颅内动脉瘤增大。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy, its common causes, and the specific eye muscles it innervates. It requires correlating clinical findings such as ptosis, pupillary abnormalities, and eye deviation with the underlying neurological deficit.\n\nTo solve this question, one must identify the affected nerve based on the constellation of symptoms (ptosis, dilated pupil, \"down and out\" gaze). Then, recall which extraocular muscles are innervated by that nerve and which are innervated by other cranial nerves (CN IV and CN VI) that would remain unaffected.",
    "zh": "此题考察对动眼神经（CN III）麻痹的理解、其常见病因以及其支配的特定眼部肌肉。它要求将临床表现（如眼睑下垂、瞳孔异常和眼偏斜）与潜在的神经功能障碍联系起来。\n\n要解决此题，必须根据症状组合（眼睑下垂、瞳孔散大、“向下和向外”凝视）确定受影响的神经。然后，回忆哪些眼外肌由该神经支配，哪些由其他颅神经（CN IV 和 CN VI）支配，而这些神经将不受影响。"
