    "en": "A 6-week-old infant is brought to the office due to difficulty feeding. The patient was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is breastfeeding for 5 minutes per side every 3 hours. The patient has profuse sweating and difficulty breathing with feeds. Weight is at the 5th percentile. On examination, the patient is tachypneic. Cardiac examination shows a holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border; a palpable thrill is present at the left sternal border. Compared to a healthy infant, this patient likely has which of the following intracardiac pressure changes? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's holosystolic murmur along the lower left sternal border and a palpable thrill are consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD), an abnormal communication between the right ventricle (RV) and the left ventricle (LV). Although small VSDs are typically asymptomatic, large VSDs often present in early infancy with signs of HEART FAILURE (eg, poor feeding, sweating/tachypnea with feeds) and FAILURE TO THRIVE due to left-sided volume overload with inability to maintain adequate cardiac output.\n\nIn utero, vascular resistance against left- and right-sided cardiac outflow is nearly equal. At birth, once the placenta is no longer responsible for oxygenation, pulmonary vascular resistance drops and systemic vascular resistance increases.\n\nIn patients with VSD, this transition causes shunting of blood from the LV to the RV due to increased left-sided cardiac pressure relative to right-sided pressure. The unrestricted blood flow to the RV causes increased pressure in the RV (Choices B and D) and allows a large volume of blood from the LV to reenter the pulmonary circulation; this high volume of recirculating blood leads to left-sided volume overload with increased pressure in the LV and left atrium (Choices A and C). Right atrial pressure is unchanged. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nEducational objective:\nVentricular septal defect causes left-to-right shunting with increased right ventricular pressure and, if large, left-sided volume overload with increased left ventricular and left atrial pressures. A holosystolic murmur is characteristic, and failure to thrive and signs of heart failure (eg, poor feeding, diaphoresis) can occur.",
    "zh": "该患者在左下胸骨旁出现的全收缩期杂音以及可触及的震颤与室间隔缺损 (VSD) 一致，室间隔缺损是右心室 (RV) 和左心室 (LV) 之间的一种异常交通。虽然小的 VSD 通常无症状，但大的 VSD 经常在婴儿早期出现，伴有心力衰竭的迹象（例如，喂养差、喂养时出汗/呼吸急促）和生长迟缓，这是由于左侧容量超负荷导致无法维持足够的心输出量。\n\n在子宫内，针对左侧和右侧心输出的血管阻力几乎相等。出生后，一旦胎盘不再负责氧合，肺血管阻力下降，体循环血管阻力增加。\n\n对于 VSD 患者，这种转变导致血液从 LV 分流到 RV，这是由于左侧心压相对于右侧压力升高。流入 RV 的不受限制的血流导致 RV 内压力升高（选项 B 和 D），并允许大量血液从 LV 重新进入肺循环；这种高容量的循环血液导致左侧容量超负荷，左心室和左心房的压力升高（选项 A 和 C）。右心房压力不变。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n教育目标：\n室间隔缺损导致左向右分流，右心室压力升高，如果较大，则左侧容量超负荷，左心室和左心房压力升高。全收缩期杂音是其特征，可能出现生长迟缓和心力衰竭的迹象（例如，喂养差、出汗）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of ventricular septal defect (VSD) and its effect on intracardiac pressures in infants. Specifically, it assesses the understanding of left-to-right shunting and volume overload in the context of changing pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance after birth.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of a VSD (holosystolic murmur, failure to thrive, signs of heart failure). Understand the transition from fetal to postnatal circulation and how VSD affects intracardiac pressures, leading to increased pressures in the right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle due to shunting and volume overload.",
