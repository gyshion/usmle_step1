    "en": "A 50-year-old woman comes to the office for an annual examination. She is healthy and takes no medications other than vitamin D and calcium supplements. The patient does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her blood pressure is 118/69 mm Hg. Physical examination is unremarkable. A recent mammogram was normal. A colonoscopy showed 2 polyps, which were excised. On histological examination, one polyp is small and has early adenoma features; the other is larger and has late adenoma features. A mutation in which of the following genes would most likely cause this patient's small early adenoma to grow and develop late adenoma features?",

  "correct_answer": "C",

    "en": "The correct answer is C. The progression of a normal colonic mucosa to a small adenoma (polyp) is typically initiated by mutation of the APC tumor suppressor gene. The subsequent growth of the adenoma and its progression to a larger adenoma with late adenoma features is often facilitated by mutation of the KRAS proto-oncogene. KRAS encodes a G protein-like protein that regulates the cell cycle. Mutation of KRAS leads to constitutive activation of the GTP-bound protein, resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation and growth of the adenoma. The final step in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence is malignant transformation, which is often associated with mutations in TP53, a tumor suppressor gene that regulates the cell cycle and promotes DNA repair.\n\n(Choice A) Mutations in the BRCA1 gene are classically associated with breast and ovarian cancers, not typically with the progression of colonic adenomas.\n(Choice B) Cyclin D1 (encoded by CCND1) is a protein that regulates cell cycle progression. Its overexpression is seen in various cancers, but it is not the primary driver of adenoma growth in the context of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.\n(Choice D) Amplification of the NMYC oncogene is commonly seen in neuroblastoma, not typically in the progression of colonic adenomas.\n(Choice E) TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a critical role in malignant transformation of adenomas into carcinomas. While important in the overall process, it is typically involved in the later stages of progression, not the growth of an early adenoma to late adenoma features.\n(Choice F) Mutation of WT1, a tumor suppressor gene, is associated with the development of Wilms tumor, a type of kidney cancer.\n\nKey pearls: The adenoma-carcinoma sequence involves sequential genetic mutations. APC mutation initiates adenoma formation. KRAS mutation promotes adenoma growth. TP53 mutation facilitates malignant transformation. Remember the order: APC -> KRAS -> TP53.",
    "zh": "正确答案是C。正常结肠粘膜进展为小腺瘤（息肉）通常由抑癌基因APC的突变引发。随后，腺瘤的生长及其进展为具有晚期腺瘤特征的较大腺瘤，通常由原癌基因KRAS的突变促进。KRAS编码一种类似G蛋白的蛋白，它调节细胞周期。KRAS突变导致GTP结合蛋白的组成性激活，从而导致细胞不受控制地增殖和腺瘤生长。腺瘤-癌变序列的最后一步是恶性转化，这通常与TP53（一种调节细胞周期并促进DNA修复的抑癌基因）的突变有关。\n\n（选项A）BRCA1基因的突变通常与乳腺癌和卵巢癌相关，通常与结肠腺瘤的进展无关。\n（选项B）Cyclin D1（由CCND1编码）是一种调节细胞周期进展的蛋白质。在各种癌症中可见其过度表达，但它不是腺瘤-癌变序列中腺瘤生长的主要驱动因素。\n（选项D）NMYC癌基因的扩增常见于神经母细胞瘤，通常不常见于结肠腺瘤的进展。\n（选项E）TP53是一种抑癌基因，在腺瘤恶变为癌瘤方面起着关键作用。虽然它在整个过程中很重要，但它通常参与进展的后期阶段，而不是早期腺瘤生长为晚期腺瘤特征。\n（选项F）抑癌基因WT1的突变与肾母细胞瘤（一种肾癌）的发生相关。\n\n关键要点：腺瘤-癌变序列涉及连续的基因突变。APC突变引发腺瘤形成。KRAS突变促进腺瘤生长。TP53突变促进恶性转化。记住这个顺序：APC -> KRAS -> TP53。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the genetic mutations involved in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in colorectal cancer. Specifically, it assesses knowledge of which gene mutation is most likely responsible for the growth and progression of an early adenoma to a larger adenoma with late adenoma features.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall the stepwise progression of colorectal tumorigenesis and the specific genetic alterations associated with each stage. Identifying the stage described in the vignette (growth from early to late adenoma features) and correlating it with the known functions of the genes listed in the options is crucial for selecting the correct answer.",
