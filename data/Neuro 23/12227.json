    "en": "A 60-year-old man comes to the office due to difficulties in tasting food. He says, \"All food now tastes bland,\" and he is unable to enjoy different flavors during meals. Two months ago, the patient had a traumatic brain injury after a head-on motor vehicle collision. He was in a coma for several days and, after regaining consciousness, began having severe headaches and impaired taste. The headaches have improved, but he continues to have difficulty tasting food. The patient has no visual concerns, slurred speech, trouble swallowing, vertigo, or extremity weakness or numbness. He is a truck driver and has a history of heavy tobacco use for many years. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no focal motor deficits. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms?",
    "zh": "一位60岁男性因品尝食物困难前来就诊。他说：“现在所有食物都索然无味”，而且他在用餐时无法享受不同的口味。两个月前，该患者在迎面发生的机动车碰撞事故中遭受了创伤性脑损伤。他昏迷了几天，在恢复意识后，开始出现严重的头痛和味觉障碍。头痛已经好转，但他仍然难以品尝食物。患者没有视觉问题，言语不清，吞咽困难，眩晕，或肢体无力或麻木。他是一名卡车司机，多年来有大量吸烟史。生命体征在正常范围内。体格检查显示无局灶性运动功能障碍。以下哪一项最可能是导致患者目前症状的原因？"

    "en": "This patient has a decreased perception of flavors after traumatic brain injury. The perception of flavor is dependent on both smell and taste, with smell being more important. Patients with ANOSMIA (loss of smell) often describe difficulties with taste, even if taste sensation is intact.\n\nThe perception of smell is mediated by odorant molecules that bind to olfactory chemoreceptor cells in the nasal mucosa. Axons of the chemoreceptor cells make up the olfactory nerve (CN I) rootlets, which project through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone to synapse on the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. The olfactory bulb then projects second-order axons to the primary olfactory cortex in the medial temporal lobe via the olfactory tract.\n\nHead trauma can cause anosmia when acceleration-deceleration forces lead to avulsion of the olfactory nerve rootlets {{exhibit_1}} as they traverse the cribriform plate.\n\n(Choice A) The anterior temporal lobe is important for semantic memory; as a result, injury to this brain region typically results in impaired comprehension about the meaning of words, pictures, and objects.\n\n(Choice C) Dorsolateral medulla infarction causes Wallenberg syndrome. This condition is characterized by vertigo/nystagmus, ipsilateral cerebellar signs (eg, ataxia, dysmetria), loss of pain/temperature sensation in the ipsilateral face and contralateral body, bulbar weakness (eg, dysphagia), and ipsilateral Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, anhidrosis).\n\n(Choice D) The lingual nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3) that provides somatic sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Fibers of the chorda tympani nerve, a branch of the facial nerve (CN VII), also travel with the lingual nerve to relay taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. If taste disturbances were due to injury of the lingual nerve, tongue numbness would also be present.\n\n(Choice E) Sphenoid bone fractures are associated with damage to the optic nerve (CN II), pituitary gland injury, and leakage of cerebrospinal fluid into the sphenoid sinus.\n\nEducational objective:\nOlfactory signals are relayed via the olfactory nerve (CN I) through the cribriform plate to the olfactory bulb, which then projects to the primary olfactory cortex in the medial temporal lobe. Head trauma can tear olfactory nerve (CNI) rootlets as they cross the cribriform plate, causing anosmia. Anosmia is often interpreted by patients as loss of taste. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者在发生创伤性脑损伤后出现味觉感知下降。味觉的感知依赖于嗅觉和味觉，其中嗅觉更为重要。患有嗅觉缺失症（嗅觉丧失）的患者通常会描述味觉困难，即使味觉感觉完好。\n\n嗅觉的感知由气味分子介导，这些分子与鼻粘膜中的嗅觉化学感受器细胞结合。化学感受器细胞的轴突构成嗅神经（CN I）根丝，这些根丝穿过筛骨的筛板投射到嗅球的肾小球上。然后，嗅球通过嗅束将二阶轴突投射到内侧颞叶的初级嗅皮层。\n\n当加速-减速力导致嗅神经根丝{{exhibit_1}}在穿过筛板时撕脱时，头部外伤可引起嗅觉缺失。\n\n（选项A）前颞叶对语义记忆很重要；因此，该脑区损伤通常会导致对单词、图片和物体含义的理解受损。\n\n（选项C）背外侧延髓梗死引起Wallenberg综合征。该病症的特征是眩晕/眼球震颤、同侧小脑体征（如共济失调、运动失调）、同侧面部和对侧身体的疼痛/温度感觉丧失、延髓无力（如吞咽困难）和同侧Horner综合征（缩瞳、上睑下垂、无汗症）。\n\n（选项D）舌神经是三叉神经下颌支（CN V3）的分支，为舌前三分之二提供躯体感觉。鼓索神经纤维，面神经（CN VII）的分支，也与舌神经一起传递来自舌前三分之二的味觉。如果味觉障碍是由于舌神经损伤引起的，也会出现舌麻木。\n\n（选项E）蝶骨骨折与视神经（CN II）、垂体损伤和脑脊液渗入蝶窦有关。\n\n教育目标：\n嗅觉信号通过嗅神经（CN I）通过筛板传递到嗅球，然后投射到内侧颞叶的初级嗅皮层。头部外伤可撕裂嗅神经（CNI）根丝，因为它们穿过筛板，导致嗅觉缺失。嗅觉缺失症通常被患者解释为味觉丧失。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of the olfactory pathway and the causes of anosmia, particularly after traumatic brain injury. It requires understanding the anatomy of the olfactory nerve and the mechanism by which head trauma can disrupt its function. \n\nTo solve this question, consider the patient's history of traumatic brain injury and the specific symptom of altered taste. Recognize that the sense of smell is crucial for flavor perception, and damage to the olfactory nerve is a common cause of anosmia following head trauma.",
