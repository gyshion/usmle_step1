    "en": "This couple’s son has SICKLE CELL DISEASE (SCD), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the production of hemoglobin S and sickled red blood cells that undergo hemolysis (eg, anemia, jaundice) and cause vascular obstruction (eg, painful swelling of the hands/feet). SCD is diagnosed using hemoglobin electrophoresis, which separates different types of hemoglobin according to the electrical charge of their amino acid composition. In this case, electrophoresis shows a predominance of hemoglobin S, consistent with SCD.\n\nFor autosomal recessive disorders such as SCD, affected offspring must inherit a mutant allele from each parent. In this case, both parents are unaffected but have affected offspring. Therefore, both parents must be carriers, and the probability of inheriting each of the 3 possible genotypes (AA, Aa, aa) can be determined using a Punnett square.\n\n*   25% probability (1 in 4) of inheriting 2 normal alleles (AA, unaffected)\n*   50% probability (2 in 4) of inheriting 1 normal allele and 1 mutated allele (Aa, carrier)\n*   25% probability (1 in 4) of inheriting 2 mutated alleles (aa, affected)\n\nAlthough the couple already has an affected child, each child’s genotype is determined independently, and the probability of this couple’s second child inheriting ≥1 mutated alleles is neither more nor less likely than that of their first. Therefore, the probability of this couple’s second child inheriting ≥1 mutated alleles is 50% + 25% = 75%.\n\nEducational objective:\nSickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a predominance of hemoglobin S, causing red blood cells to sickle, hemolyze, and cause vascular obstruction. Offspring of carrier parents have a 3 in 4 (75%) chance of inheriting at least 1 mutated allele (ie, genotype Aa or aa).",
    "zh": "这对夫妇的儿子患有镰状细胞病（SCD），这是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是产生血红蛋白S和镰状红细胞，这些红细胞会发生溶血（例如，贫血，黄疸），并导致血管阻塞（例如，手/脚的疼痛性肿胀）。SCD使用血红蛋白电泳进行诊断，血红蛋白电泳根据其氨基酸组成的电荷分离不同类型的血红蛋白。在这种情况下，电泳显示血红蛋白S占优势，这与SCD一致。\n\n对于像SCD这样的常染色体隐性遗传病，受影响的后代必须从每个父母那里继承一个突变等位基因。在这种情况下，父母双方均未受影响，但他们的后代受到影响。因此，父母双方必须是携带者，并且可以使用Punnett方阵确定继承3种可能基因型（AA，Aa，aa）中每种基因型的概率。\n\n*   继承2个正常等位基因（AA，未受影响）的概率为25%（1/4）\n*   继承1个正常等位基因和1个突变等位基因（Aa，携带者）的概率为50%（2/4）\n*   继承2个突变等位基因（aa，受影响）的概率为25%（1/4）\n\n尽管这对夫妇已经有一个受影响的孩子，但每个孩子的基因型是独立确定的，并且这对夫妇的第二个孩子继承≥1个突变等位基因的概率既不会比他们的第一个孩子更大，也不会更小。因此，这对夫妇的第二个孩子继承≥1个突变等位基因的概率为50%+25%=75%。\n\n教育目标：\n镰状细胞病是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其特征是血红蛋白S占优势，导致红细胞镰变，溶血，并引起血管阻塞。携带者父母的后代有3/4（75%）的机会继承至少1个突变等位基因（即，基因型Aa或aa）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of autosomal recessive inheritance patterns, specifically in the context of sickle cell disease, and the ability to calculate the probability of offspring inheriting mutated alleles. The hemoglobin electrophoresis results confirm the child's sickle cell disease, indicating that both parents are carriers of the sickle cell allele.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize that the parents are carriers, and then use a Punnett square or knowledge of Mendelian genetics to determine the probability of inheriting at least one mutated allele (either as a carrier or affected) which is 75%.",
