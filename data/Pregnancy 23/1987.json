She reports regular fetal movement and no contractions, loss of fluid, or vaginal bleeding. Pregnancy to date has been uncomplicated and the patient has no underlying medical conditions. She signed up for a clinical trial investigating prolactin. At 34 weeks gestation, she had a serum prolactin level several times higher than what was recorded prior to pregnancy. {{exhibit_1}} Which of the following hormones prevents lactation in this patient?",

    "en": "Progesterone and estrogen promote normal development and maternal breast growth during the prenatal period. In the first trimester of pregnancy, progesterone is secreted by the corpus luteum and is crucial to successful implantation. In the second and third trimesters, progesterone is produced by the placenta and suppresses FSH and LH through action on the anterior pituitary (Choice C). Prolactin is a peptide hormone that promotes lactogenesis (ie, maturation of breast alveolar cells) and milk production. It is released by the anterior pituitary gland due to stimulation by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and increases steadily in circulation as pregnancy progresses. Although lactogenesis may begin during the second trimester, lactation is suppressed due to the high progesterone levels inhibiting the binding of prolactin to receptors on breast alveolar cells. {{exhibit_2}} After delivery, the precipitous drop in progesterone allows prolactin to stimulate lactation. (Choice A) β-hCG is secreted by the embryonic syncytiotrophoblast during the first trimester, rising to its highest levels at the ninth week of gestation. β-hCG serves to maintain the corpus luteum until the placenta can assume responsibility for estrogen and progesterone synthesis. By mid-pregnancy, the corpus luteum degenerates and serum β-hCG decreases to a very low level. Therefore, β-hCG is not likely to have a significant effect on lactation during late pregnancy. (Choices B and E) Thyroxine and insulin contribute to normal gestational mammary gland hypertrophy. Although high dose thyroxine can decrease the production of TRH, this patient has an elevated prolactin level which indicates that TRH production is not suppressed.",
    "zh": "孕酮和雌激素促进产前期间正常的发育和孕妇乳房生长。在妊娠早期，孕酮由黄体分泌，对成功着床至关重要。在妊娠中期和晚期，孕酮由胎盘产生，并通过作用于垂体前叶来抑制FSH和LH（选项C）。催乳素是一种肽类激素，可促进泌乳（即，乳腺泡细胞的成熟）和乳汁的产生。它由垂体前叶释放，原因是受到促甲状腺素释放激素 (TRH) 的刺激，并且随着妊娠的进展而在循环中稳步增加。虽然泌乳可能在妊娠中期开始，但由于高孕酮水平抑制催乳素与乳腺泡细胞上受体的结合，因此泌乳受到抑制。{{exhibit_2}} 分娩后，孕酮的急剧下降使催乳素能够刺激泌乳。（选项A）β-hCG 在妊娠早期由胚胎滋养细胞分泌，在妊娠第九周达到最高水平。β-hCG 维持黄体，直到胎盘可以承担雌激素和孕酮的合成。到妊娠中期，黄体退化，血清β-hCG 降低至非常低的水平。因此，β-hCG 不太可能对晚期妊娠期间的泌乳产生重大影响。（选项 B 和 E）甲状腺素和胰岛素有助于正常的妊娠期乳腺肥大。尽管高剂量的甲状腺素可以减少 TRH 的产生，但该患者的催乳素水平升高，这表明 TRH 的产生并未受到抑制。"

    "en": "During pregnancy, high levels of progesterone prevent lactation by inhibiting prolactin's action on breast alveolar cells. Progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum initially and then by the placenta. Other hormones like β-hCG, insulin, LH, and thyroxine have different roles and do not primarily prevent lactation.",
