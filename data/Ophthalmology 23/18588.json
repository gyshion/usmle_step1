    "en": "A 58-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to vision disturbances. Over the past several weeks, the patient has had intermittent episodes in which he sees everything tinted with blue. His vision returned to normal within a few hours each time. When he woke up today, vision in the left eye was blurry. He has had no eye pain, conjunctival redness, or headache. The patient has tingling and numbness in the feet due to diabetic neuropathy, which is unchanged, and reports no other focal weakness or sensory loss. Medical history is notable for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and erectile dysfunction. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows an afferent pupillary defect, decreased visual acuity, and optic disc edema in the left eye. Discontinuing which of the following medications may improve this patient's vision?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's symptoms of transient blue tint to vision and sudden onset of blurry vision in one eye with an afferent pupillary defect, decreased visual acuity, and optic disc edema are highly suggestive of NONARTERITIC ANTERIOR ISCHEMIC OPTIC NEUROPATHY (NAION). This condition is a common cause of sudden, painless vision loss in older adults and is often associated with vascular risk factors, such as those present in this patient (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). The history of intermittent blue vision is also a key clue, as it is a known side effect of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. PDE5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil, are commonly used to treat erectile dysfunction. They work by increasing cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels, which promotes smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. However, PDE5 inhibitors can also inhibit PDE6 in the retina, which is involved in color vision, leading to a transient bluish discoloration of vision. More importantly, PDE5 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of NAION. The mechanism is thought to be related to impaired autoregulation of optic nerve blood flow. Therefore, discontinuing sildenafil is the most likely intervention to improve the patient's vision.\n\n(Choice A) Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. Its ocular side effects include dry eye, blurred vision, and angle-closure glaucoma. It does not typically cause NAION or transient blue vision.\n\n(Choice B) Atorvastatin is a statin used to treat hyperlipidemia. Its primary ocular side effects are rare and may include cataracts. It is not associated with NAION or blue vision.\n\n(Choice C) Canagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor used to treat type 2 diabetes. Its side effects are mainly related to glucosuria and fluid shifts, such as hypotension and urinary tract infections. While it can cause dehydration, leading to potential vision changes, it is not directly linked to NAION or blue vision.\n\n(Choice D) Metformin is a biguanide used to treat type 2 diabetes. Its most common side effects are gastrointestinal. Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious complication. Visual side effects are not a significant concern.\n\n(Choice E) Ramipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used to treat hypertension. Its side effects are primarily related to renal function, hyperkalemia, and cough. While it can cause hypotension, leading to potential vision changes, it is not directly associated with NAION or blue vision.\n\nKey pearls:\n- PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil) can cause transient BLUE DISCOLORATION of vision and are associated with NONARTERITIC ANTERIOR ISCHEMIC OPTIC NEUROPATHY (NAION).\n- NAION presents with SUDDEN, PAINLESS MONOCULAR VISION LOSS, afferent pupillary defect, decreased visual acuity, and optic disc edema.\n- Risk factors for NAION include VASCULAR RISK FACTORS (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, nocturnal hypotension).",
    "zh": "患者出现短暂的视力蓝色色调和一只眼睛突然出现视力模糊，伴有传入性瞳孔缺陷、视力下降和视盘水肿，高度提示非动脉炎性前部缺血性视神经病变 (NAION)。这种情况是老年人突然、无痛性视力丧失的常见原因，通常与该患者所存在的血管危险因素（高血压、糖尿病、高脂血症）相关。间歇性视力蓝色也是一个关键线索，因为这是磷酸二酯酶 5 (PDE5) 抑制剂的已知副作用。PDE5 抑制剂，如西地那非、他达拉非和伐地那非，常用于治疗勃起功能障碍。它们通过增加环磷酸鸟苷 (cGMP) 水平来发挥作用，从而促进平滑肌松弛和血管舒张。然而，PDE5 抑制剂也可以抑制视网膜中的 PDE6，后者参与颜色视觉，导致视力出现短暂的蓝色变色。更重要的是，PDE5 抑制剂与 NAION 风险增加有关。其机制被认为与视神经血流的自主调节受损有关。因此，停用西地那非是最有可能改善患者视力的干预措施。\n\n(选项 A) 阿米替林是一种三环类抗抑郁药。其眼部副作用包括干眼症、视力模糊和闭角型青光眼。它通常不会引起 NAION 或短暂的蓝色视力。\n\n(选项 B) 阿托伐他汀是一种用于治疗高脂血症的他汀类药物。其主要的眼部副作用很少见，可能包括白内障。它与 NAION 或蓝色视力无关。\n\n(选项 C) 卡格列净是一种用于治疗 2 型糖尿病的钠-葡萄糖协同转运蛋白 2 (SGLT2) 抑制剂。其副作用主要与尿糖和液体转移有关，例如低血压和尿路感染。虽然它会导致脱水，从而导致潜在的视力变化，但它与 NAION 或蓝色视力没有直接关系。\n\n(选项 D) 二甲双胍是一种用于治疗 2 型糖尿病的双胍类药物。其最常见的副作用是胃肠道。乳酸酸中毒是一种罕见但严重的并发症。视觉副作用不是一个主要关注点。\n\n(选项 E) 雷米普利是一种用于治疗高血压的血管紧张素转换酶 (ACE) 抑制剂。其副作用主要与肾功能、高钾血症和咳嗽有关。虽然它会导致低血压，从而导致潜在的视力变化，但它与 NAION 或蓝色视力没有直接关系。\n\n关键要点：\n- PDE5 抑制剂（西地那非、他达拉非）可引起短暂的视力蓝色变色，并与非动脉炎性前部缺血性视神经病变 (NAION) 相关。\n- NAION 表现为突发、无痛性单眼视力丧失、传入性瞳孔缺陷、视力下降和视盘水肿。\n- NAION 的危险因素包括血管危险因素（高血压、糖尿病、高脂血症、吸烟、夜间低血压）。"
