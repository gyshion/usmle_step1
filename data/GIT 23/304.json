    "en": "A 32-year-old man comes to the clinic for peptic ulcer disease follow-up. The patient has received several months of proton pump inhibitor therapy without significant improvement in his epigastric discomfort. He does not use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tobacco, or alcohol. *Helicobacter pylori* testing is negative. The patient undergoes a partial gastrectomy for refractory peptic ulcer disease. The pathologist receives the tissue and notes significant enlargement of the gastric rugal folds on gross examination. Microscopy of the gastric mucosa reveals parietal cell hyperplasia. Which of the following stimuli is the most likely cause of parietal cell proliferation in this patient?",

    "en": "Parietal cells are located in the gastric glands of the fundus and body of the stomach. They can be spotted easily due to their eosinophilic cytoplasm on H&E stain. These cells have abundant mitochondria and an intracellular tubulovesicular system that allows them to secrete large quantities of gastric acid (HCl) and intrinsic factor.\n\nParietal cells are influenced by a number of substances. Histamine, acetylcholine, and gastrin increase gastric acid secretion, but prostaglandins inhibit it. **Gastrin** not only stimulates HCl secretion, but it also has a trophic effect on parietal cells. In patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (such as this patient), gastrin hypersecretion induces parietal cell hyperplasia, causing visible enlargement of gastric folds on endoscopy. The increased gastric acid secretion induced by excess gastrin also causes peptic ulcer disease, heartburn, and diarrhea.\n\n(Choice A) Acetylcholine is a universal neurotransmitter that is present in parasympathetic postganglionic synapses and in all autonomic preganglionic ganglions. Cholinergic receptors are divided into muscarinic (located in smooth muscle and glands) and nicotinic (found at the neuromuscular junction). Acetylcholine stimulates parietal cell acid secretion but is not typically associated with parietal cell hyperplasia or gastric fold enlargement.\n\n(Choice C) Secretin is produced by S cells of the small intestine. It increases bicarbonate production by the pancreas and leads to the secretion of watery, alkaline pancreatic juice. This substance also inhibits gastric acid secretion and stimulates pyloric sphincter contraction.\n\n(Choice D) Serotonin (5HT) is primarily found in enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the central nervous system, and platelets. In the GI tract, it helps to regulate intestinal secretions and peristalsis.\n\n(Choice E) Somatostatin (growth hormone-inhibiting hormone) is secreted by D cells of pancreatic islets and GI mucosa. It has multiple inhibitory effects over the GI tract, including decreasing motility, gastrin secretion, pancreatic endocrine/exocrine secretion, and absorption of nutrients.\n\n(Choice F) Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α) is a potent stimulator of epithelial growth and is secreted by carcinomas, macrophages, and epithelial cells. Menetrier disease is associated with overproduction of TGF-α, resulting in mucosal-cell hyperplasia with gastric fold enlargement. However, the condition causes hypoplasia of parietal/chief cells, resulting in glandular atrophy with reduced gastric acid secretion.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome develop peptic ulcer disease and parietal cell hyperplasia with gastric fold enlargement due to gastrin hypersecretion.",
    "zh": "壁细胞位于胃底和胃体的胃腺中。由于它们在H&E染色中呈现嗜酸性细胞质，因此很容易被发现。这些细胞拥有丰富的线粒体和细胞内管泡系统，这使得它们能够分泌大量的胃酸(HCl)和内因子。\n\n壁细胞受到多种物质的影响。组胺、乙酰胆碱和胃泌素增加胃酸分泌，但前列腺素会抑制它。**胃泌素**不仅刺激HCl分泌，而且对壁细胞具有营养作用。在Zollinger-Ellison综合征患者（如本患者）中，胃泌素过度分泌会导致壁细胞增生，从而导致内镜检查时可见胃皱襞增大。过量胃泌素引起的胃酸分泌增加也会导致消化性溃疡病、胃灼热和腹泻。\n\n(选项A) 乙酰胆碱是一种普遍存在的神经递质，存在于副交感神经节后突触和所有自主神经节前神经节中。胆碱能受体分为毒蕈碱型（位于平滑肌和腺体中）和烟碱型（位于神经肌肉接头处）。乙酰胆碱刺激壁细胞酸分泌，但通常与壁细胞增生或胃皱襞增大无关。\n\n(选项C) 促胰液素由小肠的S细胞产生。它增加胰腺产生的碳酸氢盐，并导致分泌水样、碱性胰液。该物质还抑制胃酸分泌并刺激幽门括约肌收缩。\n\n(选项D) 血清素（5HT）主要存在于胃肠道(GI)道的嗜铬细胞、中枢神经系统和血小板中。在胃肠道中，它有助于调节肠道分泌和蠕动。\n\n(选项E) 生长抑素（生长激素抑制激素）由胰岛的D细胞和胃肠道粘膜分泌。它对胃肠道具有多种抑制作用，包括降低蠕动、胃泌素分泌、胰腺内分泌/外分泌和营养物质的吸收。\n\n(选项F) 转化生长因子α（TGF-α）是上皮细胞生长的有效刺激因子，由癌细胞、巨噬细胞和上皮细胞分泌。梅涅特里埃病与TGF-α过度产生有关，导致粘膜细胞增生，胃皱襞增大。然而，这种情况会导致壁细胞/主细胞发育不全，导致腺体萎缩，胃酸分泌减少。\n\n教育目标：\nZollinger-Ellison综合征患者由于胃泌素过度分泌而出现消化性溃疡病和壁细胞增生，并伴有胃皱襞增大。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and the role of gastrin in stimulating parietal cell hyperplasia and gastric acid secretion. It also requires understanding the effects of other hormones and neurotransmitters on gastric function.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation suggestive of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (refractory peptic ulcer disease, gastric fold enlargement, parietal cell hyperplasia). Recall that gastrin is the primary trophic factor for parietal cells and is responsible for the hypersecretion of gastric acid in this condition.",
    "zh": "本题考察对Zollinger-Ellison综合征的了解以及胃泌素在刺激壁细胞增生和胃酸分泌中的作用。它还需要理解其他激素和神经递质对胃功能的影响。\n\n要解决这个问题，需要识别提示Zollinger-Ellison综合征的临床表现（难治性消化性溃疡病、胃皱襞增大、壁细胞增生）。回想一下，胃泌素是壁细胞的主要营养因子，并负责在这种情况下胃酸的过度分泌。"
