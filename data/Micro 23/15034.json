    "en": "A 24-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 0, at 26 weeks gestation comes to the emergency department due to abdominal cramping and vaginal bleeding. She recently emigrated from Bolivia and reports no prior medical problems. The patient's only medication is a daily multivitamin. Immunization status is unknown. The patient spontaneously delivers a stillborn fetus with multiple congenital malformations. Fetal autopsy reveals microcephaly with thin cerebral cortices, ventriculomegaly, and subcortical calcifications. Viral RNA of a neurotropic virus is detected in body fluids of the mother and the fetus. Transplacental transmission of this virus causes apoptosis of neural progenitor cells in the developing fetus, leading to disruption of neuronal proliferation, migration, and differentiation.",
    "zh": "一名24岁的女性，孕1产0，妊娠26周因腹部绞痛和阴道出血到急诊科就诊。她最近从玻利维亚移民过来，报告没有既往病史。患者唯一的药物是每日复合维生素。免疫接种史不详。患者自发分娩了一个死产胎儿，伴有多发先天性畸形。胎儿尸检显示小头畸形伴脑皮质变薄、脑室扩大和皮质下钙化。在母亲和胎儿的体液中检测到神经向性病毒的病毒RNA。这种病毒的经胎盘传播导致发育中的胎儿神经祖细胞凋亡，导致神经元增殖、迁移和分化的破坏。"

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Zika virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flavivirus genus. Transmission occurs primarily via an Aedes mosquito bite, but infected patients can also spread the virus via genital secretions. The neurotropic virus can cross the placenta and infect and destroy fetal neural progenitor cells, causing congenital Zika syndrome and possible fetal demise. Fetal brain development is impaired due to disruption of normal proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neurons.\n\nClassic findings in affected newborns include microcephaly with facial features out of proportion to head size, arthrogryposis (contractures), seizures, hypertonia, and ocular abnormalities. Loss of brain mass (eg, cortical thinning, ventriculomegaly) as well as subcortical calcifications are typically present. Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Zika RNA (real-time reverse transcriptase PCR) in serum, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nThe mainstay of treatment for surviving infants is supportive care with management of feeding difficulties, hydrocephalus, and seizures. Pregnant women should be counseled to avoid traveling to areas with ongoing Zika transmission (eg, South and Central America, Asia, Africa, Mexico, the Caribbean).\n\n(Choices A, B, and E) Cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) are double-stranded DNA viruses that can be transmitted in utero and cause CNS abnormalities in the fetus. Typical CMV findings include hearing loss, chorioretinitis, jaundice, and periventricular calcifications. When transmitted in utero, HSV and VZV can cause diffuse cutaneous lesions and severe brain destruction; hypoplasia of the limbs and eyes is also commonly seen with fetal VZV infection.\n\n(Choice C) Parvovirus B19 is a single-stranded DNA virus that infects and destroys erythroid progenitor cells and can result in fetal hydrops when the infection is contracted during pregnancy.\n\n(Choice D) Rubella virus is a single-stranded RNA virus that typically presents with cardiac defects, hearing loss, and cataracts.",
    "zh": "寨卡病毒是一种属于黄病毒属的单链RNA病毒。主要通过埃及伊蚊叮咬传播，但感染患者也可以通过生殖器分泌物传播该病毒。这种嗜神经病毒可以穿过胎盘并感染和破坏胎儿神经祖细胞，导致先天性寨卡综合征和可能的胎儿死亡。由于神经元正常增殖、迁移和分化的破坏，胎儿大脑发育受损。\n\n受影响的新生儿的典型表现包括小头畸形伴面部特征与头部大小不成比例、关节挛缩、癫痫发作、肌张力亢进和眼部异常。通常存在脑质量损失（例如，皮质变薄、脑室扩大）以及皮质下钙化。通过检测血清、尿液或脑脊液中的寨卡RNA（实时逆转录酶PCR）来确诊。\n\n幸存婴儿的主要治疗方法是支持性护理，包括处理喂养困难、脑积水和癫痫发作。应劝告孕妇避免前往寨卡病毒持续传播的地区（例如，南美洲和中美洲、亚洲、非洲、墨西哥、加勒比海）。\n\n（选项 A、B 和 E）巨细胞病毒 (CMV)、单纯疱疹病毒 (HSV) 和水痘-带状疱疹病毒 (VZV) 是双链DNA病毒，可以在宫内传播并导致胎儿中枢神经系统异常。典型的CMV表现包括听力丧失、脉络膜视网膜炎、黄疸和脑室周围钙化。宫内传播时，HSV和VZV可引起弥漫性皮肤病变和严重的脑破坏；胎儿VZV感染也常可见肢体和眼睛发育不全。\n\n（选项 C）B19微小病毒是一种单链DNA病毒，可感染和破坏红系祖细胞，如果妊娠期间感染，可导致胎儿水肿。\n\n（选项 D）风疹病毒是一种单链RNA病毒，通常表现为心脏缺陷、听力丧失和白内障。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of congenital infections, specifically Zika virus, and its characteristic presentation in newborns. It assesses the ability to recognize the clinical features of congenital Zika syndrome and differentiate it from other congenital infections.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key findings of microcephaly, cerebral cortical thinning, ventriculomegaly, and subcortical calcifications in the fetus. Consider the patient's travel history and the fact that the virus is neurotropic and causes apoptosis of neural progenitor cells.",
