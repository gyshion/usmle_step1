    "en": "A 26-year-old woman comes to the emergency department to report that her life is in danger. The patient believes that transmitters inserted in her bedroom walls are broadcasting her thoughts to a central government agency that is now plotting to kill her. On mental status examination, she is fearful and paces the examining room. The patient makes poor eye contact with the examiner, and her responses are interrupted by frequent pauses during which she appears to talk back to a person who is not present. She has no medical history. The patient smokes a pack of cigarettes daily and does not use illicit drugs. Physical examination shows a thin, disheveled young woman but no abnormalities. She is hospitalized, improves with medication over the course of 2 weeks, and is discharged on olanzapine. At this patient's 3-month checkup, which of the following studies should be obtained?",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Olanzapine is a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medication used to treat psychotic and mood disorders. SGAs are commonly used as first-line agents due to their lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects compared to first-generation antipsychotics. As a class, SGAs are associated with METABOLIC ADVERSE EFFECTS (eg, weight gain, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, increased risk of diabetes) to varying degrees. Among the SGAs, olanzapine and clozapine carry the GREATEST METABOLIC SYNDROME risk. Patients taking SGAs require routine monitoring of metabolic parameters, including weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, FASTING GLUCOSE, and LIPID PROFILE.\n\n(Choices A and F) Blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and thyroid function tests should be routinely monitored in patients taking the mood stabilizer lithium due to its potential to cause hypothyroidism and impair renal function. Treatment with olanzapine does not require routine monitoring of thyroid or renal function.\n\n(Choice B) Olanzapine rarely causes neutropenia, and routine monitoring of complete blood counts is not required unless the patient has a history of drug-induced or baseline neutropenia. Clozapine is the only antipsychotic that requires regular monitoring of the absolute neutrophil count due to the drug's 1% risk of agranulocytosis.\n\n(Choice C) Routine ECG monitoring is not required with antipsychotic treatment unless the patient has known pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (eg, long QT syndrome). Among SGAs, ziprasidone is most often associated with QT prolongation.\n\n(Choice E) Although antipsychotics can cause prolactin elevation due to D2 receptor antagonism in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, prolactin levels are not routinely monitored unless the patient has symptoms of prolactin dysfunction (eg, galactorrhea, sexual impairment). Among SGAs, risperidone has been associated with a greater risk of prolactin elevation.\n\nEducational objective:\nAs a class, second-generation antipsychotics are associated with metabolic adverse effects (eg, weight gain, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, increased risk of diabetes). Within the class, olanzapine and clozapine carry the greatest risk.",
    "zh": "奥氮平是一种二代抗精神病药（SGA），用于治疗精神病和心境障碍。由于与一代抗精神病药相比，SGA的锥体外系副作用风险较低，因此常被用作一线药物。作为一类药物，SGA与不同程度的代谢不良反应相关（例如，体重增加、血脂异常、高血糖、糖尿病风险增加）。在SGA中，奥氮平和氯氮平具有最大的代谢综合征风险。服用SGA的患者需要定期监测代谢参数，包括体重、腰围、血压、空腹血糖和血脂分析。\n\n（选项A和F）血尿素氮、肌酐和甲状腺功能检查应定期监测服用情绪稳定剂锂的患者，因为锂可能导致甲状腺功能减退并损害肾功能。奥氮平治疗不需要定期监测甲状腺或肾功能。\n\n（选项B）奥氮平很少引起中性粒细胞减少症，除非患者有药物诱导性或基线中性粒细胞减少症病史，否则不需要常规监测全血细胞计数。氯氮平是唯一需要定期监测绝对中性粒细胞计数的抗精神病药，因为该药有1%的粒细胞缺乏症风险。\n\n（选项C）除非患者已知存在心血管危险因素（例如，长QT综合征），否则抗精神病药物治疗不需要常规心电图监测。在SGA中，齐拉西酮最常与QT间期延长相关。\n\n（选项E）尽管抗精神病药物可能由于结节漏斗通路中的D2受体拮抗作用而导致催乳素升高，但除非患者出现催乳素功能障碍的症状（例如，溢乳、性功能障碍），否则不会常规监测催乳素水平。在SGA中，利培酮与较高的催乳素升高风险相关。\n\n教学目标：\n作为一类药物，二代抗精神病药与代谢不良反应相关（例如，体重增加、血脂异常、高血糖、糖尿病风险增加）。在这一类药物中，奥氮平和氯氮平的风险最大。"
