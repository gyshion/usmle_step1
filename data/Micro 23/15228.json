    "en": "Biopsy of the ulcerative tonsil lesion in this patient with persistent throat pain shows malignant cells with atypical mitotic figures and keratin pearls, findings consistent with head and neck mucosal squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).\n\nAlthough most head and neck cancers are linked to tobacco and excessive alcohol use, patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma (eg, tonsil, base of tongue) often lack traditional risk factors. Instead, oropharyngeal cancer is frequently associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) exposure, particularly in younger patients. HPV-positive HNSCC primarily affects the oropharynx, possibly due to the higher concentration of lymphatic tissue facilitating viral processing. The most common causative subtypes are HPV-16 and 18, which are covered by the HPV vaccine.\n\nHPV is a nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that infects cutaneous and mucosal tissues. Some strains (eg, HPV-1, HPV-2) cause skin warts. Others (eg, HPV-6, HPV-11) cause anogenital papillomas or papillomas that affect the upper respiratory tract (ie, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis). High-risk strains (eg, HPV-16, HPV-18) produce proteins (E6, E7) that prevent apoptosis, promote cellular proliferation, and cause genetic instability; they are also linked to cancer of the cervix, vulva, anus, and penis.\n\n(Choice A) Coxsackievirus is the leading cause of hand-foot-and-mouth disease, which is characterized by low-grade fever, oral macules/vesicles, and a macular/papular/vesicular rash on the hands, feet, and extremities. This virus does not typically cause malignant transformation.\n\n(Choice B) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can also cause HNSCC; however, it is most specifically implicated in the nasopharynx, rather than the oropharynx. The classic triad of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a neck mass, nasal obstruction, and a unilateral, persistent middle ear effusion due to obstruction of the eustachian tube.\n\n(Choice C) Herpes simplex virus causes latent infection in the sensory nerves. It is associated with vesicular lesions of the orolabial mucosa, not tonsillar ulcers, and does not cause HNSCC.\n\n(Choice D) HIV increases the risk of many types of cancer due to immune dysregulation. The risk of cancers related to underlying infections, such as human herpesvirus 8 (Kaposi sarcoma), HPV, EBV, and hepatitis B and C viruses (hepatocellular carcinoma), is particularly increased. However, oropharyngeal cancer is most tightly linked to underlying HPV infection even in the setting of HIV.\n\nEducational objective:\nMost oropharyngeal carcinomas (eg. tonsil, base of tongue) are caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. HPV-16 and HPV-18 are particularly likely to cause malignant transformation. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者持续咽喉疼痛，扁桃体溃疡病变的活检显示恶性细胞，伴有非典型有丝分裂像和角蛋白珠，这些发现与头颈部黏膜鳞状细胞癌（HNSCC）一致。\n\n尽管大多数头颈癌与烟草和过量饮酒有关，但口咽癌（如扁桃体、舌根）患者通常缺乏传统危险因素。相反，口咽癌经常与人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）暴露有关，尤其是在年轻患者中。HPV阳性HNSCC主要影响口咽，这可能归因于淋巴组织浓度较高，从而促进病毒处理。最常见的致病亚型是HPV-16和18，这两种亚型已被HPV疫苗覆盖。\n\nHPV是一种无包膜、双链DNA病毒，可感染皮肤和黏膜组织。某些毒株（如HPV-1、HPV-2）引起皮肤疣。其他毒株（如HPV-6、HPV-11）引起肛门生殖器乳头状瘤或影响上呼吸道的乳头状瘤（即复发性呼吸道乳头状瘤病）。高危毒株（如HPV-16、HPV-18）产生阻止细胞凋亡、促进细胞增殖和导致基因不稳定的蛋白质（E6、E7）；它们也与子宫颈癌、外阴癌、肛门癌和阴茎癌有关。\n\n（选项A）柯萨奇病毒是手足口病的常见病因，其特征是低烧、口腔斑丘疹/水疱以及手、足和四肢的斑疹/丘疹/水疱样皮疹。这种病毒通常不会引起恶性转化。\n\n（选项B）EB病毒（EBV）也可引起HNSCC；然而，它更多地与鼻咽而非口咽有关。鼻咽癌的典型三联征是颈部肿块、鼻塞和单侧持续性中耳积液，这是由于咽鼓管阻塞所致。\n\n（选项C）单纯疱疹病毒在感觉神经中引起潜伏感染。它与口唇黏膜的水疱性病变有关，而不是扁桃体溃疡，并且不会引起HNSCC。\n\n（选项D）HIV由于免疫失调而增加了多种癌症的风险。与潜在感染相关的癌症风险，例如人类疱疹病毒8型（卡波西肉瘤）、HPV、EBV以及乙型和丙型肝炎病毒（肝细胞癌），尤其增加。然而，即使在HIV感染的情况下，口咽癌也与潜在的HPV感染密切相关。\n\n教育目标：\n大多数口咽癌（如扁桃体、舌根）是由人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）感染引起的。HPV-16和HPV-18特别可能引起恶性转化。{{exhibit_2}}"
