The lesions are occasionally pruritic but are otherwise asymptomatic; he is not bothered significantly by them and made today's appointment at his wife's insistence. Medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. On examination, there are numerous pigmented plaques, as shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}.",

  "correct_answer": "F",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Seborrheic keratosis (SK) (plural: keratoses) is a common, tan or brown, epidermal tumor occurring in middle-aged or elderly individuals. It has a variable appearance from nearly flat macules to raised, wart-like lesions, ranging in size from a few millimeters to centimeters. SK typically has a velvety or greasy surface and well-demarcated border, and is often described as having a \"stuck-on\" appearance. On microscopic examination, the lesions of SK are composed of small cells resembling basal cells, with variable pigmentation, hyperkeratosis (thickening of the stratum corneum), and keratin-containing cysts.\n\nThe etiology of SK is not fully understood; however, it is frequently associated with activating mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. SK itself is benign, but rapid onset of numerous SKs (Leser-Trélat sign) is often associated with an internal malignancy (eg, gastric adenocarcinoma), possibly due to overproduction of insulin-like growth factor 1 and other cytokines.\n\n(Choice A) Acanthosis nigricans is characterized by hyperpigmented, velvety plaques at flexural areas (eg, axilla, posterior neck). It is associated with diabetes mellitus, obesity, and visceral malignancies.\n\n(Choice B) Actinic keratosis presents with hyperkeratotic lesions in sun-exposed areas of the scalp, ears, face, and hands. These lesions are unpigmented and, despite the similar name, are unrelated to seborrheic keratosis.\n\n(Choice C) Lichen planus is characterized by the \"5 Ps\": polygonal, planar, pruritic, purplish plaques on the wrists, hands, trunk, and legs. Fine white lines (Wickham striae) may be present on the plaque surface.\n\n(Choice D) Melanoma characteristically presents as an asymmetric, pigmented lesion with an irregular border, variable coloration, and change in size and appearance over time. Multifocal development of monotonous, otherwise asymptomatic lesions is much more typical of SK.\n\n(Choice E) Psoriasis presents with scaly, nonpigmented plaques. Although it may occur on the trunk, it is more common on the extensor surfaces of the extremities. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}}",
    "zh": "脂溢性角化病（SK）（复数：角化病）是一种常见的、呈棕褐色或棕色的表皮肿瘤，发生于中年或老年人。它具有多样的外观，从近乎扁平的斑点到隆起、疣状的病变，大小从几毫米到几厘米不等。SK通常具有天鹅绒般或油腻的表面和界限清晰的边缘，并且通常被描述为具有“黏附”外观。在显微镜检查下，SK的病变由类似于基底细胞的小细胞组成，具有可变的色素沉着、角化过度（角质层增厚）和含角蛋白的囊肿。\n\nSK的病因尚不完全清楚；然而，它经常与成纤维细胞生长因子受体3的激活突变相关。SK本身是良性的，但大量SK的快速发生（Leser-Trélat征）通常与内部恶性肿瘤（例如，胃腺癌）相关，这可能由于胰岛素样生长因子1和其他细胞因子的过度产生所致。\n\n（选项A）黑棘皮病以屈曲部位（例如，腋窝、后颈）的色素沉着过度、天鹅绒状斑块为特征。它与糖尿病、肥胖和内脏恶性肿瘤有关。\n\n（选项B）日光性角化病表现为头皮、耳朵、面部和手部暴露于阳光下的角化过度病变。这些病变无色素沉着，尽管名称相似，但与脂溢性角化病无关。\n\n（选项C）扁平苔藓的特征是“5个P”：腕部、手部、躯干和腿部的多边形、平面、瘙痒、紫红色斑块。斑块表面可能存在细小的白线（Wickham纹）。\n\n（选项D）黑色素瘤的特征是表现为不对称的、色素沉着的病变，具有不规则的边缘、可变的颜色以及随时间推移的大小和外观变化。单调的、无症状病变的多灶性发展更常见于SK。\n\n（选项E）银屑病表现为鳞状、无色素沉着的斑块。虽然它可能发生在躯干上，但更常见于四肢的伸侧。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}}"
