    "en": "A 26-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to a 10-hour history of progressively worsening right-sided scrotal pain. Clinical and radiological evaluations confirm testicular torsion with significant ischemic damage and the patient undergoes unilateral orchiectomy. Three months later, he comes to the office for follow-up. The patient is otherwise healthy and takes no medications but is worried about the risk of sexual dysfunction and infertility. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following sets of findings in this patient?",

    "en": "{{exhibit_1}}\n\nSpermatogenesis in the testis is dependent on 2 primary hormone systems. Testicular Leydig cells produce testosterone in response to LH from the pituitary; in turn, LH is regulated by feedback inhibition from testosterone. At the same time, FSH from the pituitary induces the Sertoli cells to produce androgen binding protein (ABP), which concentrates testosterone in the seminiferous tubules and facilitates spermatogenesis. The Sertoli cells also produce inhibin, which provides feedback regulation of FSH.\n\nFollowing unilateral orchiectomy, the initial drop in circulating testosterone stimulates pituitary LH secretion, leading to compensatory testosterone production and Leydig cell hyperplasia in the remaining testis. Testosterone levels are quickly restored, maintaining normal libido, erectile function, and secondary sex characteristics.\n\nConcurrently, the loss of inhibin following unilateral orchiectomy leads to increased pituitary FSH release, stimulating ABP production and facilitating spermatogenesis in the remaining testis. However, due to the loss of seminiferous tubules in the orchiectomized testis, most patients experience decreased net spermatogenesis, often with reduced fertility (Choice C).\n\n(Choice A) Bilateral testicular damage (eg, orchitis, bilateral orchiectomy) leads to azoospermia. In addition, nontesticular sources of testosterone (eg, adrenals) are often inadequate to maintain normal libido and erectile function.\n\n(Choice D) Erectile dysfunction (ED) with normal sperm counts can be caused by a variety of disorders (eg, neurologic or vascular disorders, psychogenic ED), but most patients who have loss of testosterone production severe enough to cause ED will also have impaired spermatogenesis.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nFollowing unilateral orchiectomy, the drop in testosterone stimulates pituitary LH secretion, which stimulates increased testosterone production in the remaining testis and maintains libido, erectile function, and secondary sex characteristics. However, the loss of sperm-producing tissue usually causes a drop in sperm counts.",
    "zh": "{{exhibit_1}}\n\n睾丸中的精子发生依赖于两个主要的激素系统。睾丸间质细胞响应垂体释放的LH产生睾酮；反过来，LH受到来自睾酮的负反馈抑制的调节。与此同时，垂体释放的FSH诱导支持细胞产生雄激素结合蛋白（ABP），该蛋白将睾酮集中在曲细精管中并促进精子发生。支持细胞也产生抑制素，它提供对FSH的反馈调节。\n\n单侧睾丸切除术后，循环睾酮的最初下降刺激垂体LH的分泌，导致剩余睾丸代偿性睾酮产生和间质细胞增生。睾酮水平迅速恢复，维持正常的性欲、勃起功能和第二性征。\n\n同时，单侧睾丸切除术后抑制素的缺失导致垂体FSH释放增加，刺激ABP的产生并促进剩余睾丸的精子发生。然而，由于被切除睾丸的曲细精管缺失，大多数患者经历精子发生净下降，通常伴有生育力降低（选项C）。\n\n（选项A）双侧睾丸损伤（例如，睾丸炎、双侧睾丸切除术）导致无精症。此外，非睾丸来源的睾酮（例如，肾上腺）通常不足以维持正常的性欲和勃起功能。\n\n（选项D）勃起功能障碍（ED）伴有正常的精子计数可由多种疾病引起（例如，神经或血管疾病、心因性ED），但大多数睾酮产生不足以引起ED的患者也会出现精子发生受损。\n\n教育目的：\n\n单侧睾丸切除术后，睾酮的下降刺激垂体LH的分泌，从而刺激剩余睾丸中睾酮的产生增加，并维持性欲、勃起功能和第二性征。然而，产生精子的组织的损失通常会导致精子计数下降。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of hormonal regulation and the impact of unilateral orchiectomy on testosterone levels, erectile function, and spermatogenesis. It requires knowledge of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and the roles of LH, FSH, testosterone, and inhibin.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that unilateral orchiectomy leads to compensatory testosterone production, maintaining normal erectile function, but the loss of seminiferous tubules in the removed testis results in decreased sperm production. Therefore, the most likely finding is normal erectile function and decreased sperm count.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对激素调节的理解以及单侧睾丸切除术对睾酮水平、勃起功能和精子发生的影响。它需要了解下丘脑-垂体-性腺轴以及LH、FSH、睾酮和抑制素的作用。\n\n解决这个问题的关键是认识到单侧睾丸切除术导致代偿性睾酮产生，维持正常的勃起功能，但切除的睾丸中曲细精管的损失导致精子产生减少。因此，最有可能的发现是正常的勃起功能和精子计数降低。"
