    "en": "A 46-year-old woman comes to the office to be tested for HIV after one of her prior sexual partners found that he was HIV-positive. She feels healthy and has no symptoms. The patient has never had a sexually transmitted infection and has no chronic medical conditions. She has had several sexual partners in her lifetime and uses condoms inconsistently. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. HIV antigen/antibody immunoassay and a confirmatory HIV-1 antibody test are positive. Further studies reveal plasma HIV viral load is >250,000 copies/mL and CD4 lymphocyte count is 150 cells/mm³. After discussing the results and need for treatment, the patient agrees to start antiretroviral therapy. An additional medication to prevent opportunistic infections is also planned. This added treatment is most likely being used to prevent infection from which of the following pathogens?",
    "zh": "一名46岁的女性来到诊所，在她的一个之前的性伴侣发现HIV阳性后，她来做HIV检测。她感觉健康，没有任何症状。该患者从未患有性传播感染，也没有慢性病史。她一生中有过几个性伴侣，而且不规律地使用避孕套。体格检查未见异常。HIV抗原/抗体免疫测定和确证性HIV-1抗体检测呈阳性。进一步的研究显示血浆HIV病毒载量>250,000拷贝/mL，CD4淋巴细胞计数为150个细胞/mm³。在讨论了结果和治疗的必要性后，患者同意开始抗逆转录病毒治疗。还计划使用另一种药物来预防机会性感染。这种附加治疗最有可能用于预防以下哪种病原体的感染？"

    "en": "Patients with HIV have progressive impairment of the cell-mediated immune response that puts them at risk for OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS (OIs) with bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal pathogens. OIs are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and also worsen HIV progression and viremia. ANTIMICROBIAL PROPHYLAXIS can decrease the risk of developing certain OIs and is recommended in addition to antiretroviral therapy for all patients with HIV who have CD4 counts <200/mm³.\n\nAntimicrobial prophylaxis is guided by the patient's CD4 count, as follows:\n\nCD4 count <200/mm³ – Antimicrobial prophylaxis against PNEUMOCYSTIS JIROVECII pneumonia is indicated. TRIMETHOPRIM-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE is the first-line agent.\n\nCD4 count <100/mm³ – Patients require antimicrobial prophylaxis against TOXOPLASMA GONDII reactivation if they have serologic evidence of previous exposure (positive Toxoplasma IgG antibody). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is also used for prophylaxis against this condition (Choice F).\n\nCD4 count <50/mm³ – Patients require antimicrobial prophylaxis against MYCOBACTERIUM AVIUM-INTRACELLULARE (mycobacterium avium complex). Azithromycin is used most commonly (Choice D).\n\nOnce CD4 counts improve with antiretroviral therapy (>200/mm³ for >3 months), patients can often stop taking antimicrobial prophylaxis.\n\n(Choice A) Patients with advanced HIV who have low CD4 counts are at greater risk for mucocutaneous Candida infections (eg, thrush, esophagitis). However, routine prophylaxis against Candida infection is not recommended due to drug resistance and drug interactions.\n\n(Choice B) Patients with HIV who have CD4 counts <100/mm³ are at risk for cryptococcal meningitis. However, prophylaxis is not recommended against Cryptococcus due to drug interactions, adverse effects, risk of fungal resistance, and cost. This patient's CD4 count >100/mm³.\n\n(Choice C) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common OI in patients with HIV who have CD4 counts <50/mm³. Reactivation frequently leads to retinitis and gastrointestinal disease (eg, colitis). However, primary prophylaxis against CMV is not recommended due to cost, toxicity, and the high number needed to treat to reduce risk of disease.",
    "zh": "HIV患者的细胞介导免疫反应进行性受损，使他们面临细菌、病毒、真菌和原生动物病原体引起的机会性感染 (OIs) 的风险。OIs与显著的发病率和死亡率相关，并且会加重HIV进展和病毒血症。除了抗逆转录病毒治疗外，对于所有CD4计数<200/mm³的HIV患者，推荐使用抗菌药物预防，以降低发生某些OIs的风险。\n\n抗菌药物预防根据患者的CD4计数指导，如下所示：\n\nCD4计数<200/mm³ – 需进行肺孢子菌肺炎的抗菌药物预防。复方磺胺甲噁唑是一线药物。\n\nCD4计数<100/mm³ – 如果患者有既往暴露的血清学证据（弓形虫IgG抗体阳性），则需要进行弓形虫再激活的抗菌药物预防。复方磺胺甲噁唑也用于预防这种情况（选项F）。\n\nCD4计数<50/mm³ – 患者需要进行鸟分枝杆菌-细胞内复合体（鸟分枝杆菌复合体）的抗菌药物预防。阿奇霉素最常用（选项D）。\n\n一旦CD4计数通过抗逆转录病毒治疗得到改善（>200/mm³持续>3个月），患者通常可以停止抗菌药物预防。\n\n（选项A）晚期HIV患者，CD4计数较低者，发生粘膜皮肤念珠菌感染（如鹅口疮、食管炎）的风险更大。然而，由于耐药性和药物相互作用，不推荐对念珠菌感染进行常规预防。\n\n（选项B）CD4计数<100/mm³的HIV患者，有发生隐球菌性脑膜炎的风险。然而，由于药物相互作用、不良反应、真菌耐药风险和成本，不推荐预防隐球菌病。该患者的CD4计数>100/mm³。\n\n（选项C）巨细胞病毒（CMV）是CD4计数<50/mm³的HIV患者中常见的一种机会性感染。再激活常导致视网膜炎和胃肠道疾病（如结肠炎）。然而，由于成本、毒性和需要治疗以降低疾病风险的人数较多，不推荐对CMV进行一级预防。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of opportunistic infection prophylaxis in HIV patients based on CD4 count. Specifically, it focuses on the indications for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to remember the CD4 count thresholds for different opportunistic infections and their corresponding prophylactic medications. In this case, a CD4 count of 150 cells/mm³ indicates the need for PCP prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.",
