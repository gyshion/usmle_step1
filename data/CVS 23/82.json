  "explanation": {
    "en": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is most often precipitated by cardiac arrhythmia (eg, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation) that leads to markedly decreased cardiac output and impaired coronary artery perfusion. In older adults (eg, age ≥35), myocardial ischemia due to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (Choice A) is the most common cause of SCD. However, young adults who experience SCD usually have underlying structural heart disease; HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY (HCM) is one of the most common precipitating diseases. Most patients with HCM are asymptomatic, but some may experience exertional dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, or syncope.\n\nHCM is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutation of one of several genes coding for cardiac sarcomere proteins. It is characterized by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (predominantly affecting the septum) and myofiber disarray consisting of an irregular arrangement of abnormally shaped cardiomyocytes and interstitial fibrosis. This structural disarray leads to conduction abnormalities that predispose to ventricular arrhythmia and SCD.\n\n(Choice B) Dilated cardiac chambers and thin ventricular walls are consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a less common cause of SCD than HCM in young adults. A patient with DCM would likely have symptoms of heart failure (eg, lower extremity swelling, dyspnea, orthopnea) and would not be capable of participating in strenuous activities such as soccer.\n\n(Choice C) Extracellular deposits and stiff ventricular walls suggest restrictive cardiomyopathy due to amyloidosis or hemochromatosis. Although restrictive cardiomyopathy can cause SCD, there is usually a preceding course of progressive and symptomatic heart failure.\n\n(Choice E) Thrombus at the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery (ie, saddle pulmonary embolism) is a potential cause of SCD; however, a preceding history of exertion-related dyspnea and chest discomfort would not be expected. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "心脏性猝死 (SCD) 最常由心律失常（例如，室性心动过速/颤动）引起，这会导致心输出量显着降低和冠状动脉灌注受损。在老年人（例如，年龄 ≥35 岁）中，由于动脉粥样硬化性冠状动脉疾病（选项 A）引起的心肌缺血是 SCD 最常见的原因。然而，经历 SCD 的年轻人通常患有潜在的结构性心脏病；肥厚型心肌病 (HCM) 是最常见的诱发疾病之一。大多数 HCM 患者无症状，但有些人可能会出现劳力性呼吸困难、疲劳、胸痛或晕厥。\n\nHCM 是一种常染色体显性遗传病，由编码心脏肌节蛋白的几个基因之一的突变引起。其特征是心肌细胞肥大（主要影响间隔）和肌纤维排列紊乱，包括异常形状的心肌细胞和间质纤维化的不规则排列。这种结构紊乱会导致传导异常，从而易于发生室性心律失常和 SCD。\n\n（选项 B）扩大的心腔和薄的室壁与扩张型心肌病 (DCM) 一致，DCM 在年轻人中是比 HCM 较少见的 SCD 原因。DCM 患者可能出现心力衰竭的症状（例如，下肢肿胀、呼吸困难、端坐呼吸），并且无法参加足球等剧烈活动。\n\n（选项 C）细胞外沉积物和僵硬的室壁提示由于淀粉样变性或血色素沉着病引起的限制型心肌病。尽管限制型心肌病可引起 SCD，但通常会伴有进行性和有症状的心力衰竭。\n\n（选项 E）主肺动脉分叉处的血栓（即，马鞍形肺栓塞）是 SCD 的潜在原因；然而，不应预期有先前的劳力性呼吸困难和胸部不适病史。{{exhibit_1}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the causes of sudden cardiac death in young adults, specifically focusing on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and its characteristic pathological findings. It requires understanding the clinical presentation and underlying structural abnormalities associated with HCM.\n\nTo solve this question, consider the age of the patient and the absence of significant medical history. Recognize that HCM is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes and identify the pathological features associated with HCM, such as myocardial hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis.",
