    "en": "Thrush is an oropharyngeal *Candida albicans* infection that usually presents with creamy white, plaque-like lesions on the buccal mucosa, palate, tongue, or pharynx. The lesions can be easily scraped off with a tongue depressor, revealing underlying erythematous mucosa. The diagnosis is often made clinically, but microscopic examination {{exhibit_2}} will reveal budding yeasts with or without pseudohyphae.\n\n*Candida albicans* is a normal commensal of the human digestive tract that can cause mucocutaneous infections when local microbial flora is disrupted (eg, antibiotic use) or the cell-mediated immune response is impaired. Although *Candida albicans* infections of the skin (eg, diaper rash) and vulvovaginal region often occur in otherwise healthy individuals, oropharyngeal infection is rare in the absence of antibiotics, chemotherapy, or inhaled corticosteroids. Young, healthy individuals who develop thrush and have no clear inciting cause should be tested for HIV, particularly when HIV risk factors (eg, multiple sexual partners) or symptoms of the virus (eg, lymphadenopathy, weight loss) are present. A fourth-generation HIV antigen/antibody test is typically used for screening.\n\n(Choice B) Leukoplakia is a benign lesion of the tongue caused by hyperplasia of the squamous mucosa that can evolve into dysplasia → carcinoma in situ → invasive carcinoma. Leukoplakia appears as white patches or plaques on the oral mucosa. However, these lesions cannot be easily removed with scraping (unlike thrush).\n\n(Choice C) Coxsackievirus causes herpangina, which is usually seen in infants and children. It is characterized by high fever, sore throat, and yellowish or grey-white papulovesicular lesions on the throat (tongue lesions are rare). Coxsackievirus also causes hand, foot, and mouth disease, which is characterized by tongue macules, vesicles, and ulcers. However, it is also usually associated with a vesicular or macular skin rash.\n\n(Choice D) Microscopy of herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesions will reveal multinucleated giant cells. HSV usually causes multiple vesicular lesions on an erythematous base, not white mucosal plaques.\n\n(Choice E) Atrophic glossitis can be caused by vitamin B₁₂ or folate deficiency. It is characterized by atrophy of the filiform papillae leading to a smooth, glossy, erythematous tongue.\n\nEducational objective:\nOral thrush is caused by *Candida albicans* infection and usually presents as white, plaque-like oropharyngeal lesions that are easily scraped off with a tongue depressor. Affected patients typically have disruption to local microbial flora (eg, antibiotic use) or impairment in cell-mediated immunity (eg, corticosteroids, HIV). Young, otherwise healthy patients with thrush should be tested for HIV. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "鹅口疮是一种口咽部的白色念珠菌感染，通常表现为颊粘膜、腭、舌或咽部的奶油色白色、斑块样病变。这些病变可以用舌压板轻松刮除，露出下方的红斑粘膜。诊断通常在临床上做出，但显微镜检查 {{exhibit_2}} 将显示出芽酵母，伴有或不伴有假菌丝。\n\n白色念珠菌是人体消化道的正常共生菌，当局部微生物菌群被破坏（例如，使用抗生素）或细胞介导的免疫反应受损时，可引起皮肤粘膜感染。虽然白色念珠菌引起的皮肤感染（例如，尿布疹）和外阴阴道区域感染通常发生在其他健康的个体中，但在没有抗生素、化疗或吸入性皮质类固醇的情况下，口咽感染很少见。出现鹅口疮且没有明确诱因的年轻健康个体应进行 HIV 检测，尤其是在存在 HIV 危险因素（例如，多个性伴侣）或病毒症状（例如，淋巴结病、体重减轻）时。通常使用第四代 HIV 抗原/抗体检测进行筛查。\n\n（选项 B） 白斑是舌部的良性病变，由鳞状粘膜增生引起，可演变为发育不良 → 原位癌 → 浸润性癌。白斑表现为口腔粘膜上的白色斑块或斑点。然而，这些病变不能轻易用刮除方法去除（与鹅口疮不同）。\n\n（选项 C） 柯萨奇病毒引起疱疹性咽峡炎，通常见于婴儿和儿童。其特征是高烧、咽喉痛以及咽部（舌部病变很少见）的黄白色或灰白色丘疹水疱病变。柯萨奇病毒也引起手足口病，其特征是舌部出现斑点、水疱和溃疡。然而，它也通常与水疱性或斑疹性皮疹有关。\n\n（选项 D） 单纯疱疹病毒 (HSV) 病变的显微镜检查将显示多核巨细胞。HSV 通常在红斑基础上引起多个水疱性病变，而不是白色粘膜斑块。\n\n（选项 E） 萎缩性舌炎可由维生素 B₁₂ 或叶酸缺乏引起。其特征是丝状乳头萎缩，导致舌头光滑、有光泽、发红。\n\n教育目标：\n鹅口疮是由白色念珠菌感染引起的，通常表现为白色、斑块样的口咽部病变，可用舌压板轻松刮除。受影响的患者通常会破坏局部微生物菌群（例如，使用抗生素）或细胞介导的免疫力受损（例如，皮质类固醇、HIV）。患有鹅口疮的年轻、原本健康的患者应进行 HIV 检测。 {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of oral candidiasis (thrush) in the context of potential underlying immunodeficiency, specifically HIV infection. It requires recognizing the clinical presentation of thrush and understanding the risk factors that warrant HIV testing.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that thrush in a young, otherwise healthy individual without an obvious cause (like antibiotic use) should raise suspicion for HIV. The additional symptoms of fatigue and weight loss further support this suspicion, making HIV testing the most appropriate next step.",
    "zh": "此题考察在潜在免疫缺陷（特别是 HIV 感染）背景下对口腔念珠菌病（鹅口疮）的了解。它要求识别鹅口疮的临床表现，并了解需要进行 HIV 检测的危险因素。\n\n解决此题的关键是认识到，年轻、原本健康的个体，如果没有明显原因（如使用抗生素）出现鹅口疮，应怀疑 HIV 感染。疲劳和体重减轻的附加症状进一步支持了这种怀疑，使得 HIV 检测成为最合适的下一步。"
