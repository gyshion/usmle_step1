    "en": "A 21-year-old woman at 18 weeks gestation comes to the office for a routine prenatal visit. A quadruple screen reveals an elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein. Sonographic imaging of the fetus shows an anterior abdominal wall defect with herniation of bowel contents adjacent to the umbilicus. No covering membrane is identified. Color Doppler ultrasound imaging shows a normal 3-vessel cord inserting medial to this defect. The remainder of the anatomical survey is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these fetal findings?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This fetus has an anterior abdominal wall defect with herniation of bowel contents. These findings suggest one of 2 possible diagnoses that differ based on location and covering membrane:\n\n*   Omphaloceles occur due to abnormal gut rotation and failed physiologic return of bowel to the abdominal cavity during embryonic development. Omphaloceles have herniated bowel contents confined to the umbilical cord sac, which results in a midline defect with an associated peritoneal covering (Choice E).\n\n*   Gastroschisis is a congenital anomaly caused by disrupted or defective abdominal wall formation. Because the underlying etiology is a full-thickness abdominal wall defect, the fetal bowel eviscerates into the amniotic cavity without a covering membrane. The herniation is adjacent to the umbilicus (ie, paraumbilical), and the umbilical cord insertion site is usually normal and separate from the defect. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nBecause fetal bowel produces alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), fetuses with gastroschisis (no covering membrane) have direct AFP leakage into the amniotic fluid. The high concentration of amniotic fluid AFP is absorbed into the maternal circulation, resulting in abnormally elevated maternal serum AFP levels. Omphaloceles, by comparison, do not elevate amniotic fluid or maternal serum AFP levels as highly because the fetal bowel remains covered by peritoneum.\n\n(Choice A) In contrast to gastroschisis, congenital umbilical hernias (caused by failed closure of the umbilical fascial ring after birth) are midline defects covered by subcutaneous tissue and skin. They are typically benign and easily reducible. {{exhibit_2}}\n\n(Choice C) Hirschsprung disease occurs due to failure of neural crest cell migration. Patients have an aganglionic sigmoid colon/rectum that cannot relax (eg, bowel obstruction, megacolon). It does not present with eviscerated bowel in utero. {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(Choice D) Meckel diverticulum results from failure of obliteration of the vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct; the diverticulum can contain ectopic, acid-secreting gastric mucosa that ulcerates adjacent small bowel. Therefore, the most common presentation is painless lower gastrointestinal bleeding in early childhood. There is no associated herniation of bowel contents. {{exhibit_4}}\n\nEducational objective:\nGastroschisis is a congenital abdominal wall defect characterized by herniation of uncovered bowel (ie, no covering membrane) located adjacent to the umbilicus. It can be diagnosed on fetal ultrasound, and the condition is associated with abnormally elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels. {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该胎儿患有前腹壁缺损，伴有肠内容物突出。这些发现提示两种可能的诊断，这两种诊断基于位置和覆盖膜而有所不同：\n\n*   脐膨出是由于胚胎发育过程中肠道异常旋转以及肠道无法生理性地回转至腹腔所致。脐膨出的特点是突出肠内容物局限于脐带囊中，这会导致中线缺损，并伴有相关的腹膜覆盖（选项E）。\n\n*   腹裂是一种先天性异常，由腹壁形成中断或缺陷引起。由于其根本病因是全层腹壁缺损，胎儿肠道会脱出到羊膜腔中，没有覆盖膜。突出部位邻近脐部（即，脐旁），脐带插入部位通常正常且与缺损分离。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n由于胎儿肠道产生甲胎蛋白(AFP)，患有腹裂（无覆盖膜）的胎儿会出现AFP直接漏入羊水的情况。羊水中高浓度的AFP被母体循环吸收，导致母亲血清AFP水平异常升高。相比之下，脐膨出不会像腹裂那样高度升高羊水或母亲血清AFP水平，因为胎儿肠道仍被腹膜覆盖。\n\n（选项A）与腹裂相比，先天性脐疝（由出生后脐筋膜环闭合失败引起）是中线缺损，被皮下组织和皮肤覆盖。它们通常是良性的，并且易于复位。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n（选项C）先天性巨结肠是由于神经嵴细胞迁移失败所致。患者有无神经节细胞的乙状结肠/直肠，无法松弛（例如，肠梗阻、巨结肠）。它不会出现宫内肠道脱出。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n（选项D）Meckel憩室是由于卵黄（卵黄系膜）管闭塞失败所致；憩室可包含异位、分泌酸的胃黏膜，导致邻近小肠溃疡。因此，最常见的表现是儿童早期无痛性下消化道出血。没有相关的肠内容物突出。{{exhibit_4}}\n\n教育目标：\n腹裂是一种先天性腹壁缺损，其特征是无覆盖肠道（即，无覆盖膜）突出，位于脐部附近。它可以通过胎儿超声诊断，并且该病症与母亲血清甲胎蛋白水平异常升高有关。{{exhibit_5}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of fetal abdominal wall defects, specifically gastroschisis and omphalocele, and their distinguishing features on prenatal ultrasound and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels. It also tests the ability to differentiate these conditions from other causes of abdominal wall defects or gastrointestinal issues.\n\nTo solve this question, focus on the key findings: anterior abdominal wall defect, herniation of bowel contents adjacent to the umbilicus, absence of a covering membrane, and elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein. These findings are most consistent with gastroschisis.",
