    "en": "A 56-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to several days of progressive dyspnea, productive cough, and fever. Today, her son found her very short of breath and obtunded. The patient has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and long-standing rheumatoid arthritis. Examination reveals bilateral pneumonia and severe respiratory distress. The patient is lethargic without focal neurologic deficits. Urgent endotracheal intubation is performed for mechanical ventilation, and the patient is started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Repeat examination 2 hours later shows that she has developed areflexic, flaccid paralysis of all extremities.",

    "en": "This patient with rheumatoid arthritis underwent urgent endotracheal intubation due to severe pneumonia and subsequently developed sudden-onset quadriparesis. Long-standing rheumatoid arthritis frequently involves the cervical spine and causes joint destruction with vertebral malalignment (subluxation). The atlantoaxial joint is most often involved as the atlas (C1) has a high degree of mobility relative to the axis (C2 odontoid and body).\n\nChronic symptoms of cervical subluxation include neck pain, stiffness, and neurologic findings (eg, sensory loss, muscle weakness). Endotracheal intubation can acutely worsen the subluxation and cause compression of the spinal cord and/or vertebral arteries. Acute spinal cord injury results in flaccid paralysis with decreased or absent reflexes below the level of the compression due to spinal shock; the paralysis eventually becomes spastic as spinal shock resolves over the ensuing days to weeks.\n\n(Choice A) Cerebral septic emboli are usually due to infective endocarditis of the left-sided heart valves. Patients can develop acute neurologic findings including unilateral paralysis; quadriparesis would be less likely. This patient also has no cardiac murmur or other stigmata (eg, petechiae, splinter hemorrhages) to suggest endocarditis.\n\n(Choice B) Diabetic neuropathy presents with a slowly progressive decrease in vibratory sensation, proprioception, and temperature sensation. Early neuropathy can cause decreased ankle reflexes, whereas later disease can cause widespread loss of reflexes with motor weakness.\n\n(Choice C) Guillain-Barré syndrome presents with progressively worsening, symmetrical, flaccid muscle weakness with absent or decreased reflexes. The abnormalities typically start in the lower extremities and ascend upward over the course of days to weeks.\n\n(Choice D) Malignant hyperthermia is usually due to anesthesia exposure (eg, halothane, succinylcholine), causing increased and sustained muscle contraction with myocyte breakdown. Patients typically develop diffuse muscle rigidity followed by hyperthermia and possible myoglobinuria.\n\nEducational objective:\nLong-standing rheumatoid arthritis can affect the cervical spine, causing vertebral malalignment (subluxation) that can affect the atlantoaxial joint. Extension of the neck during endotracheal intubation can worsen the subluxation, leading to acute compression of the spinal cord and/or vertebral arteries.",
    "zh": "该类风湿性关节炎患者因严重肺炎接受紧急气管插管，随后出现突发的四肢瘫。长期类风湿性关节炎常累及颈椎，引起关节破坏伴椎体错位（半脱位）。寰枢关节最常受累，因为寰椎（C1）相对于枢椎（C2齿突和椎体）具有高度的活动性。\n\n颈椎半脱位的慢性症状包括颈部疼痛、僵硬和神经系统体征（如感觉丧失、肌肉无力）。气管插管可急剧加重半脱位并导致脊髓和/或椎动脉受压。急性脊髓损伤导致压缩平面以下弛缓性麻痹伴反射减弱或消失，这是由于脊髓休克；随着脊髓休克在随后的几天到几周内消退，麻痹最终会变得痉挛。\n\n（选项A）脑脓毒性栓塞通常是由于左侧心脏瓣膜的感染性心内膜炎所致。患者可出现急性神经系统体征，包括单侧瘫痪；四肢瘫痪不太可能。该患者也没有心脏杂音或其他特征（如瘀点、刺状出血）提示心内膜炎。\n\n（选项B）糖尿病性神经病变表现为振动觉、本体感觉和温度觉缓慢进行性下降。早期神经病变可引起踝反射减弱，而晚期疾病可引起广泛的反射消失伴肌无力。\n\n（选项C）格林-巴利综合征表现为进行性加重的对称性弛缓性肌无力，伴反射消失或减弱。异常通常从下肢开始，并在几天到几周内向上发展。\n\n（选项D）恶性高热通常是由于麻醉暴露（如氟烷、琥珀酰胆碱）所致，导致肌肉收缩增加并持续，伴肌细胞分解。患者通常会出现弥漫性肌强直，随后出现高热和可能的肌红蛋白尿。\n\n教学目标：\n长期类风湿性关节炎可影响颈椎，引起椎体错位（半脱位），从而影响寰枢关节。气管插管期间颈部伸展可加重半脱位，导致脊髓和/或椎动脉急性受压。"

    "en": "This question tests the knowledge of complications of rheumatoid arthritis, specifically cervical subluxation, and how it can be exacerbated by endotracheal intubation. It also tests the ability to differentiate this condition from other causes of acute paralysis.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and the temporal relationship between endotracheal intubation and the onset of neurologic deficits. Consider the potential for cervical spine involvement in patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis.",
