Cardiopulmonary examination reveals mild tachycardia. The abdomen is soft without organomegaly. Skin examination shows pallor and scattered bruises in various stages of healing throughout the trunk. Complete blood count results are as follows:\n\nHemoglobin\t7.2 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume\t90 µm³\nPlatelets\t10,000/mm³\nLeukocytes\t1.050/mm³\nNeutrophils\t5%\nLymphocytes\t95%",

    "en": "This patient has gastrointestinal bleeding and ecchymosis secondary to thrombocytopenia; although anemia (eg, pallor) would be expected with significant bleeding, her low leukocyte count indicates PANCYTOPENIA, which is generally caused by one of the following:\n\n*   Bone marrow aplasia: Hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow are unable to proliferate and differentiate into mature blood cells due to aplastic anemia, nutritional impairment, infection (eg, parvovirus, HIV), or cytotoxic medications.\n*   Bone marrow infiltration: Cancer, fibrosis, or infection (eg, tuberculosis) fills the bone marrow and crowds out hematologic cells, thereby preventing blood cell replication and maturation.\n*   Mature blood cell destruction: Circulating mature blood cells may be destroyed due to disseminated intravascular coagulation or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; extravascular mature blood cells may be destroyed or sequestered in the spleen due to hypersplenism.\n\nBased on this patient's laboratory and physical examination results, several answer choices can be eliminated. The presence of a normal MCV makes vitamin B12 or folate deficiency unlikely because these are associated with macrocytic (not normocytic) anemia (Choice E). Hypersplenism is also unlikely because abdominal examination would show significant splenomegaly (Choice C). Chronic myelogenous leukemia, an infiltrative cancer associated with constitutively active tyrosine kinase, is also unlikely because this condition is usually associated with dramatic leukocytosis (not leukopenia) (Choice B).\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of this patient's pancytopenia is APLASTIC ANEMIA (AA). Although AA is linked to certain medications, infections, toxins, or radiation, most cases are idiopathic and thought to be caused by AUTOIMMUNE-INDUCED LOSS of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells. In idiopathic AA, an underlying insult (eg, mutation, virus) causes alteration of surface antigens on multipotent stem cells, making them appear foreign and triggering a CYTOTOXIC T-CELL RESPONSE. Cytokines released by T-helper cells (type 1 cytokines) also contribute to the pathogenesis, most notably INTERFERON-GAMMA, which triggers APOPTOTIC CELL DEATH due to the stimulation of a destructive cytokine cascade and the increased expression of the Fas receptor on the hematopoietic stem cell surface.\n\n(Choice D) Autoantibodies against glycoprotein IIb/IIIa cause immune thrombocytopenia, which is marked by thrombocytopenia and no change in the other cell lines.\n\nEducational objective:\nAplastic anemia is a form of bone marrow failure in which patients have decreased production of all cell lines (platelets, erythrocytes, and leukocytes). It is primarily caused by the autoimmune destruction of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells due to an alteration in their surface antigens, leading to a cytotoxic T-cell response and release of interferon-gamma from T-helper cells (triggers apoptotic cell death).",
    "zh": "该患者因血小板减少症继发消化道出血和瘀斑；虽然在大量出血时会发生贫血（如苍白），但她的白细胞计数低表明全血细胞减少症，这通常由以下原因之一引起：\n\n*   骨髓发育不全：骨髓中的造血干细胞由于再生障碍性贫血、营养不良、感染（如细小病毒、HIV）或细胞毒性药物而无法增殖和分化为成熟血细胞。\n*   骨髓浸润：癌症、纤维化或感染（如结核病）填充骨髓并挤出血液细胞，从而阻止血细胞的复制和成熟。\n*   成熟血细胞破坏：循环中的成熟血细胞可能因弥漫性血管内凝血或血栓性血小板减少性紫癜而受到破坏；血管外成熟血细胞可能因脾功能亢进而受到破坏或隔离在脾脏中。\n\n根据该患者的实验室和体格检查结果，可以排除几个选项。正常MCV的存在使得维生素B12或叶酸缺乏的可能性很小，因为这些与大细胞性（而非正细胞性）贫血相关（选项E）。脾功能亢进的可能性也很小，因为腹部检查会显示明显的脾肿大（选项C）。慢性髓细胞性白血病（一种与组成型活化酪氨酸激酶相关的浸润性癌症）的可能性也很小，因为这种情况通常与明显的白细胞增多症（而非白细胞减少症）相关（选项B）。\n\n因此，该患者全血细胞减少症最可能的原因是再生障碍性贫血 (AA)。尽管AA与某些药物、感染、毒素或辐射有关，但大多数病例是特发性的，被认为是由于自身免疫诱导的多能造血干细胞的丢失。在特发性AA中，潜在的损伤（例如，突变、病毒）会导致多能干细胞的表面抗原发生改变，使其看起来像异物，并触发细胞毒性T细胞反应。T辅助细胞（1型细胞因子）释放的细胞因子也有助于发病机制，最著名的是干扰素-γ，它由于刺激破坏性细胞因子级联反应和造血干细胞表面Fas受体的表达增加而触发细胞凋亡。\n\n（选项D）针对糖蛋白IIb/IIIa的自身抗体会引起免疫性血小板减少症，其特征是血小板减少症，而其他细胞系没有变化。\n\n教育目标：\n再生障碍性贫血是一种骨髓衰竭，患者所有细胞系（血小板、红细胞和白细胞）的产生减少。它主要由多能造血干细胞的自身免疫破坏引起，这是由于其表面抗原的改变，导致细胞毒性T细胞反应和T辅助细胞释放干扰素-γ（触发细胞凋亡）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pancytopenia and its common causes, specifically focusing on aplastic anemia and its underlying pathophysiology. It requires the ability to interpret complete blood count results and correlate them with clinical findings to narrow down the differential diagnosis. \n\nThe best approach is to first recognize the pancytopenia based on the lab values. Then, consider the common causes of pancytopenia and use the clinical and laboratory findings to rule out other possibilities, such as micronutrient deficiencies, hypersplenism, and bone marrow infiltration, before arriving at the most likely diagnosis of aplastic anemia.",
