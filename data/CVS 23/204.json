    "en": "A 4-month-old boy is brought to the cardiology clinic by his parents for follow-up of tetralogy of Fallot. The diagnosis was made during routine antenatal sonography, and the pregnancy and delivery were otherwise uncomplicated. The patient has been seen frequently in the clinic and has had no cyanosis, respiratory distress, or difficulty feeding. The parents become concerned when their son's surgical plan is discussed because he does not have the clinical signs demonstrated by other children with tetralogy of Fallot. Which of the following is the greatest determinant of symptom severity in this condition?",

    "en": "Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is a congenital heart defect characterized by right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, a ventricular septal defect (VSD), an overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Because the VSD is invariably large and unrestricted, right and left ventricular pressures are generally equal, and the magnitude and direction of shunting through the VSD are determined by the relative resistances of the ventricular outflow tracts (Choice E). Therefore, the greatest determinant of symptom severity is the degree of RVOT obstruction:\n\n*   Severe RVOT obstruction: Insufficient pulmonary arterial flow with obligatory right-to-left ventricular shunting leads to hypoxemia and profound cyanosis requiring medical/surgical intervention in the immediate neonatal period.\n*   Moderate RVOT obstruction: Moderate obstruction typically permits adequate pulmonary arterial flow and oxygenation. These patients are acyanotic at baseline due to left-to-right or neutral shunting through the VSD. However, some degree of the RVOT obstruction is dynamic, and transient increases in RVOT obstruction (eg, infundibular muscle spasm while feeding or crying) may force the reversal of flow (ie, right-to-left) and cause episodic cyanosis.\n*   Mild RVOT obstruction: Patients with mild RVOT, which is likely the case in this boy, may have no cyanotic episodes and develop heart failure later in childhood due to pulmonary overcirculation from the high volume of left-to-right shunting via the large VSD.\n\n(Choices A and C) Although the pulmonic valve may be stenotic in patients with ToF (contributing to RVOT obstruction), the aortic and tricuspid valves are typically normal and have no stenosis or insufficiency.\n\n(Choice D) The majority of patients with ToF do not have pulmonary parenchymal or other extracardiac malformations.\n\nEducational objective:\nTetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect characterized by right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, a large ventricular septal defect (VSD), an overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The degree of RVOT obstruction is the greatest determinant of symptom severity because it regulates pulmonary arterial blood flow and the magnitude and direction of shunting through the VSD. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "法洛四联症 (ToF) 是一种先天性心脏缺陷，其特征是右心室流出道 (RVOT) 梗阻、室间隔缺损 (VSD)、主动脉骑跨和右心室肥大。由于 VSD 总是很大且不受限制，右心室和左心室压力通常相等，通过 VSD 分流的大小和方向取决于心室流出道的相对阻力（选项 E）。因此，症状严重程度的最大决定因素是 RVOT 梗阻的程度：\n\n*   重度 RVOT 梗阻：肺动脉血流不足，伴有强制性右向左心室分流，导致低氧血症和严重发绀，需要在新生儿期立即进行内科/外科干预。\n*   中度 RVOT 梗阻：中度梗阻通常允许足够的肺动脉血流和氧合。由于通过 VSD 的左向右或中性分流，这些患者在基线时无发绀。然而，RVOT 梗阻的某些程度是动态的，RVOT 梗阻的短暂增加（例如，喂养或哭泣时漏斗部肌肉痉挛）可能会迫使血流逆转（即，右向左），并引起阵发性发绀。\n*   轻度 RVOT 梗阻：在这个男孩可能出现轻度 RVOT 的情况下，可能没有发绀发作，并且由于通过大型 VSD 的大量左向右分流导致肺过度循环，因此在儿童晚期发生心力衰竭。\n\n（选项 A 和 C）尽管肺动脉瓣在 ToF 患者中可能狭窄（导致 RVOT 梗阻），但主动脉瓣和三尖瓣通常是正常的，没有狭窄或关闭不全。\n\n（选项 D）大多数 ToF 患者没有肺实质或其他心外畸形。\n\n教育目标：\n法洛四联症是一种先天性心脏缺陷，其特征是右心室流出道 (RVOT) 梗阻、大型室间隔缺损 (VSD)、主动脉骑跨和右心室肥大。RVOT 梗阻的程度是症状严重程度的最大决定因素，因为它调节肺动脉血流以及通过 VSD 的分流大小和方向。{{exhibit_1}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and the factors determining the severity of symptoms, specifically the degree of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOT). It assesses understanding of the pathophysiology of TOF and how the degree of RVOT obstruction affects pulmonary blood flow and shunting through the ventricular septal defect.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the degree of RVOT obstruction is the primary determinant of symptom severity in TOF. Understanding the relationship between RVOT obstruction, pulmonary blood flow, and shunting through the VSD is crucial for selecting the correct answer. Consider the impact of varying degrees of RVOT obstruction on cyanosis and other clinical manifestations.",
