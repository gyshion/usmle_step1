    "en": "This patient's low urinary riboflavin excretion suggests a significant deficiency in riboflavin intake. Symptomatic RIBOFLAVIN DEFICIENCY is rare in the United States but can be seen with chronic alcohol use and in severely malnourished patients. Clinical manifestations include angular stomatitis, cheilitis, glossitis, seborrheic dermatitis, eye changes (eg, keratitis, corneal neovascularization), and anemia.\n\nThe riboflavin (vitamin B₂) -containing coenzymes are key constituents of the ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN. Typically, riboflavin is first phosphorylated to become flavin mononucleotide (FMN), which can then be integrated into a coenzyme-flavin complex or further phosphorylated to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). FMN and FAD participate as coenzymes in numerous reduction-oxidation reactions and are converted into reduced, energy-carrying states (FMNH₂ and FADH₂) through the acceptance of electrons.\n\nFMN serves as a component of complex I, whereas FAD functions as a component of SUCCINATE DEHYDROGENASE (complex II). Complex II participates in both the electron transport chain and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. During the TCA cycle, succinate dehydrogenase converts succinate to fumarate and transfers electrons to coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) via FAD. Complex II also accepts electrons from other sources of FADH₂, such as fatty acid oxidation.\n\n(Choices A, D, E, and G) Isocitrate dehydrogenase, succinate thiokinase, malate dehydrogenase, and fumarase are enzymes that participate in the TCA cycle but do not use FAD or FMN as cofactors.\n\n(Choice B) Reduced glutathione is an antioxidant that minimizes oxidative damage in many cells. Glutathione reductase regenerates reduced glutathione using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as an electron donor and FAD as a cofactor. Although glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway and supplies the necessary NADPH, it does not use FAD as a cofactor.\n\n(Choice C) HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. FMN and FAD are not used as cofactors.",
    "zh": "该患者的尿核黄素排泄量低表明核黄素摄入严重不足。在美国，有症状的核黄素缺乏症很少见，但在长期饮酒和严重营养不良的患者中可见。临床表现包括口角炎、唇炎、舌炎、脂溢性皮炎、眼部改变（例如，角膜炎、角膜新生血管形成）和贫血。\n\n含有核黄素（维生素B₂）的辅酶是电子传递链的关键组成部分。通常，核黄素首先被磷酸化，成为黄素单核苷酸（FMN），然后可以整合到辅酶-黄素复合物中，或进一步磷酸化为黄素腺嘌呤二核苷酸（FAD）。FMN和FAD作为辅酶参与许多还原-氧化反应，并通过接受电子转化为还原的、携带能量的状态（FMNH₂和FADH₂）。\n\nFMN作为复合物I的组成部分，而FAD作为琥珀酸脱氢酶（复合物II）的组成部分。复合物II参与电子传递链和三羧酸（TCA）循环。在TCA循环中，琥珀酸脱氢酶将琥珀酸转化为延胡索酸，并通过FAD将电子转移到辅酶Q（泛醌）。复合物II还接受来自其他FADH₂来源的电子，例如脂肪酸氧化。\n\n（选项A、D、E和G）异柠檬酸脱氢酶、琥珀酸硫激酶、苹果酸脱氢酶和延胡索酸酶是参与TCA循环的酶，但它们不使用FAD或FMN作为辅因子。\n\n（选项B）还原型谷胱甘肽是一种抗氧化剂，可最大限度地减少许多细胞的氧化损伤。谷胱甘肽还原酶使用烟酰胺腺嘌呤二核苷酸磷酸（NADPH）作为电子供体和FAD作为辅因子，从而再生还原型谷胱甘肽。尽管葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶（G6PD）是磷酸戊糖途径中的限速酶，并提供必要的NADPH，但它不使用FAD作为辅因子。\n\n（选项C）HMG-CoA还原酶是胆固醇合成途径中的限速酶。FMN和FAD不被用作辅因子。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of vitamin deficiencies, specifically riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiency, and its impact on enzyme function, particularly succinate dehydrogenase in the electron transport chain and TCA cycle. The question requires recognizing the clinical signs of riboflavin deficiency and linking it to the biochemical role of riboflavin as a precursor to FMN and FAD coenzymes.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the clinical signs of riboflavin deficiency (angular stomatitis, glossitis, cheilitis) and the patient's risk factors (alcoholism, malnutrition). Then, recall the enzymes that require riboflavin-derived cofactors (FMN and FAD) and select the enzyme most directly affected by riboflavin deficiency.",
