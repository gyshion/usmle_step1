    "en": "A 29-year-old man comes to the urgent care clinic for evaluation of a sore throat and nasal congestion. After waiting for 2 hours, he is taken to an examination room.

I'm missing work to be here.\" In addition to thanking the patient for waiting, which of the following initial responses by the physician is most appropriate?",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Patient-centered communication involves being responsive to the patient's perspective. Initial interactions are particularly important because they set the foundation for the physician-patient relationship. Acknowledging the patient's perspective and being respectful, nondefensive, and nonjudgmental are important for developing rapport and fostering the physician-patient relationship.\n\nIn this scenario, the patient is upset because he waited 2 hours and missed work, which is compounded by his perception that the wait was avoidable. The best approach is to offer a straightforward apology for the delay, instead of attempting to justify it, and then focus on the reason for the visit. This response keeps the focus on the patient's needs and perspective.\n\n(Choice B) This response attempts to justify why the waiting room is empty rather than acknowledging the impact of the delay on the patient. It is likely to be perceived as defensive and does not foster the physician-patient relationship.\n\n(Choices C and D) These responses assume that the patient's condition is not serious or urgent. They may also convey that the patient's concerns are being given lower priority and insinuate that the patient made a mistake in coming to an urgent care clinic. A patient who is already frustrated is likely to experience these comments as dismissive and judgmental.\n\n(Choice E) Although this statement acknowledges the patient's perspective, it does not attempt to defuse and could possibly increase the patient's anger. Focusing on the reason for the patient's visit is likely to be more productive.\n\nEducational objective:\nPatient-centered communication involves acknowledging the patient's perspective, showing respect, and being nondefensive and nonjudgmental. Long delays are best handled with a straightforward apology and a focus on the patient's concerns.",
    "zh": "以患者为中心的沟通涉及对患者观点的回应。 最初的互动尤为重要，因为它们奠定了医患关系的基础。 承认患者的观点，尊重、不辩解且不带有评判性，对于建立融洽关系和促进医患关系至关重要。\n\n在这种情况下，患者感到沮丧，因为他等了2个小时并且耽误了工作，而他认为等待是可以避免的，这加剧了他的沮丧。 最佳方法是直接为延误道歉，而不是试图为之辩解，然后关注就诊原因。 这种回应将重点放在患者的需求和观点上。\n\n（选项B） 这种回应试图解释候诊室为何空无一人，而不是承认延误对患者的影响。 它很可能被认为是辩护性的，并且无助于建立医患关系。\n\n（选项 C 和 D） 这些回应假设患者的病情不严重或不紧急。 它们也可能表明患者的担忧没有得到优先考虑，并暗示患者来急诊诊所是错误的。 一个已经很沮丧的患者很可能会认为这些评论是轻视和带有评判性的。\n\n（选项 E） 尽管此声明承认了患者的观点，但它并没有试图化解矛盾，反而可能会增加患者的愤怒。 关注患者就诊的原因可能更有效。\n\n教育目标：\n以患者为中心的沟通涉及承认患者的观点，表示尊重，并且不辩解且不带有评判性。 最好通过直接道歉并关注患者的担忧来处理长时间的延误。"
