    "en": "A 28-year-old woman comes to the office for a regularly scheduled prenatal appointment. Her pregnancy has been going well and the patient says that she is thrilled to be having a baby after trying to become pregnant for several years. She and her husband experienced considerable strain in their marriage as they went through multiple unsuccessful fertility treatments. During the visit, the physician orders some blood work and performs a 1-hour glucose challenge test. The patient becomes apprehensive when this is mentioned and begins to ask questions about the purpose of the testing. When asked about her concern, she confides that the fetus is not her husband's child. Her husband is also the physician's patient, and she asks the physician not to tell him about this because \"it will ruin everything.\"",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Physicians are ethically obligated to respect patient autonomy and protect patient confidentiality, keeping all personal health information private unless the patient gives specific consent to release the information.\n\nMaintaining patient confidentiality is essential to developing a trusting physician-patient relationship as patients would otherwise be less likely to share sensitive information, which could negatively impact their care. This is particularly critical for issues that might be stigmatizing, such as reproductive, sexual, substance use, and mental health concerns. Confidentiality assures that private information not be disclosed to family or employers without the patient's explicit consent. This patient's request not to inform her husband should be respected.\n\nExceptions to confidentiality include the following:\n\n*   Suspected child, disabled person, or elder abuse (reporting laws for spousal abuse vary by state)\n*   Knife or gunshot wounds\n*   Diagnosis of a reportable communicable disease\n*   Threats to harm self or others and reasonable ability to carry out the threat in the near future\n\n(Choice A) The physician's primary duty is to protect the patient's confidentiality regardless of whether her husband is a patient or not. Imposing one's personal belief that it would be in the husband's best interest to know is inappropriate.\n\n(Choices B and D) These statements could be considered directive and/or judgmental by the patient. The physician should be neutral with regard to the patient's decision and not force her into actions or a conversation with which she may be uncomfortable. It would be appropriate to inquire about the patient's concerns, specifically if there are any safety concerns.\n\n(Choice C) The physician has no legal or ethical obligation to inform the biological father. Under current law, a father has no legal right to know that a child is his unless he is ordered to make child support payments.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nPatient confidentiality is strongly protected because patients must feel free to disclose details of all aspects of their lives so that physicians can provide optimal care. Exceptions to patient confidentiality include suspected child, disabled person, or elder abuse; knife or gunshot wounds; diagnosis of a reportable communicable disease; and patients at risk of physically harming themselves or others.",
    "zh": "医生在伦理上有义务尊重患者的自主权并保护患者的隐私，将所有个人健康信息保密，除非患者明确同意披露该信息。\n\n维护患者的隐私对于建立信任的医患关系至关重要，否则患者不太可能分享敏感信息，这可能会对其治疗产生负面影响。这对于可能带有污名化的事件尤其重要，例如生殖、性、物质使用和心理健康问题。隐私保护确保未经患者明确同意，不得将私人信息泄露给家人或雇主。应尊重患者不告知其丈夫的要求。\n\n隐私保护的例外情况包括以下几点：\n\n*   疑似虐待儿童、残疾人或老人（配偶虐待的报告法律因州而异）\n*   刀伤或枪伤\n*   可报告的传染病诊断\n*   威胁伤害自己或他人，且近期内有合理能力实施该威胁\n\n（选项A） 医生的首要职责是保护患者的隐私，无论其丈夫是否也是病人。强加认为告知丈夫对其有好处的个人信念是不合适的。\n\n（选项B和D） 这些陈述可能被患者视为具有指导性和/或评判性。医生在患者的决定上应保持中立，并且不强迫她采取行动或进行她可能感到不舒服的对话。询问患者的担忧是合适的，特别是如果存在任何安全问题。\n\n（选项C） 医生没有法律或伦理义务告知孩子的生父。根据现行法律，除非被命令支付子女抚养费，否则父亲无权知道孩子是他的。\n\n教育目标：\n\n由于患者必须自由地披露其生活的各个方面的细节，以便医生可以提供最佳的护理，因此患者隐私受到严格保护。患者隐私的例外情况包括疑似虐待儿童、残疾人或老人；刀伤或枪伤；可报告的传染病诊断；以及有身体伤害自己或他人风险的患者。"

It also assesses the exceptions to confidentiality and the physician's role in respecting patient autonomy. \n\nThe key to solving this question is to recognize the strong ethical obligation to maintain patient confidentiality unless specific exceptions apply.
