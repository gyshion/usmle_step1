    "en": "A 52-year-old woman comes to the office due to 2 weeks of constant back pain. She has also had several months of nonproductive cough, anorexia, and unintentional weight loss. The patient has a 40-pack-year smoking history. Physical examination shows diffuse muscle wasting, left lung crackles, and vertebral tenderness. Imaging reveals a left lung mass and lytic lesions in the vertebrae. Further evaluation confirms metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Treatment with a cisplatin-based chemotherapy is begun, and the patient is also started on a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist. The latter medication is most likely to improve which of the following in this patient?",

    "en": "Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a common side effect of cancer treatment. It is caused by both peripheral and central mechanisms, as follows:\n\n*   Acute-phase CINV (<24 hours after chemotherapy) is mediated primarily by the release of serotonin from intestinal enterochromaffin cells that have been damaged by chemotherapy. Serotonin stimulates vagal afferent fibers (5-HT3 receptors) in the bowel wall, which project to the brainstem and stimulate the vomiting reflex. Therefore, serotonin receptor antagonists (eg, ondansetron) can be used for treatment.\n*   Delayed-phase CINV (1-5 days after chemotherapy) is mediated primarily by increased levels of substance P in the brainstem due to chemotherapy-activated emetic stimuli in the cerebrospinal fluid and bloodstream. Substance P binds to and activates the neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor in areas of the brainstem that mediate vomiting (eg, nucleus tractus solitarius, area postrema). Therefore, NK1 receptor antagonists (eg, aprepitant, fosaprepitant) are often used for treatment.\n\nMost patients who undergo chemotherapy associated with a high risk of vomiting (eg, cisplatin) receive a combination of serotonin receptor antagonists and NK1 receptor antagonists (often with other antiemetics) to prevent both types of CINV.\n\n(Choice B) Malignancy-related anorexia is the loss of muscle and fat caused by elevated levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines. Progesterone analogs (eg, megestrol acetate) are the first-line treatment; corticosteroids and cannabinoids are also frequently used.\n\n(Choice C) Malignancy-related hypercalcemia is typically treated with bisphosphonates (eg, zoledronic acid), which reduce osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.\n\n(Choice D) Opioid-induced constipation occurs due to opioid-mediated effects on the bowel wall, which reduce peristalsis. Methylnaltrexone, an opioid antagonist that has limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (it does not trigger withdrawal), can be used as treatment.\n\n(Choice E) Patients who have highly aggressive lymphomas and leukemias are at risk for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) with chemotherapy. Its primary manifestation is renal damage from elevated uric acid levels (catabolism of nucleic acids released from tumor cells increases uric acid). Rasburicase, a drug that breaks down uric acid, is used to prevent TLS in high-risk patients.\n\nEducational objective:\nChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is mediated by peripheral and central mechanisms. It can be treated with serotonin receptor antagonists (eg, ondansetron) to prevent serotonin stimulation of afferent vagal fibers in the bowel wall (peripheral cause) and neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists (eg, aprepitant) to prevent the effects of substance P in the brainstem (central cause).",
    "zh": "化疗引起的恶心和呕吐(CINV)是癌症治疗的常见副作用。它由周围和中枢机制引起，如下所示：\n\n*   急性期CINV（化疗后<24小时）主要由化疗损伤的肠嗜铬细胞释放血清素介导。血清素刺激肠壁中的迷走神经传入纤维（5-HT3受体），这些纤维投射到脑干并刺激呕吐反射。因此，可以使用血清素受体拮抗剂（例如，昂丹司琼）进行治疗。\n*   延迟期CINV（化疗后1-5天）主要由脑干中P物质水平升高介导，这是由于脑脊液和血流中化疗激活的催吐刺激。P物质与脑干中介导呕吐的区域（例如，孤束核，后区）的神经激肽-1（NK1）受体结合并激活它们。因此，NK1受体拮抗剂（例如，阿瑞匹坦，磷酸阿瑞匹坦）经常用于治疗。\n\n大多数接受与高呕吐风险相关的化疗的患者（例如，顺铂）接受血清素受体拮抗剂和NK1受体拮抗剂的组合（通常与其他止吐药一起），以预防两种类型的CINV。\n\n（选项B）恶性肿瘤相关的厌食症是由于循环炎症细胞因子水平升高引起的肌肉和脂肪流失。孕激素类似物（例如，甲地孕酮）是一线治疗；皮质类固醇和类大麻素也经常使用。\n\n（选项C）恶性肿瘤相关的血钙过多症通常使用双膦酸盐（例如，唑来膦酸）治疗，以减少破骨细胞介导的骨吸收。\n\n（选项D）阿片类药物引起的便秘是由于阿片类药物对肠壁的影响，从而减少蠕动。甲基纳曲酮，一种有限穿过血脑屏障（它不会引起戒断）的阿片类药物拮抗剂，可用作治疗方法。\n\n（选项E）患有高度侵袭性淋巴瘤和白血病的患者有发生化疗相关的肿瘤溶解综合征（TLS）的风险。其主要表现是由于尿酸水平升高引起的肾脏损伤（肿瘤细胞释放的核酸分解代谢增加了尿酸）。拉布立酶，一种分解尿酸的药物，用于预防高危患者的TLS。\n\n教学目标：\n化疗引起的恶心和呕吐由周围和中枢机制介导。可以使用血清素受体拮抗剂（例如，昂丹司琼）治疗以防止血清素刺激肠壁中的传入迷走神经纤维（周围原因），以及神经激肽-1受体拮抗剂（例如，阿瑞匹坦）以防止P物质在脑干中的作用（中枢原因）。"
