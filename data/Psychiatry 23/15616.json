    "en": "A 19-year-old college student comes to the office with new-onset fatigue. The patient has had difficulty getting up in the morning for the past week and states he would sleep 10-12 hours if his schedule allowed. He also reports vivid dreams.

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's new-onset fatigue, hypersomnia, and vivid dreams following abrupt cessation of prolonged stimulant (eg, dextroamphetamine) use is most likely due to STIMULANT WITHDRAWAL. Decreased appetite and insomnia are the most common adverse effects of stimulant medications used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and abrupt stimulant withdrawal is associated with the opposite symptoms of fatigue, HYPERSOMNIA, and HYPERPHAGIA. Dysphoric mood may also occur.\n\nUse of\"supratherapeutic doses of prescribed stimulants or use that deviates from prescription instructions (eg, insufflation to attain a \"euphoric effect\") increases the risk for withdrawal and adverse effects. Depending on the half-life of the agent used, symptoms of stimulant withdrawal typically present within hours to days of cessation or reduction of heavy or prolonged use and resolve without treatment. In contrast to withdrawal from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opiates, physical symptoms in stimulant withdrawal are minor.\n\n(Choices A and C) Dilated pupils and rhinorrhea are classic symptoms of OPIOID WITHDRAWAL. Pupillary dilation may be seen during acute intoxication with stimulants but not during withdrawal.\n\n(Choices D, E, and F) Seizures, tachycardia, and tremors are features of ALCOHOL and BENZODIAZEPINE withdrawal syndromes. These features may be seen in stimulant overdose but not in stimulant withdrawal.\n\nEducational objective:\nStimulant withdrawal is characterized by dysphoric mood, fatigue, hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and vivid dreams. In contrast to many other withdrawal syndromes, stimulant withdrawal is associated with significant findings on physical examination.",
    "zh": "该患者突然停用长期兴奋剂（如右旋苯丙胺）后出现的新发疲劳、嗜睡和生动的梦境，最可能是由于兴奋剂戒断所致。食欲下降和失眠是用于治疗注意力缺陷多动障碍的兴奋剂药物最常见的副作用，而突然的兴奋剂戒断与疲劳、嗜睡和暴食等相反的症状有关。也可能出现心境恶劣。\n\n使用\"超治疗剂量的处方兴奋剂或偏离处方说明的使用（例如，吸入以达到“欣快感”）会增加戒断和不良反应的风险。根据所用药物的半衰期，兴奋剂戒断的症状通常在停止或减少大量或长期使用后的数小时至数天内出现，并在没有治疗的情况下消失。与酒精、苯二氮卓类药物和阿片类药物的戒断相比，兴奋剂戒断的身体症状较轻。\n\n（选项 A 和 C）瞳孔扩大和鼻漏是阿片类药物戒断的典型症状。在兴奋剂的急性中毒期间可能会看到瞳孔扩大，但在戒断期间则不会。\n\n（选项 D、E 和 F）癫痫发作、心动过速和震颤是酒精和苯二氮卓类药物戒断综合征的特征。这些特征可能在兴奋剂过量时出现，但不会在兴奋剂戒断时出现。\n\n教育目标：\n兴奋剂戒断的特征是心境恶劣、疲劳、嗜睡、暴食和生动的梦境。与其他许多戒断综合征相比，兴奋剂戒断与体格检查中重要的发现相关。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of stimulant withdrawal syndrome, its characteristic symptoms, and differentiation from other substance withdrawal syndromes. It requires recognizing that abrupt cessation of stimulants, especially after dose escalation, can lead to a withdrawal state with symptoms opposite to the drug's effects.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the substance used (dextroamphetamine), the pattern of use (prolonged, recent dose escalation, and abrupt cessation), and then recalling or deducing the typical withdrawal symptoms associated with stimulants. Comparing these symptoms to the options provided and considering the differential diagnoses of other withdrawal syndromes is crucial.",
    "zh": "此题考察对兴奋剂戒断综合征的理解、其特征性症状以及与其他物质戒断综合征的区别。它需要认识到突然停止使用兴奋剂，特别是剂量增加后，会导致出现与药物作用相反的症状的戒断状态。\n\n解决此题的方法包括确定使用的物质（右旋苯丙胺）、使用模式（长期、最近剂量增加和突然停止），然后回忆或推断与兴奋剂相关的典型戒断症状。将这些症状与提供的选项进行比较，并考虑其他戒断综合征的鉴别诊断至关重要。"
