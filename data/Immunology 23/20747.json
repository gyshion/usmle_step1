    "en": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the office due to sudden onset of facial swelling 2 hours ago. He has had no itching or pain other than a sore throat over the last 2 days, for which he has taken acetaminophen. The patient has had similar episodes of facial swelling that resolved spontaneously after a few days. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 100/78 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 24/min. Examination shows nonpitting edema of the cheeks, lips, and tongue; there is no tenderness or erythema. {{exhibit_1}} Which of the following studies is most likely to be abnormal?",

    "en": "Hereditary angioedema is caused by deficiency or dysfunction of C1 inhibitor (previously referred to as C1 esterase inhibitor). Poor C1 inhibitor function leads to elevated bradykinin, a peptide that causes vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, resulting in edema. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nPresentation is typically in childhood or adolescence with episodes of swelling affecting the skin (eg, face, extremities) and mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract and/or larynx. Attacks are often precipitated by minor trauma (eg, dental procedure) or emotional stress and are not associated with itching or urticaria.\n\nInitial evaluation of hereditary angioedema is with complement testing. Low C4 is characteristic because, in the absence of C1 inhibitor, unregulated activation of C1 leads to excess activated C1 and, in turn, unchecked cleavage of C4. Diagnosis is confirmed by a decrease in functional C1 inhibitor level.\n\n(Choices A and E) Elevated eosinophils and IgE are associated with allergic conditions. In contrast to bradykinin-mediated hereditary angioedema, allergic angioedema (eg, anaphylaxis) is due to histamine release from activated mast cells and presents with pruritis and urticaria in addition to swelling.\n\n(Choice C) C8 is involved in the formation of the membrane attack complex, which, when deficient, results in increased susceptibility to Neisseria infections. Deficiency of terminal complement components (C5, C6, C7, C8, C9) does not occur with hereditary angioedema because the upstream complement fragments (C2b, C4b) are rapidly inactivated in the plasma.\n\n(Choice D) Selective IgA deficiency increases risk for anaphylaxis, which can cause angioedema. However, this risk is only with transfusion of blood products and would present with other organ system involvement (eg, bronchospasm, hypotension, urticaria). IgA deficiency is also associated with certain autoimmune conditions (eg, celiac disease, systemic lupus erythematosus), but none of these would present with isolated facial swelling.\n\nEducational objective:\nHereditary angioedema is characterized by recurrent episodes of cutaneous and/or mucosal swelling due to C1 inhibitor deficiency. C4 levels are low due to uninhibited cleavage of C4 by excess activated C1. {{exhibit_3}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hereditary angioedema, specifically the pathophysiology related to C1 inhibitor deficiency and its impact on the complement cascade, leading to low C4 levels. It also tests the ability to differentiate hereditary angioedema from other causes of angioedema, such as allergic reactions.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of hereditary angioedema: recurrent episodes of swelling without urticaria or pruritus. Understand that C1 inhibitor deficiency leads to unchecked activation of C1 and subsequent cleavage of C4, resulting in low C4 levels. Rule out other causes of angioedema based on the absence of allergic symptoms and the specific complement pathway involvement.",
