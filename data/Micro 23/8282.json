    "en": "A 37-year-old man is brought to the emergency department following a motor vehicle accident in which he was the unrestrained driver. Paramedics report that his breath smelled of alcohol at the scene. En route to the hospital, the patient receives 2 L intravenous normal saline. In the emergency department, his blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 44/min. He is admitted directly to the intensive care unit, where he is intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. A decision is made to insert a central venous catheter. In addition to sterile draping during the procedure, which of the following actions would be most likely to prevent intravascular catheter-related infections?",

    "en": "Central venous catheters (CVCs) are commonly used for hemodynamic monitoring and administration of fluids and medications in critically ill patients. Infection originating from the patient's skin flora or bacteria on the hands of health care workers is one of the major complications of CVCs. Gram-positive cocci, primarily coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus, account for the majority of these infections.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the following steps to reduce CVC infections:\n\n*   Hand hygiene with an alcohol sanitizer or soap and water prior to donning sterile gloves\n*   Maximal barrier precautions during insertion (surgical mask, sterile gloves, long-sleeved surgical gown, and a large sterile sheet drape)\n*   Preparation of the insertion site with chlorhexidine antiseptic\n*   Use of subclavian or internal jugular insertion sites (femoral vein has a higher risk of infection) (Choice C)\n*   Prompt removal of the catheter when it is no longer needed\n\n(Choice B) Topical antimicrobial ointments do not reduce the rate of CVC-related infections and are associated with increased risk of antimicrobial resistance and Candida colonization.\n\n(Choice D) Oral or parenteral antibiotics have not been found to reduce the incidence of CVC-related infections. In addition, the prophylactic use of vancomycin has been found to increase the risk of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.\n\n(Choice E) Catheter replacement at scheduled intervals does not reduce infection rates. Routine replacement of CVCs is not necessary for functional catheters with no evidence of infection.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe most important steps for prevention of central venous catheter infections are as follows:\n\n*   Proper hand hygiene\n*   Full barrier precautions during insertion\n*   Chlorhexidine skin disinfection\n*   Avoidance of the femoral insertion site\n*   Removal of the catheter when it is no longer needed",
    "zh": "中心静脉导管 (CVCs) 常用于危重病人的血流动力学监测以及液体和药物的输注。源自患者皮肤菌群或医护人员手上的细菌的感染是 CVC 的主要并发症之一。革兰阳性球菌，主要是凝固酶阴性葡萄球菌和金黄色葡萄球菌，是这些感染的主要原因。\n\n疾病控制与预防中心建议采取以下步骤来减少 CVC 感染：\n\n*   在戴上无菌手套之前，用含酒精洗手液或肥皂和水进行手部卫生\n*   插入期间的最大限度屏障防护（外科口罩、无菌手套、长袖手术服和大型无菌铺单）\n*   用氯己定消毒剂准备插入部位\n*   使用锁骨下静脉或颈内静脉插入部位（股静脉的感染风险较高）（选项 C）\n*   当不再需要导管时及时移除\n\n（选项 B）局部抗菌软膏不能降低 CVC 相关感染的发生率，并且与抗菌素耐药性和念珠菌定植的风险增加有关。\n\n（选项 D）尚未发现口服或肠外抗生素能降低 CVC 相关感染的发生率。此外，已发现预防性使用万古霉素会增加万古霉素耐药性肠球菌的风险。\n\n（选项 E）按计划更换导管并不能降低感染率。对于功能正常且无感染证据的导管，无需进行常规更换。\n\n教学目标：\n预防中心静脉导管感染的最重要步骤如下：\n\n*   正确的手部卫生\n*   插入期间的全面屏障防护\n*   氯己定皮肤消毒\n*   避免股静脉插入部位\n*   当不再需要导管时移除"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of best practices for preventing central venous catheter (CVC) infections, including hand hygiene, barrier precautions, site preparation, and catheter placement.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the CDC guidelines for CVC insertion and maintenance, focusing on evidence-based strategies to minimize infection risk.
