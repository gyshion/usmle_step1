    "en": "A 68-year-old man comes to the office due to several weeks of progressive exertional dyspnea and lower extremity edema. Medical history is significant for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is in remission after chemotherapy 8 years ago. Blood pressure is 126/76 mm Hg and pulse is 88/min. Physical examination reveals bibasilar lung crackles and 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema. Echocardiography shows biventricular dilation and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%. Stress myocardial perfusion scan is negative for inducible ischemia. After initial stabilization, long-term use of which of the following medications will most likely improve survival in this patient?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (left ventricular [LV] systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction <40%). Given the absence of evidence of ischemia, this patient's presentation is most likely due to dilated cardiomyopathy as an adverse effect of chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nBeta blockers (eg, carvedilol, metoprolol) have been shown to improve long-term survival in patients with HFrEF. Much of the benefit of beta blockers in the treatment of HFrEF likely owes to neurohormonal blockade of sympathetic drive. This results in reduced heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand as well as decreased levels of circulating vasoconstrictors (eg, epinephrine, renin, endothelin), leading to reduced peripheral resistance (afterload) and myocardial work. These effects are cardioprotective, helping to reduce cardiomyocyte death and prevent deleterious cardiac remodeling.\n\nBeta blockers should not be initiated in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ie, heart failure requiring hospitalization), as they can further impair cardiac output; they should be introduced slowly after the patient has been stabilized. Other drugs that improve long-term survival in patients with HFrEF include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (eg, sacubitril-valsartan), and aldosterone antagonists (eg, spironolactone, eplerenone).\n\n(Choice A) Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent used for the management of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, but it is not used for heart failure.\n\n(Choices B and E) Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine) do not improve survival in patients with HFrEF. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem, verapamil) are specifically contraindicated in HFrEF due to the potential for reduced contractility and further worsening of LV systolic dysfunction.\n\n(Choice D) Digoxin is sometimes used as an adjunctive therapy in patients with HFrEF. It improves symptoms and reduces hospitalizations, but it has not been shown to improve survival.\n\n(Choice F) Flecainide is a class IC antiarrhythmic drug that is occasionally used for management of atrial fibrillation in patients with a structurally normal heart. It has no role in the management of heart failure.\n\n(Choice G) Loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) are first-line agents for volume control in patients with heart failure. They improve symptoms and reduce hospitalizations, but they have not been shown to improve long-term survival.\n\nEducational objective:\nDrugs that have been shown to improve long-term survival in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction include beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, and aldosterone antagonists.",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现与失代偿性射血分数降低的心力衰竭（HFrEF）（左心室[LV]收缩功能障碍，射血分数<40%）相符。考虑到没有缺血的证据，该患者的症状很可能是由于非霍奇金淋巴瘤化疗的不良反应引起的扩张型心肌病。\n\nβ受体阻滞剂（如卡维地洛、美托洛尔）已被证明可改善HFrEF患者的长期生存率。β受体阻滞剂在HFrEF治疗中的大部分益处可能归功于交感神经驱动的神经激素阻滞。这导致心率和心肌耗氧量降低，以及循环血管收缩剂（如肾上腺素、肾素、内皮素）水平降低，从而降低外周阻力（后负荷）和心肌做功。这些作用具有心脏保护作用，有助于减少心肌细胞死亡并防止有害的心脏重塑。\n\nβ受体阻滞剂不应在急性失代偿性心力衰竭患者（即需要住院治疗的心力衰竭）中使用，因为它们会进一步损害心输出量；应在患者病情稳定后缓慢引入。其他可改善HFrEF患者长期生存率的药物包括ACE抑制剂、血管紧张素II受体阻滞剂、血管紧张素受体-脑啡肽酶抑制剂（如沙库巴曲-缬沙坦）和醛固酮拮抗剂（如螺内酯、依普利酮）。\n\n（选项A）胺碘酮是一种III类抗心律失常药物，用于治疗房颤和室性心动过速，但它不用于治疗心力衰竭。\n\n（选项B和E）二氢吡啶类钙通道阻滞剂（如氨氯地平）不能改善HFrEF患者的生存率。非二氢吡啶类钙通道阻滞剂（如地尔硫卓、维拉帕米）在HFrEF中明确禁用，因为它们可能降低收缩力并进一步恶化左室收缩功能障碍。\n\n（选项D）地高辛有时被用作HFrEF患者的辅助治疗。它可以改善症状并减少住院次数，但尚未被证明可以改善生存率。\n\n（选项F）氟卡尼是一种IC类抗心律失常药物，偶尔用于治疗结构正常心脏的房颤。它在心力衰竭的治疗中没有作用。\n\n（选项G）袢利尿剂（如呋塞米）是心力衰竭患者容量控制的一线药物。它们可以改善症状并减少住院次数，但尚未被证明可以改善长期生存率。\n\n教育目标：\n已被证明可改善射血分数降低的心力衰竭患者长期生存率的药物包括β受体阻滞剂、ACE抑制剂、血管紧张素II受体阻滞剂、血管紧张素受体-脑啡肽酶抑制剂和醛固酮拮抗剂。"
