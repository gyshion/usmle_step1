    "en": "A 40-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her roommate due to significant left leg weakness. The symptom began 3 days ago after her father had a heart attack. There is no personal or family history of neurological disease; surgical history includes liposuction of the thighs and varicose vein removal. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 123/81 mm Hg, pulse is 62/min, and respirations are 14/min. Physical examination reveals symmetric 2+ deep tendon reflexes as well as normal muscle bulk and tone bilaterally in the upper and lower extremities. Laboratory testing and neurologic imaging reveal no abnormalities.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's acute onset of muscular weakness following a stressful incident, normal neurological examination, and negative workup are suggestive of CONVERSION DISORDER (functional neurologic symptom disorder). Conversion disorder is characterized by symptoms or DEFICITS OF VOLUNTARY MOTOR and/or SENSORY FUNCTION that are INCOMPATIBLE with any recognized neurological condition and cannot be explained by another medical or mental disorder. Common symptoms of conversion disorder may include weakness, paralysis, gait disturbance, blindness, diplopia, aphonia, anesthesia, or nonepileptic seizures (also called psychogenic seizures).\n\nThe phenomenon of la belle indifference (ie, incongruous lack of concern about symptoms) has been associated with conversion disorder but is not pathognomonic, occurs at equal frequency in true neurological disorders, and should not be used to make the diagnosis. In fact, patients with conversion disorder may be very distressed by their symptoms.\n\n(Choice A) Body dysmorphic disorder involves an excessive preoccupation with perceived defects in physical appearance (eg, nose shape) as opposed to a neurologic deficit (eg, leg weakness).\n\n(Choice C) In factitious disorder, patients deliberately falsify symptoms due to their desire to assume the sick role. There is no evidence that this patient is intentionally falsifying her symptoms; and given her recent stress (eg, her father's heart attack), conversion disorder is more likely.\n\n(Choice D) Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive fears of having a serious physical disease. The fear is usually due to misinterpretation of bodily symptoms or normal functions (eg, a man with gas pain becoming preoccupied with having colon cancer).\n\n(Choice E) Malingering is the purposeful falsification of symptoms for obvious external benefit (eg, a patient feigning hemiparesis to receive disability benefits).\n\n(Choice F) Somatic symptom disorder is characterized by excessive and persistent health anxiety and preoccupation with multiple somatic symptoms; it does not present with a clearly incompatible neurological examination. This patient does not express any concern about her impairment and seeks care only when brought in by her roommate, effectively ruling out somatic symptom disorder.\n\nEducational objective:\nConversion disorder is characterized by neurologic symptoms and examination findings that are incompatible with a known neurological disease. Patients do not consciously produce the symptoms like in factitious disorder or malingering, and the condition may cause significant distress/impairment.",
    "zh": "该患者在应激事件后突然出现肌肉无力、神经系统检查正常以及检查结果阴性，提示转换障碍（功能性神经症状障碍）。转换障碍的特征是自愿运动和/或感觉功能的症状或缺陷，与任何已知的神经系统疾病不相符，并且不能用其他医学或精神疾病解释。转换障碍的常见症状可能包括无力、麻痹、步态障碍、失明、复视、失语、感觉缺失或非癫痫发作（也称为心因性发作）。\n\nla belle indifference（即对症状缺乏不一致的担忧）现象与转换障碍相关，但并非病理性的，在真正的神经系统疾病中也以相同的频率出现，不应用于做出诊断。事实上，患有转换障碍的患者可能会因其症状而感到非常痛苦。\n\n（选项A）躯体变形障碍涉及过度关注对身体外观的感知缺陷（例如，鼻子的形状），而不是神经功能缺陷（例如，腿部无力）。\n\n（选项C）在人为障碍中，患者故意伪造症状，因为他们希望扮演病人的角色。没有证据表明该患者故意伪造她的症状；并且鉴于她最近的压力（例如，她父亲的心脏病发作），转换障碍的可能性更大。\n\n（选项D）疾病焦虑障碍的特征是过度担心患有严重的身体疾病。这种恐惧通常是由于对身体症状或正常功能的误解（例如，一个患有腹痛的男人变得专注于患有结肠癌）。\n\n（选项E）诈病是有意伪造症状以获得明显的外部利益（例如，患者假装偏瘫以获得残疾福利）。\n\n（选项F）躯体症状障碍的特征是过度和持续的健康焦虑以及对多种躯体症状的关注；它没有表现出明显不相容的神经系统检查结果。该患者没有表达对她损伤的任何担忧，并且只有在被她的室友带入时才寻求治疗，有效地排除了躯体症状障碍。\n\n教育目标：\n转换障碍的特征是神经系统症状和检查结果与已知的神经系统疾病不相符。患者不像人为障碍或诈病那样有意识地产生症状，并且这种疾病可能导致严重的痛苦/损害。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the diagnostic criteria for conversion disorder and its differentiation from other somatic symptom and related disorders. It requires the clinician to recognize the incompatibility of the patient's neurological symptoms with objective findings and to consider psychological stressors as a precipitating factor.\n\nTo solve this question, one must carefully evaluate the patient's presentation, including the nature of the symptoms, the temporal relationship to stressors, the physical examination findings, and the results of diagnostic investigations. Differentiating between conversion disorder, somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, factitious disorder, and malingering is crucial, focusing on the underlying mechanism (involuntary vs. voluntary symptom production) and the motivation (psychological vs. external gain).",
