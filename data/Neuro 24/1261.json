    "en": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the office due to headaches that have worsened progressively over the past month and are most severe when lying down. He also has had nonbloody, nonbillious emesis for 2 weeks that typically occurs early in the morning. The child has intermittent blurry vision, particularly when looking up at the mirror while brushing his teeth. Physical examination shows bilateral papilledema, inability to gaze upwards, and bilateral eyelid retraction. Laboratory testing of sodium, growth hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is normal. Given the early morning emesis and papilledema, a brain mass is suspected and a brain MRI is ordered. {{exhibit_1}}",
    "zh": "一名4岁男孩因头痛就诊，头痛在过去一个月里逐渐加重，且在躺下时最为严重。他还出现了非血性、非胆汁性呕吐，持续2周，通常在清晨发生。患儿有间歇性视力模糊，尤其是在刷牙时看向镜子上方时。体格检查显示双侧视乳头水肿、无法向上凝视以及双侧眼睑回缩。钠、生长激素、黄体生成素 (LH) 和促卵泡激素 (FSH) 的实验室检查结果均正常。考虑到清晨呕吐和视乳头水肿，怀疑有脑部肿块，并已安排脑部 MRI 检查。{{exhibit_1}}"

    "en": "This patient has a pineal gland mass. Classic manifestations of a pineal mass include obstructive hydrocephalus from aqueductal stenosis (papilledema, headache, and vomiting) and dorsal midbrain (Parinaud) syndrome due to direct compression of the pretectal region of the midbrain. Parinaud syndrome is characterized by limitation of upward gaze with a downward gaze preference, bilateral eyelid retraction (eg, Collier sign, sclera visible above the superior corneal limbus), and light-near dissociation (eg, pupils that react to accommodation but not to light). Diagnosis of pineal gland mass is made by brain MRI.\n\nThe most common pineal mass is a germinoma, a midline malignant tumor thought to arise from embryonic germ cells. A germinoma can also arise in the gonads or mediastinum and is more common in young boys. The most common locations for intracranial germinomas are the pineal gland and the suprasellar region (less common site).\n\n(Choice A) Due to their proximity to the pituitary gland and hypothalamus, suprasellar germinomas do not lead to Parinaud syndrome, but they are more likely to present with endocrinopathies (eg, central precocious puberty, diabetes insipidus).\n\n(Choice B) Primary thalamic tumors are rare. Damage to the thalamus from a mass or more commonly infarction/hemorrhage presents with contralateral hemisensory loss, behavioral changes, and language deficits.\n\n(Choice D) Pontine hemorrhage or tumor may cause \"locked-in\" syndrome, which is characterized by spastic quadriplegia and paralysis of most cranial nerves (CNs) with preserved consciousness and eye movements.\n\n(Choice E) The most common cerebellar tumor in children is medulloblastoma, which typically presents with gait and limb ataxia, intention tremor, and nystagmus.\n\n(Choice F) Lesions of the medulla can cause lateral and medial medullary syndromes. Lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome leads to contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensations along with ipsilateral paralysis of CNs V, IX, and X, and XI. Medial medullary syndrome causes contralateral spastic paralysis, contralateral sensory loss of vibration and proprioception, and ipsilateral flaccid paralysis of the tongue (CN XII). {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有松果体肿块。松果体肿块的典型表现包括由于导水管狭窄引起的梗阻性脑积水（视乳头水肿、头痛和呕吐）和由于直接压迫中脑的视前区而引起的背侧中脑（帕里诺）综合征。帕里诺综合征的特征是向上凝视受限，向下凝视偏好，双侧眼睑回缩（例如，科利尔征，角膜缘上方的巩膜可见），以及光近分离（例如，对调节反应但对光无反应的瞳孔）。通过脑 MRI 诊断松果体肿块。\n\n最常见的松果体肿块是生殖细胞瘤，一种被认为起源于胚胎生殖细胞的恶性肿瘤。生殖细胞瘤也可发生在性腺或纵隔，在年轻男孩中更为常见。颅内生殖细胞瘤最常见的部位是松果体和鞍上区（较不常见部位）。\n\n(选项 A) 由于靠近脑下垂体和下丘脑，鞍上生殖细胞瘤不会导致帕里诺综合征，但更可能表现为内分泌病变（例如，中枢性性早熟、尿崩症）。\n\n(选项 B) 原发性丘脑肿瘤很少见。由于肿块或更常见的是梗死/出血导致的丘脑损伤表现为对侧半身感觉丧失、行为改变和语言障碍。\n\n(选项 D) 脑桥出血或肿瘤可导致“闭锁综合征”，其特征是痉挛性四肢瘫痪和大多数脑神经 (CN) 瘫痪，但意识和眼球运动得以保留。\n\n(选项 E) 儿童最常见的脑肿瘤是髓母细胞瘤，通常表现为步态和肢体共济失调、意向性震颤和眼球震颤。\n\n(选项 F) 延髓病变可引起侧性和内侧延髓综合征。侧延髓（瓦伦伯格）综合征导致对侧痛觉和温度觉丧失，以及同侧 CN V、IX、X 和 XI 瘫痪。内侧延髓综合征导致对侧痉挛性瘫痪、对侧振动觉和本体感觉丧失，以及同侧舌头 (CN XII) 弛缓性麻痹。{{exhibit_2}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation and neuroimaging localization of a pineal gland mass, specifically a germinoma, in a pediatric patient. It assesses the ability to correlate symptoms such as headaches, vomiting, papilledema, and visual disturbances with specific anatomical structures in the brain.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the constellation of symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure and dorsal midbrain involvement. Then, by interpreting the provided MRI image, the location of the lesion can be identified and correlated with the differential diagnosis of brain tumors in children, particularly those arising in the pineal region.",
