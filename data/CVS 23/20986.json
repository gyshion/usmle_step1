  "explanation": {
    "en": "The cardiovascular system undergoes an array of age-related physiologic changes. Over time, cardiomyocytes are lost to both apoptosis and necrosis (ie, cardiomyocyte dropout), resulting in an overall reduced cardiomyocyte number. The loss of ventricular cardiomyocytes (Choice E) weakens contractile strength. In addition, the aorta and other large arteries stiffen with age, resulting in reduced arterial compliance (ie, reduced arterial reserve capacity) (Choice B) and increased left ventricular (LV) afterload. To compensate for the cardiomyocyte loss and increased afterload, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (ie, mild concentric LV hypertrophy) occurs, allowing for maintenance of LV contractility and ejection fraction.\n\nCardiomyocyte dropout also affects cardiac conduction cells, contributing to decreased maximal heart rate and slightly decreased resting afterload. Decreased responsiveness to adrenergic stimuli with age also contributes to reduced maximal heart rate.\n\n(Choices C and D) The mild concentric LV hypertrophy that occurs with age results in reductions in LV compliance and LV end-diastolic volume. However, because these changes are relatively slight, stroke volume and cardiac output are mostly preserved.\n\nEducational objective:\nCardiomyocyte hypertrophy (ie, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy) occurs with age to allow for maintenance of left ventricular contractility and ejection fraction despite cardiomyocyte dropout and increased left ventricular afterload (due to reduced aortic compliance).",
    "zh": "心血管系统会经历一系列与年龄相关的生理变化。 随着时间的推移，心肌细胞会因凋亡和坏死而丢失（即，心肌细胞脱落），导致心肌细胞总数减少。 心室心肌细胞的丢失（选项 E）会削弱收缩力。 此外，主动脉和其他大动脉会随着年龄的增长而硬化，导致动脉顺应性降低（即，动脉储备能力降低）（选项 B）和左心室 (LV) 后负荷增加。 为了代偿心肌细胞的丢失和后负荷的增加，会发生心肌细胞肥大（即，轻度向心性左心室肥大），从而维持左心室收缩力和射血分数。\n\n心肌细胞脱落也会影响心脏传导细胞，导致最大心率降低和静息后负荷略有下降。 随着年龄的增长，对肾上腺素能刺激的反应降低也有助于降低最大心率。\n\n（选项 C 和 D）随着年龄的增长，发生的轻度向心性左心室肥大会导致左心室顺应性和左心室舒张末期容积降低。 然而，由于这些变化相对较小，每搏输出量和心输出量基本保持不变。\n\n教育目标：\n心肌细胞肥大（即，向心性左心室肥大）会随着年龄的增长而发生，以维持左心室收缩力和射血分数，尽管存在心肌细胞脱落和左心室后负荷增加（由于主动脉顺应性降低）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of age-related physiological changes in the cardiovascular system, specifically focusing on the compensatory mechanisms that maintain left ventricular ejection fraction despite cardiomyocyte dropout and increased afterload. The key concept is cardiomyocyte hypertrophy as a response to these age-related changes.\n\nTo solve this question, understand the impact of aging on the heart and vessels. Recognize that cardiomyocyte dropout and increased afterload are common age-related changes, and that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac function.",
