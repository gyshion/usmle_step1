    "en": "A 65-year-old man with a long history of smoking comes to the office due to a nonproductive cough over the last several months. He recently developed left shoulder pain, persistent hiccups, and dyspnea. His temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg, and pulse is 76/min. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the left side. Chest x-ray shows a large left lung mass. Compression of a nerve arising from which of the following locations is most likely causing this patient's recent symptoms?",

    "en": "Lung cancers are prone to early local and distant spread. Intrathoracic expansion of a tumor can cause a number of distinctive syndromes, including PHRENIC NERVE irritation and palsy. The phrenic nerve arises from the C3-C5 cervical segments and descends through the neck and thorax to innervate the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm. Phrenic nerve irritation can cause DYSPNEA, HICCUPS (diaphragmatic irritation), and REFERRED PAIN to the shoulder (area innervated by supraclavicular nerve originating from C3 and C4). Phrenic nerve palsy is associated with respiratory distress and diminished breath sounds on the affected side, with elevation of the affected hemidiaphragm on chest x-ray. Upward movement of the affected hemidiaphragm with inspiration is seen on fluoroscopy.\n\nOther syndromes that may occur due to local spread of a lung tumor include:\n\n* HORNER SYNDROME (ipsilateral miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis) occurs in association with tumors of the lung apex (PANCOAST TUMOR) that disrupt the oculosympathetic nerve pathway. Lung cancer in this location can also invade the rami of the BRACHIAL PLEXUS (C5-T1) and cause shoulder pain (Choices D and E).\n* A centrally located tumor or mediastinal spread of a more distant tumor can cause SUPERIOR VENA CAVA (SVC) SYNDROME, which is commonly associated with small cell lung carcinoma. SVC syndrome causes headache, facial and upper-extremity edema, and dilated veins of the upper torso.\n* Involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve may cause hoarseness.\n* Dysphagia may result if the tumor compresses the esophagus.\n\n(Choice A) The BRAINSTEM, which is the site of origin of most cranial nerves, contains the respiratory center (in the medulla oblongata) and is traversed by spinal tracts. Brainstem strokes typically present with vertigo and, in extreme cases, can lead to locked-in syndrome (spastic quadriplegia and paralysis of most cranial nerves with preserved consciousness).\n\n(Choice B) C1 is unique among the spinal nerves in that it carries only motor fibers. C1-C3 lesions could affect neck musculature but would not explain this patient's hiccups or dyspnea.\n\nEducational objective: The phrenic nerve arises from the C3-C5 segments of the spinal cord and innervates the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm. Intrathoracic spread of lung cancer may affect the phrenic nerve, causing hiccups and diaphragmatic paralysis with dyspnea. Brachial plexus involvement can cause pain in the distribution of the C8, T1, and T2 nerve roots. Involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve may cause hoarseness.",
    "zh": "肺癌易于早期局部和远处扩散。肿瘤的胸内扩张可引起多种独特的综合征，包括膈神经刺激和麻痹。膈神经起源于C3-C5颈段，向下穿过颈部和胸部，支配同侧半膈肌。膈神经刺激可引起呼吸困难、呃逆（膈肌刺激）和肩部牵涉痛（由C3和C4发出的锁骨上神经支配的区域）。膈神经麻痹与呼吸窘迫和患侧呼吸音减弱有关，胸部X光片显示患侧半膈肌升高。在荧光透视下可见吸气时患侧半膈肌向上运动。\n\n由于肺部肿瘤的局部扩散，可能发生的其他综合征包括：\n\n* 霍纳综合征（同侧瞳孔缩小、眼睑下垂和无汗症）与肺尖肿瘤（Pancoast肿瘤）相关，后者会破坏眼交感神经通路。该位置的肺癌也可能侵犯臂丛神经（C5-T1），引起肩部疼痛（选项D和E）。\n* 位于中央的肿瘤或远处肿瘤的纵隔转移可引起上腔静脉（SVC）综合征，这通常与小细胞肺癌相关。SVC综合征引起头痛、面部和上肢水肿以及上躯干静脉扩张。\n* 喉返神经受累可能引起声音嘶哑。\n* 如果肿瘤压迫食管，可能会导致吞咽困难。\n\n（选项A）脑干是大多数颅神经的起源部位，包含呼吸中枢（在延髓中），并有脊髓束穿过。脑干卒中通常表现为眩晕，在极端情况下，可导致闭锁综合征（痉挛性四肢瘫痪和大多数颅神经麻痹，但意识保留）。\n\n（选项B）C1在脊神经中是独一无二的，因为它只携带运动纤维。C1-C3病变可能会影响颈部肌肉，但不能解释该患者的呃逆或呼吸困难。\n\n教育目标：膈神经起源于脊髓的C3-C5节段，支配同侧半膈肌。肺癌的胸内扩散可能会影响膈神经，引起呃逆和膈肌麻痹，并伴有呼吸困难。臂丛神经受累可引起C8、T1和T2神经根分布区域的疼痛。喉返神经受累可能引起声音嘶哑。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of referred pain and neurological symptoms associated with lung cancer, specifically focusing on the anatomical origins of nerves affected by intrathoracic tumors.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the patient's symptoms (shoulder pain, hiccups, dyspnea) and correlating them with potential nerve compressions caused by a lung mass. Understanding the innervation of the diaphragm and the referred pain pathways from the phrenic nerve is crucial.",
