  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's autopsy shows a large THROMBOEMBOLISM lodged in the right pulmonary artery; he most likely died from a massive PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE) that originated as a lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. Massive PE can lead to sudden occlusion of >50% of the pulmonary arterial circulation, causing a rapid increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular (RV) pressure load. This can result in acute RV dysfunction and inability to pump blood through the pulmonary circulation to the left side of the heart. With a marked decrease in left ventricular preload (left ventricular end-diastolic volume) there is a sudden loss of cardiac output.\n\nDepending on the degree of compensation for the loss of cardiac output, patients can experience lightheadedness, syncope, or sudden cardiac death (SCD). Less commonly, acute PE may also cause SCD due to cardiac arrhythmia induced by RV strain and ischemia.\n\n(Choice A) Coronary atheromatous plaque rupture leads to acute myocardial infarction; SCD can result due to ventricular arrhythmia (ie, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) triggered by myocardial ischemia/infarction. There would not be evidence of thromboembolism in the pulmonary arteries.\n\n(Choices C and D) Malignant tumor may erode into a bronchial artery, resulting in acute hemorrhage, or it may erode into a bronchus resulting in airway obstruction. Neither of these scenarios is likely to cause SCD. Bronchial artery hemorrhage would likely present with hemoptysis and, if fatal, would be evidenced by blood or thrombus in the airways on gross pathology. Bronchial airway obstruction is likely to present with respiratory difficulty or distress.\n\n(Choice E) Sleep-related upper airway obstruction occurs in obstructive sleep apnea, which may cause SCD due to hypoxemia-related cardiac arrhythmia. However, there would not be evidence of thromboembolic disease on autopsy.\n\nEducational objective:\nMassive pulmonary embolism can lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to a sudden loss of cardiac output. Less commonly, SCD may result from cardiac arrhythmia triggered by right ventricular strain and ischemia.",
    "zh": "该患者的尸检显示右肺动脉内有大血栓栓塞；他很可能死于大规模的肺栓塞 (PE)，其起源于下肢深静脉血栓形成。大规模的 PE 可导致超过 50% 的肺动脉循环突然闭塞，导致肺血管阻力快速增加和右心室 (RV) 压力负荷增加。这可能导致急性 RV 功能障碍和无法通过肺循环将血液泵入心脏左侧。由于左心室前负荷 (左心室舒张末期容积) 显着减少，心脏输出量会突然下降。\n\n根据对心脏输出量下降的代偿程度，患者可能会出现头晕、晕厥或猝死 (SCD)。不太常见的是，急性 PE 也可能因 RV 应变和缺血引起的室性心律失常而导致 SCD。\n\n(选项 A) 冠状动脉粥样硬化斑块破裂导致急性心肌梗死；SCD 可能由于心肌缺血/梗死触发的室性心律失常（即室性心动过速、室颤）而发生。肺动脉中不会有血栓栓塞的证据。\n\n(选项 C 和 D) 恶性肿瘤可能侵蚀支气管动脉，导致急性出血，或者可能侵蚀支气管导致气道阻塞。这两种情况都不太可能导致 SCD。支气管动脉出血可能表现为咯血，如果致命，尸检病理学上会在气道中发现血液或血栓。支气管气道阻塞可能表现为呼吸困难或窘迫。\n\n(选项 E) 与睡眠相关的上呼吸道阻塞发生在阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停中，这可能由于低氧相关的室性心律失常而导致 SCD。然而，尸检中不会有血栓栓塞性疾病的证据。\n\n教育目标：\n大规模的肺栓塞可导致猝死 (SCD)，原因是心脏输出量突然下降。不太常见的是，SCD 可能是由右心室应变和缺血引起的心律失常导致的。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of pulmonary embolism and its potential to cause sudden cardiac death. It requires recognizing the autopsy findings consistent with massive PE and understanding the mechanism by which it leads to hemodynamic collapse.\n\nThe key to solving this question is identifying the thromboembolism in the pulmonary artery on autopsy as shown in {{exhibit_2}} and linking it to the most likely cause, which is a deep vein thrombosis. Ruling out other causes of sudden death based on the absence of corresponding autopsy findings is also crucial.",
    "zh": "此题考察对肺栓塞的病理生理学及其导致猝死的潜力的认识。它要求识别与大规模 PE 一致的尸检结果，并了解其导致血流动力学崩溃的机制。\n\n解决此题的关键是在尸检中识别肺动脉内的血栓栓塞，如 {{exhibit_2}} 所示，并将其与最可能的原因（即深静脉血栓形成）联系起来。根据缺乏相应的尸检结果来排除其他猝死原因也很关键。"
