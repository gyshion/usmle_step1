    "en": "A 55-year-old woman is diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. The patient is treated with an opioid analgesic for bone pain that is well controlled during the first week of therapy. The following week, the analgesic dose becomes ineffective and the patient reports nausea, itching, and constipation. She has become very weak and is unable to walk due to the pain. The opioid dose is increased. The patient is concerned about side effects with higher dosages, noting that her son has a history of opioid dependence, and \"I watched him suffer a lot of bad reactions.\" The physician explains the concept of tolerance to opioids and that high doses are commonly required to control pain. Over the next few weeks, the patient would likely experience which of the following?",

    "en": "Opioid therapy is the first-line treatment for chronic cancer pain, with effective management commonly requiring higher doses over prolonged periods. An increase in dosage is often necessary to maintain adequate pain control following the development of tolerance to analgesic effects and most side effects. Tolerance to most opioid side effects is also expected to occur. However, tolerance to constipation and miosis does not readily occur, and constipation is the most common and persistent opioid side effect.\n\nOpioids stimulate mu receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, causing decreased secretions and gastric motility. Normal bowel function rarely resumes. Patients who require prolonged opioid therapy should receive a PROPHYLACTIC BOWEL REGIMEN (increased fluid intake, dietary fiber, and laxatives) to minimize constipation.\n\n(Choice A) Opioids can produce significant euphoria, mood alterations, and rewarding pleasure effects. The mechanism of euphoria and rewarding properties may involve dopaminergic pathways in the nucleus accumbens. Tolerance to euphoric effects develops rapidly, underlying the addictive potential of this medication class.\n\n(Choice B) In most cases, opioid-induced pruritus is mild and tolerance develops.\n\n(Choice C) Nausea with or without vomiting is a common side effect during initiation of opioid therapy, but tolerance develops within days and persistent nausea is uncommon. Opioids stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone, leading to emesis.\n\n(Choice D) Respiratory depression is the most serious, yet rare, side effect of opioid therapy. Opioids depress respiration by reducing responsiveness of brainstem respiratory centers to increased levels of carbon dioxide. Patients who take opioids regularly are unlikely to develop respiratory depression as tolerance to this side effect develops rapidly.\n\n(Choice E) Sedation typically occurs during initiation of therapy and usually disappears after several days. It is not unusual for patients to be drowsy and sleep more during the first days of therapy.\n\n(Choice F) Opioids block urinary voiding reflexes and also increase sphincter tone and bladder volume. This results in an antidiuretic effect and urinary retention. Tolerance to these effects develops rapidly.\n\nEducational objective: Chronic opioid use leads to the development of tolerance to analgesic effects and most side effects, with the exception of constipation and miosis. To prevent bowel complications, it is recommended that patients be treated prophylactically with adequate fluid intake and daily laxatives.",
    "zh": "阿片类药物治疗是慢性癌痛的一线治疗方法，有效管理通常需要在较长时间内使用更高剂量。在对镇痛作用和大多数副作用产生耐受性后，通常需要增加剂量以维持足够的疼痛控制。预计对大多数阿片类药物副作用也会产生耐受性。然而，对便秘和缩瞳的耐受性不易发生，便秘是最常见和持续存在的阿片类药物副作用。\n\n阿片类药物刺激胃肠道的 μ 受体，导致分泌物减少和胃肠蠕动减弱。正常的肠功能很少恢复。需要长期阿片类药物治疗的患者应接受预防性肠道方案（增加液体摄入、膳食纤维和泻药）以最大限度地减少便秘。\n\n(选项 A) 阿片类药物可产生显着的欣快感、情绪改变和奖励性愉悦效果。欣快感和奖励特性的机制可能涉及伏隔核的多巴胺能通路。对欣快感的耐受性发展迅速，这构成了该类药物的成瘾潜力。\n\n(选项 B) 在大多数情况下，阿片类药物引起的瘙痒是轻微的，并且会产生耐受性。\n\n(选项 C) 恶心伴或不伴呕吐是阿片类药物治疗开始期间常见的副作用，但耐受性在几天内产生，持续性恶心不常见。阿片类药物刺激化学感受器触发区，导致呕吐。\n\n(选项 D) 呼吸抑制是阿片类药物治疗最严重但罕见的副作用。阿片类药物通过降低脑干呼吸中枢对二氧化碳水平升高的反应来抑制呼吸。定期服用阿片类药物的患者不太可能出现呼吸抑制，因为对这种副作用的耐受性发展迅速。\n\n(选项 E) 镇静通常发生在治疗开始期间，通常在几天后消失。在治疗的最初几天，患者嗜睡和睡眠增多并不少见。\n\n(选项 F) 阿片类药物阻断排尿反射，并增加括约肌张力和膀胱容积。这导致抗利尿作用和尿潴留。对这些作用的耐受性发展迅速。\n\n教育目标：长期使用阿片类药物会导致对镇痛作用和大多数副作用产生耐受性，但便秘和缩瞳除外。为预防肠道并发症，建议患者预防性地摄入充足的液体并每日使用泻药。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of opioid tolerance and the common side effects associated with chronic opioid use, particularly in the context of cancer pain management. It highlights which side effects patients develop tolerance to and which ones persist.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing that while tolerance develops to many opioid side effects, constipation is a notable exception. Therefore, a patient on chronic opioid therapy, especially with dose escalation, is highly likely to experience worsening constipation.",
