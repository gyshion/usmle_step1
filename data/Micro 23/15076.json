  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Phthirus pubis, the human pubic louse, is a translucent parasite approximately 1 mm long with crab-like claws that allow it to grip pubic hair. Transmission usually occurs during sexual contact; however, condoms are not effective prophylaxis as the louse is transmitted by proximity (not genital secretions).\n\nManifestations typically include intense pruritus in the pubic area with excoriations due to scratching. Other hairy areas such as the axillae may be affected, but the scalp is typically spared. Visualization of the louse or nits (oval, white, louse eggs on the hair shaft) confirms the diagnosis. First-line treatment includes topical permethrin to the affected area. Permethrin blocks parasite sodium ion conduction in nerve cell membrane channels and results in louse paralysis and death.\n\n(Choice A) Oral acyclovir is used for genital herpes simplex virus infection, which usually causes painful vesicular lesions on an erythematous base.\n\n(Choice B) Oral doxycycline is first-line treatment for hidradenitis suppurativa, a chronic follicular occlusive disease that manifests in the intertriginous skin areas (eg, groin, axilla, inframammary). Manifestations usually include recurrent inflammatory nodules and abscesses with pain and malodorous discharge.\n\n(Choice C) Oral fluconazole can be used to treat mucocutaneous Candida infections. Candida balanitis can cause severe pruritus but would be associated with white patches on an erythematous base.\n\n(Choice D) Topical imiquimod increases the immune-response to anogenital warts caused by human papilloma virus infection. Anogenital warts can have many presentations (eg, flat, dome-shaped, filiform, pedunculated, verrucous) and may occasionally be pruritic.\n\n(Choice F) Topical corticosteroids can be used to treat inflammatory cutaneous conditions such as psoriasis and contact dermatitis. Although these conditions can cause erythema and pruritus, they would not be associated with a translucent louse on examination.\n\nEducational objective:\nPhthirus pubis is the human pubic louse. It is transmitted sexually via skin-to-skin contact and causes intense pruritus. Louse and nits (eggs) can often be visualized on examination. Treatment is with topical permethrin.",
    "zh": "阴虱，即人体的阴虱，是一种半透明的寄生虫，长约1毫米，具有蟹状爪，使其能够抓住阴毛。传播通常发生在性接触过程中；然而，避孕套不能有效预防，因为虱子是通过接触传播的（不是生殖器分泌物）。\n\n表现通常包括耻骨区域的剧烈瘙痒，并因搔抓而出现抓痕。其他毛发区域（如腋窝）可能会受到影响，但头皮通常不会受到影响。观察到虱子或虱卵（在毛干上的椭圆形、白色、虱子卵）可确认诊断。一线治疗包括在受影响区域局部使用扑灭司林。扑灭司林可阻断寄生虫在神经细胞膜通道中的钠离子传导，导致虱子麻痹和死亡。\n\n(选项A) 口服阿昔洛韦用于生殖器单纯疱疹病毒感染，该病通常会导致在红斑基础上出现疼痛性水疱病变。\n\n(选项B) 口服多西环素是一线治疗化脓性汗腺炎的药物，化脓性汗腺炎是一种慢性毛囊闭塞性疾病，表现于皮肤皱褶区域（如腹股沟、腋窝、乳房下）。表现通常包括反复出现的炎症性结节和脓肿，伴有疼痛和恶臭分泌物。\n\n(选项C) 口服氟康唑可用于治疗皮肤黏膜念珠菌感染。念珠菌性龟头炎可引起严重瘙痒，但会伴有红斑基础上的白色斑块。\n\n(选项D) 局部咪喹莫特可增强对人乳头瘤病毒感染引起的肛门生殖器疣的免疫反应。肛门生殖器疣可有多种表现形式（如扁平、圆顶状、丝状、带蒂、疣状），偶尔可能出现瘙痒。\n\n(选项F) 局部皮质类固醇可用于治疗炎症性皮肤病，如银屑病和接触性皮炎。虽然这些病症可引起红斑和瘙痒，但在检查中不会伴有半透明的虱子。\n\n教育目标：\n阴虱是人类阴虱。它通过性接触传播，导致剧烈瘙痒。在检查中经常可以观察到虱子和虱卵（卵）。治疗方法是局部使用扑灭司林。"

Key diagnostic features include intense pruritus in the pubic area with excoriations, and visualization of lice or nits on the hair shafts.
