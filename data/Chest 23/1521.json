    "en": "The graph compares the respiration curve for a normal, healthy individual (black line) and this patient (blue line), who most likely has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); the tracings show resting breaths along with a maximal air intake and expulsion effort. In a resting breath, a single tidal volume (TV) is exchanged. With maximal inhalation, the curve includes both the TV and the inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), which together equal the inspiratory capacity. With maximal exhalation, the curve reflects the expulsion of the IRV and the TV, as well as the amount of additional air that can be expired, which is the expiratory reserve volume (ERV). The air remaining in the lungs following full exhalation is the residual volume (RV).\n\nIn patients with COPD, the RV is substantially increased due to air trapping (eg, small airway collapse, mucous plugs) within floppy/inflamed airways. The total lung capacity (TLC) can also increase over time due to emphysematous destruction of the lung parenchyma (with resulting expansion of alveolar airspaces), but this occurs primarily in advanced disease and to a lesser extent than the increase in RV (resulting in an increased RV/TLC ratio). Increased airflow resistance and decreased pulmonary elastic recoil further contribute to hyperinflation of the lungs, causing COPD patients to breathe at higher baseline lung volumes (higher FRC).\n\n(Choice A) ERV is decreased in obstructive lung disease, as less air can be forcefully exhaled due to airway obstruction and collapse.\n\n(Choices B, C, and D) Both forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) are decreased in obstructive lung disease due to airway obstruction. Because FEV1 is decreased more than FVC, the FEV1/FVC ratio is also decreased (<0.7 in COPD).\n\nEducational objective:\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease causes air trapping and hyperinflation; consequently, these patients breathe at higher baseline lung volumes (higher functional residual capacity). The absolute volume of air in the lungs that is not respired (residual volume) increases substantially, as does the fraction of air in the lungs that is not involved in respiration (residual volume/total lung capacity). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}} {{exhibit_10}}",
    "zh": "该图比较了正常健康个体的呼吸曲线（黑线）和该患者的呼吸曲线（蓝线），该患者很可能患有慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD）；这些描记图显示了平静呼吸以及最大吸气和呼气努力。在平静呼吸中，交换单次潮气量（TV）。在最大吸气时，该曲线包括TV和吸气储备容积（IRV），两者之和等于吸气量。在最大呼气时，该曲线反映了IRV和TV的排出，以及可以呼出的额外空气量，即呼气储备容积（ERV）。完全呼气后残留在肺内的空气是残气量（RV）。\n\n在COPD患者中，由于气道内（例如，小气道塌陷、黏液栓）的气体潴留，RV显著增加。肺总量（TLC）也可能随着时间的推移而增加，这归因于肺实质的肺气肿性破坏（导致肺泡空间的扩张），但这种情况主要发生在晚期疾病中，且程度小于RV的增加（导致RV/TLC比值增加）。气流阻力增加和肺弹性回缩降低进一步导致肺过度充气，导致COPD患者在较高的基线肺容积（较高的功能残气量）下呼吸。\n\n（选项 A）在阻塞性肺病中，ERV降低，因为由于气道阻塞和塌陷，用力呼出的空气量减少。\n\n（选项 B、C 和 D）在阻塞性肺病中，由于气道阻塞，用力肺活量（FVC）和一秒用力呼气容积（FEV1）均降低。由于FEV1的降低幅度大于FVC，因此FEV1/FVC比值也降低（COPD中<0.7）。\n\n教育目标：\n慢性阻塞性肺病会导致气体潴留和过度充气；因此，这些患者在较高的基线肺容积（较高的功能残气量）下呼吸。肺内未呼吸的空气绝对量（残气量）显著增加，肺内未参与呼吸的空气分数（残气量/肺总量）也显著增加。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}} {{exhibit_7}} {{exhibit_8}} {{exhibit_9}} {{exhibit_10}}"

    "en": "This question tests the interpretation of pulmonary function test results, specifically lung volume curves, in the context of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It assesses the understanding of how COPD affects residual volume (RV) and total lung capacity (TLC), leading to an increased RV/TLC ratio.\n\nTo solve this question, analyze the provided lung volume curve, comparing the patient's curve to the normal curve. Identify the key differences, particularly the elevated residual volume and potentially increased total lung capacity, which are characteristic of COPD and result in an increased RV/TLC ratio.",
