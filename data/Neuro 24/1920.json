    "en": "A 65-year-old man is evaluated for right lower extremity weakness and difficulty walking. The patient has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. During physical examination, the lateral border of his right sole is stroked using the blunt tip of a reflex hammer. The maneuver, starting near the heel and proceeding to the base of the fifth toe, elicits extension of the great toe and fanning out of the other toes. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be observed in this patient's right lower extremity?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's presentation of lower extremity weakness and the positive Babinski sign (extension of the great toe and fanning of the other toes when the sole is stroked) are indicative of an UPPER MOTOR NEURON LESION. The Babinski sign is elicited by stroking the lateral aspect of the sole from the heel to the base of the fifth toe. A positive response is dorsiflexion of the great toe with fanning of the other toes. This reflex is normally present in infants due to incomplete myelination of the corticospinal tract but should be replaced by plantar flexion in adults. A positive Babinski sign in an adult indicates damage to the corticospinal tract (upper motor neuron).\n\nUpper motor neuron lesions are characterized by hyperreflexia (increased briskness of deep tendon reflexes), spastic paralysis, increased muscle tone (spasticity), and pyramidal weakness (weakness is more pronounced in extensors in the upper extremities and flexors in the lower extremities). The maneuver described in the question is the Babinski reflex, which is a sign of upper motor neuron dysfunction.\n\n(Choice A) Decreased muscle girth (atrophy) is typically seen in LOWER MOTOR NEURON lesions due to denervation and disuse. While disuse can lead to some atrophy in UMN lesions, significant atrophy is more characteristic of LMN lesions.\n\n(Choice C) Increased muscle rigidity with rhythmic interruptions (cogwheel rigidity) is a sign of dysfunction in the EXTRAPYRAMIDAL tracts, particularly seen in PARKINSON DISEASE, which affects the basal ganglia.\n\n(Choice D) In upper motor neuron lesions, lower extremity weakness is typically more pronounced in the FLEXORS than the extensors, not the other way around. This is referred to as spasticity.\n\n(Choice E) Spontaneous, intermittent contractions of muscle fibers (fasciculations) are a sign of LOWER MOTOR NEURON disease, indicating irritation or damage to the motor neurons themselves or their axons.\n\nKey clinical pearls:\nBabinski sign is a hallmark of UPPER MOTOR NEURON lesions.\nUpper motor neuron signs include HYPERREFLEXIA, SPASICITY, and PYRAMIDAL WEAKNESS.\nLower motor neuron signs include HYPOTONIA, MUSCLE ATROPHY, FASCICULATIONS, and HYPOREFLEXIA or AREFLEXIA.",
    "zh": "患者表现出的下肢无力和Babinski征阳性（当划触足底时，大脚趾伸展，其他脚趾呈扇形展开）表明存在上运动神经元损伤。Babinski征通过从足跟到第五个脚趾根部的足底外侧面划触来引出。阳性反应是大脚趾背屈，其他脚趾呈扇形展开。这种反射通常存在于婴儿中，原因是皮质脊髓束髓鞘形成不完全，但成年人应被跖屈取代。成年人Babinski征阳性表明皮质脊髓束（上运动神经元）受损。\n\n上运动神经元损伤的特征是反射亢进（深腱反射活跃度增加）、痉挛性麻痹、肌张力增高（痉挛）和锥体束无力（上肢伸肌无力更明显，下肢屈肌无力更明显）。问题中描述的操作是Babinski反射，这是上运动神经元功能障碍的征兆。\n\n(选项A) 肌肉周径减小（萎缩）通常见于下运动神经元损伤，原因是去神经支配和废用。虽然废用会导致一些上运动神经元损伤中的萎缩，但显著的萎缩更常见于下运动神经元损伤。\n\n(选项C) 肌肉僵硬度增加，并伴有节律性中断（齿轮样僵硬）是锥体外系束功能障碍的征兆，尤其见于帕金森病，该病影响基底节。\n\n(选项D) 在上运动神经元损伤中，下肢无力通常在屈肌中比伸肌更明显，而不是相反。这被称为痉挛。\n\n(选项E) 肌纤维自发性、间歇性收缩（肌束颤动）是下运动神经元疾病的征兆，表明运动神经元本身或其轴突受到刺激或损伤。\n\n关键临床要点：\nBabinski征是上运动神经元损伤的标志。\n上运动神经元征包括反射亢进、痉挛和锥体束无力。\n下运动神经元征包括肌张力减退、肌肉萎缩、肌束颤动和反射减退或反射消失。"
