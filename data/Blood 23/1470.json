    "en": "Hemoglobin electrophoresis is used to assess for different forms of hemoglobin in patients with suspected hemoglobinopathy. Normal hemoglobin consists primarily of HEMOGLOBIN A (HbA), which migrates rapidly toward the positive electrode (anode) because of its negative charge. Hemoglobin S (HbS) is an abnormal type of hemoglobin in which a nonpolar amino acid (valine) replaces a negatively charged amino acid (glutamate) in the beta globin chain. This amino acid replacement decreases the negative charge on the HbS molecule, which causes HbS to move more slowly toward the anode. Similarly, hemoglobin C (HbC) has a glutamate residue replaced by lysine in the beta globin chain. Because lysine is a positively charged amino acid, HbC has even less total negative charge than HbS and moves even more slowly toward the anode. Both HbC and HbS result from missense mutations, a type of mutation in which a single base substitution results in a codon that codes for a different amino acid.\n\nPatients with sickle cell disease have HbS mutations in both beta chains; those with HbC disease have HbC mutations involving both beta chains. Patients with hemoglobin SC disease have 1 HbS allele and 1 HbC allele and will have 2 hemoglobin bands on electrophoresis. This patient's electrophoresis results show a single band that migrates less than the HbA and HbS bands, meaning that he has HbC disease {{exhibit_2}}. Patients with HbC disease are typically asymptomatic and often have mild hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly.\n\n(Choice A) Deletions involving the alpha globin genes cause alpha thalassemia, which results in imbalanced beta chain production and formation of beta tetramers (hemoglobin H) that migrate further than HbA during electrophoresis.\n\n(Choice C) Nonsense mutations introduce a stop codon within gene sequences, resulting in the formation of truncated proteins. As a result of their decreased size, these proteins tend to move further during electrophoresis.\n\n(Choice D) Silent mutations are point mutations that have no effect on the protein formed. A mutation from UCA to UCC does not result in any change in protein structure as both codons result in the placement of serine into the growing polypeptide chain.\n\n(Choice E) Trinucleotide expansions increase the number of trinucleotide repeats within a gene, resulting in large, unstable proteins or alterations in the epigenetic effects. These proteins would tend to move less during electrophoresis due to their increased size. However, the hemoglobinopathies are not caused by trinucleotide expansions, as the hemoglobin genes do not contain trinucleotide repeat regions.\n\nEducational objective:\nHemoglobin C is caused by a missense mutation that results in a glutamate residue being substituted by lysine in the beta globin chain. This results in an overall decrease in negative charge for the hemoglobin molecule. The speed of hemoglobin movement during gel electrophoresis is hemoglobin A > hemoglobin S > hemoglobin C.",
    "zh": "血红蛋白电泳用于评估怀疑患有血红蛋白病的患者的不同形式的血红蛋白。正常的血红蛋白主要由血红蛋白A（HbA）组成，由于其带负电荷，它会迅速向正电极（阳极）移动。血红蛋白S（HbS）是一种异常类型的血红蛋白，其中非极性氨基酸（缬氨酸）取代了β珠蛋白链中的带负电荷的氨基酸（谷氨酸）。这种氨基酸的置换降低了HbS分子的负电荷，这导致HbS向阳极移动的速度更慢。同样，血红蛋白C（HbC）的β珠蛋白链中，谷氨酸残基被赖氨酸取代。由于赖氨酸是一种带正电荷的氨基酸，HbC的总负电荷甚至低于HbS，并且向阳极移动的速度更慢。HbC和HbS都源于错义突变，这是一种单碱基替换导致密码子编码不同氨基酸的突变。\n\n镰状细胞病患者的两个β链中都有HbS突变；而HbC病患者则有涉及两个β链的HbC突变。血红蛋白SC病患者有1个HbS等位基因和1个HbC等位基因，在电泳上将有2条血红蛋白带。该患者的电泳结果显示一条单带，其迁移速度低于HbA和HbS带，这意味着他患有HbC病 {{exhibit_2}}。HbC病患者通常无症状，并且经常有轻度溶血性贫血和脾肿大。\n\n（选项A）涉及α珠蛋白基因的缺失会导致α地中海贫血，从而导致β链产生失衡，并形成β四聚体（血红蛋白H），在电泳期间其迁移距离大于HbA。\n\n（选项C）无义突变在基因序列中引入终止密码子，从而导致截短蛋白的形成。由于其尺寸减小，这些蛋白质倾向于在电泳期间移动更远。\n\n（选项D）沉默突变是不会对形成的蛋白质产生影响的点突变。从UCA到UCC的突变不会导致蛋白质结构的任何变化，因为这两个密码子都会导致丝氨酸被置于正在生长的多肽链中。\n\n（选项E）三核苷酸扩增增加了基因内三核苷酸重复序列的数量，从而导致大型、不稳定的蛋白质或表观遗传效应的改变。由于其尺寸增大，这些蛋白质在电泳期间倾向于移动较少。然而，血红蛋白病不是由三核苷酸扩增引起的，因为血红蛋白基因不包含三核苷酸重复序列区域。\n\n教育目标：\n血红蛋白C是由错义突变引起的，该突变导致β珠蛋白链中的谷氨酸残基被赖氨酸取代。这导致血红蛋白分子的总负电荷降低。在凝胶电泳期间，血红蛋白的迁移速度为血红蛋白A > 血红蛋白S > 血红蛋白C。"
