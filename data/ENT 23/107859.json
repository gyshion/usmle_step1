    "en": "A 1-year-old boy is brought to the clinic for a painful mass in the neck. The parents noticed a small area of nontender swelling in the neck a month ago. Over the last few days, it has enlarged and become painful, and the patient has a fever. Examination shows a mobile, tender, fluctuant, and warm mass approximately 2 cm in diameter that is located at the right mandibular angle. There is purulent drainage from the skin surface just anterior to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. This patient's clinical findings are most likely due to which of the following embryologic processes? {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",

    "en": "Branchial cleft cyst\n\nThis patient's neck mass anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle is likely an infected branchial cleft cyst. This congenital anomaly is related to abnormal in utero development of the pharyngeal apparatus, an early embryologic structure comprising the following:\n\n*   Pharyngeal (or branchial) arches: Six pairs of arches are precursors to the bones, muscles, and vasculature of the face, neck, and pharynx.\n*   Pharyngeal pouches: The inner surface of the arches is lined by endoderm, and the pockets created by each arch are pouches, which differentiate into distinct fetal structures (eg, third pouch forms the thymus).\n*   Pharyngeal clefts (or grooves): The outer surface of the arches is lined by ectoderm, and the clefts are the recesses between the arches. Most clefts obliterate; for example, the second, third, and fourth clefts merge to form the cervical sinus, which then involutes.\n\nFailed obliteration of a pharyngeal cleft leaves a pathologic remnant in a predictable anatomic location. This patient likely has the most common type, a second pharyngeal groove anomaly (branchial cleft cyst), which is characteristically located anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The cyst is often unrecognized until secondary infection leads to a tender, fluctuant mass with or without purulent drainage (ie, sinus, fistula).\n\n(Choice A) The parathyroid glands are derivatives of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches; failure to descend to their anatomic position leads to ectopic glands. An associated adenoma can lead to symptoms of persistent hyperparathyroidism (eg, bone disease, nephrolithiasis), not a fluctuant mass and drainage.\n\n(Choice B) Failed neural crest cell migration to the pharyngeal arches would affect development of skeletal structures of the face and neck (eg, bone, cartilage) and would not explain a cystic mass.\n\n(Choice C) Inadequate fusion of the mandibular prominences (derivatives of the first pharyngeal arch) is rare and affects development of the lower lip, lower jaw, and tongue, findings not seen in this patient.\n\n(Choice E) In utero, the thyroid gland descends from the base of the tongue to its final position down the thyroglossal duct, which then obliterates. A persistent thyroglossal duct can lead to a cyst along the path of descent that can become secondarily infected, but the cyst would be midline.\n\nEducational objective:\nBranchial cleft cysts are most often located anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and result from incomplete obliteration of a pharyngeal cleft (or groove). Patients typically have a tender, fluctuant mass (due to secondary infection) with or without purulent drainage.",
    "zh": "鳃裂囊肿\n\n该患者胸锁乳突肌前方的颈部肿块很可能是一个感染的鳃裂囊肿。这种先天性异常与子宫内咽器发育异常有关，咽器是早期胚胎结构，包括以下内容：\n\n*   咽弓（或鳃弓）：六对弓是面部、颈部和咽部骨骼、肌肉和血管的前体。\n*   咽囊：弓的内表面由内胚层覆盖，每个弓形成的口袋是咽囊，它们分化成不同的胎儿结构（例如，第三咽囊形成胸腺）。\n*   咽裂（或沟）：弓的外表面由外胚层覆盖，裂缝是弓之间的凹陷。大多数裂缝会闭合；例如，第二、第三和第四裂缝融合形成颈窦，然后退化。\n\n咽裂闭锁不全会在可预测的解剖位置留下病理残余。该患者可能患有最常见的类型，即第二鳃沟异常（鳃裂囊肿），其特征性位于胸锁乳突肌前方。囊肿通常在继发感染导致触痛、波动性肿块并伴或不伴脓性引流（即，窦道、瘘管）之前未被识别。\n\n(选项 A) 甲状旁腺是第三和第四咽囊的衍生物；未能下降到其解剖位置会导致异位腺体。相关的腺瘤可导致持续性甲状旁腺功能亢进的症状（例如，骨病、肾结石），而不是波动性肿块和引流。\n\n(选项 B) 神经嵴细胞未能迁移到咽弓会影响面部和颈部的骨骼结构（例如，骨、软骨）的发育，并且不能解释囊性肿块。\n\n(选项 C) 下颌隆突（第一咽弓的衍生物）融合不足的情况很少见，会影响下唇、下颌和舌头的发育，该患者未见这些表现。\n\n(选项 E) 在子宫内，甲状腺从舌根下降到最终位置，沿着甲状舌管，然后闭锁。持续存在的甲状舌管会导致沿下降路径形成囊肿，该囊肿可能继发感染，但囊肿将位于中线。\n\n教育目标：\n鳃裂囊肿通常位于胸锁乳突肌前方，是由于咽裂（或沟）闭锁不全所致。患者通常会出现触痛、波动性肿块（由于继发感染），并伴或不伴脓性引流。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of embryological development of the neck and the etiology of branchial cleft cysts. It requires understanding the structures derived from pharyngeal arches, pouches, and clefts. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the location of the mass (anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle) and the presence of purulent drainage, which are characteristic of a branchial cleft cyst.
