  "explanation": {
    "en": "Na-, K-, and Cl- are the main ions that determine the electrical potential difference (voltage) across a membrane (membrane potential). Under normal physiologic conditions, there is a low concentration of Na+ and Cl- in the cell and high concentration of K+ in the cytoplasm. Conversely, the extracellular space has a high concentration of Na- and Cl- ions and low concentration of K- ions.\n\nBecause intracellular K+ concentration is much greater than its extracellular concentration, opening of cellular potassium channels leads to K+ efflux from the cell along the K- concentration gradient. Within the cell, the positive charge of the K+ ions is normally neutralized by the negative charge of intracellular anions (eg, phosphates and proteins) that are trapped in the cell. As K+ ions leave the cell, negatively charged anions accumulate along the inner side of the cell membrane. This continually increasing negative charge attracts the positively charged K+ ions back into the cell. When the difference in concentration (diffusion potential) of K+ inside and outside the cell is large, the efflux of K+ ions will continue despite the increasing negative charge. At a certain point, however, the negative intracellular charge (electrical potential) of the membrane becomes large enough that the number of K+ ions it attracts into the cell equals the number of K+ ions that leave the cell along the concentration gradient. The electrical potential difference that moves K+ ions into the cell at the same rate as they leave the cell along the concentration gradient is called the equilibrium potential.\n\nEducational objective:\nWhen a specific ion channel opens, the respective ions will flow across the membrane in a direction that brings the resting membrane potential closer to that ion's equilibrium potential.",
    "zh": "Na+、K+ 和 Cl- 是决定跨膜电位差（电压）的主要离子。在正常生理条件下，细胞内 Na+ 和 Cl- 的浓度较低，而细胞质中 K+ 的浓度较高。相反，细胞外空间具有高浓度的 Na+ 和 Cl- 离子以及低浓度的 K+ 离子。\n\n由于细胞内 K+ 浓度远大于其细胞外浓度，细胞钾离子通道的开放导致 K+ 顺着 K+ 浓度梯度从细胞中流出。在细胞内，K+ 离子的正电荷通常被细胞内阴离子（例如，磷酸盐和蛋白质）的负电荷中和，这些阴离子被困在细胞内。当 K+ 离子离开细胞时，带负电荷的阴离子会在细胞膜的内侧积累。这种不断增加的负电荷吸引带正电荷的 K+ 离子重新进入细胞。当细胞内外 K+ 的浓度差（扩散电位）很大时，尽管负电荷增加，K+ 离子的流出仍将持续。然而，在某一点上，膜的负细胞内电荷（电位）变得足够大，以至于它吸引到细胞内的 K+ 离子数量等于顺着浓度梯度离开细胞的 K+ 离子数量。使 K+ 离子以与它们顺着浓度梯度离开细胞相同的速率进入细胞的电位差称为平衡电位。\n\n教育目标：\n当特定的离子通道打开时，相应的离子将朝向使静息膜电位更接近该离子平衡电位的方向跨膜流动。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of ion channel physiology, specifically how concentration gradients and equilibrium potentials influence ion movement across cell membranes. The scenario requires integrating given equilibrium potentials with the principle that ions move to bring the resting membrane potential closer to their individual equilibrium potential.\n\nThe solution involves identifying the ion with the most negative equilibrium potential relative to the resting membrane potential. This indicates the ion whose movement outward would most significantly hyperpolarize the cell, given the provided conditions and ion channel opening.",
