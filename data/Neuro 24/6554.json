    "en": "A 31-year-old woman is brought to the hospital due to respiratory difficulty. She has had trouble performing her daily activities for the past few weeks due to fatigue. In particular, her arms seem to \"just drop\" when she combs her hair or brushes her teeth. The patient's symptoms are generally better in the morning and worsen throughout the day. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Examination shows diplopia. Chest auscultation shows normal heart and breath sounds. Deep tendon reflexes are normal. Babinski sign is absent. The results of arterial blood gas analysis are as follows: {{exhibit_1}} pH 7.32, {{exhibit_2}} pCO2 60 mm Hg, {{exhibit_3}} pO2 60 mm Hg. Which of the following is most likely abnormal in this patient?",

    "en": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by fatigable, fluctuating weakness of the skeletal muscles. The most commonly affected muscles include ocular (diplopia, ptosis), bulbar (dysarthria, fatigable chewing), facial (loss of smile), and proximal (neck/shoulder weakness) muscles. However, respiratory failure (↓ pH, ↑ pCO2, ↓ O2) can also occur due to diaphragmatic weakness (ie, myasthenic crisis), and may be the presenting symptom in some patients. MG is caused by an autoantibody-mediated, T cell-dependent attack on the acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) of the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction. Antibody-mediated blockade of the active site of AChRs prevents acetylcholine from binding and also triggers endocytosis of AChRs (receptor internalization) as well as complement-mediated membrane damage. Over time, these changes result in reduced numbers of AChRs and impaired neuromuscular transmission. {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "重症肌无力(MG)是一种获得性自身免疫性疾病，其特征是骨骼肌的易疲劳、波动性无力。最常受影响的肌肉包括眼肌（复视、上睑下垂）、延髓肌（构音障碍、易疲劳的咀嚼）、面部肌（失去微笑）和近端肌（颈/肩无力）。然而，由于膈肌无力（即肌无力危象），也可能发生呼吸衰竭（↓ pH，↑ pCO2，↓ O2），并且可能是某些患者的首发症状。 MG是由自身抗体介导的、T细胞依赖性地攻击突触后神经肌肉接头的乙酰胆碱受体（AChRs）引起的。 抗体介导的对AChRs活性位点的阻断阻止了乙酰胆碱的结合，并且还触发了AChRs的内吞作用（受体内化）以及补体介导的膜损伤。 随着时间的推移，这些变化导致AChRs数量减少和神经肌肉传递受损。{{exhibit_4}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of myasthenia gravis, including fatigable weakness, diplopia, and respiratory difficulty indicated by abnormal arterial blood gas results (respiratory acidosis). Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder where antibodies attack acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to reduced numbers of functional receptors and impaired neuromuscular transmission. Therefore, the number of acetylcholine receptors is most likely abnormal.",
    "zh": "患者表现出提示重症肌无力的症状，包括易疲劳的无力、复视以及由异常动脉血气结果（呼吸性酸中毒）所指示的呼吸困难。重症肌无力是一种自身免疫性疾病，其中抗体攻击神经肌肉接头的乙酰胆碱受体，导致功能受体数量减少和神经肌肉传递受损。因此，乙酰胆碱受体的数量最有可能异常。"
