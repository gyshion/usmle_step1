    "en": "A 52-year-old man comes to the office due to diarrhea. For the past 3 months, he has had loose, brown, watery stools 4 or 5 times a day; it is associated with postprandial bloating. The patient has no vomiting, melena, hematochezia, or unexpected weight changes. He was diagnosed 10 years ago with systemic sclerosis, which presented with sclerodactyly and Raynaud phenomenon. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. The abdomen is visibly distended but nontender and without rebound or guarding. His symptoms dramatically improve after treatment with oral antibiotics.",
    "zh": "一名52岁男性因腹泻前来就诊。在过去的3个月里，他每天有4到5次稀便，呈棕色、水样便；这与餐后腹胀有关。患者没有呕吐、黑便、便血或意外的体重变化。10年前他被诊断为系统性硬化症，表现为硬皮病和雷诺现象。患者不吸烟、不饮酒、也不使用违禁药物。腹部可见膨胀，但无触痛，也没有反跳痛或腹肌紧张。在口服抗生素治疗后，他的症状明显改善。"

    "en": "This patient has small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) presenting with bloating and diarrhea. SIBO is caused by bacterial proliferation (eg, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides, Aeromonas) in the small bowel. It is a common complication of scleroderma, which can alter intestinal motility due to smooth muscle atrophy and fibrosis. As in this patient, symptoms often improve with antibiotics.\n\nSIBO is characterized by mucosal enterocyte injury due to bacterial adherence, invasion, and toxin injury. The activity of brush border enzymes is often impaired. These changes lead to maldigestion and often malabsorption in more severe cases. Specific macronutrient effects include the following:\n\n*   Carbohydrates: decreased digestion and absorption of carbohydrates facilitate bacterial fermentation, producing carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane gases (eg, bloating).\n*   Fatty acids: conjugated bile acids normally emulsify dietary fats in the proximal small bowel and are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum. However, SIBO causes deconjugation of bile acids, leading to early bile acid resorption in the jejunum, reduced lipid emulsification, and fat malabsorption.\n*   Amino acids: SIBO causes maldigestion of proteins and malabsorption of amino acids, occasionally leading to protein-losing enteropathy in severe cases.\n\n(Choice A) Defective apoprotein structure occurs in abetalipoproteinemia, an autosomal recessive disorder that presents in infancy with fat malabsorption and growth abnormalities; symptoms would not improve with antibiotics.\n\n(Choice B) Impaired release of pancreatic lipase occurs with chronic pancreatitis. Patients typically have severe postprandial abdominal pain and steatorrhea (bulky, fat-laden stools); therapy involves pancreatic enzyme replacement, not antibiotics.\n\n(Choice D) Gastrin-secreting tumors (ie, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) cause gastric acid hypersecretion, which lowers duodenal pH and inactivates pancreatic lipase. Although it can cause diarrhea and fat malabsorption, hypersecretion typically presents with abdominal pain and multiple gastrointestinal ulcers; antibiotics are ineffective.\n\nEducational objective:\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth is characterized by bacterial proliferation in the small bowel, leading to mucosal inflammation with subsequent fermentation of carbohydrates and fat malabsorption; it manifests with diarrhea, abdominal distension, and flatulence. Patients with impaired intestinal peristalsis (eg, systemic sclerosis) are at increased risk. Treatment includes oral antibiotics.",
    "zh": "该患者患有小肠细菌过度生长（SIBO），表现为腹胀和腹泻。SIBO是由小肠内细菌增殖（例如，大肠杆菌、拟杆菌、气单胞菌）引起的。它是硬皮病常见的并发症，硬皮病可由于平滑肌萎缩和纤维化而改变肠道蠕动。正如该患者一样，症状通常在抗生素治疗后得到改善。\n\nSIBO的特点是由于细菌粘附、侵袭和毒素损伤导致粘膜肠细胞损伤。刷状缘酶的活性常常受损。这些变化导致消化不良，并且在更严重的情况下常常导致吸收不良。特定的常量营养素影响包括：\n\n*   碳水化合物：碳水化合物的消化和吸收减少促进细菌发酵，产生二氧化碳、氢气和甲烷气体（例如，腹胀）。\n*   脂肪酸：结合型胆汁酸通常在近端小肠中乳化膳食脂肪，并在末端回肠中被重吸收。然而，SIBO导致胆汁酸去结合，导致胆汁酸在空肠中早期重吸收，减少脂质乳化，并导致脂肪吸收不良。\n*   氨基酸：SIBO引起蛋白质消化不良和氨基酸吸收不良，偶尔导致严重的蛋白丢失性肠病。\n\n（选项A）载脂蛋白结构缺陷见于无β脂蛋白血症，这是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，在婴儿期表现为脂肪吸收不良和生长异常；症状不会对抗生素治疗有效。\n\n（选项B）胰脂肪酶释放受损见于慢性胰腺炎。患者通常有严重的餐后腹痛和脂肪泻（大便体积大，含脂肪）；治疗涉及胰酶替代，而非抗生素。\n\n（选项D）胃泌素分泌肿瘤（即，Zollinger-Ellison综合征）引起胃酸分泌过多，降低十二指肠pH值并使胰脂肪酶失活。虽然它可引起腹泻和脂肪吸收不良，但分泌过多通常表现为腹痛和多发胃肠溃疡；抗生素无效。\n\n教学目标：\n小肠细菌过度生长以小肠内细菌增殖为特征，导致粘膜炎症，随后碳水化合物发酵和脂肪吸收不良；表现为腹泻、腹胀和肠胃胀气。肠蠕动受损的患者（例如，系统性硬化症）风险增加。治疗包括口服抗生素。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) as a cause of diarrhea, particularly in patients with systemic sclerosis. It also assesses understanding of the pathophysiology of SIBO and its response to antibiotic treatment.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the association between systemic sclerosis and SIBO, and understand that SIBO leads to maldigestion and malabsorption due to bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. The improvement with antibiotics is a key clue.",
