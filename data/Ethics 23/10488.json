  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient requires surgical intervention and must give appropriate consent before proceeding. However, he has limited English proficiency (LEP) and will require language assistance to make informed decisions about his health care. Best practices for medical communication with a patient who has LEP is to use an medical interpreter (or provider) trained in medical translation in the patient's primary language. Using a trained medical interpreter can help avoid potentially dangerous miscommunication, and leads to fewer clinical errors, higher patient satisfaction, and better clinical outcomes. However, using an interpreter or other personnel to provide care is subject to consent by the patient.\n\nIf a face-to-face interpreter is unavailable, video or telephonic remote translation services should be offered. If the situation is urgent and there is no time to wait for interpretation services, communication should be facilitated by any tools available (eg, friends/family, writing/drawing instruments, bilingual hospital staff); however, these options should not be considered standard procedure in nonemergency situations.\n\n(Choice B) Printing out a Vietnamese language informed consent form would be helpful. However, it does not replace the need for a medical interpreter who can provide details of the procedure and guarantee that the patient's questions are answered thoroughly.\n\n(Choices C and D) Friends and family members are not ideal for language interpretation due to lack of impartiality and possible barriers to open communication regarding sensitive topics (eg, domestic abuse). They may also be unfamiliar with medical terminology and may struggle to accurately convey complex medical information (although this patient's son has medical training). This patient should be offered the services of a trained medical translator; family would be used only if the patient declines an outside translator.\n\n(Choice E) Although this statement reflects a potential reason to avoid using family members as interpreters, there is nothing in the family interaction to suggest a lack of objectivity, and such a direct response may be taken as demeaning or insensitive.\n\nEducational objective:\nPhysicians must ensure the appropriate use of medical interpreters to promote adequate patient understanding and participation in the decision-making process. This is particularly important when obtaining informed consent for treatment.",
    "zh": "该患者需要手术干预，并且在进行手术前必须给予适当的知情同意。然而，他的英语能力有限（LEP），需要语言帮助才能对他的医疗保健做出知情的决定。与LEP患者进行医学交流的最佳实践是使用在患者主要语言的医学翻译方面受过训练的医学翻译（或提供者）。使用训练有素的医学翻译可以帮助避免潜在的危险误解，并减少临床错误，提高患者满意度，并获得更好的临床结果。但是，使用翻译或其他人员提供护理须经患者同意。\n\n如果无法提供面对面的翻译，应提供视频或电话远程翻译服务。如果情况紧急，没有时间等待翻译服务，应通过任何可用的工具（例如，朋友/家人、书写/绘画工具、双语医院工作人员）促进沟通；但是，这些选项不应被视为非紧急情况下的标准程序。\n\n（选项 B）打印越南语的知情同意书会有所帮助。但是，这并不能取代对医学翻译的需求，医学翻译可以提供该程序的详细信息，并保证患者的问题得到充分解答。\n\n（选项 C 和 D）由于缺乏公正性和可能阻碍关于敏感话题（例如家庭虐待）的开放沟通，朋友和家人并不是理想的语言翻译者。他们也可能不熟悉医学术语，并且可能难以准确传达复杂的医学信息（尽管该患者的儿子接受过医学培训）。应向该患者提供训练有素的医学翻译服务；只有当患者拒绝外部翻译时，才会使用家人。\n\n（选项 E）虽然此声明反映了避免使用家庭成员作为翻译的潜在原因，但家庭互动中没有任何迹象表明缺乏客观性，而且这种直接的回应可能被认为是贬低的或不敏感的。\n\n教育目标：\n医师必须确保适当使用医学翻译，以促进患者充分理解和参与决策过程。这在获得治疗的知情同意时尤其重要。"
