  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient says he feels \"like a failure\" because he used cocaine again following a 3-month period of abstinence. Focusing on the negative consequences of cocaine use (which the patient is already aware of) may be perceived as shaming and judgmental. The best approach is to help the patient feel understood by acknowledging his feelings of disappointment but reframing his relapse as a temporary setback he can surmount.\n\nPrinciples of motivational interviewing can be used to help this patient get back on track and strengthen his belief that he can keep making progress. Motivational interviewing is a nonjudgmental, collaborative, patient-centered approach that enhances the patient's sense of self-confidence and self-efficacy. By emphasizing the patient's past success in maintaining abstinence for a period of time, the physician supports the patient's belief in his ability to learn from this setback and make changes. Open-ended discussion of what contributed to using cocaine again from the patient's perspective can then be used to guide the patient to make a specific plan to achieve and implement change.\n\n(Choice A) This question has a judgmental tone and fails to acknowledge how the patient feels. It also assumes the patient will keep using and prematurely focuses on possible negative consequences of continued use.\n\n(Choice B) This approach also focuses on reiterating the negative health effects of cocaine rather than addressing the patient's loss of confidence in his ability to make changes. Focusing on his strengths rather than on negative consequences is more likely to build internal motivation.\n\n(Choice C) Although this statement seems supportive, it discourages self-reflection and does not help build the patient's sense of self-efficacy.\n\n(Choice D) Rather than first exploring the patient's own thoughts about his relapse, this approach is assumptive and reflects a desire to control the agenda while rushing to a premature solution. Such a statement misses the opportunity to elicit the patient's perspective and help build his confidence in his own ability to make changes.\n\nEducational objective:\nPrinciples of motivational interviewing can be used in the treatment of substance use disorders to guide responses to patients who relapse. This technique helps build patients' sense of self-efficacy by emphasizing their past successes in maintaining abstinence and by supporting patients' belief in their ability to make changes.",
    "zh": "该患者说他感觉“像个失败者”，因为他在戒断3个月后再次使用了可卡因。专注于可卡因使用的负面后果（患者已经意识到）可能会被视为羞辱和评判。最好的方法是帮助患者感到被理解，通过承认他的失望情绪，但将他的复发重新定义为他可以克服的暂时挫折。\n\n动机性访谈的原则可以用来帮助这位患者重回正轨，并加强他可以继续取得进步的信念。动机性访谈是一种非评判性、合作性、以患者为中心的治疗方法，可增强患者的自信心和自我效能感。通过强调患者过去一段时间内保持戒断的成功，医生支持患者相信他有能力从这次挫折中学习并做出改变。然后，从患者的角度进行开放式讨论，探讨导致再次使用可卡因的原因，可以引导患者制定具体计划以实现和实施改变。\n\n（选项 A）这个问题带有评判色彩，未能承认患者的感受。它还假设患者会继续使用，并过早地关注继续使用的可能负面后果。\n\n（选项 B）这种方法也侧重于重申可卡因的负面健康影响，而不是解决患者对改变能力的信心丧失。关注他的优势而不是负面后果，更有可能建立内在的动力。\n\n（选项 C）虽然这种说法似乎是支持性的，但它会阻碍自我反思，并且无助于建立患者的自我效能感。\n\n（选项 D）这种方法不是首先探索患者自己对复发的想法，而是假设性的，并反映了控制议程的愿望，同时急于得到一个过早的解决方案。这种说法错失了引出患者观点并帮助建立他对自身做出改变的能力的信心。\n\n教育目标：\n动机性访谈的原则可用于治疗物质使用障碍，以指导对复发患者的反应。这种技术通过强调患者过去在维持戒断方面的成功，并通过支持患者相信他们有能力做出改变来帮助建立患者的自我效能感。"
