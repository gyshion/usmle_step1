    "en": "A 68-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter due to a change in mental status. Over the past 2 days, the patient has reported seeing strangers sneaking around the house when only he and his daughter were at home. He has also been intermittently confused, difficult to rouse, and distractible. The patient has had no headaches or focal weakness. He has no chronic medical or psychiatric problems other than seasonal allergies, which his daughter says have flared up since he moved in with her 2 weeks ago. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 12/min. On physical examination, the patient is somnolent but arousable to voice. He is not oriented to place or time. Pupils are bilaterally equal and reactive to light. Bilateral upper and lower extremity muscle strength, deep tendon reflexes, and pain sensation are normal. Blood cell counts and serum chemistry studies are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his current condition?",
    "zh": "一名68岁男性因精神状态改变被女儿送往急诊科。在过去的2天里，患者报告说看到陌生人在房子周围鬼鬼祟祟，而当时只有他和他的女儿在家。他还间歇性地意识模糊、难以唤醒且容易分心。患者没有头痛或局灶性无力。他除了季节性过敏外，没有其他慢性内科或精神科问题，他的女儿说自从他两周前搬来和她一起住后，过敏就发作了。体温36.7摄氏度（98华氏度），血压140/85毫米汞柱，脉搏88次/分钟，呼吸12次/分钟。体格检查显示，患者嗜睡但能被声音唤醒。他不清楚时间和地点。双侧瞳孔等大，对光反应灵敏。双侧上下肢肌力、深腱反射和痛觉正常。血细胞计数和血清化学研究均在正常范围内。以下哪项最可能是他目前情况的原因？"

    "en": "This patient has altered mental status (eg, impaired consciousness, disorientation, hallucinations) consistent with DELIRIUM. The key characteristics of ACUTE ONSET (hours to days) and FLUCTUATION distinguish delirium from other disorders with similar symptoms (eg, dementia, psychosis). Delirium is frequently multifactorial, most often caused by an acute medical condition, drug intoxication/withdrawal, or adverse medication effect. Underlying illness and intoxication/withdrawal are unlikely given this patient's stable vital signs, nonfocal exam, and normal laboratory values. Therefore, MEDICATION-INDUCED DELIRIUM, which is common with over-the-counter remedies for SEASONAL ALLERGIES, should be suspected.\n\nDrug reactions frequently cause delirium, and psychoactive agents (eg, anticholinergics, ANTIHISTAMINES, benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics, opioids) carry the highest risk. Comprehensive medication review (including over-the-counter agents and other family members' prescriptions) is essential to every delirium workup. The definitive treatment for delirium must address the underlying cause (eg, treat the medical illness, remove the offending medication).\n\nDementia (often previously unrecognized) is among the most common risk factors for delirium, and cognitive assessment should follow delirium resolution.\n\n(Choice A) Brief psychotic disorder may be diagnosed in patients with ≥1 day but <1 month of psychotic symptoms not better explained by a medical illness/medication effect. Patients with brief psychotic disorder are typically alert without altered consciousness.\n\n(Choice B) Like delirium, dementia with Lewy bodies can cause visual hallucinations and cognitive fluctuations. However, it is marked by early executive dysfunction (eg, driving difficulty, job impairment), follows a progressive course, and has other neurologic findings (eg, parkinsonism, REM sleep behavior disorder).\n\n(Choice C) Frontotemporal dementias are a group of several neurodegenerative diseases. They can present with behavioral disturbance (eg, impulsivity, disinhibition, apathy) or language impairment (eg, aphasia). Unlike delirium, they have a gradual onset with a progressive course, and hallucinations are atypical.\n\n(Choice D) Hypothyroidism presenting as delirium is rare, but would be possible if severe (ie, myxedema coma); however, progressive lethargy with hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia is typically present. Delirium is a more common manifestation of acute thyrotoxicosis.\n\nEducational objective:\nDelirium involves the acute onset of fluctuating disturbances in attention (eg, altered consciousness) and cognition (eg, disorientation, hallucinations). When no clear medical illness is apparent, medication-induced delirium should be suspected. Psychoactive drugs (eg, anticholinergics, antihistamines, benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics, opioids) are common causes, and over-the-counter agents and un-authorized prescriptions should not be overlooked.",
    "zh": "该患者的精神状态发生了改变（例如，意识受损、定向障碍、幻觉），与谵妄一致。急性起病（数小时至数天）和波动是谵妄与其他具有相似症状的疾病（例如，痴呆、精神病）的区别的关键特征。谵妄通常是多因素的，最常见的原因是急性内科疾病、药物中毒/戒断或不良的药物反应。鉴于该患者的生命体征稳定、体格检查无局灶性发现以及实验室指标正常，潜在的疾病和中毒/戒断的可能性不大。因此，应怀疑药物诱发的谵妄，这在治疗季节性过敏的非处方药中很常见。\n\n药物反应经常引起谵妄，精神活性药物（例如，抗胆碱药、抗组胺药、苯二氮卓类药物、镇静催眠药、阿片类药物）的风险最高。全面的药物回顾（包括非处方药和其他家庭成员的处方）对于每次谵妄检查至关重要。谵妄的明确治疗必须针对根本原因（例如，治疗内科疾病，去除致病药物）。\n\n痴呆（通常以前未被识别）是谵妄最常见的危险因素之一，在谵妄缓解后应进行认知评估。\n\n（选项A）在出现精神病症状≥1天但<1个月，且无法用内科疾病/药物效应更好地解释的患者中，可以诊断为短暂性精神病障碍。短暂性精神病障碍患者通常清醒，没有意识改变。\n\n（选项B）像谵妄一样，路易体痴呆可引起视觉幻觉和认知波动。然而，其特点是早期执行功能障碍（例如，驾驶困难、工作受损），病程呈进行性，并有其他神经系统发现（例如，帕金森病、REM睡眠行为障碍）。\n\n（选项C）额颞叶痴呆是几种神经退行性疾病的集合。它们可能表现为行为障碍（例如，冲动、失抑制、冷漠）或语言障碍（例如，失语症）。与谵妄不同，它们起病缓慢，病程呈进行性，并且幻觉不典型。\n\n（选项D）甲状腺功能减退症表现为谵妄的情况很少见，但如果病情严重（即，黏液性水肿性昏迷）则可能发生；然而，通常会出现进行性嗜睡，伴有体温过低、低血压和心动过缓。谵妄是急性甲状腺毒症更常见的表现。\n\n教育目标：\n谵妄涉及注意力（例如，意识改变）和认知（例如，定向障碍、幻觉）的波动性急性起病。当没有明显的内科疾病时，应怀疑药物诱发的谵妄。精神活性药物（例如，抗胆碱药、抗组胺药、苯二氮卓类药物、镇静催眠药、阿片类药物）是常见原因，不应忽视非处方药和未经授权的处方。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of delirium, its key features, common causes, and differential diagnosis. It emphasizes the importance of considering medication effects, including over-the-counter drugs, in the etiology of acute mental status changes.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the core features of delirium such as acute onset, fluctuating course, and altered consciousness. Differentiate delirium from other causes of altered mental status like dementia and psychosis by considering the temporal course and specific clinical findings. Prioritize medication-induced delirium when no other clear medical cause is evident, especially in the context of recent changes in medication or allergies.",
