    "en": "A 58-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the emergency department with fever, malaise, lower abdominal discomfort, and left flank pain. The patient has a history of diabetic autonomic neuropathy with bladder dysfunction and has been hospitalized multiple times for recurrent urinary tract infections. His temperature is 39.4 C (103 F), blood pressure is 94/50 mm Hg, and pulse is 118/min. Height is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in), weight is 150 kg (331 lb), and BMI is 46 kg/m². On examination, there is suprapubic and left costovertebral angle tenderness. After review of culture and sensitivity tests from his prior hospitalization, the patient is started on an empiric antibiotic regimen that includes an aminoglycoside. While calculating the appropriate dosage, the hospital pharmacy uses an adjusted body weight that is lower than the patient's actual body weight. Which of the following best explains the use of this adjusted body parameter?",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is E. Aminoglycosides are large, charged molecules that cannot cross cell membranes; their volume of distribution is limited to the extracellular space, which increases only marginally in obese individuals. As a result, dosing in obese patients is based on an adjusted body weight that takes into account only a portion (~40%) of the excess adipose mass. This approach is used because the drug does not distribute extensively into adipose tissue. \n\n(Choice B) The route of elimination does not directly impact weight-based drug dosing, aside from the fact that lipophilic drugs more often undergo hepatic elimination. Furthermore, aminoglycosides are not metabolized by the liver; they are freely filtered by the glomerulus and excreted unchanged in the urine. \n\n(Choice C) The vast majority of drugs, including aminoglycosides, undergo first- (not zero-) order metabolism. In addition, body weight adjustments with regard to medication dosing are usually made according to the way a drug distributes within the body's tissues. \n\n(Choice D) Acidic drugs with a high degree of plasma protein binding (eg, warfarin) are retained in the intravascular space and have a limited volume of distribution that is less affected by body weight. In contrast, aminoglycosides have minimal plasma protein binding and can distribute extensively into the interstitial compartment.",
    "zh": "正确答案是E。氨基糖苷类药物是大的带电分子，不能穿过细胞膜；它们的分布体积仅限于细胞外空间，肥胖个体中仅略有增加。因此，肥胖患者的剂量是基于调整后的体重，该体重仅考虑了过量脂肪质量的一部分（约40%）。使用这种方法是因为药物不会广泛分布到脂肪组织中。\n\n（选项B）消除途径不会直接影响基于体重的药物剂量，除了亲脂性药物更常通过肝脏消除这一事实。此外，氨基糖苷类药物不会被肝脏代谢；它们会被肾小球自由过滤，并以原形从尿液中排出。\n\n（选项C）绝大多数药物，包括氨基糖苷类药物，都经过一级（而非零级）代谢。此外，关于药物剂量的体重调整通常是根据药物在体内组织中的分布方式进行的。\n\n（选项D）高度血浆蛋白结合的酸性药物（例如，华法林）保留在血管内空间，分布体积有限，受体重的影响较小。相比之下，氨基糖苷类药物的血浆蛋白结合 minimal，可以广泛分布到间质间室。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of pharmacokinetic principles, specifically how body composition, particularly obesity, affects drug distribution and dosing strategies for certain drug classes like aminoglycosides.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recognize that aminoglycosides are hydrophilic and primarily distribute in the extracellular fluid. In obese patients, the excess adipose tissue does not significantly contribute to the volume of distribution for these drugs, necessitating the use of adjusted body weight for accurate dosing to avoid toxicity.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对药代动力学原理的理解，特别是身体成分，尤其是肥胖，如何影响某些药物（如氨基糖苷类药物）的药物分布和给药策略。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须认识到氨基糖苷类药物是亲水的，主要分布在细胞外液中。在肥胖患者中，过多的脂肪组织不会显著影响这些药物的分布体积，因此需要使用调整后的体重进行准确的剂量计算，以避免毒性。"
