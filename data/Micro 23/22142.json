The patient was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 19-year-old woman who had poor access to prenatal care. Temperature is 38 C (100.4 F). Vital signs are otherwise normal for age. On examination, the patient has nasal drainage and peeling skin on his face, hands, and feet. Hepatosplenomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy are present.",

    "en": "This neonate has fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and generalized lymphadenopathy, which are nonspecific findings for congenital infection. This patient's rhinorrhea and desquamating rash involving the hands and feet are further suggestive of congenital syphilis. \n\nCongenital syphilis is transmitted transplacentally from an infected mother. Routine prenatal screening with treatment (ie, penicillin) when indicated can decrease the risk for transmission; however, cases still occur due to limited access to prenatal care or primary infection acquired after screening. \n\nAlthough many neonates with congenital syphilis are asymptomatic, classic early findings in symptomatic patients include the following:\n\n*   Snuffles: Copious, persistent rhinorrhea develops after age 1 week. It is caused by erosions of the mucosa in the nasal cavity, and discharge may be clear/white, bloody, or purulent.\n*   Maculopapular rash: Lesions usually develop after the onset of rhinorrhea, classically involving the palms, soles, and buttocks, and then desquamate. The rash may be associated with fissures near orifices (eg, anal, oral).\n*   Skeletal anomalies: Symmetric and bilateral long bone involvement can cause pain, swelling, and limited movement.\n\n(Choice A) The rash of erythema multiforme often involves the palms and soles and may be precipitated by an infection (eg, Epstein-Barr virus) associated with fever, as well as enlargement of the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. However, the rash is characterized by target lesions with a dusky center, findings not seen in this patient.\n\n(Choice B) Kawasaki disease, which is exceedingly rare in neonates, can present with a desquamating rash involving the hands and feet. However, other diagnostic criteria include fever ≥5 days, a cervical node >1.5 cm, conjunctivitis, and mucositis, none of which are seen in this patient. In addition, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are inconsistent with this diagnosis.\n\n(Choice C) Measles initially presents with a prodrome of fever and rhinorrhea but also conjunctivitis and cough, findings not seen in this patient. The subsequent rash spreads cephalocaudally and typically spares the palms and soles, making this diagnosis unlikely in this patient.\n\n(Choice D) Scarlet fever due to group A Streptococcus causes pharyngitis with a diffuse, fine, rough (sandpaper) rash that spares the palms and soles, unlike in this patient. Reticuloendothelial involvement (ie, diffuse lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly) is not seen.\n\nEducational objective:\nCongenital syphilis should be suspected in a neonate with rhinorrhea and a desquamating, maculopapular rash involving the palms/soles, particularly in those with limited prenatal care. Nonspecific findings of congenital infection include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy.",
    "zh": "该新生儿有发热、肝脾肿大和全身淋巴结肿大，这些都是先天性感染的非特异性表现。该患者的流涕和手脚脱屑性皮疹进一步提示先天性梅毒。\n\n先天性梅毒通过胎盘从受感染的母亲传播。在适当情况下进行常规产前筛查和治疗（即青霉素）可以降低传播风险；然而，由于产前护理机会有限或筛查后获得的初级感染，仍会发生病例。\n\n虽然许多患有先天性梅毒的新生儿无症状，但有症状患者的典型早期表现包括以下内容：\n\n*   鼻塞：在1周后出现大量、持续性流涕。它是由鼻腔粘膜糜烂引起的，分泌物可能为清亮/白色、血性或脓性。\n*   斑丘疹：病变通常在流涕开始后出现，典型地涉及手掌、足底和臀部，然后脱屑。皮疹可能与孔口附近的裂隙（例如，肛门、口腔）相关。\n*   骨骼异常：对称性和双侧长骨受累可引起疼痛、肿胀和活动受限。\n\n(选项 A) 多形性红斑的皮疹通常涉及手掌和足底，并可能由感染（例如，Epstein-Barr病毒）引起，并伴有发热以及淋巴结、肝脏和脾脏肿大。然而，皮疹的特征是靶状病变，中心呈暗色，在该患者中未见这些表现。\n\n(选项 B) 川崎病在新生儿中极为罕见，可表现为手脚脱屑性皮疹。然而，其他诊断标准包括发热≥5天、颈部淋巴结>1.5厘米、结膜炎和黏膜炎，该患者均未出现。此外，全身淋巴结肿大和肝脾肿大与该诊断不符。\n\n(选项 C) 麻疹最初表现为发热和流涕的前驱症状，但也有结膜炎和咳嗽，该患者未见这些表现。随后的皮疹呈头尾扩散，通常不累及手掌和足底，这使得该诊断在该患者中不太可能。\n\n(选项 D) A组链球菌引起的猩红热会导致咽炎，并出现弥漫性、细腻、粗糙（砂纸样）皮疹，但该皮疹不累及手掌和足底，与该患者不同。未见网状内皮系统受累（即弥漫性淋巴结肿大、肝脾肿大）。\n\n教育目标：\n在患有流涕和手掌/足底脱屑性斑丘疹的新生儿中，应怀疑先天性梅毒，尤其是在产前护理有限的患者中。先天性感染的非特异性表现包括发热、肝脾肿大和淋巴结肿大。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of congenital syphilis presentation in neonates, focusing on clinical features like rhinorrhea, desquamating rash on palms/soles, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy, especially in the context of limited prenatal care. It emphasizes recognizing the classic signs and symptoms of congenital syphilis to differentiate it from other neonatal infections. \n\nTo solve this question, focus on the combination of rhinorrhea (snuffles), desquamating rash involving palms and soles, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy in a neonate with limited prenatal care. Rule out other conditions based on their distinct clinical features, such as target lesions in erythema multiforme, specific diagnostic criteria in Kawasaki disease, cephalocaudal rash spread in measles, and pharyngitis with sandpaper rash in scarlet fever.",
