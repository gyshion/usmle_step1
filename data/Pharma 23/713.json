    "en": "A 64-year-old woman comes to the hospital due to sudden-onset right arm weakness and difficulty speaking, which completely resolved within 20 minutes. The patient has had no shaking movements, headache, nausea, photophobia, or anxiety. She has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and takes amlodipine and rosuvastatin, respectively. Her blood pressure is 125/70 mm Hg and pulse is 78/min and regular. Neurologic examination is unremarkable. Fingerstick glucose is within normal limits. ECG shows normal sinus rhythm. Carotid Doppler reveals mild left common carotid artery stenosis. MRI of the brain and echocardiogram are unremarkable. If the patient is started on an additional medication that is indicated for her condition, which of the following adverse effects is most likely to occur? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's symptoms are consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Given her risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, carotid stenosis), low-dose aspirin is indicated to prevent future ischemic events. Aspirin works by irreversibly inhibiting COX-1, which reduces thromboxane A2 production, impairing platelet aggregation and reducing vasoconstriction. At least 2 distinct COX-1-dependent mechanisms contribute to the increased risk of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding associated with aspirin therapy: inhibition of platelet aggregation and impairment of prostaglandin-dependent GI mucosal protection. The risk of upper GI bleeding increases with higher doses but is increased 2- to 3-fold even with low-dose aspirin. Proton pump inhibitors can help reduce the risk of upper GI bleeding in patients taking aspirin. \n\n(Choice A) Central nervous system depression is commonly seen with benzodiazepine use. \n(Choice C) Very high doses of aspirin can cause salicylism (e.g., vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss) and hyperpnea (stimulates respiratory drive). Hyperpnea may result in respiratory alkalosis, whereas systemic salicylate accumulation often leads to a concurrent metabolic acidosis. \n(Choice D) Orthostatic hypotension may occur with use of antihypertensive medications due to vasodilation. \n(Choice E) Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of antidepressants and some antihypertensives. \n(Choice F) Pioglitazone (a thiazolidinedione) is associated with an increased risk of urinary bladder cancer with long-term use.",
    "zh": "患者的症状与短暂性脑缺血发作（TIA）一致。考虑到她的危险因素（高血压、高胆固醇血症、颈动脉狭窄），低剂量阿司匹林适用于预防未来的缺血事件。阿司匹林通过不可逆地抑制COX-1起作用，从而减少血栓素A2的产生，损害血小板聚集并减少血管收缩。至少两种不同的COX-1依赖性机制导致与阿司匹林治疗相关的上消化道（GI）出血风险增加：抑制血小板聚集和损害前列腺素依赖性GI粘膜保护。上消化道出血的风险随着剂量的增加而增加，即使使用低剂量阿司匹林，风险也会增加2到3倍。质子泵抑制剂可以帮助降低服用阿司匹林的患者发生上消化道出血的风险。\n\n（选项A）中枢神经系统抑制通常见于苯二氮卓类药物的使用。\n（选项C）非常高剂量的阿司匹林可引起水杨酸中毒（例如，眩晕、耳鸣、听力丧失）和呼吸过快（刺激呼吸驱动）。呼吸过快可能导致呼吸性碱中毒，而全身性水杨酸盐蓄积常常导致并发的代谢性酸中毒。\n（选项D）体位性低血压可能发生在由于血管舒张而使用降压药时。\n（选项E）性功能障碍是抗抑郁药和某些降压药的常见副作用。\n（选项F）吡格列酮（一种噻唑烷二酮类药物）与长期使用相关的膀胱癌风险增加有关。"
