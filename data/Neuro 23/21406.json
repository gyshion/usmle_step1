    "en": "A 4-day-old girl is seen in the clinic for follow-up after discharge from the newborn nursery. She was born at 38 weeks gestation via uncomplicated vaginal delivery. On examination, the patient is well appearing and is moving all extremities. Tone and reflexes are normal. A deep sacral pit is noted with a hair tuft over the midline lumbosacral region. The remainder of the examination is normal. A spinal ultrasound is obtained and reveals a low-lying conus medullaris at L5 with a thickened filum terminale. Failure of which of the following embryologic processes is most likely associated with this patient's findings?",

    "en": "Spinal dysraphism with a midline lumbosacral pit with hair tuft has findings concerning for a closed spinal dysraphism, also referred to as spina bifida occulta or a closed neural tube defect (NTD). {{exhibit_1}}\n\nIn contrast to open NTDs in which neuronal tissue is exposed due to defective primary neurulation, closed NTDs are covered by overlying skin and are thought to represent an impairment in secondary neurulation, a process by which the caudal spinal cord and its mesenchymal tissues are formed. The most common defect causing closed spinal dysraphism is failure of vertebral arch fusion, typically at L5-S1.\n\nMost newborns, such as this patient, are asymptomatic or have only cutaneous findings, such as lumbosacral hemangioma, pit, nevus, or hair tuft. Spinal ultrasound may reveal a thickened filum terminale and low-lying conus medullaris, as seen here, which is suggestive of an occult tethered cord, a common finding in patients with closed NTDs.\n\nSymptomatic tethered cord syndrome due to stretch-induced dysfunction of the distal spinal cord can occur as patients grow, causing pain and lower motor neuron signs (eg, lower extremity weakness, loss of sensation, hyporeflexia).\n\n(Choice A) Anterior (rostral) neural tube closure is part of primary neurulation. Failure of this process leads to anencephaly, an open NTD characterized by absence of major portions of the skull and forebrain.\n\n(Choice B) The myelencephalon is the precursor of the medulla oblongata; it does not divide into separate hemispheres. Impairment in its development would result in fetal brainstem dysfunction and would likely be fatal.\n\n(Choice C) Neural crest cells are the progenitors for the peripheral (not central) nervous system. Hirschsprung disease is a disorder of neural crest cell migration and results in an aganglionic colonic segment, often causing intestinal obstruction. Spinal cord abnormalities and a cutaneous lumbosacral finding would not be seen.\n\n(Choice D) Failure of notochord separation from the underlying endoderm leads to neurenteric cysts (eg, spinal tumors with gastrointestinal epithelium) rather than spinal dysraphism.\n\nEducational objective:\nClosed spinal dysraphism (spina bifida occulta or closed neural tube defect) often presents with cutaneous lumbosacral findings (eg, deep pit, hemangioma, tuft of hair) in the newborn period. Pathogenesis involves failure of vertebral arch fusion, and imaging may suggest an underlying tethered cord (eg, low-lying conus medullaris, thickened filum terminale). {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
