    "en": "This patient’s fever and joint pain are nonspecific symptoms of a viral infection. Atypical (reactive) lymphocytes are also nonspecific and are seen with many viral infections (although Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus usually present with the highest counts).\n\nBased on the described viral morphology, this patient is most likely infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), a member of the DNA-containing *Hepadnaviridae* family. The mature virion (called a Dane particle) consists of a hexagonal protein core (capsid) covered with a lipid bilayer envelope studded with proteins and carbohydrates. The HBV genome is a partially double-stranded circular DNA molecule housed within the capsid.\n\nAfter the virion enters the cell, the capsid is released into the cytoplasm and the viral genome is transferred into the nucleus. The viral DNA is then repaired to form a fully double-stranded circular minichromosome that is capable of being transcribed into viral mRNAs. Replication of the genome occurs within a newly synthesized capsid containing the full-length viral mRNA transcript. Reverse transcriptase (which has both RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA-polymerase activity) acts on this RNA template to create a single-stranded DNA intermediate that is then converted back into circular, partially double-stranded DNA. The mature capsid is then enveloped by a portion of the endoplasmic reticulum containing virally-coded proteins to form the completed virion.\n\n(Choice A) Coxsackie virus is within the *Picornaviridae* family and is composed of an icosahedral nucleocapsid and a + single-stranded RNA genome. The RNA has a protein on the 5’ end that acts as a primer for transcription by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\n\n(Choices B and C) Cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus are members of the *Herpesviridae* family. All viruses within this family contain an icosahedral core surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope and have double-stranded, linear DNA. These are the only viruses to acquire their envelopes by budding from the nuclear membrane.\n\n(Choice E) Human immunodeficiency virus is within the *Lentivirus* subgroup of retroviruses. It contains a bar-shaped protein core surrounded by a glycoprotein envelope that includes the gp120 and gp41 glycoproteins. The genome is diploid, consisting of 2 + single-stranded RNA molecules that are transcribed into double-stranded DNA by a reverse transcriptase present in the capsid.\n\n(Choice F) Parvovirus B19 is a small nonenveloped icosahedral virus with a linear, single-stranded DNA genome. There is no polymerase in the virion.\n\nEducational objective:\nReplication of the hepatitis B genome occurs within a newly synthesized capsid through the action of reverse transcriptase on an RNA template. The mature capsid contains partially double-stranded circular DNA and reverse transcriptase.",
    "zh": "该患者的发热和关节痛是病毒感染的非特异性症状。非典型（反应性）淋巴细胞也是非特异性的，见于多种病毒感染（尽管 EB 病毒和巨细胞病毒通常表现出最高的计数）。\n\n根据所描述的病毒形态，该患者最有可能感染乙型肝炎病毒 (HBV)，属于含 DNA 的 *肝 DNA 病毒科*。成熟的病毒体（称为 Dane 颗粒）由一个六边形蛋白质核心（衣壳）组成，该核心被覆盖着一层脂质双分子层包膜，包膜上镶嵌着蛋白质和碳水化合物。HBV 基因组是一个部分双链环状 DNA 分子，位于衣壳内。\n\n病毒体进入细胞后，衣壳释放到细胞质中，病毒基因组转移到细胞核中。然后修复病毒 DNA，形成一个完全双链环状微染色体，该染色体能够转录成病毒 mRNA。基因组的复制发生在一个新合成的衣壳内，该衣壳包含全长病毒 mRNA 转录本。逆转录酶（具有 RNA 依赖性和 DNA 依赖性 DNA 聚合酶活性）作用于该 RNA 模板，生成单链 DNA 中间体，然后该中间体再转化为环状部分双链 DNA。然后，成熟的衣壳被内质网的一部分包膜，其中包含病毒编码的蛋白质，以形成完整的病毒体。\n\n（选项 A）柯萨奇病毒属于 *小 RNA 病毒科*，由二十面体核衣壳和 + 单链 RNA 基因组组成。RNA 在 5' 末端有一个蛋白质，它充当由 RNA 依赖性 RNA 聚合酶转录的引物。\n\n（选项 B 和 C）巨细胞病毒和 EB 病毒是 *疱疹病毒科* 的成员。该科内的所有病毒都包含一个由脂蛋白包膜包围的二十面体核心，并具有双链线性 DNA。这些是唯一通过从核膜出芽而获得其包膜的病毒。\n\n（选项 E）人类免疫缺陷病毒属于逆转录病毒的 *慢病毒*亚组。它包含一个棒状蛋白质核心，周围环绕着一个糖蛋白包膜，其中包括 gp120 和 gp41 糖蛋白。该基因组是二倍体，由 2 个 + 单链 RNA 分子组成，这些分子由衣壳中存在的逆转录酶转录成双链 DNA。\n\n（选项 F）B19 细小病毒是一种小型无包膜二十面体病毒，具有线性单链 DNA 基因组。病毒体中没有聚合酶。\n\n教育目标：\n乙型肝炎基因组的复制通过逆转录酶作用于 RNA 模板而发生在新合成的衣壳内。成熟的衣壳包含部分双链环状 DNA 和逆转录酶。"
