    "en": "Dystonia is a neurologic movement disorder characterized by sustained, involuntary muscle contractions, which force certain parts of the body into abnormal, sometimes painful movements or postures. Focal dystonias affect a single muscle or group of related muscles, the most common of which include cervical dystonia (ie, torticollis), blepharospasm (ie, eyelid twitching), and brachial dystonia (ie, writer's cramp).\n\nFocal dystonias are usually classified as idiopathic; however, genetic mutations are becoming increasingly implicated. Focal dystonias are due to abnormal neural signaling pathways, which can arise from multiple locations in the brain (eg, basal ganglia, motor cortex, supplementary motor areas).\n\nBecause the dystonia originates from abnormal neural signaling, microscopic examination of the affected muscle is often relatively unremarkable. Histopathology may show normal muscle or muscle fiber hypertrophy (which occurs due to repetitive contractions).\n\n(Choice A) Certain types of glycogen storage diseases (eg, Pompe disease) can lead to weakness and fatigue due to abnormal glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle. Muscle biopsy would show enlarged lysosomes containing periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive material.\n\n(Choice B) Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are caused by mutations affecting dystrophin, a cytoplasmic protein vital for stabilization of the muscle cell membrane. Loss of cell membrane integrity leads to muscle fiber degeneration and progressive fibrofatty replacement.\n\n(Choice C) Autoimmune muscle injury (eg, dermatomyositis, polymyositis) often shows an inflammatory cellular infiltrate (eg, lymphocytes) with muscle fiber necrosis, phagocytosis, and regeneration. Over time, the active inflammation and necrosis may be replaced by fibrosis.\n\n(Choice E) Statin therapy can cause muscle fiber necrosis without a significant associated inflammatory infiltrate. Muscle aches and weakness are the most common complications of statin therapy.\n\nEducational objective:\nFocal dystonia is a neurologic movement disorder characterized by sustained, involuntary muscle contractions. Because these contractions are neurologically mediated, muscle biopsy may not show significant histologic changes, although muscle fiber hypertrophy is often present due to repetitive contractions.",
    "zh": "肌张力障碍是一种神经系统运动障碍，其特征是持续的、不自主的肌肉收缩，这迫使身体的某些部位出现异常，有时是痛苦的运动或姿势。局灶性肌张力障碍影响单个肌肉或一组相关肌肉，其中最常见的是颈部肌张力障碍（即斜颈）、睑痉挛（即眼睑抽搐）和臂肌张力障碍（即书写痉挛）。\n\n局灶性肌张力障碍通常被归类为特发性；然而，越来越多的证据表明与基因突变有关。局灶性肌张力障碍是由于异常的神经信号通路引起的，这些通路可能源于大脑的多个位置（例如，基底神经节、运动皮层、辅助运动区）。\n\n由于肌张力障碍起源于异常的神经信号，受影响肌肉的显微镜检查通常相对不明显。组织病理学可能显示正常肌肉或肌纤维肥大（由于重复收缩而发生）。\n\n（选项A）某些类型的糖原累积病（例如，庞贝病）会导致骨骼肌中糖原分解异常，从而导致无力和疲劳。肌肉活检将显示溶酶体增大，其中含有周期性酸-希夫（PAS）阳性物质。\n\n（选项B）杜兴和贝克尔肌营养不良症是由影响肌萎缩蛋白的突变引起的，肌萎缩蛋白是一种细胞质蛋白，对稳定肌细胞膜至关重要。细胞膜完整性的丧失导致肌纤维变性和进行性纤维脂肪替代。\n\n（选项C）自身免疫性肌肉损伤（例如，皮肌炎、多发性肌炎）通常显示炎性细胞浸润（例如，淋巴细胞），伴有肌纤维坏死、吞噬作用和再生。随着时间的推移，活动性炎症和坏死可能被纤维化所取代。\n\n（选项E）他汀类药物治疗可导致肌纤维坏死，而没有显著相关的炎症浸润。肌肉疼痛和无力是他汀类药物治疗最常见的并发症。\n\n教育目标：\n局灶性肌张力障碍是一种神经系统运动障碍，其特征是持续的、不自主的肌肉收缩。由于这些收缩是由神经系统介导的，肌肉活检可能不会显示出显着的组织学变化，尽管由于重复收缩，通常存在肌纤维肥大。"

It requires differentiating these findings from other muscle pathologies.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves understanding the pathophysiology of dystonia, recognizing that it is primarily a neurological disorder affecting muscle function, and recalling the typical histological changes that may occur in affected muscles, particularly muscle fiber hypertrophy due to sustained contractions.",
