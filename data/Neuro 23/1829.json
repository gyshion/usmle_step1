    "en": "A 12-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother due to left hand clumsiness. Several hours ago, he was climbing a tree but lost his balance and fell, grabbing a branch with his left hand on the way down. He landed safely on his feet with no head injury or loss of consciousness. On physical examination, the patient has difficulty performing fine finger movements with his left hand.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Brachial plexus inferior trunk injury {{exhibit_1}}\nThe inferior trunk carries nerve fibers from the C8 and T1 spinal levels that ultimately contribute to the median and ulnar nerves. Together, these nerves innervate all of the intrinsic muscles of the hand (eg, lumbricals, interossei, thenar, hypothenar).\n\nInjury to the inferior trunk of the brachial plexus may cause paralysis of all the intrinsic hand muscles (Klumpke palsy), resulting in hand clumsiness. Weakness of lumbricals impairs flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints and extension of the interphalangeal joints. Relative sparing of the extrinsic flexors and extensors of the hand contributes to the total claw hand deformity seen in this condition. Sensory loss can also occur over the medial aspect of the hand and/or forearm. Involvement of the T1 nerve root proximal to the sympathetic trunk may cause concomitant Horner syndrome (eg, ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis).\n\n(Choice A) Shoulder dislocations or fractures of the surgical neck of the humerus can cause axillary nerve injury, which results in weakness of the deltoid and teres minor muscles.\n\n(Choice C) Long thoracic nerve injury classically occurs during axillary lymph node dissection and results in paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle, leading to winging of the scapula.\n\n(Choice D) Injury to the musculocutaneous nerve causes weakened elbow flexion because the nerve innervates the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles.\n\n(Choice E) Fractures at the midshaft of the humerus commonly cause radial nerve injury. Patients may experience posterior forearm and dorsolateral hand numbness with paralysis of the wrist and finger extensors (wrist drop).\n\n(Choice F) The suprascapular nerve innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. Nerve injury may result in difficulties with abduction and lateral rotation of the arm, respectively.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe inferior trunk of the brachial plexus carries nerve fibers from the C8 and T1 spinal levels that are responsible for innervating all the intrinsic muscles of the hand (via the median and ulnar nerves). Sudden upward stretching on the arm at the shoulder can damage the inferior trunk, resulting in hand clumsiness and total claw hand deformity.",
    "zh": "臂丛神经下干损伤 {{exhibit_1}}\n下干携带来自C8和T1脊髓节段的神经纤维，这些神经纤维最终有助于形成正中神经和尺神经。这些神经共同支配手的所有内在肌（例如，蚓状肌、骨间肌、拇指内收肌、小鱼际肌）。\n\n臂丛神经下干损伤可导致所有手部内在肌麻痹（Klumpke麻痹），导致手部笨拙。蚓状肌无力会损害掌指关节的屈曲和指间关节的伸展。相对于手的外在屈肌和伸肌的相对保留，有助于形成在这种情况下看到的完全爪形手畸形。感觉丧失也可能发生在手和/或前臂的内侧。T1神经根在交感干近端的受累可能导致伴发的Horner综合征（例如，同侧眼睑下垂、瞳孔缩小、无汗症）。\n\n(选项 A) 肩关节脱位或肱骨外科颈骨折可导致腋神经损伤，导致三角肌和小圆肌无力。\n\n(选项 C) 胸长神经损伤通常发生在腋窝淋巴结清扫术中，导致前锯肌麻痹，导致肩胛骨翼状改变。\n\n(选项 D) 肌皮神经损伤会导致肘屈曲无力，因为该神经支配肱二头肌和肱肌。\n\n(选项 E) 肱骨中段骨折常导致桡神经损伤。患者可能出现后前臂和手背外侧麻木，伴有腕和手指伸肌麻痹（腕下垂）。\n\n(选项 F) 冈上神经支配冈上肌和冈下肌。神经损伤可能分别导致手臂外展和外旋困难。\n\n教育目标：\n臂丛神经的下干携带来自C8和T1脊髓节段的神经纤维，这些神经纤维负责支配手的所有内在肌（通过正中神经和尺神经）。肩部手臂突然向上牵拉会损伤下干，导致手部笨拙和完全爪形手畸形。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of brachial plexus injuries, specifically Klumpke palsy resulting from inferior trunk damage. It requires understanding the nerve roots involved and the muscles innervated by those nerves.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the mechanism of injury (sudden upward stretch) and the resulting symptoms (hand clumsiness). Recall that the inferior trunk (C8-T1) innervates intrinsic hand muscles, and damage leads to Klumpke palsy.",
