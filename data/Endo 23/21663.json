  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient has a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma (prolactinoma), confirmed with elevated serum prolactin and a pituitary mass visible on MRI. Prolactin can cause hypogonadism (eg, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, gynecomastia) due to suppression of hypothalamic GnRH production. Mass-effect symptoms of the tumor commonly include headaches and visual field defects due to compression of the optic chiasm.\n\nUnlike most pituitary hormones, which are under positive regulation by releasing hormones (eg, GnRH, TRH) from the hypothalamus, prolactin is primarily under negative regulation by dopaminergic neurons via the pituitary stalk. Dopamine agonists (eg, cabergoline, bromocriptine) are used in patients with prolactinomas to suppress prolactin production and reduce tumor size.\n\nProlactin levels typically fall significantly within the first 2-3 weeks of therapy (Choices D and E), with a corresponding improvement in hypogonadal symptoms. Although decreased tumor size may not be visible on imaging for several weeks, mass-effect symptoms (eg, visual field defects) usually start to improve much sooner, often within the first several days of treatment (Choices B and C), with eventual normalization in many cases.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the adenoma size and severity of neurologic symptoms, dopamine agonists are the first-line therapy for prolactinoma. Surgery is not needed in most patients; even if surgery is performed, complete resection is often not possible, and recurrence is common, requiring medication therapy.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nProlactin is under negative regulation by dopaminergic neurons via the pituitary stalk. Dopamine agonists (eg, cabergoline) are used in patients with prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas (prolactinomas) to suppress prolactin production and reduce tumor size. Benefits are typically seen within the first few weeks of therapy. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有泌乳素分泌型垂体腺瘤（催乳素瘤），这通过血清催乳素升高和MRI可见的垂体肿块得以证实。催乳素可引起性腺功能减退（如性欲下降、勃起功能障碍、男性乳房发育），原因是它会抑制下丘脑GnRH的产生。肿瘤的占位效应症状通常包括头痛和视野缺损，这是由于压迫视交叉所致。\n\n与大多数受下丘脑释放激素（如GnRH、TRH）正向调节的垂体激素不同，催乳素主要受多巴胺能神经元通过垂体柄的负向调节。多巴胺激动剂（如卡麦角林、溴隐亭）用于催乳素瘤患者，以抑制催乳素的产生并缩小肿瘤大小。\n\n催乳素水平通常在治疗的头2-3周内显著下降（选项D和E），伴随性腺功能减退症状的相应改善。尽管肿瘤大小的缩小在影像学上可能需要几周才能显现，但占位效应症状（如视野缺损）通常会更早开始改善，通常在治疗的头几天内（选项B和C），许多情况下最终会恢复正常。\n\n因此，无论腺瘤大小和神经系统症状的严重程度如何，多巴胺激动剂都是催乳素瘤的一线治疗。大多数患者不需要手术；即使进行了手术，也往往无法完全切除，复发很常见，需要药物治疗。\n\n教育目标：\n\n催乳素受多巴胺能神经元通过垂体柄的负向调节。多巴胺激动剂（如卡麦角林）用于患有泌乳素分泌型垂体腺瘤（催乳素瘤）的患者，以抑制催乳素的产生并缩小肿瘤大小。益处通常在治疗的头几周内即可显现。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"
