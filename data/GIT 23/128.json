    "en": "A 5-week-old boy born to a 23-year-old primigravida is brought to the emergency department due to increasingly frequent, forceful vomiting after every feed over the last 4 days. The emesis appears to be undigested formula. The patient seems hungry again after vomiting. On examination, the anterior fontanelle is slightly sunken, and mucous membranes are dry. Abdominal examination shows prominent peristalsis in the epigastric region. Laboratory evaluation indicates metabolic alkalosis and mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.",

    "en": "Nonbilious emesis and signs of dehydration (eg, sunken fontanelle, dry mucous membranes) in an infant age 3-6 weeks raise concern for infantile HYPERTROPHIC PYLORIC STENOSIS. Hypertrophy of the circular layer of smooth muscle that surrounds the pylorus obstructs the gastric outlet and impedes the passage of gastric contents, resulting in nonbilious, projectile emesis. Vomiting usually occurs immediately after oral intake, and infants classically show signs of hunger soon after emesis. The etiology of this abnormal postnatal growth of smooth muscle is likely multifactorial, involving the interplay of genetic factors (eg, positive family history) with environmental exposures (eg, macrolide antibiotics).\n\nIf the diagnosis is delayed, protracted vomiting can result in hypochloremic METABOLIC ALKALOSIS because of the loss of hydrochloric acid in the emesis. In addition, hypovolemia activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and aldosterone stimulates potassium excretion by the kidneys, resulting in hypokalemia. Unconjugated HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA is also commonly seen due to dehydration, which increases enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin.\n\nExamination of patients with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis often reveals palpation of the hypertrophied muscle as an olive-shaped abdominal mass in the epigastrium, although its absence does not exclude the diagnosis. Visually prominent peristaltic waves {{exhibit_1}} may be seen and represent exaggerated gastric contractions attempting to move food beyond the obstruction. A thick, elongated pylorus visualized with abdominal ultrasonography is diagnostic, and pyloromyotomy is the definitive treatment.\n\n(Choice B) Midgut malrotation is a defect in the normal rotation of the midgut around the superior mesenteric artery in early gestation and can lead to volvulus of the small intestine. Although vomiting commonly occurs, the emesis is typically bilious, and infants are usually ill-appearing and hemodynamically unstable.\n\n(Choices C and E) Biliary cysts and biliary atresia (fibrous obliteration of the extrahepatic bile ducts) cause jaundice due to direct (conjugated) hyperbilirubinemia, which is not present in this patient. Moreover, these conditions do not typically cause vomiting.\n\n(Choice D) Intestinal atresia is caused by disruption of mesenteric blood vessels during embryologic development, leading to ischemic necrosis and resorption of the fetal bowel. Vomiting is a common presenting symptom, but it occurs within 48 hours of birth and the emesis is bilious.",
    "zh": "对于 3-6 周大的婴儿，非胆汁性呕吐和脱水体征（如囟门凹陷、黏膜干燥）提示患有婴儿肥厚性幽门狭窄。围绕幽门的环形平滑肌层肥大阻塞了胃出口，阻碍了胃内容物的通过，导致非胆汁性喷射性呕吐。呕吐通常发生在口服摄入后立即发生，婴儿在呕吐后通常会很快出现饥饿迹象。这种平滑肌异常产后生长的病因很可能是多因素的，涉及遗传因素（如家族史阳性）与环境暴露（如大环内酯类抗生素）的相互作用。\n\n如果诊断延迟，持续性呕吐会导致低氯性代谢性碱中毒，因为呕吐物中盐酸的流失。此外，血容量过低会激活肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统，醛固酮刺激肾脏排钾，导致低钾血症。由于脱水，非结合胆红素血症也很常见，这会增加胆红素的肝肠循环。\n\n对婴儿肥厚性幽门狭窄患者的检查通常显示，触诊可触及上腹部呈橄榄状的肥大肌肉肿块，尽管未触及并不能排除诊断。可见明显的蠕动波 {{exhibit_1}}，这可能代表胃收缩过度，试图将食物移过梗阻。通过腹部超声检查可见增厚、延长的幽门具有诊断意义，幽门肌切开术是明确的治疗方法。\n\n（选项 B）中肠旋转不良是中肠在早期妊娠期间围绕肠系膜上动脉正常旋转的缺陷，可导致小肠扭转。虽然常发生呕吐，但呕吐物通常为胆汁性，婴儿通常表现不佳且血流动力学不稳定。\n\n（选项 C 和 E）胆道囊肿和胆道闭锁（肝外胆管纤维性闭塞）引起黄疸，原因是直接（结合型）高胆红素血症，但该患者未出现。此外，这些情况通常不会引起呕吐。\n\n（选项 D）肠闭锁是由胚胎发育过程中肠系膜血管中断引起的，导致胎儿肠管缺血性坏死和吸收。呕吐是常见的首发症状，但通常在出生后 48 小时内发生，且呕吐物为胆汁性。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), including its presentation, pathophysiology, and associated lab findings. It requires differentiating IHPS from other causes of vomiting in infants based on clinical and laboratory features.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic presentation of nonbilious, projectile vomiting in a young infant with signs of dehydration and metabolic alkalosis.
