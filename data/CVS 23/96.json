    "en": "A 34-year-old man comes to the emergency department with fatigue and lightheadedness. The patient had an upper respiratory infection last week, and since then his energy level has been low with shortness of breath on mild exertion. Otherwise, his medical history is insignificant. He is a lifetime nonsmoker. The patient's temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg, and pulse is 120/min and regular. His pulse becomes undetectable to palpation during inspiration. The lungs are clear to auscultation, but the jugular veins are distended. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This presentation of hypotension, tachycardia, jugular venous distension with clear lungs, and pulsus paradoxus {{exhibit_1}} (manifesting as loss of palpable pulse during inspiration) is consistent with cardiac tamponade. This is most likely due to the patient's recent viral illness causing viral pericarditis with significant pericardial fluid accumulation. Normally there is a <10 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure during inspiration. Pulsus paraxocus refers to an abnormal exaggerated decrease in systolic blood pressure >10 mm Hg on inspiration, a common finding in patients with large pericardial effusions causing tamponade.\n\nInspiration causes an increase in systemic venous return, resulting in increased right heart volumes. Under normal conditions, this results in expansion of the right ventricle into the pericardial space with little impact on the left side of the heart. However, in conditions that impair expansion into the pericardial space (eg, cardiac tamponade), the increased right ventricular volume that occurs with inspiration leads to bowing of the interventricular septum toward the left ventricle. This leads to a decrease in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume and forward stroke volume, with a resultant decrease in systolic pressure during inspiration.\n\n(Choice A) Acute myocardial infarction typically presents with sudden onset of substernal discomfort, diaphoresis, and/or dyspnea, and can progress to cardiogenic shock (hypotension, tachycardia, jugular venous distension, and pulmonary edema). Patients can have weak or undetectable peripheral pulses; however, pulsus paradoxus is typically not seen.\n\n(Choice B) Acute viral myocarditis can lead to severe LV systolic dysfunction and present with acute congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Patients with severe LV failure can have pulsus alternans - a variation in pulse amplitude with alternate beats. Pulsus paradoxus is typically not seen in such patients.\n\n(Choice D) Pulsus paradoxus can also occur in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and (less frequently) constrictive pericarditis. Constrictive pericarditis is caused by scarring and loss of elasticity of the normal pericardial sac; it takes several weeks to months to develop and only rarely occurs after recurrent episodes of acute pericarditis.\n\n(Choice E) The initial stage of septic shock is a hyperdynamic circulatory state with lowered systemic vascular resistance and increased cardiac output (warm shock). Weak pulses and pulsus paradoxus would not be expected in such patients.\n\n(Choice F) In tension pneumothorax, breath sounds are typically absent on the affected side with hyperresonance to percussion. Other features of tension pneumothorax include tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, distended neck veins, and tracheal deviation to the contralateral side.\n\nEducational objective:\nCardiac tamponade typically presents with hypotension with pulsus paradoxus, elevated jugular venous pressure, and muffled heart sounds (Beck's triad). Pulsus paradoxus refers to an abnormal exaggerated decrease in systolic blood pressure >10 mm Hg on inspiration, and is a common finding in patients with pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade.",
    "zh": "这种低血压、心动过速、颈静脉扩张，肺部清晰，以及反常脉搏{{exhibit_1}}（表现为吸气时可触及脉搏消失）的临床表现与心脏压塞一致。这很可能是由于患者近期病毒感染导致病毒性心包炎，并伴有大量心包积液。正常情况下，吸气时收缩压降低<10 mmHg。反常脉搏是指吸气时收缩压异常过度降低>10 mmHg，这是心包积液导致心脏压塞患者的常见发现。\n\n吸气会导致体循环静脉回流增加，导致右心容量增加。在正常情况下，这会导致右心室扩张到心包腔内，对左心影响不大。然而，在影响心包腔内扩张的条件下（例如，心脏压塞），吸气时右心室容量增加会导致室间隔向左心室弯曲。这会导致左心室（LV）舒张末期容量和前向搏动量减少，导致吸气时收缩压下降。\n\n(选项 A) 急性心肌梗死通常表现为胸骨后不适、出汗和/或呼吸困难的突然发作，并可进展为心源性休克（低血压、心动过速、颈静脉扩张和肺水肿）。患者可有微弱或无法触及的外周脉搏；然而，通常不会出现反常脉搏。\n\n(选项 B) 急性病毒性心肌炎可导致严重的左心室收缩功能障碍，并表现为急性充血性心力衰竭和心源性休克。患有严重左心室衰竭的患者可出现交替脉搏——脉搏振幅在交替跳动中发生变化。此类患者通常不会出现反常脉搏。\n\n(选项 D) 反常脉搏也可能发生在哮喘、慢性阻塞性肺病患者中，以及（较少见）缩窄性心包炎中。缩窄性心包炎是由正常心包囊的瘢痕形成和弹性丧失引起的；它需要数周到数月的时间才能发展，并且很少发生在急性心包炎反复发作之后。\n\n(选项 E) 感染性休克的初始阶段是高动力循环状态，表现为全身血管阻力降低和心输出量增加（暖休克）。在这种患者中，不会出现微弱的脉搏和反常脉搏。\n\n(选项 F) 在张力性气胸中，患侧通常听不到呼吸音，叩诊呈过清音。张力性气胸的其他特征包括呼吸急促、心动过速、低血压、颈静脉扩张和气管向对侧偏离。\n\n教学目标：\n心脏压塞通常表现为低血压伴反常脉搏、颈静脉压升高和心音低钝（Beck三联征）。反常脉搏是指吸气时收缩压异常过度降低>10 mmHg，这是心包积液伴心脏压塞患者的常见发现。"
