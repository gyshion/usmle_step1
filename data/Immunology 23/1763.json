    "en": "A 3-year-old boy is being evaluated for persistent diarrhea. Although the patient seemed healthy at his 12-month well child visit, since then he has experienced 4 episodes of otitis media and 3 episodes of pneumococcal pneumonia. He was at the 50th percentile for weight and height at 12 months but is now at the 25th percentile for height and 10th percentile for weight. The patient is referred for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and Giardia lamblia is isolated from duodenal aspirates. Further workup shows very low serum levels of all immunoglobulin types. Flow cytometry of this patient's peripheral blood is most likely to show a near absence of cells bearing which of the following markers?",
    "zh": "一名3岁男孩正在接受评估，因为他持续腹泻。虽然该患者在12个月大的时候的体检中看起来很健康，但从那时起，他经历了4次中耳炎和3次肺炎链球菌性肺炎。他在12个月大的时候体重和身高位于第50百分位数，但现在身高位于第25百分位数，体重位于第10百分位数。该患者被转诊进行上消化内镜检查，并且从十二指肠抽吸物中分离出兰伯贾第虫。进一步检查显示所有免疫球蛋白类型的血清水平都非常低。该患者的外周血的流式细胞术最有可能显示携带以下哪种标记物的细胞几乎不存在？"

    "en": "This patient's recurrent sinopulmonary infections, Giardia lamblia gastroenteritis, failure to thrive, and low immunoglobulin levels are suggestive of X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). In this condition, a mutation in the Bruton tyrosine kinase gene causes failure of bone marrow pre-B cells to develop into mature B cells, a step necessary for B cells to leave the bone marrow and enter the peripheral circulation.\n\nPatients with XLA have low or absent B cells in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues and pan-hypogammaglobulinemia (ie, very low IgG, IgM, and IgA). As a result, they are at increased risk of infection with pyogenic (encapsulated) bacteria. Patients also have increased susceptibility to certain viral and parasitic infections, such as enteroviruses and Giardia lamblia, due to the absence of opsonizing and neutralizing antibodies.\n\nFlow cytometry can be used to assess the number of circulating B cells by using fluorescent tags that bind to specific B cell surface proteins such as CD19, CD20, and CD21.\n\n(Choices A and B) CD4 is a helper T cell surface marker, and CD8 is a cytotoxic T cell surface marker. Both B cells and T cells can be deficient in patients with certain forms of severe combined immunodeficiency. However, these patients typically have failure to thrive, persistent mucosal candidiasis, and severe infections with opportunistic organisms (eg, Pneumocystis) at a much younger age (~6 months).\n\n(Choice C) CD15 is a cell surface protein present on granulocytes. It is also present on nearly all Reed-Sternberg cells and is therefore a cytologic marker useful in the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n(Choice D) CD16 is a low-affinity Fc receptor found on the surface of natural killer cells, neutrophils, and macrophages.\n\nEducational objective:\nX-linked agammaglobulinemia is characterized by low or absent circulating mature B cells (ie, CD19+, CD20+ CD22+) and pan-hypogammaglobulinemia. Affected patients have increased susceptibility to pyogenic bacteria, enteroviruses, and Giardia lamblia due to the absence of opsonizing and neutralizing antibodies.",
    "zh": "该患者反复出现鼻窦肺部感染、兰伯贾第虫性胃肠炎、生长迟缓和免疫球蛋白水平低，提示X连锁无丙种球蛋白血症(XLA)。在这种情况下，Bruton酪氨酸激酶基因的突变导致骨髓前B细胞无法发育成成熟的B细胞，这是B细胞离开骨髓并进入外周循环的必要步骤。\n\nXLA患者外周血和淋巴组织中B细胞低或缺失，并出现全丙种球蛋白血症(即，IgG、IgM和IgA非常低)。因此，他们感染化脓性(包膜)细菌的风险增加。由于缺乏调理素和中和抗体，患者也更容易感染某些病毒和寄生虫感染，例如肠道病毒和兰伯贾第虫。\n\n流式细胞术可用于通过使用与特定B细胞表面蛋白(如CD19、CD20和CD21)结合的荧光标记来评估循环B细胞的数量。\n\n(选项A和B) CD4是辅助性T细胞表面标志物，CD8是细胞毒性T细胞表面标志物。患有某些严重联合免疫缺陷病的患者，B细胞和T细胞都可能出现缺陷。然而，这些患者通常会出现生长迟缓、持续性黏膜念珠菌病，并在更年轻的年龄(~6个月)发生机会性生物(如肺孢子虫)的严重感染。\n\n(选项C) CD15是一种存在于粒细胞上的细胞表面蛋白。它也存在于几乎所有Reed-Sternberg细胞上，因此是用于诊断霍奇金淋巴瘤的细胞学标志物。\n\n(选项D) CD16是一种低亲和力的Fc受体，存在于自然杀伤细胞、中性粒细胞和巨噬细胞的表面。\n\n教育目标：\nX连锁无丙种球蛋白血症的特征是循环成熟B细胞(即，CD19+、CD20+ CD22+)低或缺失，以及全丙种球蛋白血症。受影响的患者由于缺乏调理素和中和抗体，更容易感染化脓性细菌、肠道病毒和兰伯贾第虫。"
