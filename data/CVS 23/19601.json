    "en": "The patient is experiencing a hypertensive emergency (BP ≥180/120 mmHg) with evidence of end-organ damage (ST-segment changes on ECG). Labetalol is a nonselective beta blocker that blocks beta-1, beta-2, and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. Alpha-1 receptor blockade outweighs beta-2 receptor blockade in vascular smooth muscle to cause peripheral vasodilation of both venules and arterioles. Venular vasodilation decreases venous return and arteriolar vasodilation decreases systemic vascular resistance (SVR); because the vasodilation is relatively balanced, blood pressure is reduced with stroke volume unchanged. Normally, reduced blood pressure stimulates a baroreceptor reflex-mediated increase in heart rate, but the strong beta-1 receptor blockade of labetalol overrides this response, causing overall decreased heart rate. Hydralazine is an arterial vasodilator that has little effect on veins. Nitroprusside is a nitric oxide donor that causes balanced arterial and venous vasodilation. Phentolamine is a nonselective alpha receptor blocker that also causes balanced vasodilation. All these drugs reduce blood pressure primarily via a reduction in SVR, but they have no negative chronotropic effects and are associated with a baroreceptor reflex-mediated increase in heart rate. Stroke volume is increased with hydralazine, and unchanged with the balanced vasodilation that occurs with nitroprusside and phentolamine. Metoprolol is a cardioselective beta blocker that primarily blocks beta-1 receptors; it causes slight blockade of beta-2 receptors and has no effect on alpha receptors. Metoprolol causes no significant change in SVR but facilitates a mild reduction in blood pressure due to a decrease in contractility and heart rate that reduces stroke volume and cardiac output.",
    "zh": "患者正经历高血压危象（血压≥180/120 mmHg），并有靶器官损害的证据（心电图上ST段改变）。拉贝洛尔是一种非选择性β受体阻滞剂，可阻断β-1、β-2和α-1肾上腺素能受体。α-1受体阻滞在血管平滑肌中优于β-2受体阻滞，导致静脉和小动脉的周围血管舒张。静脉舒张减少静脉回流，小动脉舒张降低全身血管阻力 (SVR)；由于血管舒张相对平衡，血压降低，而每搏输出量不变。通常，血压降低会刺激由压力感受器反射介导的心率增加，但拉贝洛尔的强效β-1受体阻滞会抵消这种反应，导致总体心率降低。肼苯哒嗪是一种动脉血管扩张剂，对静脉影响很小。硝普钠是一种一氧化氮供体，可引起动脉和静脉的平衡舒张。酚妥拉明是一种非选择性α受体阻滞剂，也可引起平衡血管舒张。所有这些药物主要通过降低SVR来降低血压，但它们没有负性变时作用，并且与压力感受器反射介导的心率增加有关。肼苯哒嗪会增加每搏输出量，而硝普钠和酚妥拉明引起的平衡血管舒张则保持不变。美托洛尔是一种心脏选择性β受体阻滞剂，主要阻断β-1受体；它会导致β-2受体轻微阻滞，并且对α受体没有影响。美托洛尔不会导致SVR发生显着变化，但由于心肌收缩力和心率降低，导致每搏输出量和心输出量减少，从而促进血压的轻度降低。"
