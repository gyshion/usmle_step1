    "en": "A 52-year-old woman comes to the office due to fatigue for the last 2 weeks. The patient was previously healthy, but over the past 3 months, she has had significant weight loss without changing her diet. She also reports increased sweating, hand tremor, and decreased sleep. Examination shows diffuse, nontender enlargement of the thyroid gland. The eyeballs are protuberant. The remainder of the examination is notable for 1+ pitting edema in the ankles. Which of the following parameters is most likely to be decreased in this patient? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient with an enlarged thyroid gland and multiple consistent symptoms (eg, fatigue, unintentional weight loss, sweating, tremor, insomnia) most likely has HYPERTHYROIDISM. Protruberance of the eyeballs (ie, exophthalmos) suggests Graves disease, specifically.\n\nIn adults, the major effect of thyroid hormone is control of cellular metabolism, including the rate of oxygen consumption and use of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. As a result, hyperthyroidism causes characteristic cardiovascular effects:\n\n*   Increased metabolic demand in the peripheral tissues, combined with a direct effect of thyroid hormone on vascular smooth muscle, causes peripheral vasodilation, which leads to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and reduced diastolic blood pressure.\n*   Thyroid hormone has a direct sympathetic-like effect on the myocardium, which stimulates increased heart rate and contractility (Choice A). A reflexive response to decreased SVR also contributes to these changes. With increased contractility, stroke volume is increased, resulting in increased pulse pressure and systolic blood pressure (Choices D and F). Ejection fraction and cardiac output are also increased.\n\nOver time, some patients develop high-output heart failure due to the hyperdynamic circulatory state. Restoration of a euthyroid state normalizes cardiovascular hemodynamics and typically resolves any heart failure that has developed.\n\n(Choice B) Myocardial oxygen consumption increases in hyperthyroidism, caused by a direct effect of thyroid hormone and by hemodynamic changes that increase myocardial oxygen demand (ie, increased heart rate, contractility, and afterload [systolic blood pressure]).\n\n(Choice C) Both diastolic and systolic pulmonary artery pressures increase in hyperthyroidism. This is likely because cardiac output increases, but the pulmonary circulation does not undergo the same vasodilation and reduction in resistance that occurs in the systemic circulation (pressure = cardiac output × resistance).\n\nEducational objective:\nHyperthyroidism causes characteristic cardiovascular changes. Increased metabolic demand in the tissues and a direct vasodilatory effect of thyroid hormone lead to reduced systemic vascular resistance (and decreased diastolic blood pressure). A direct sympathetic-like effect of thyroid hormone on the myocardium leads to increased heart rate, contractility, and cardiac output. Increased stroke volume increases pulse pressure and systolic blood pressure.",
    "zh": "该患者甲状腺增大并伴有多发一致的症状（如：疲劳、非意向性体重减轻、出汗、震颤、失眠），最有可能患有甲状腺功能亢进症。眼球突出（即，眼球突出）提示格雷夫斯病。\n\n在成人中，甲状腺激素的主要作用是控制细胞代谢，包括耗氧率以及蛋白质、碳水化合物和脂质的利用。因此，甲状腺功能亢进症会导致特征性的心血管效应：\n\n*   外周组织代谢需求增加，加上甲状腺激素对血管平滑肌的直接作用，引起外周血管舒张，导致全身血管阻力（SVR）降低和舒张压降低。\n*   甲状腺激素对心肌具有类似交感神经的作用，可刺激心率和收缩力增加（选项A）。对SVR降低的反射性反应也有助于这些变化。随着收缩力增加，每搏输出量增加，导致脉压和收缩压升高（选项D和F）。射血分数和心输出量也会增加。\n\n随着时间的推移，一些患者会因高动力循环状态而发生高输出量心力衰竭。恢复甲状腺功能正常状态可使心血管血流动力学正常化，并且通常会解决已经发生的心力衰竭。\n\n（选项B）心肌耗氧量在甲状腺功能亢进症中增加，这由甲状腺激素的直接作用以及增加心肌耗氧量（即，心率、收缩力和后负荷[收缩压]增加）的血流动力学变化引起。\n\n（选项C）舒张期和收缩期肺动脉压在甲状腺功能亢进症中均升高。这可能是因为心输出量增加，但肺循环不会像全身循环那样发生相同的血管舒张和阻力降低（压力=心输出量×阻力）。\n\n教学目标：\n甲状腺功能亢进症会导致特征性的心血管变化。组织代谢需求增加和甲状腺激素的直接血管舒张作用导致全身血管阻力降低（和舒张压降低）。甲状腺激素对心肌的直接类似交感神经作用导致心率、收缩力和心输出量增加。每搏输出量增加会增加脉压和收缩压。"
