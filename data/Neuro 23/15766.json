    "en": "A 62-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to right upper extremity weakness. Thirty minutes ago, the patient was at his office when he developed difficulty holding a pen. His grip in the right hand was weak and he could not lift his right arm. He tried calling his coworker but could not speak. The patient has never had similar symptoms before. He had no loss of consciousness, weakness of other extremities, vision abnormality, or headache. The symptoms resolved spontaneously by the time paramedics arrived. Medical history is significant for hypertension and a 30-pack-year smoking history. The patient is a defense attorney and recently took on a high-profile case. Temperature is 36.9 C (98.4 F), blood pressure is 140/84 mm Hg, pulse is 82/min and regular, and respirations are 14/min. Physical examination shows no extremity weakness or sensory loss. There is a left carotid bruit; the remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Noncontrast CT scan of the head is normal.",

    "en": "This patient with cardiovascular risk factors (ie, hypertension, smoking) and a carotid bruit developed right upper extremity weakness and aphasia that resolved without intervention; this is characteristic of a TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK (TIA), which, in this case, likely occurred following atheroembolization or low flow from the patient's carotid artery lesion. TIAs are defined as focal neurologic deficits that occur due to transient brain ischemia; tissue infarction does not occur, and brain imaging is normal. Symptoms are typically localized to a singular vascular territory and resolve without intervention, typically in <24 hours.\n\nPatients with TIA are at markedly increased risk of future stroke; therefore, intensive medical management is indicated. Secondary prevention includes antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel) to prevent thrombus formation and statin therapy (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor; eg, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin) to reduce atherosclerotic plaque formation. Lifestyle modifications (eg, exercise, tobacco cessation) are also recommended.\n\n(Choice A) CNS-targeted immunomodulators (eg, ocrelizumab) or glucocorticoids are used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease that causes relapsing and remitting neurologic deficits. However, MS typically occurs in young women and neurologic deficits are slowly progressive over the course of days.\n\n(Choice B) Benzodiazepines (GABA A receptor modulators) are used for acute seizure termination. Seizures can cause postictal paralysis but are typically preceded by stereotyped positive symptoms (eg, repetitive limb movement, lip smacking), whereas TIAs often typically cause negative symptoms (eg, loss of limb function, aphasia). In addition, seizure patients often have postictal confusion or sedation.\n\n(Choice D) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are used for treating anxiety or depression.\n\n(Choice E) Tissue plasminogen activator [tPA]; eg, alteplase) is used for thrombolysis in patients with acute, potentially debilitating, ischemic stroke, which would present with persistent neurologic deficits. TPA is not indicated as this patient's symptoms resolved without intervention.",
    "zh": "该患者具有心血管危险因素（即高血压、吸烟）和颈动脉杂音，出现右侧上肢无力和失语，无需干预即可缓解；这是一种短暂性脑缺血发作（TIA）的特征，在这种情况下，TIA很可能发生在来自患者颈动脉病变的动脉粥样硬化栓塞或低血流之后。TIA定义为由于短暂性脑缺血而发生的局灶性神经功能缺损；未发生组织梗死，脑部影像学检查正常。症状通常局限于单一血管区域，无需干预即可缓解，通常在24小时内。\n\nTIA患者未来发生卒中的风险显着增加；因此，需要进行强化医学治疗。二级预防包括抗血小板药物（如阿司匹林、氯吡格雷）以防止血栓形成和他汀类药物（HMG-CoA还原酶抑制剂；如阿托伐他汀、瑞舒伐他汀）以减少动脉粥样硬化斑块形成。还建议进行生活方式改变（如锻炼、戒烟）。\n\n（选项A）CNS靶向免疫调节剂（如奥瑞珠单抗）或糖皮质激素用于治疗多发性硬化症（MS），这是一种导致复发和缓解神经功能缺损的脱髓鞘疾病。然而，MS通常发生在年轻女性中，并且神经功能缺损在几天内缓慢进展。\n\n（选项B）苯二氮卓类药物（GABA A受体调节剂）用于急性发作的终止。癫痫发作可引起痫后麻痹，但通常先于刻板的阳性症状（如重复肢体运动、咂嘴），而TIA通常引起阴性症状（如肢体功能丧失、失语）。此外，癫痫患者通常有痫后意识模糊或镇静。\n\n（选项D）选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂用于治疗焦虑或抑郁症。\n\n（选项E）组织型纤溶酶原激活剂[tPA；如阿替普酶]用于治疗急性、可能使人衰弱的缺血性卒中患者，这些患者会出现持续的神经功能缺损。由于该患者的症状无需干预即可缓解，因此不适用tPA。"

It requires understanding the underlying pathophysiology of TIA and the appropriate pharmacotherapy to prevent further atherothrombotic events.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's presentation as a TIA based on the transient neurological deficits and risk factors.
