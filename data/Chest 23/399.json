    "en": "A 47-year-old man comes to the office due to worsening shortness of breath for several months. The patient has no fever, weight loss, or cough. He has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are normal. Pulmonary examination demonstrates wheezing and poor air movement. Laboratory results are as follows:\n\nPlatelets 160,000/mm³\nLeukocytes 6.500/mm³\nCreatinine 0.8 mg/dL\nTotal bilirubin 1.3 mg/dL\nAspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) 112 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (SGPT) 124 U/L\n\nA liver biopsy is subsequently performed. Light microscopy of the tissue specimen after treatment with diastase and periodic acid–Schiff staining is shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}. Given these findings, which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's shortness of breath?",

    "en": "This patient has alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, an autosomal codominant disorder that can affect the lungs and liver. Produced primarily in the liver, AAT is a serum protein that inhibits several different proteolytic enzymes (in particular, neutrophil elastase), thereby reducing tissue damage caused by inflammation. Most patients with AAT deficiency are homozygous for the Z allele, which causes decreased secretion of AAT secondary to abnormal protein folding.\n\nIndividuals with AAT deficiency classically develop early-onset panacinar emphysema due to unchecked destruction of the interalveolar septa (which contain large amounts of elastin). Smoking plays a synergistic role in the disease process by inducing lung inflammation and permanently inactivating AAT through oxidation of a crucial methionine residue. Therefore, smokers with AAT deficiency tend to develop dyspnea at a median age of 36 versus a median age of 51 in nonsmokers.\n\nPatients with particular genetic mutations (including the Z allele) are at risk for developing liver disease due to intrahepatocyte accumulation of polymerized AAT molecules; cirrhosis is the second most common cause of death behind emphysema in patients with AAT deficiency. Histologically, intracellular granules of unsecreted AAT are seen within the periportal hepatocytes. These globules resist digestion by diastase (an enzyme that breaks down glycogen) and appear reddish-pink with the periodic acid–Schiff stain {{exhibit_2}} in the periportal hepatocytes.\n\n(Choice A) Bronchial hyperreactivity is a hallmark of chronic asthma.\n\n(Choice C) Interstitial infiltration is a finding in interstitial pneumonitis.\n\n(Choice D) Intraalveolar substance accumulation is a finding in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.\n\n(Choice E) Pulmonary congestion is a finding in congestive heart failure.\n\n(Choice F) Pulmonary vascular obstruction occurs in pulmonary embolism or vasculopathy.\n\nEducational objective:\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a serum protein that inhibits neutrophil elastase, thereby reducing tissue damage caused by inflammation. Patients with AAT deficiency typically develop early-onset emphysema; those with specific mutations (including the Z allele) are also at risk for liver disease due to accumulation of unsecreted, polymerized AAT (reddish-pink globules on periodic acid–Schiff stain) in the periportal hepatocytes. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者患有α-1抗胰蛋白酶(AAT)缺乏症，这是一种常染色体共显性遗传病，可影响肺和肝脏。AAT主要在肝脏中产生，是一种血清蛋白，可抑制几种不同的蛋白水解酶（特别是中性粒细胞弹性蛋白酶），从而减少炎症引起的组织损伤。大多数AAT缺乏症患者是Z基因的纯合子，该基因导致AAT分泌减少，继发于蛋白质折叠异常。\n\nAAT缺乏症患者通常由于肺泡间隔不受控制的破坏（其中含有大量弹性蛋白）而发生早发性泛小叶肺气肿。吸烟在疾病过程中起协同作用，通过诱导肺部炎症和通过关键甲硫氨酸残基的氧化而永久性地灭活AAT。因此，AAT缺乏症的吸烟者往往在36岁的中位年龄出现呼吸困难，而非吸烟者则为51岁。\n\n具有特定基因突变（包括Z基因）的患者由于聚合的AAT分子在肝细胞内积聚而有发生肝病的风险；肝硬化是AAT缺乏症患者仅次于肺气肿的第二大死亡原因。组织学上，在门静脉周围肝细胞内可见未分泌的AAT的细胞内颗粒。这些小球耐受淀粉酶（一种分解糖原的酶）的消化，并在门静脉周围肝细胞的过碘酸-希夫染色中呈现红粉色{{exhibit_2}}。\n\n(选项A) 支气管高反应性是慢性哮喘的标志。\n\n(选项C) 间质浸润是间质性肺炎的发现。\n\n(选项D) 肺泡内物质积聚是肺泡蛋白沉着症的发现。\n\n(选项E) 肺充血是充血性心力衰竭的发现。\n\n(选项F) 肺血管阻塞发生在肺栓塞或血管病变中。\n\n教育目标：\nα-1抗胰蛋白酶(AAT)是一种血清蛋白，可抑制中性粒细胞弹性蛋白酶，从而减少炎症引起的组织损伤。AAT缺乏症患者通常会发生早发性肺气肿；具有特定突变（包括Z基因）的患者也因未分泌的聚合AAT（过碘酸-希夫染色呈红粉色小球）在门静脉周围肝细胞中积聚而有发生肝病的风险。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}"
