    "en": "This child has an infantile hemangioma, a common, benign vascular tumor composed of closely packed capillaries. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nInfantile hemangiomas are not usually apparent at birth and typically present in the first few days to weeks of life as bright red, raised, and sharply demarcated plaques. They can arise anywhere in the body and usually occur as a single lesion on the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Less commonly, multiple cutaneous hemangiomas may be present, increasing the risk for visceral (eg, hepatic) lesions.\n\nThe natural progression of hemangiomas begins with proliferation in infancy due to growth of blood vessels within the hemangioma. Following the proliferative phase, an involution phase occurs, in which the lesion spontaneously regresses (Choice B). During involution, the hemangioma dulls in color and softens, eventually resulting in complete resolution in early childhood in most cases.\n\n(Choice C) Port-wine stain, or nevus flammeus, is a capillary malformation that begins as a flat, unilateral pink patch that grows proportionally with the child and may evolve into a deep purple, thickened, nodular lesion. Port-wine stains do not regress in size.\n\n(Choice D) Nevus simplex is a flat, pink, blanching vascular lesion that commonly occurs on the eyelids, forehead, and nape of the neck. These lesions are benign and typically regress in early childhood.\n\n(Choice E) A cherry angioma is a vascular lesion characterized by a proliferation of capillaries that remain stable in size. However, this lesion is typically small (<0.5 cm) and develops in older adults, not infants.\n\nEducational objective:\nInfantile hemangioma is a common, benign vascular tumor that presents soon after birth as a bright red, raised, sharply demarcated plaque. The natural course of hemangiomas is proliferation in infancy followed by regression in early childhood. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "该儿童患有婴儿血管瘤，这是一种常见的良性血管肿瘤，由紧密排列的毛细血管组成。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n婴儿血管瘤通常在出生时不可见，通常在出生后几周内表现为鲜红色、隆起且边界清晰的斑块。它们可以出现在身体的任何部位，通常作为单个病灶出现在皮肤和皮下组织上。不太常见的是，可能存在多个皮肤血管瘤，从而增加了内脏（例如肝脏）病变的风险。\n\n血管瘤的自然病程始于婴儿期的增殖，这是由于血管瘤内血管的生长所致。在增殖期之后，会发生退化期，其中病灶自发消退（选项 B）。在退化期间，血管瘤颜色变暗并软化，最终在大多数情况下于儿童早期完全消退。\n\n（选项 C）葡萄酒色斑，或火焰痣，是一种毛细血管畸形，开始时为扁平的、单侧的粉红色斑块，与儿童成比例地生长，并可能演变成深紫色、增厚、结节状的病灶。葡萄酒色斑不会缩小。\n\n（选项 D）单纯性痣是一种扁平、粉红色、变白的血管病变，通常发生在眼睑、前额和颈后。这些病变是良性的，通常在儿童早期消退。\n\n（选项 E）樱桃血管瘤是一种血管病变，其特征是毛细血管增生，但其大小保持稳定。然而，这种病变通常很小（<0.5 cm），并且发生在老年人身上，而不是婴儿。\n\n教育目标：\n婴儿血管瘤是一种常见的良性血管肿瘤，在出生后不久表现为鲜红色、隆起、边界清晰的斑块。血管瘤的自然病程是婴儿期增殖，然后在儿童早期消退。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"
