    "en": "Lung cancer has been the leading cause of cancer mortality in both women and men in the United States since the 1980s. Tobacco use (primary and secondhand) is the most important cause of lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer. Female use of cigarettes peaked in 1955, and mortality rates increased 20-50 years after smoking onset. Lung cancer mortality began to decrease after 2000, corresponding to a decline in tobacco use.\n\nTobacco is a causative factor for numerous other cancers (eg, leukemia, nasopharyngeal, larynx, esophagus, pancreas, cervix, colon). It is directly carcinogenic to tissue by causing irritation and inflammation of the body's natural protective barriers. Patient education about tobacco's harmful effects is extremely important, as smoking cessation for even longtime users can be beneficial for reducing cancer risk and improving life expectancy.\n\n(Choice B) Breast cancer is the most common non-skin cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death among women in the United States. Mortality from breast cancer began to decrease in the 1990s. Increased use of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation and more frequent breast cancer screening are likely contributing factors to this decline.\n\n(Choice C) Colon cancer mortality has decreased since the 1950s due to advances in surgical technique and adjuvant chemotherapy. Additional protective factors may include colorectal cancer screening, menopausal hormone therapy in women, and aspirin use.\n\n(Choice D) The incidence and mortality of pancreatic cancer have increased in women over the last century and recently became the fourth most common cause of cancer death in women. Pancreatic cancer trends, like those of lung cancer, follow the pattern of increased smoking in women. However, lung cancer is responsible for three times more deaths than pancreatic cancer in women.\n\n(Choice E) Stomach cancer incidence and mortality decreased drastically over the first half of the twentieth century. Proposed reasons include advances in refrigeration and food preservation (leading to decreased salt intake), and better sanitation and more adequate housing (reducing Helicobacter pylori infection rates).\n\nEducational objective:\nBetween 1950 and 2000, rising rates of tobacco use resulted in an increase in female lung cancer incidence and mortality. Lung cancer is currently the most common cause of cancer death in both women and men in the United States.",
    "zh": "自20世纪80年代以来，肺癌一直是美国男女癌症死亡的主要原因。烟草使用（一手烟和二手烟）是肺癌最重要的病因，尤其是非小细胞肺癌。女性吸烟量在1955年达到顶峰，死亡率在吸烟开始后20-50年增加。2000年后，肺癌死亡率开始下降，这与烟草使用量的下降相对应。\n\n烟草是多种其他癌症的致病因素（例如，白血病、鼻咽癌、喉癌、食道癌、胰腺癌、宫颈癌、结肠癌）。它通过引起身体自然保护屏障的刺激和炎症，直接对组织产生致癌作用。关于烟草有害影响的患者教育非常重要，因为即使是长期吸烟者戒烟也有利于降低患癌风险和提高预期寿命。\n\n（选项B）乳腺癌是最常见的非皮肤癌，也是美国女性癌症死亡的第二大原因。乳腺癌死亡率从20世纪90年代开始下降。辅助化疗和/或放疗的增加以及更频繁的乳腺癌筛查可能是导致这种下降的因素。\n\n（选项C）自20世纪50年代以来，由于外科技术的进步和辅助化疗的发展，结肠癌的死亡率有所下降。其他保护因素可能包括结直肠癌筛查、女性更年期激素治疗和阿司匹林的使用。\n\n（选项D）过去一个世纪以来，女性胰腺癌的发病率和死亡率有所增加，最近成为女性癌症死亡的第四大常见原因。胰腺癌的趋势，与肺癌一样，遵循女性吸烟量增加的模式。然而，女性肺癌导致的死亡人数是胰腺癌的三倍。\n\n（选项E）胃癌的发病率和死亡率在20世纪上半叶急剧下降。可能的原因包括冷藏和食物保藏技术的进步（导致盐摄入量减少），以及更好的卫生条件和更充足的住房（降低幽门螺杆菌感染率）。\n\n教育目标：\n1950年至2000年间，烟草使用率上升导致女性肺癌的发病率和死亡率增加。肺癌目前是美国男女最常见的癌症死亡原因。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to interpret cancer mortality trends in women and correlate them with known risk factors, specifically focusing on lung cancer and tobacco use. It requires understanding the temporal relationship between smoking habits and lung cancer mortality rates.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to recognize the historical trends of tobacco use and its impact on lung cancer mortality.
