    "en": "A 68-year-old woman comes to the emergency department for evaluation of stroke-like symptoms. The patient says her face appeared \"twisted\" this morning but was normal when she went to bed last night. Her brother recently had a stroke, and she was worried that she may also be having a stroke. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows facial asymmetry with drooping of the left corner of the mouth and loss of the left nasolabial fold. Which of the following additional examination findings on the affected side would be most suggestive of central nervous system involvement?",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is E. The patient presents with unilateral facial weakness, which can be caused by either a central nervous system lesion (e.g., stroke) or a peripheral nerve lesion (e.g., Bell palsy). Central nervous system lesions affecting the motor cortex or descending tracts typically cause contralateral lower facial weakness. However, the nuclei that innervate the upper face receive bilateral input from the motor cortices. Therefore, movement of the upper facial muscles (e.g., forehead, brow) is often spared in central lesions. Peripheral nerve lesions, such as Bell palsy, affect the entire facial nerve (CN VII) and result in unilateral weakness of the entire half of the face, including the forehead. The patient's facial asymmetry with drooping of the left corner of the mouth and loss of the left nasolabial fold indicates weakness of the lower face. The question asks for a finding most suggestive of central nervous system involvement. Sparing of the forehead muscles on the affected side is characteristic of a central lesion. \n\n(Choices A, C, and D) Patients with facial nerve lesions (both central and peripheral) can have decreased eye lacrimation (due to loss of parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal gland), hyperacusis (due to weakness of the stapedius muscle), and decreased sensation of taste over the ipsilateral anterior two-thirds of the tongue (which is innervated by the chorda tympani nerve, a branch of the facial nerve). Therefore, these findings are not specific for central nervous system involvement and can be seen in peripheral lesions as well.\n\n(Choice B) The platysma muscle, responsible for tensing the skin on the neck, is also innervated by the facial nerve. Weakness of this muscle would be expected in both central and peripheral lesions affecting the facial nerve pathway. \n\nKey clinical pearls: Differentiating between central and peripheral facial nerve palsies is crucial. Remember that the forehead receives bilateral cortical innervation, so forehead sparing suggests a central lesion. Conversely, involvement of the entire hemiface, including the forehead, suggests a peripheral lesion.",
    "zh": "正确答案是E。患者表现为单侧面部无力，这可能是由中枢神经系统病变（例如，卒中）或周围神经病变（例如，贝尔氏麻痹）引起的。影响运动皮质或下行束的中枢神经系统病变通常会导致对侧下面部无力。然而，支配上面部的核团接收来自运动皮质的双侧输入。因此，在上部面部肌肉（例如，额头、眉毛）的运动中，中枢病变通常会保留。周围神经病变，例如贝尔氏麻痹，会影响整个面神经（脑神经VII），并导致整个半侧面部（包括额头）的单侧无力。患者的面部不对称，左嘴角下垂和左侧鼻唇沟消失，表明下面部无力。问题询问的是最提示中枢神经系统受累的发现。受累侧额肌不受影响是中枢病变的特征。\n\n（选项A、C和D）面神经损伤（包括中枢和周围）的患者可能出现泪液分泌减少（由于迷走神经对泪腺的支配丧失）、听觉过敏（由于镫骨肌无力）和舌同侧前三分之二味觉减退（由鼓索神经支配，鼓索神经是面神经的一个分支）。因此，这些发现并非中枢神经系统受累特异性，也可见于周围神经病变。\n\n（选项B）负责收紧颈部皮肤的颈阔肌也由面神经支配。这种肌肉的无力预计在中枢和周围病变中都会影响面神经通路。\n\n关键临床要点：区分中枢性和周围性面神经麻痹至关重要。请记住，额头接收双侧皮质支配，因此额头不受影响提示中枢病变。相反，整个半侧面部（包括额头）受累提示周围病变。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to differentiate between central and peripheral causes of facial weakness based on examination findings. It assesses knowledge of the innervation patterns of facial muscles and the implications for localization of neurological lesions.\n\nTo solve this question, one must understand the concept of bilateral versus unilateral cortical innervation of facial muscles. By identifying which facial movements are spared or affected, one can infer whether the lesion is central (e.g., stroke) or peripheral (e.g., Bell palsy).",
