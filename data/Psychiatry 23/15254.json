    "en": "A 22-year-old man is brought to the office by his mother due to a change in behavior over the past year. Nine months ago, the patient abruptly decided to quit college in his last year and insisted on moving back home to \"work on my research without being disturbed.\" Since then, he has stopped going out with friends, seems uninterested in his usual hobbies of playing and watching football, and spends hours on his computer researching government cover-ups. He stays up late at night, sleeps during the day, and showers only once a week. The patient has no motivation to look for work; his mother reports that when she encourages him to go back to school or work, he becomes agitated and starts accusing her of \"being one of the black suits.\" Physical examination shows poor hygiene but is otherwise normal. Laboratory evaluation, including urine drug screen, is unremarkable.",
    "zh": "一位22岁男性由其母亲带到诊室，原因是过去一年行为发生了改变。九个月前，该患者突然决定从大学最后一年退学，并坚持搬回家“不受干扰地做我的研究”。从那以后，他不再与朋友外出，对玩和看足球等爱好似乎也失去了兴趣，并且花几个小时在电脑上研究政府掩盖真相的事情。他熬夜很晚，白天睡觉，并且一周只洗一次澡。患者没有找工作的动力；他的母亲报告说，当她鼓励他重返学校或工作时，他变得焦躁不安，并开始指责她“是黑衣人之一”。体格检查显示卫生状况差，但其他方面正常。实验室评估，包括尿液药物筛查，无异常。"

    "en": "This patient's paranoid delusions and negative symptoms (eg, loss of motivation, social withdrawal, decreased attention to personal hygiene) lasting >6 months are consistent with SCHIZOPHRENIA, a psychotic disorder with typical onset in early adulthood. Progressive functional impairment is common, as illustrated by this patient's academic and occupational dysfunction.\n\nAntipsychotic medications are first-line pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia. The primary mechanism of action of antipsychotics is ANTAGONISM at postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptors. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have the additional property of serotonin type 2 receptor antagonism, and some SGAs (eg, aripiprazole) also act as D2 receptor partial agonists.\n\n(Choice A) Alpha receptor agonism is the mechanism of action of a variety of medications (eg, vasopressors, nasal decongestants), but it does not play a role in the therapeutic action of antipsychotics.\n\n(Choices C and F) Dopamine reuptake inhibition, usually in combination with norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, is the mechanism of action of medications used in the treatment of ADHD (eg, methylphenidate, bupropion).\n\n(Choice D) Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonism is the mechanism of action of ethanol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and propofol.\n\n(Choice E) Antihistamines are not a first-line treatment for schizophrenia. They are primarily used in the treatment of allergic conditions.\n\n(Choice G) Serotonin reuptake inhibition is the mechanism of action of antidepressant medications, which are primarily used in the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders. Although patients with schizophrenia often experience mood and anxiety symptoms, antidepressant medication would not effectively target this patient's psychotic symptoms.\n\nEducational objective: Antipsychotic medications are first-line pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia. Their primary mechanism of action is D2 receptor antagonism.",
    "zh": "该患者的妄想症和阴性症状（例如，缺乏动力、社交退缩、对个人卫生的关注度下降）持续超过6个月，与精神分裂症一致，这是一种精神病性疾病，通常在成年早期发病。进行性功能障碍很常见，正如该患者的学业和职业功能障碍所说明的那样。\n\n抗精神病药物是治疗精神分裂症的一线药物。抗精神病药物的主要作用机制是拮抗突触后多巴胺D2受体。第二代抗精神病药（SGAs）具有额外的血清素2型受体拮抗特性，一些SGAs（例如，阿立哌唑）也充当D2受体部分激动剂。\n\n（选项A）α受体激动是多种药物（例如，血管加压药、鼻腔减充血剂）的作用机制，但它在抗精神病药物的治疗作用中不起作用。\n\n（选项C和F）多巴胺再摄取抑制，通常与去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制相结合，是用于治疗ADHD的药物（例如，哌甲酯、安非他酮）的作用机制。\n\n（选项D）γ-氨基丁酸受体激动是乙醇、巴比妥类药物、苯二氮卓类药物和丙泊酚的作用机制。\n\n（选项E）抗组胺药不是治疗精神分裂症的一线治疗方法。它们主要用于治疗过敏性疾病。\n\n（选项G）血清素再摄取抑制是抗抑郁药的作用机制，主要用于治疗抑郁症和焦虑症。尽管精神分裂症患者经常出现情绪和焦虑症状，但抗抑郁药不能有效针对该患者的精神病性症状。\n\n教育目标：抗精神病药物是治疗精神分裂症的一线药物。它们的主要作用机制是D2受体拮抗。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the diagnosis and pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia, specifically focusing on the primary mechanism of action of antipsychotic medications used to treat the condition.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the clinical presentation consistent with schizophrenia based on the patient's positive and negative symptoms and functional decline. Then, recall that antipsychotic medications are the mainstay of treatment and identify their primary mechanism of action, which is dopamine D2 receptor antagonism.",
