    "en": "A 10-year-old boy is brought to the pediatric clinic due to unusual classroom behavior for the past year, which has worsened over the last few weeks. Although the patient is generally quiet, he intermittently disrupts the class with sniffing, repetitive throat clearing, and grunting sounds. His teacher states that the boy distracts other students and that his focus in class is poor. The behaviors worsen when he is tired, stressed, or excited. The patient's parents are also concerned because he has only a few friends and his classmates make fun of him. Medical history is significant for recurrent otitis media as a toddler, atopic dermatitis, and an influenza infection 9 months ago. Family history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis and anxiety in his mother. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), pulse is 78/min, blood pressure is 110/72 mm Hg, and respirations are 14/min. Physical examination shows frequent eye blinking and shoulder shrugging but is otherwise normal.",
    "zh": "一名10岁男孩因过去一年不寻常的课堂行为而被带到儿科诊所就诊，这种行为在过去几周内有所恶化。虽然患者通常很安静，但他间歇性地通过吸鼻、反复清嗓和发出哼哼声来扰乱课堂。他的老师说，这男孩分散了其他学生的注意力，他在课堂上的注意力很差。当他疲倦、有压力或兴奋时，行为会恶化。病人的父母也很担心，因为他只有几个朋友，他的同学取笑他。病史记录了幼儿时期反复性中耳炎、特应性皮炎和9个月前的一次流感感染。家族史显示其母亲患有类风湿性关节炎和焦虑症。体温为36.7摄氏度（98华氏度），脉搏78次/分钟，血压110/72毫米汞柱，呼吸频率14次/分钟。体格检查显示频繁眨眼和耸肩，但其他方面均正常。"

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient is experiencing both vocal and multiple motor tics (sudden, intermittent, nonrhythmic motor movements and vocalizations) consistent with a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome. Vocal tics can range from simple sounds (eg, coughing, grunting, throat clearing) to blustering out inappropriate comments and obscenities (coprolalia). They are typically preceded by irresistible urges and followed by feelings of relief. Tics have a waxing and waning course and are typically exacerbated by stress or fatigue, but they can be suppressed voluntarily for brief periods.\n\nTourette syndrome is more common in boys and typically presents at age 6-15. Comorbid psychiatric conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder are common.\n\n(Choice A) Although ADHD is a common comorbidity, this patient does not exhibit sufficient symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity required for this diagnosis.\n\n(Choice B) Stereotypic movement disorder is characterized by simple repetitive movements (eg, rocking, head banging), which are voluntary in nature and seemingly purposeless. They are often seen in children with autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability and are a common form of self-harm.\n\n(Choice C) Sydenham chorea is a manifestation of rheumatic fever (related to group A streptococcal infection) characterized by choreiform movements (brief, random, irregular contractions of the limbs and face), emotional lability, and hypotonia. Tics can be differentiated from chorea by their patterned, repetitive appearance; ability to be temporarily suppressed; and association with premontory urges.\n\n(Choice E) Wilson disease is caused by copper accumulation and can present in children and adolescents. It is characterized by liver dysfunction, neurological signs (eg, dysarthria, dystonia, ataxia) rather than tics, and psychiatric abnormalities (eg, depression, psychosis).\n\nEducational objective: Tourette syndrome is a common childhood neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by both vocal and multiple motor tics. These tics characteristically wax and wane, can be suppressed temporarily, and are preceded by a premontory urge.",
    "zh": "该患者同时出现了发声抽动和多种运动抽动（突发、间歇性、非节律性运动和发声），这与抽动秽语综合征的诊断相符。发声抽动可从简单的声音（例如，咳嗽、哼哼、清嗓）到突然说出不当评论和秽语（秽语症）不等。它们通常先于无法抗拒的冲动，然后伴随着轻松感。抽动有起伏的病程，通常因压力或疲劳而加重，但可以在短时间内自愿抑制。\n\n抽动秽语综合征在男孩中更常见，通常在6-15岁时出现。合并的精神疾病如注意缺陷/多动障碍（ADHD）和强迫症很常见。\n\n（选项 A）尽管ADHD是一种常见的合并症，但该患者并未表现出诊断所需的足够的注意力不集中和多动/冲动症状。\n\n（选项 B）刻板性动作障碍的特征是简单的重复动作（例如，摇晃、撞头），这些动作是自愿的，看似无目的的。它们通常见于患有自闭症谱系障碍和智力障碍的儿童，并且是一种常见的自残形式。\n\n（选项 C）Sydenham舞蹈病是风湿热（与A组链球菌感染相关）的表现，其特征是舞蹈样动作（肢体和面部的短暂、随机、不规则收缩）、情绪不稳和肌张力减退。抽动与舞蹈病的区别在于其有规律、重复的出现；能够被暂时抑制；以及与先兆冲动的关联。\n\n（选项 E）Wilson病是由铜蓄积引起的，可发生在儿童和青少年中。其特征是肝功能障碍、神经系统体征（例如，言语不清、肌张力障碍、共济失调）而不是抽动，以及精神异常（例如，抑郁、精神病）。\n\n教学目标：抽动秽语综合征是一种常见的儿童神经精神疾病，其特征是发声和多种运动抽动。这些抽动通常有起伏，可以暂时被抑制，并且先于先兆冲动。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome based on the presentation of motor and vocal tics in a child. It requires differentiating Tourette syndrome from other neurodevelopmental and movement disorders.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves identifying the key features of tics, such as their sudden, intermittent, and repetitive nature, the presence of both motor and vocal components, and the characteristic premontory urge. Then, these features are used to distinguish Tourette syndrome from other conditions in the differential diagnosis.",
    "zh": "本题考察根据儿童的运动和发声抽动的表现诊断抽动秽语综合征。它需要将抽动秽语综合征与其他神经发育和运动障碍区分开来。\n\n解决此问题的方法包括识别抽动的关键特征，例如其突然性、间歇性和重复性，存在运动和发声成分，以及特有的先兆冲动。然后，利用这些特征将抽动秽语综合征与鉴别诊断中的其他疾病区分开来。"
