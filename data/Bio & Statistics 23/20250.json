  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "A population pyramid displays the percentage of individuals in each age cohort to describe the current population profile, and to project how the population will increase/decrease in the future. Every population pyramid is unique, but most fit into one of three general categories.\n\n*   Expansive populations have high birth and mortality rates and short life expectancies. Therefore, they show a larger percentage of people in younger cohorts (ie, graph has a broad bottom and narrow top). These populations are young and growing, and their pyramids characterize many developing countries.\n*   Stationary populations have declining birth rates, low mortality rates, and long life expectancies. Therefore, they show a somewhat equal percentage of people in each age cohort (ie, graph has a somewhat rectangular shape). These populations are stable (ie, neither growing nor shrinking), and their pyramids are characteristic of many developed countries.\n*   Constrictive populations have significantly low birth and mortality rates and long life expectancies. Therefore, they show a smaller percentage of people in younger cohorts (ie, graph has a narrow bottom). These populations are shrinking, and their pyramids are characteristic of very advanced countries with a high level of literacy, easy access to birth control measures, and exceptional health and medical resources.\n\nIn this question, the population pyramid has a rectangular shape that tapers off significantly only in the advanced age cohorts. This indicates that the population has gone through a decline in both birth and mortality rates resulting in a longer life expectancy (Choices A and E). When a population reaches a balance between its birth and mortality rates (ie, rectangular shape), it is neither growing nor shrinking; therefore, it is a stable population (Choice B).\n\n(Choice C) A small proportion of older cohorts (eg, age ≥75) is expected in any population: this tapering off at the top of the pyramid occurs due to a natural increase in age-related mortality rather than migration of older people.\n\nEducational objective:\nThere are three types of population pyramids: expansive (ie, young and growing population; high birth and mortality rates), stationary (ie, stable population; declining birth rates and low mortality rates), and constrictive (ie, shrinking population; significantly low birth and mortality rates). {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "人口金字塔显示每个年龄组中个体的百分比，以描述当前的人口概况，并预测未来人口将如何增加/减少。每个人口金字塔都是独一无二的，但大多数都属于三种主要类别之一。\n\n*   扩张型人口具有高出生率和高死亡率以及短的预期寿命。因此，它们在较年轻的年龄组中显示出较大比例的人口（即，图表的底部较宽，顶部较窄）。这些人口年轻且正在增长，其金字塔是许多发展中国家的特征。\n*   稳定型人口的出生率下降，死亡率低，预期寿命长。因此，它们在每个年龄组中显示出大致相等的人口比例（即，图表具有近似矩形的形状）。这些人口是稳定的（即，既不增长也不萎缩），其金字塔是许多发达国家的特征。\n*   收缩型人口的出生率和死亡率显着降低，并且预期寿命长。因此，它们在较年轻的年龄组中显示出较小比例的人口（即，图表的底部较窄）。这些人口正在萎缩，其金字塔是受过高等教育、易于获得节育措施以及拥有卓越的健康和医疗资源的非常发达国家的特征。\n\n在本题中，人口金字塔呈矩形，仅在老年年龄组中显着缩小。这表明人口的出生率和死亡率均有所下降，从而导致预期寿命更长（选项 A 和 E）。当一个人口在其出生率和死亡率之间达到平衡时（即，矩形形状），它既不增长也不萎缩；因此，它是一个稳定的人口（选项 B）。\n\n（选项 C）任何人口中都预计有一小部分老年年龄组（例如，年龄 ≥75 岁）：金字塔顶部的这种逐渐缩小是由于年龄相关死亡率的自然增加，而不是老年人的迁移。\n\n教育目标：\n人口金字塔有三种类型：扩张型（即，年轻且增长的人口；高出生率和高死亡率）、稳定型（即，稳定的人口；出生率下降和低死亡率）和收缩型（即，萎缩的人口；显着低的出生率和死亡率）。 {{exhibit_2}}"
