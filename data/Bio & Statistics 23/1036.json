    "en": "This patient is likely suffering from GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE (G6PD) DEFICIENCY, an X-linked recessive disorder resulting in episodic bouts of HEMOLYSIS when red blood cells experience increased oxidative stress.\n\nG6PD is the rate-limiting enzyme of the PENTOSE PHOSPHATE PATHWAY (PPP). This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE to 6-PHOSPHOGLUCONOLACTONE, which is subsequently converted to 6-PHOSPHOGLUCONATE. Pathway 'C' in the diagram represents this conversion from Glucose-6-phosphate to 6-Phosphogluconate. The PPP serves to generate both NADPH and RIBOSE-5-PHOSPHATE, a precursor for nucleotide synthesis. Red blood cells utilize reduced NADPH to maintain a steady supply of GLUTATHIONE, a molecule capable of neutralizing free radicals and therefore protecting the cells against oxidative damage. As the PPP is the only mechanism for red blood cells to generate NADPH, enzymatic defects in the pathway increase their susceptibility to oxidative damage, leading to HEMOLYSIS.\n\nIncreased OXIDATIVE STRESS can occur as a result of exposure to medications (eg, antimalarials, sulfonamides), certain foods (eg, fava beans), and infection. This patient was likely treated with a SULFONAMIDE drug for his bacterial skin infection, which precipitated HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. The clinical presentation of weakness, malaise, dark urine (hemoglobinuria), scleral icterus, anemia, and elevated reticulocyte count are all consistent with HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. Abnormal erythrocytes on peripheral smear, specifically HEINZ BODIES and BITE CELLS, are characteristic findings in G6PD deficiency due to oxidative damage. Oxidative damage to red blood cells also causes hemoglobin to denature, forming insoluble HEINZ BODIES that are removed in the spleen (producing characteristic BITE CELLS).\n\n(Choices A and B) PHOSPHOGLUCOMUTASE interconverts GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE and GLUCOSE-1-PHOSPHATE. This enzyme links GLYCOGENOLYSIS, GLYCOGENESIS, and GLYCOLYSIS. Deficiency in these pathways would not typically present with drug-induced hemolytic anemia.\n\n(Choice D) This reaction, the conversion of Glucose to Glucose-6-phosphate (or vice versa), is the final step in both GLUCONEOGENESIS and GLYCOGENOLYSIS in the liver. It is catalyzed by GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATASE and results in the liberation of a free glucose molecule. Enzyme deficiency results in GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE type I, which has a different clinical presentation (e.g., hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia) and does not primarily cause hemolytic anemia.\n\n(Choice E) This reaction, the conversion of Glucose to Glucose-6-phosphate, is the first step in GLYCOLYSIS and is catalyzed by HEXOKINASE or GLUCOKINASE. HEXOKINASE deficiency is a rare cause of HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, but it primarily affects glycolysis and is less directly linked to oxidative stress precipitation by drugs. GLUCOKINASE deficiency has been linked to hyperglycemic states and diabetes. The clinical context of sulfonamide-induced oxidative stress points more strongly to G6PD deficiency.\n\n(Choices F and G) Interconversion of GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE and FRUCTOSE-6-PHOSPHATE is catalyzed by the bidirectional enzyme PHOSPHOGLUCOSE ISOMERASE. Enzyme deficiency is responsible for a small percentage of HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS but is not the most likely cause given the classic oxidative stress trigger and the role of the pentose phosphate pathway in red blood cell protection.",
    "zh": "该患者可能患有葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶（G6PD）缺乏症，这是一种 X 连锁隐性遗传疾病，当红细胞经历氧化应激增加时，会导致阵发性溶血。\n\nG6PD 是磷酸戊糖途径（PPP）的限速酶。该酶催化葡萄糖-6-磷酸转化为 6-磷酸葡糖酸内酯，随后转化为 6-磷酸葡萄糖酸。图表中途径“C”代表了从葡萄糖-6-磷酸到 6-磷酸葡萄糖酸的转化。PPP 用于生成 NADPH 和核苷酸合成的前体核糖-5-磷酸。红细胞利用还原型 NADPH 来维持谷胱甘肽的稳定供应，谷胱甘肽是一种能够中和自由基，从而保护细胞免受氧化损伤的分子。由于 PPP 是红细胞生成 NADPH 的唯一机制，该途径中的酶缺陷会增加其对氧化损伤的易感性，从而导致溶血。\n\n氧化应激增加可能由于接触药物（例如，抗疟药、磺胺类药物）、某些食物（例如，蚕豆）和感染而发生。该患者可能因细菌性皮肤感染接受了磺胺类药物治疗，这加速了溶血性贫血。虚弱、不适、深色尿液（血红蛋白尿）、巩膜黄疸、贫血和网织红细胞计数升高的临床表现均与溶血性贫血一致。外周血涂片上出现异常红细胞，特别是海因茨小体和咬痕细胞，是 G6PD 缺乏症因氧化损伤而产生的特征性发现。红细胞的氧化损伤也会导致血红蛋白变性，形成不溶性海因茨小体，这些小体在脾脏中被移除（产生特征性的咬痕细胞）。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）磷酸葡糖变位酶相互转化葡萄糖-6-磷酸和葡萄糖-1-磷酸。该酶连接糖原分解、糖原合成和糖酵解。这些途径的缺乏通常不会表现为药物诱发的溶血性贫血。\n\n（选项 D）该反应，即葡萄糖转化为葡萄糖-6-磷酸（或反之），是肝脏中糖异生和糖原分解的最后一步。它由葡萄糖-6-磷酸酶催化，并导致游离葡萄糖分子的释放。酶缺乏会导致糖原累积病 I 型，其临床表现不同（例如，肝肿大、低血糖症），并且主要不会引起溶血性贫血。\n\n（选项 E）该反应，即葡萄糖转化为葡萄糖-6-磷酸，是糖酵解的第一步，由己糖激酶或葡萄糖激酶催化。己糖激酶缺乏症是溶血性贫血的罕见原因，但它主要影响糖酵解，并且与药物引起的氧化应激沉淀的关系较弱。葡萄糖激酶缺乏症与高血糖状态和糖尿病有关。磺胺类药物引起的氧化应激的临床背景更强烈地指向 G6PD 缺乏症。\n\n（选项 F 和 G）葡萄糖-6-磷酸和果糖-6-磷酸的相互转化由双向酶磷酸葡糖异构酶催化。酶缺乏是导致一小部分溶血性贫血的原因，但考虑到经典的氧化应激诱因以及磷酸戊糖途径在红细胞保护中的作用，这并不是最可能的原因。"
