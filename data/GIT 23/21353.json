    "en": "A 70-year old man comes to the office due to persistent aspiration. Two weeks ago, he had a stroke that impacted his speech, voice, and swallowing. Modified barium swallow study reveals aspiration of liquids without nasal regurgitation. Aspiration is ameliorated when the patient flexes his neck to put his chin to his chest during swallowing.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Normal swallowing involves a complex sequence of voluntary and reflexive processes that move food from the mouth to the esophagus while preventing it from entering the airway (ie, aspiration). Three main airway-protective movements occur during normal swallowing:\n\nDisplacement of the larynx superiorly and anteriorly under the base of tongue, which allows food to be directed into the more posteriorly located esophagus\nTilting of the epiglottis to block the airway\nClosing of the glottis by adduction of the vocal folds\n\nBecause of the complexity of swallowing, patients who sustain strokes often have persistent dysphagia and/or aspiration. If a neurologic deficit cannot be corrected, behavioral modifications can sometimes improve the safety of swallowing. A chin-tuck maneuver (ie, flexion of the head and neck during swallowing) sometimes helps. The maneuver seems to decrease the distance from the hyoid bone to the larynx (simulating elevation of the larynx), as well as to narrow the distance of the laryngeal entrance, leading to decreased aspiration.\n\n(Choice A) The first phase of swallowing is the oral preparatory phase, in which food is chewed and mixed with saliva to form a controlled bolus. Although impaired mastication can lead to poor bolus formation, flexion of the head and neck does not generally change the mechanics of mastication.\n\n(Choice B) Elevation of the soft palate primarily prevents food from entering the nasopharynx rather than the larynx.\n\n(Choice C) Contraction of the base of tongue occurs during the pharyngeal phase of swallowing and pushes the bolus posteriorly into the pharynx. Head and neck flexion could potentially worsen this function by increasing the distance that the base of tongue has to contract and by increasing the anterior force on the tongue due to gravity.\n\n(Choice E) Although adduction of the vocal folds is an important airway-protective mechanism, head and neck flexion would not alter vocal fold movement.",
    "zh": "正常的吞咽包括一系列复杂的自主和反射过程，这些过程将食物从口腔移动到食道，同时阻止其进入气道（即误吸）。正常吞咽期间会发生三种主要的气道保护性运动：\n\n喉部向上和向前移动到舌根下方，这使得食物能够被引导到更靠后的食道中\n会厌倾斜以阻塞气道\n声带内收关闭声门\n\n由于吞咽的复杂性，发生中风的患者通常会持续出现吞咽困难和/或误吸。如果神经功能缺损无法纠正，行为改变有时可以提高吞咽的安全性。屈颈动作（即吞咽时头部和颈部屈曲）有时会有所帮助。这种操作似乎可以减少舌骨到喉部的距离（模拟喉部上抬），并缩小喉部入口的距离，从而减少误吸。\n\n（选项 A）吞咽的第一阶段是口腔准备阶段，在此阶段，食物被咀嚼并与唾液混合，形成可控的食团。虽然咀嚼功能受损会导致食团形成不良，但头部和颈部的屈曲通常不会改变咀嚼的机制。\n\n（选项 B）软腭上抬主要防止食物进入鼻咽而不是喉部。\n\n（选项 C）舌根收缩发生在吞咽的咽部阶段，并将食团向后推入咽部。头部和颈部的屈曲可能会通过增加舌根必须收缩的距离以及增加重力作用下舌部的前向力来潜在地恶化此功能。\n\n（选项 E）虽然声带内收是一种重要的气道保护机制，但头部和颈部的屈曲不会改变声带的运动。"
