    "en": "Gastrulation marks the beginning of the embryonic stage of development and establishes three distinct cell layers (eg, ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm) from which all tissues and organs are derived. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nThe gastrointestinal system is derived from components of each of the following cell layers:\n\n*   **Ectoderm:** The ectoderm is composed of surface ectoderm, neural tube, and neural crest cells. The surface ectoderm gives rise to the oral epithelial linings and salivary glands (**Choice D**). The neural crest gives rise to neural ganglia, including enteric ganglion cells. These cells are responsible for intestinal relaxation, and failure of neural crest cell migration to the distal colon during embryonic development leads to HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE (**Choice A**).\n*   **Mesoderm:** The peritoneum and spleen are derivatives of the mesoderm (**Choices C and E**), which also gives rise to the smooth muscle component of the intestinal tract.\n*   **Endoderm:** Gastrointestinal derivatives of the endoderm include the liver, pancreas, and epithelial lining.\n\nTherefore, in this fetus with disrupted endoderm differentiation, pancreatic enzyme production is likely to be affected. Other structures that could be affected in a patient with disrupted endoderm differentiation include the respiratory tract, thymus, parathyroid glands, and bladder/urethra.\n\nEducational objective:\n\nAll tissues and organs are derived from the following distinct cell layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Derivatives of the endoderm include the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and pancreas.",
    "zh": "原肠胚形成标志着胚胎发育阶段的开始，并建立了三个不同的细胞层（例如，外胚层、中胚层、内胚层），所有组织和器官都源自这三个细胞层。 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n消化系统源自以下每个细胞层的组成部分：\n\n*   **外胚层：** 外胚层由表面外胚层、神经管和神经嵴细胞组成。 表面外胚层产生口腔上皮内衬和唾液腺（**选项 D**）。 神经嵴产生神经神经节，包括肠神经节细胞。 这些细胞负责肠道松弛，并且在胚胎发育过程中神经嵴细胞未能迁移到远端结肠会导致 HIRSCHSPRUNG 病（**选项 A**）。\n*   **中胚层：** 腹膜和脾脏是中胚层的衍生物（**选项 C 和 E**），中胚层也产生消化道的平滑肌成分。\n*   **内胚层：** 内胚层的消化系统衍生物包括肝脏、胰腺和上皮内衬。\n\n因此，在该内胚层分化受损的胎儿中，胰酶的产生很可能会受到影响。 内胚层分化受损的患者中，其他可能受影响的结构包括呼吸道、胸腺、甲状旁腺和膀胱/尿道。\n\n教育目标：\n\n所有组织和器官都源自以下不同的细胞层：外胚层、中胚层和内胚层。 内胚层的衍生物包括消化道、肝脏和胰腺。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of embryological development, specifically the derivatives of the three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. It requires understanding which structures arise from each layer, particularly those related to the gastrointestinal system.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the embryological origins of various organs and tissues. Focus on the endoderm, which gives rise to the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and pancreas. Eliminate options that are derived from the ectoderm or mesoderm.",
