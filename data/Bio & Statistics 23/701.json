    "en": "A married couple comes to the office for routine prenatal counseling. The husband is 120 cm (3 ft 11 in) tall with disproportionately short upper and lower extremities, a large head, and a prominent forehead. He cannot provide a biological family history because he was adopted. His spouse is average height with no dysmorphic features, and her family history is insignificant. They inquire about the likelihood that their offspring will have short stature due to the same condition as the father.",

    "en": "This man's short stature and morphologic features are suggestive of achondroplasia, the most common form of bone dysplasia. It is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, which encodes a protein that inhibits chondrocyte proliferation and endochondral bone growth.\n\nAchondroplasia occurs as a sporadic mutation in 85% of cases; advanced paternal age is a risk factor due to increased DNA replication errors during spermatogenesis. However, once a mutation occurs, it can be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait (responsible for the remaining 15% of cases) with complete penetrance (Choice A).\n\nInheritance of only 1 mutant allele causes the disorder: inheritance of 2 mutant alleles (ie, homozygous achondroplasia) is lethal. As a result, the man must be heterozygous for the achondroplasia mutation. A heterozygous parent has a 50% chance of transmitting the mutated allele; therefore, the unborn child has a 50% chance of inheriting achondroplasia. Because achondroplasia is a rare condition, the probability of having a sporadic mutation does not significantly add to the probability of inheriting the disease. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice B) In sex-linked disorders, the responsible gene is located on a sex chromosome (either X or Y). Most sex-linked disorders are X-linked recessive; females with 1 copy of the defective gene will not have the disorder (they will be carriers), but all males who inherit the defective gene will be affected. In X-linked dominant disorders, both males and females are affected following inheritance of the defective gene.\n\n(Choice C) Because inheritance of only 1 mutant allele causes achondroplasia and the disease is completely penetrant, carriers do not exist. This woman must be homozygous for the normal allele (since she is average height with no features that suggest achondroplasia).\n\n(Choice D) About 25% of children are affected in autosomal recessive disorders if both parents carry 1 copy of the defective gene. Many recessive disorders are the result of enzymatic deficiencies (eg, phenylketonuria) that require both copies of the gene to be knocked out, as 1 functional copy usually provides sufficient enzymatic activity to prevent occurrence of the disease.\n\nEducational objective:\nAchondroplasia is an autosomal dominant (AD) disorder that results in a gain-of-function mutation in the FGFR3 gene. Most individuals affected by AD disorders are heterozygous and have a 50% chance of transmitting the mutation to their offspring. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the inheritance pattern of achondroplasia, an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the FGFR3 gene. It assesses the ability to calculate the probability of inheritance given that one parent is affected and heterozygous for the mutation.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and understanding that a heterozygous parent has a 50% chance of passing on the mutated allele to their offspring. The fact that the mother is unaffected eliminates the possibility of her being a carrier.",
