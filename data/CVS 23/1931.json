    "en": "A 44-year-old man with progressive dyspnea is diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy. Despite optimal medical therapy, he continues to have symptoms and disease progression is noted. He undergoes cardiac transplantation after a suitable donor becomes available. Permission is obtained from the patient to study his diseased heart for intracellular calcium regulation. Microelectrodes placed into cardiac muscle cells detect a rapid decrease in cytoplasmic calcium level immediately preceding relaxation. Which of the following proteins is most likely responsible for the observed change in electrolyte levels?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Intracellular calcium regulation plays an important role in excitation-contraction coupling. Voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-type) are activated during phase 2 of cardiac action potential (depolarization) and permit influx of calcium into the cardiac myocytes (Choice E). This initial calcium influx is sensed by the ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which triggers further release of Ca2+ (calcium-induced calcium release) into the cytoplasm, thereby increasing intracellular calcium concentration 100-fold (Choice C). The calcium released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum diffuses through the myofilament network and binds to troponin C (Choice D). Tropomyosin is then moved out of the way so that actin and myosin can interact, leading to muscle contraction.\n\nThe final stage of excitation-contraction coupling is myocyte relaxation, which occurs subsequent to calcium efflux from the cytoplasm {{exhibit_1}}. Intracellular calcium is removed primarily via an Na+/Ca2+ exchange pump (NCX) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump (SERCA). NCX uses the large extracellular Na+ concentration gradient to help pump Ca2+ out of the cell and, in the process, removes one intracellular Ca2+ in exchange for 3 extracellular Na+ ions. In contrast, SERCA is a Ca2+-ATPase pump that actively transfers Ca2+ from the cytosol to the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum at the expense of ATP hydrolysis.\n\n(Choice A) Calmodulin (calcium modulated protein) is a calcium-binding messenger protein that is present in all cells and mediates many of the regulatory effects of Ca2+. Calmodulin is important for excitation-contraction coupling in smooth muscle cells, which lack troponin, unlike cardiac and skeletal muscles. In cardiac muscle, calmodulin is not directly involved in excitation-contraction coupling; rather, it helps regulate intracellular calcium activity and transcription factor signaling.\n\nEducational objective:\nCalcium efflux from cardiac cells prior to relaxation is primarily mediated via an Na+/Ca2+ exchange pump and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump.",
    "zh": "细胞内钙调节在兴奋-收缩偶联中起着重要作用。电压依赖性钙离子通道（L 型）在心肌动作电位的第 2 阶段（去极化）期间被激活，并允许钙离子流入心肌细胞（选项 E）。这种初始的钙离子内流被肌浆网中的兰诺定受体感知，从而触发 Ca2+ 的进一步释放（钙离子诱导的钙离子释放）到细胞质中，从而使细胞内钙离子浓度增加 100 倍（选项 C）。从肌浆网释放的钙离子通过肌丝网络扩散，并与肌钙蛋白 C 结合（选项 D）。原肌球蛋白随后移开，以便肌动蛋白和肌球蛋白相互作用，从而导致肌肉收缩。\n\n兴奋-收缩偶联的最后阶段是心肌细胞舒张，发生在钙离子从细胞质外流之后 {{exhibit_1}}。细胞内钙离子主要通过 Na+/Ca2+ 交换泵 (NCX) 和肌浆网 Ca2+-ATP 酶泵 (SERCA) 移除。NCX 利用大的细胞外 Na+ 浓度梯度来帮助将 Ca2+ 泵出细胞，在此过程中，它交换一个细胞内 Ca2+，以换取 3 个细胞外 Na+ 离子。相比之下，SERCA 是一种 Ca2+-ATP 酶泵，它以 ATP 水解为代价，将 Ca2+ 从细胞质主动转移到肌浆网腔内。\n\n（选项 A）钙调蛋白（钙调节蛋白）是一种钙结合信使蛋白，存在于所有细胞中，并介导 Ca2+ 的许多调节作用。钙调蛋白对于平滑肌细胞中的兴奋-收缩偶联很重要，平滑肌细胞缺乏肌钙蛋白，这与心肌和骨骼肌不同。在心肌中，钙调蛋白不直接参与兴奋-收缩偶联；相反，它有助于调节细胞内钙离子活性和转录因子信号传导。\n\n教育目标：\n心肌细胞舒张前的钙离子外流主要通过 Na+/Ca2+ 交换泵和肌浆网 Ca2+-ATP 酶泵介导。"
