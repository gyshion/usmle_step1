    "en": "In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), air flow obstruction and hyperinflation (air trapping) cause increased residual volume (RV) and a consequent increase in total lung capacity (TLC). Because the increase in RV is greater than the increase in TLC, the RV/TLC ratio is increased. Airway obstruction also causes decreased forced vital capacity (FVC) and a more profound decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), resulting in a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio.\n\nIn the above graphs, the top section represents the inspiratory reserve volume, the middle section represents the tidal volume plus the expiratory reserve volume, and the bottom section represents the RV. In COPD, an increase in RV and TLC is expected, as is a decrease in FVC.\n\n(Choice A) In restrictive lung disease, the TLC, RV, FVC, and FEV1 are all reduced, but the FEV1/FVC ratio is normal or increased.\n\n(Choice C) This graph shows an increased TLC and FVC with a normal RV. Such an increase in TLC may be seen in elite athletes.\n\n(Choice D) This graph shows a decrease in TLC and an increase in RV. As changes in these parameters are not typically discordant, this would be a rare clinical finding.\n\nEducational objective:\nIn chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, air-trapping leads to an increase in residual volume (RV) and total lung capacity (TLC), as well as an increase in the RV/TLC ratio. Airway obstruction causes a decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and the FEV1/FVC ratio. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "在慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD）中，气流阻塞和过度充气（气体潴留）会导致残气量（RV）增加，进而导致总肺活量（TLC）增加。由于RV的增加大于TLC的增加，因此RV/TLC比率升高。气道阻塞还会导致用力肺活量（FVC）降低，一秒钟用力呼气量（FEV1）显著降低，导致FEV1/FVC比率降低。\n\n在上图中，顶部表示吸气储备容积，中间部分表示潮气量加上呼气储备容积，底部表示RV。在COPD中，RV和TLC预计会增加，FVC也会降低。\n\n（选项A）在限制性肺病中，TLC、RV、FVC和FEV1均降低，但FEV1/FVC比率正常或升高。\n\n（选项C）该图显示TLC和FVC增加，RV正常。TLC的这种增加可能见于优秀运动员。\n\n（选项D）该图显示TLC降低，RV增加。由于这些参数的变化通常不一致，这是一种罕见的临床发现。\n\n教育目标：\n在慢性阻塞性肺病中，气体潴留导致残气量（RV）和总肺活量（TLC）增加，以及RV/TLC比率增加。气道阻塞导致用力肺活量（FVC）、1秒用力呼气量（FEV1）和FEV1/FVC比率降低。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of pulmonary function tests and lung volumes in the context of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It requires understanding how COPD affects residual volume, total lung capacity, and other pulmonary function parameters.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the clinical presentation of COPD (smoking history, hyperresonant lungs, wheezing, flattened diaphragm). Then, recall the expected changes in lung volumes in COPD, specifically increased residual volume and total lung capacity.",
