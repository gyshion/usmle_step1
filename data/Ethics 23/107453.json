    "en": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the office due to lower back pain after lifting heavy furniture a week ago. She recently moved to the area with her boyfriend, who is starting a new job. Physical examination shows mild paraspinal muscle tenderness. There is no radiation of pain on either side during the straight-leg raise test, and no neurologic deficits are noted in the lower extremities. However, multiple bruises in various stages of healing are noted on her abdomen and back. When the patient is asked about the bruising, she says, \"It's nothing. I'm just really clumsy and bump into things.\" The patient provides brief responses and avoids eye contact throughout the evaluation.",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient with multiple bruises in various stages of healing is likely affected by intimate partner violence (IPV), which is any type of harm (eg, physical, psychologic, sexual) committed by a partner. IPV particularly affects women of childbearing age, with increased incidence during stressful life events (eg, recent move, new job). However, patients often underreport IPV due to shame or fear of retribution; therefore, a high degree of clinical suspicion should be maintained. Physicians should be alert to clues such as multiple injuries with unlikely explanations (eg, \"I'm clumsy and bump into things\") and signs of fearfulness or avoidance (eg, brief responses, avoidance of eye contact).\n\nPatients with active IPV are often less forthcoming and reluctant to speak; therefore, the initial approach should avoid direct questioning and first necessitate establishing rapport with empathic validation (eg, \"Moving to a new city can be stressful\"). This can then be followed by indirect questioning to address the concern (eg, \"How are things going at home?\"). This approach is a subtler way of introducing the topic of IPV and can decrease patient hesitation while avoiding defensiveness or denial.\n\n(Choices A and B) Inappropriate responses include those that improperly place the physician's opinions and needs above those of the patient. These types of statements directly challenge the patient's story (\"I'm concerned they were caused by someone else\") or are overly abrupt and directive (eg, \"you need to tell me about the bruises\"), approaches that risk the patient becoming defensive, undermining the possibility for intervention.\n\n(Choices D and E) Although there is valid concern for abuse, unfounded assumptions should be avoided. If IPV is confirmed, immediate safety should be addressed at that time, followed by development of a safety plan. Value judgments (eg, \"No one deserves...\"), unless originating from the patient, should not be used during this process so as to avoid unintentionally alienating the patient.\n\nEducational objective:\nRoutine screening for intimate partner violence (IPV) includes the use of direct questioning (eg, \"Have you ever been hit by your partner?\") to encourage disclosure. However, patients with suspected active IPV (eg, multiple bruises) may be less forthcoming and require indirect questioning (eg, \"How are things going at home?\").",
    "zh": "这位患者有多处不同愈合阶段的瘀伤，很可能受到亲密伴侣暴力(IPV)的影响，这指的是伴侣造成的任何类型的伤害(例如，身体、心理、性方面)。IPV尤其影响育龄妇女，在压力大的生活事件(例如，最近搬家、新工作)期间发病率增加。然而，由于羞耻感或害怕报复，患者通常会低估IPV；因此，应保持高度的临床怀疑。医生应警惕线索，如多次受伤，但解释不合理(例如，“我很笨拙，经常撞到东西”)以及恐惧或回避的迹象(例如，回答简短、避免眼神交流)。\n\n患有活动性IPV的患者通常不太坦诚，也不愿说话；因此，最初的方法应避免直接提问，首先需要通过同情性的确认来建立融洽关系(例如，“搬到一个新的城市可能会有压力”)。然后，可以进行间接提问来解决担忧(例如，“家里情况怎么样？”)。这种方法是一种更微妙的方式来介绍IPV的话题，可以减少患者的犹豫，同时避免防御或否认。\n\n(选项A和B)不恰当的回答包括那些不当地将医生的意见和需求置于患者之上的回答。这些类型的陈述直接质疑患者的说法(“我担心它们是别人造成的”)或过于唐突和指示性(例如，“你需要告诉我关于瘀伤的事情”)，这些方法可能会使患者变得具有防御性，从而破坏干预的可能性。\n\n(选项D和E) 虽然对虐待有合理的担忧，但应避免毫无根据的假设。如果IPV得到证实，应立即解决安全问题，然后制定安全计划。除非来自患者，否则在此过程中不应使用价值判断(例如，“没有人应该……”)，以免无意中疏远患者。\n\n教育目标：\n对亲密伴侣暴力(IPV)进行常规筛查包括使用直接提问(例如，“你的伴侣有没有打过你？”)来鼓励披露。然而，怀疑患有活动性IPV的患者(例如，多处瘀伤)可能不太坦诚，需要间接提问(例如，“家里情况怎么样？”)。"

    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize signs of intimate partner violence (IPV) and to apply appropriate communication techniques when approaching a patient who may be experiencing IPV. It emphasizes the importance of indirect questioning and establishing rapport before directly addressing the possibility of abuse.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the subtle clues suggesting IPV (multiple bruises, inconsistent explanations, avoidance of eye contact) and to select the response that uses indirect questioning to open the conversation in a non-threatening way. Avoid direct accusations or assumptions, which can cause the patient to become defensive.",
