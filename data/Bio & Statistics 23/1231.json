  "explanation": {
    "en": "The NUMBER NEEDED TO HARM (NNH) represents the number of people who must be treated before 1 additional adverse event occurs. It is calculated in a manner similar to the number needed to treat (NNT) but using the ABSOLUTE RISK INCREASE (attributable risk) instead of the absolute risk reduction:\n\nNNH = 1 / Absolute risk increase\n\nTo determine the absolute risk increase, first CALCULATE THE ADVERSE EVENT RATE (eg, death) in the experimental and control groups. In this case, the adverse event of interest is death at 1 year. There were 40 + 60 = 100 people treated with the experimental treatment (ie, zeracizumab-containing regimen); of those, 60 were dead at 1 year. Similarly, there were 51 + 69 = 120 people treated with standard chemotherapy; of those, 69 were dead at 1 year. Therefore:\n\nAdverse event rate in experimental group = 60 / 100 = 0.60 (ie, 60%)\nAdverse event rate in control group = 69 / 120 = 0.575 (ie, 57.5%)\n\nThe absolute risk increase can then be calculated by SUBTRACTING the adverse event rate in the control group from the adverse event rate in the treatment group:\n\nAbsolute risk increase = 0.60 – 0.575 = 0.025 (ie, 2.5%)\n\nThe absolute risk increase attributable to the treatment is 2.5% (60% risk of being dead at 1 year in the treatment group compared to 57.5% in the control group). The NNH then is simply the INVERSE of the absolute risk increase:\n\nNNH = 1 / 0.026 = 40\n\nThis result indicates that, on average, 40 PATIENTS NEED TO BE TREATED with a zeracizumab-containing regimen for 1 additional person to experience an adverse event (ie, death in 1 year).",
    "zh": "需要治疗的有害人数 (NNH) 代表在发生 1 例额外不良事件之前必须接受治疗的人数。它以类似于需要治疗的人数 (NNT) 的方式计算，但使用绝对风险增加（可归因风险）而不是绝对风险降低：\n\nNNH = 1 / 绝对风险增加\n\n要确定绝对风险增加，首先要计算实验组和对照组中的不良事件发生率（例如，死亡）。在这种情况下，关注的不良事件是 1 年死亡。有 40 + 60 = 100 人接受了实验性治疗（即，含 zeracizumab 方案）；其中，60 人在 1 年内死亡。同样，有 51 + 69 = 120 人接受了标准化学疗法；其中，69 人在 1 年内死亡。因此：\n\n实验组不良事件发生率 = 60 / 100 = 0.60（即，60%）\n对照组不良事件发生率 = 69 / 120 = 0.575（即，57.5%）\n\n然后可以通过从对照组的不良事件发生率中减去治疗组的不良事件发生率来计算绝对风险增加：\n\n绝对风险增加 = 0.60 – 0.575 = 0.025（即，2.5%）\n\n归因于治疗的绝对风险增加为 2.5%（治疗组在 1 年内死亡的风险为 60%，而对照组为 57.5%）。然后 NNH 只是绝对风险增加的倒数：\n\nNNH = 1 / 0.026 = 40\n\n该结果表明，平均而言，需要用含 zeracizumab 方案治疗 40 名患者，才能让另一个人经历不良事件（即，1 年内死亡）。"
