    "en": "Wound healing generally proceeds in 3 phases:\n\n1.  The inflammatory phase begins with formation of a fibrin clot that results in hemostasis. Cytokines released by activated platelets and damaged cells lead to migration of neutrophils (within the first 24 hours) and macrophages (2-3 days later) to the damaged area.\n2.  The proliferative phase begins 3-5 days after the injury. Fibroblasts and endothelial vascular cells proliferate to form connective tissue and blood vessels (neovascularization), respectively. Around this time, epithelial cells begin to proliferate at the dermal edges and secrete basement membrane material.\n3.  The maturation phase is characterized by fibrosis (scar formation) and starts during the second week after injury. During this phase, active fibroblasts synthesize collagen, elastin, and other components of the connective tissue matrix.\n\nDuring the healing process, fibroblast migration and proliferation are controlled by multiple growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). TGF-β is also critical for stimulating connective tissue synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. TGF-β typically decreases during the maturation phase of wound healing to limit the amount of collagenous scar tissue. Hypertrophic or disfiguring scars can be caused by persistently elevated TGF-β, which leads to increased fibroblast proliferation and activity. In addition, the fibroblasts in hypertrophic scars often have altered TGF-β signaling due to increased TGF-β receptor expression.\n\n(Choice A) Interferon-β is an antiviral cytokine that also decreases inflammatory cell movement across the blood-brain barrier. Interferon-β analogs can be used to treat multiple sclerosis.\n\n(Choice B) Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is produced by T₁ₕ cells and recruits neutrophils in addition to stimulating production of antimicrobial peptides. IL-17 improves host defense against fungi and bacteria at epithelial and mucosal surfaces. Dysregulation has been implicated in many autoimmune conditions.\n\n(Choice C) Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is a proinflammatory transcription factor that regulates cytokine production, adhesion molecule expression, and cell survival. Increased NF-κB activity is found in many cancers and inflammatory diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease).\n\n(Choice E) Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a cytokine secreted by activated macrophages and T cells that promotes leukocyte recruitment, induces the systemic inflammatory response (eg, fever, acute-phase proteins), and regulates apoptosis.\n\nEducational objective:\nTransforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is critical for fibroblast migration, proliferation, and connective tissue synthesis. Increased TGF-β activity is responsible for the hypertrophic/keloid scarring and fibrosis of the lung, liver, and kidney that occur with chronic inflammation.",
    "zh": "伤口愈合通常分为3个阶段：\n\n1.  炎症期从纤维蛋白凝块的形成开始，导致止血。被激活的血小板和受损细胞释放的细胞因子导致中性粒细胞（在最初的24小时内）和巨噬细胞（2-3天后）迁移到受损区域。\n2.  增殖期在损伤后3-5天开始。成纤维细胞和内皮血管细胞增殖，分别形成结缔组织和血管（新生血管形成）。大约在这个时候，上皮细胞开始在真皮边缘增殖并分泌基底膜物质。\n3.  成熟期以纤维化（瘢痕形成）为特征，并在损伤后第二周开始。在此阶段，活跃的成纤维细胞合成胶原蛋白、弹性蛋白和其他结缔组织基质的成分。\n\n在愈合过程中，成纤维细胞的迁移和增殖受多种生长因子的控制，包括血小板衍生生长因子（PDGF）和转化生长因子-β（TGF-β）。 TGF-β对于刺激结缔组织合成和细胞外基质的重塑也至关重要。 TGF-β通常在伤口愈合的成熟期降低，以限制胶原瘢痕组织的量。肥厚性或毁容性瘢痕可能是由持续升高的TGF-β引起的，这会导致成纤维细胞增殖和活性增加。此外，肥厚性瘢痕中的成纤维细胞通常由于TGF-β受体表达增加而具有改变的TGF-β信号传导。\n\n（选项A）干扰素-β是一种抗病毒细胞因子，也可以减少炎症细胞穿过血脑屏障的运动。干扰素-β类似物可用于治疗多发性硬化症。\n\n（选项B）白细胞介素-17（IL-17）由T₁ₕ细胞产生，除了刺激抗菌肽的产生外，还募集嗜中性粒细胞。 IL-17改善了上皮和粘膜表面对真菌和细菌的宿主防御。失调与许多自身免疫性疾病有关。\n\n（选项C）核因子-κB（NF-κB）是一种促炎转录因子，可调节细胞因子产生、粘附分子表达和细胞存活。在许多癌症和炎症性疾病（例如，类风湿性关节炎、炎症性肠病）中发现NF-κB活性增加。\n\n（选项E）肿瘤坏死因子-α（TNF-α）是由活化的巨噬细胞和T细胞分泌的细胞因子，促进白细胞募集，诱导全身炎症反应（例如，发烧，急性期蛋白）并调节细胞凋亡。\n\n教学目标：\n转化生长因子-β（TGF-β）对成纤维细胞的迁移、增殖和结缔组织合成至关重要。 TGF-β活性增加是导致慢性炎症引起的肺、肝和肾肥厚性/瘢痕疙瘩瘢痕形成和纤维化的原因。"
