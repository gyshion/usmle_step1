    "en": "A 27-year-old woman comes to the office due to concerns about her weight. She is frustrated about gaining a few pounds, although she maintains a well-balanced diet and exercises for an hour 3 times a week. The patient has been worried for years that her thighs are \"huge\" and \"covered in cellulite.\" She always wears loose-fitting pants and spends hours a day researching leg exercises and measuring the circumference of her thighs. The patient generally stays at home and avoids social activities as she feels people tend to stare at her. She weighs 58 kg (127.9 lb) and is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall. Physical examination is normal.",

  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) involves a fixation with a perceived defect in appearance that is not evident or appears slight to others. Patients may believe that they look ugly or hideous due to their appearance concerns, which results in the performance of repetitive behaviors (eg, excessive mirror checking, grooming) or mental acts (eg, comparison with others). The disorder causes significant distress and/or psychosocial impairment, often resulting in unnecessary plastic surgery, avoidance behavior, and interpersonal problems. Patient insight ranges from good to absent (absolute conviction that beliefs about their appearance are true).\n\n(Choice A) Avoidance of public areas is present in both agoraphobia and BDD; however, in agoraphobia, avoidance is motivated by thoughts about not being able to escape if a panic attack were to occur as opposed to concerns about appearance.\n\n(Choices B and E) Weight concerns may occur in both body dysmorphic and eating disorders. However, this patient does not meet diagnostic criteria for either anorexia or bulimia nervosa (eg, normal weight, no evidence of binges or inappropriate compensatory behaviors).\n\n(Choices C and H) Although patients with BDD are frequently socially anxious and avoidant, the feelings result from their distorted beliefs about their appearance. In avoidant personality disorder and social anxiety disorder, social avoidance is related to fears of rejection and criticism from others.\n\n(Choice F) Patients with BDD can have delusional beliefs about their appearance, with a firm conviction that their perception is accurate. However, this is diagnosed as BDD with absent insight, rather than delusional disorder, because it involves only fixed, false beliefs about appearance.\n\n(Choice G) Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by intrusive obsessions and/or time-consuming compulsions. When obsessions and compulsions are limited to concerns about physical appearance, BDD is the appropriate diagnosis.",
    "zh": "躯体变形障碍（BDD）涉及对外观上可察觉的缺陷的固定，这种缺陷对其他人来说并不明显或看起来很轻微。患者可能因为他们的外貌问题而认为自己丑陋或可怕，这导致了重复行为（例如，过度照镜子、修饰仪容）或精神活动（例如，与他人比较）。这种疾病会导致严重的痛苦和/或社会心理功能损害，通常导致不必要的手术、回避行为和人际关系问题。患者的洞察力从良好到缺失不等（绝对相信他们对外貌的看法是真实的）。\n\n（选项A）广场恐惧症和BDD都存在对公共场所的逃避；然而，在广场恐惧症中，逃避的动机是关于如果发生恐慌发作时无法逃脱的想法，而不是对外貌的担忧。\n\n（选项B和E）体重问题可能同时发生在躯体变形障碍和进食障碍中。然而，该患者不符合神经性厌食症或神经性贪食症的诊断标准（例如，体重正常，没有暴饮暴食或不适当的代偿行为的证据）。\n\n（选项C和H）虽然BDD患者经常有社交焦虑和回避行为，但这些感觉源于他们对自身外貌的扭曲观念。在回避型人格障碍和社交焦虑症中，社交回避与害怕被他人拒绝和批评有关。\n\n（选项F）BDD患者可能对其外貌有妄想性信念，并且坚信他们的感知是准确的。然而，这被诊断为无洞察力的BDD，而不是妄想症，因为它仅涉及关于外貌的固定的、错误的信念。\n\n（选项G）强迫症的特征是侵入性强迫观念和/或耗时的强迫行为。当强迫观念和强迫行为仅限于对外貌的担忧时，BDD是适当的诊断。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), its clinical features, and its differentiation from other psychiatric disorders that may present with similar symptoms such as anxiety, avoidance, and concerns about appearance or weight.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully analyzing the patient's chief complaint, history of present illness, and behaviors to identify the core psychopathology. Key differentiating features between BDD and other disorders like eating disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders are crucial for accurate diagnosis.",
