  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient presents with nonpitting edema, a webbed neck, nail dysplasia, and a horseshoe kidney. This constellation of findings is characteristic of TURNER SYNDROME (TS). In TS, edema is common and is due to LYMPHATIC NETWORK DYSGENESIS, leading to congenital lymphedema. Poor lymph absorption results in fluid accumulation in the interstitial space of the hands and feet. Impaired drainage of cervical lymph can lead to a webbed neck (short neck with loose skin) and cystic hygroma. Nail dysplasia is also a common feature of TS. The horseshoe kidney is an associated anomaly. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}\n\nPitting edema typically results when there is increased fluid extravasation into the interstitial space. Common causes include increased capillary hydrostatic pressure (eg, right-sided heart failure, venous thrombosis) and decreased intravascular oncotic pressure (eg, nephrotic-range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia in cirrhosis). (Choice D) Excessive urinary sodium retention occurs with kidney failure and causes increased capillary hydrostatic pressure and edema that is pitting, in contrast to this patient's nonpitting edema. (Choice A) Impaired left ventricle contractility initially causes left-sided heart failure and presents with signs of pulmonary edema, such as increased work of breathing (eg, tachypnea), hypoxia, and crackles (findings not seen in this patient). Over time, increased pulmonary pressure can cause increased central venous pressure and lead to right-sided heart failure, but edema would be pitting, unlike the edema in this patient. (Choice B) Increased capillary permeability (eg, angioedema) also characteristically causes nonpitting edema due to rapid extravasation of protein-rich fluid that overwhelms the normal drainage pathways. However, the presence of a webbed neck, nail dysplasia, and horseshoe kidney strongly points away from isolated increased capillary permeability and towards Turner syndrome.",
    "zh": "患者出现非凹陷性水肿、蹼状颈、指甲发育不良和马蹄肾。这种表现组合是TURNER综合征（TS）的特征。在TS中，水肿很常见，是由于淋巴网络发育不良所致，导致先天性淋巴水肿。淋巴吸收不良导致液体在手和脚的间质空间积聚。颈部淋巴引流受损可导致蹼状颈（颈短而皮肤松弛）和囊性水瘤。指甲发育不良也是TS的常见特征。马蹄肾是一种相关的异常。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}\n\n凹陷性水肿通常是由于液体渗出到间质空间增加所致。常见原因包括毛细血管静水压升高（例如，右心衰竭、静脉血栓形成）和血管内胶体渗透压降低（例如，肾病范围内的蛋白尿、肝硬化中的低白蛋白血症）。（选项D）尿钠潴留过多发生在肾衰竭时，导致毛细血管静水压升高和凹陷性水肿，与该患者的非凹陷性水肿形成对比。（选项A）左心室收缩力受损最初会导致左心衰竭，并表现出肺水肿的体征，例如呼吸做功增加（例如，呼吸急促）、低氧血症和爆裂音（该患者未见）。随着时间的推移，肺动脉压力升高可导致中心静脉压升高，并导致右心衰竭，但水肿会是凹陷性的，与该患者的水肿不同。（选项B）毛细血管通透性增加（例如，血管性水肿）也典型地引起非凹陷性水肿，这是由于富含蛋白质的液体快速渗出，淹没了正常的引流途径。然而，蹼状颈、指甲发育不良和马蹄肾的存在强烈表明与孤立的毛细血管通透性增加无关，而更倾向于Turner综合征。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the pathophysiology of edema, specifically differentiating between pitting and nonpitting edema and recognizing the clinical features associated with specific causes. It also assesses the ability to integrate multiple clinical findings to arrive at a diagnosis of a genetic syndrome.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves first identifying the type of edema (nonpitting) and then considering the differential diagnoses for nonpitting edema. The presence of other dysmorphic features and anomalies should then be used to narrow down the differential and identify the most likely underlying condition.",
