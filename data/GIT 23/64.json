    "en": "A 54-year-old woman is evaluated in the clinic for exertional dyspnea and easy fatigability. The patient has no chest pain, cough, or wheezing. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. On physical examination, her gait is unstable when her eyes are closed and there is impaired vibratory sensation in the lower extremities. Marked pallor of the conjunctivae, nail beds, and palms is present. Which of the following laboratory tests would help confirm the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

    "en": "This patient has features of anemia (eg, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, pallor) with associated neurologic deficits that are highly suggestive of vitamin B₁₂ deficiency. The hematologic manifestations of B₁₂ deficiency (eg, MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA, pancytopenia) are related to impaired DNA synthesis.\n\nVitamin B₁₂ (hydroxocobalamin) also serves as a cofactor for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (converts methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA) and methionine synthase (converts homocysteine and folic acid to methionine). B₁₂ deficiency consequently results in elevated levels of serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine. Increased methylmalonic acid levels can disrupt myelin synthesis and result in SUBACUTE COMBINED DEGENERATION of the dorsal columns (eg, loss of proprioception/vibration, Romberg sign) and lateral corticospinal tract (eg, spastic muscle weakness, hyperreflexia). Axonal degeneration of peripheral nerves can also be seen. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) leads to acute hemolytic anemia in response to oxidative stress. Neurologic manifestations are not present in G6PD-associated anemia.\n\n(Choice B) Erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity may be decreased in patients with vitamin B₂ (riboflavin) deficiency because glutathione reductase uses bound FAD (derived from vitamin B₂) and NADPH as cofactors to reduce disulfide bonds. Vitamin B₂ deficiency typically presents with normocytic anemia and inflammation of the lips (cheilosis), mouth (stomatitis), and/or tongue (glossitis).\n\n(Choice C) Pyruvate kinase generates ATP through the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive condition that typically presents with congenital hemolytic anemia due to impaired glycolytic ATP generation.\n\n(Choice D) Transketolase is an enzyme of the hexose monophosphate pathway that utilizes thiamine (vitamin B₁) as a coenzyme. Erythrocyte transketolase activity is decreased in THIAMINE DEFICIENCY, which causes Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and beriberi.\n\n(Choice F) Serum protoporphyrin levels are increased in iron deficiency anemia, lead poisoning, and erythropoietic protoporphyria. Lead poisoning can cause sideroblastic anemia and peripheral neuropathy, but other characteristic features (eg, abdominal/musculoskeletal pain, cognitive impairment, nephropathy) are not evident in this patient.\n\nEducational objective: \nVitamin B₁₂ deficiency often presents with megaloblastic anemia (impaired DNA synthesis) and neurologic deficits (impaired myelin synthesis). Characteristic neurologic findings include subacute combined degeneration of the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tract. Elevations in methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels occur due to decreased metabolism of these molecules.",
    "zh": "该患者有贫血表现（例如，劳力性呼吸困难、疲劳、苍白），并伴有神经功能缺损，高度提示维生素B₁₂缺乏。B₁₂缺乏的血液学表现（例如，巨幼红细胞性贫血、全血细胞减少）与DNA合成受损有关。\n\n维生素B₁₂（羟钴胺）也用作甲基丙二酰辅酶A变位酶（将甲基丙二酰CoA转化为琥珀酰CoA）和甲硫氨酸合成酶（将同型半胱氨酸和叶酸转化为甲硫氨酸）的辅助因子。因此，B₁₂缺乏导致血清甲基丙二酸和同型半胱氨酸水平升高。甲基丙二酸水平升高会破坏髓鞘合成，导致脊髓后索的亚急性联合变性（例如，本体感觉/振动感丧失、Romberg征）和侧皮质脊髓束（例如，痉挛性肌无力、反射亢进）。也可观察到周围神经的轴突变性。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项A) 葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶缺乏症（G6PD）会导致对氧化应激的急性溶血性贫血。G6PD相关性贫血中没有神经系统表现。\n\n(选项B) 维生素B₂（核黄素）缺乏症患者的红细胞谷胱甘肽还原酶活性可能会降低，因为谷胱甘肽还原酶使用结合的FAD（源自维生素B₂）和NADPH作为辅助因子来还原二硫键。维生素B₂缺乏症通常表现为正细胞性贫血和唇部（唇炎）、口腔（口炎）和/或舌部（舌炎）的炎症。\n\n(选项C) 丙酮酸激酶通过将磷酸烯醇丙酮酸转化为丙酮酸来产生ATP。丙酮酸激酶缺乏症是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，通常表现为由于糖酵解ATP生成受损引起的先天性溶血性贫血。\n\n(选项D) 转酮醇酶是利用硫胺素（维生素B₁）作为辅酶的己糖单磷酸途径的酶。硫胺素缺乏症患者红细胞转酮醇酶活性降低，导致Wernicke-Korsakoff综合征和脚气病。\n\n(选项F) 血清原卟啉水平在缺铁性贫血、铅中毒和红细胞生成性原卟啉病中升高。铅中毒可引起铁粒幼细胞性贫血和周围神经病变，但该患者没有其他特征性表现（例如，腹痛/肌肉骨骼疼痛、认知障碍、肾病）。\n\n教育目标：\n维生素B₁₂缺乏症通常表现为巨幼红细胞性贫血（DNA合成受损）和神经功能缺损（髓鞘合成受损）。特征性的神经学发现包括脊髓后索和侧皮质脊髓束的亚急性联合变性。由于这些分子的代谢减少，甲基丙二酸和同型半胱氨酸水平升高。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of vitamin B12 deficiency, its hematologic and neurologic manifestations, and the role of methylmalonic acid in its diagnosis. It also requires differentiating B12 deficiency from other causes of anemia and neurologic symptoms.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the combination of anemia and neurologic symptoms (unstable gait, impaired vibratory sensation) as suggestive of vitamin B12 deficiency. Then, recall that methylmalonic acid levels are elevated in B12 deficiency due to impaired metabolism.",
