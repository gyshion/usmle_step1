    "en": "A 64-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to worsening dizziness and shortness of breath for the past several days. The patient was diagnosed with advanced stage lung cancer 6 months ago and is receiving palliative care. The patient has no other medical history. Blood pressure is 85/45 mm Hg, pulse is 122/min and regular, and respirations are 22/min. Pulse oximetry is 94% on room air. There are undulations in blood pressure at different phases of respiration. On physical examination, the point of maximal impulse is not palpable, and heart sounds are distant. Chest x-ray reveals diffuse pulmonary metastatic disease and new enlargement of the cardiac silhouette {{exhibit_1}}. Which of the following hemodynamic changes are most likely present in this patient due to his current cardiac condition?",

    "en": "This patient's hypotension, distant heart sounds, and new enlargement of the cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray {{exhibit_2}} in the setting of advanced malignancy are consistent with cardiac tamponade. Cardiac tamponade results from an accumulation of fluid within the relatively noncompliant pericardium, leading to an increase in pericardial pressure. The increased pericardial pressure compresses the relatively low-pressure, right-sided heart chambers and restricts diastolic filling of the right side of the heart to cause obstructive shock. In addition to Beck's triad (ie, hypotension, distant heart sounds, jugular venous distension), other common signs of tamponade include an absent point of maximum impulse and pulsus paradoxus (ie, >10 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure with inspiration).\n\nIn tamponade, the compressed right atrium is decreased in size, and elevated right atrial pressures are transmitted backward to the vena cava, causing increased central venous pressure. With decreased right-sided filling, less blood is pumped through the pulmonary circulation to the left atrium and left ventricle, resulting in decreased stroke volume and cardiac output (and causing hypotension and shock). Although the volume of blood reaching the left atrium is reduced, left atrial pressure is increased due to external compression by the excessive pericardial fluid (Choices A, B, C, and E).\n\nAs tamponade progresses, diastolic pressures in all 4 cardiac chambers (ie, right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium [estimated by pulmonary capillary wedge pressure], left ventricle) increase and equalize with pericardial pressure (and with one another), eliminating the normal pressure gradients and stagnating blood flow within the heart.\n\nEducational objective:\nCardiac tamponade involves increased pericardial pressure that restricts diastolic filling of the right-sided heart chambers, leading to obstructive shock with increased central venous pressure and decreased stroke volume and cardiac output. As tamponade progresses, diastolic pressures in all 4 cardiac chambers increase and equalize with pericardial pressure (and with one another), stagnating blood flow within the heart.",
    "zh": "该患者的低血压、遥远的心音以及胸部X光片上心脏轮廓的新增大 {{exhibit_2}}，以及晚期恶性肿瘤的背景，与心脏压塞一致。心脏压塞是由于液体在相对不顺应的心包内积聚，导致心包压力升高。心包压力升高会压迫相对低压的右侧心脏腔室，并限制心脏右侧的舒张期充盈，从而导致梗阻性休克。除了Beck三联征（即低血压、遥远的心音、颈静脉扩张）外，压塞的其他常见体征包括心尖搏动消失和奇脉（即吸气时收缩压下降>10 mmHg）。\n\n在压塞中，受压的右心房减小，升高的右心房压力向后传递到腔静脉，导致中心静脉压升高。随着右侧充盈减少，流经肺循环到左心房和左心室的血液减少，导致每搏输出量和心输出量减少（并导致低血压和休克）。尽管到达左心房的血量减少，但由于过多的心包液的外部压迫，左心房压力升高（选项A、B、C和E）。\n\n随着压塞的进展，所有4个心脏腔室（即右心房、右心室、左心房[通过肺毛细血管楔压估计]、左心室）的舒张压升高并与心包压力（以及彼此之间）相等，从而消除了正常的压力梯度，导致心脏内的血流停滞。\n\n教育目标：\n心脏压塞涉及心包压力升高，限制右侧心脏腔室的舒张期充盈，导致梗阻性休克，中心静脉压升高，每搏输出量和心输出量减少。随着压塞的进展，所有4个心脏腔室的舒张压升高并与心包压力（以及彼此之间）相等，导致心脏内的血流停滞。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cardiac tamponade, its clinical presentation, and the resulting hemodynamic changes. It requires understanding of how increased pericardial pressure affects cardiac chamber size, central venous pressure, left atrial pressure, and stroke volume.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the signs of cardiac tamponade (hypotension, distant heart sounds, enlarged cardiac silhouette). Then, apply knowledge of the pathophysiology to deduce the hemodynamic consequences: increased central venous pressure, decreased right atrial size, increased left atrial pressure, and decreased stroke volume.",
