    "en": "A 24-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to fevers and chills over the last 24 hours. Three weeks ago, she underwent a partial bowel resection for Crohn disease without complications. Since the surgery, the patient has had difficulty eating and has a peripherally inserted central venous catheter in place through which she is receiving parenteral nutrition. {{exhibit_1}} Her temperature is 38.2 C (101 F), blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, and pulse is 114/min. {{exhibit_2}} The surgical wound healed well, and her abdomen is soft and nontender. {{exhibit_3}} The catheter site on the left arm is mildly tender but shows no erythema. {{exhibit_4}} Chest x-ray reveals a properly positioned central venous line and is otherwise unremarkable. {{exhibit_5}} Admission blood cultures subsequently return positive for yeast. {{exhibit_6}} The organism responsible for this patient's bloodstream infection is most likely to exhibit which of the following characteristics?",
    "zh": "一名24岁女性因过去24小时内出现发热和寒战而到急诊科就诊。三周前，她因克罗恩病接受了部分肠切除术，术后无并发症。自手术以来，患者进食困难，并置入了外周静脉置管，通过该置管接受肠外营养。{{exhibit_1}} 她的体温为38.2摄氏度（101华氏度），血压为100/60毫米汞柱，脉搏为114次/分。{{exhibit_2}} 手术切口愈合良好，腹部柔软且无压痛。{{exhibit_3}} 左臂的导管置入部位轻微触痛，但无红斑。{{exhibit_4}} 胸部X线显示中心静脉导管位置正确，无其他异常。{{exhibit_5}} 入院血培养随后酵母菌呈阳性。{{exhibit_6}} 导致该患者血流感染的病原体最有可能表现出以下哪种特征？"
