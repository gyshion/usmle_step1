    "en": "Randomization refers to the process of randomly (ie, by chance) assigning subjects to experimental groups (eg, treatment vs control group). Randomization prevents selection bias and potentially produces comparable groups by balancing the frequency of confounding variables (eg, sex, age, severity of disease) between experimental groups. Making experimental groups as similar as possible (except for the treatment assigned) cancels the effect that these characteristics may have on the outcome of interest.\n\nFor Example having that groups are dissimilar (ie, unbalanced) with respect to severity of disease may underestimate or overestimate the effect of a treatment, depending on which group has a greater proportion of severe cases. The best way to account for the effects of these variables is to randomly assign subjects to experimental groups. Afterward, the groups are analyzed to ensure that they are statistically similar in underlying variables, with the results often reported in a baseline characteristics table (eg, weight, sex, age).\n\nTherefore, randomization increases the likelihood that any difference observed between groups is due exclusively to the treatment and not to other characteristics.\n\n(Choices A and B) A blind study is a type of clinical trial in which either the participants or the researchers (ie, single blind) or both the participants and the researchers (ie, double blind) are unaware of treatment assignments. Although this study used randomization to assign patients to treatment groups, no information is provided regarding the awareness of participants or researchers to treatment assignments. By itself, randomization does not make a study blind.\n\n(Choice C) A study that analyzes all participants as initially allocated after randomization, regardless of what happens during the study period, is using an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. ITT is not a result of randomization; instead, it is used to preserve the effect of randomization.\n\n(Choice D) Depending on the randomization method (eg, simple, complete) used to allocate participants into experimental groups, a study may or may not result in groups that are similar in sample size. Regardless, the goal of randomization is not to create groups of similar size (which can be done trivially by alternating group assignment as patients enroll) but rather to make the underlying characteristics of experimental groups as similar as possible.\n\nEducational objective:\nRandomization refers to the process of using random methods to assign subjects to experimental groups. Its purpose is to make experimental groups as similar as possible (except for the treatment assignment) to ensure that any difference observed between groups is due exclusively to the treatment and not to other underlying factors.",
    "zh": "随机化是指将受试者随机（即，通过偶然）分配到实验组（例如，治疗组与对照组）的过程。随机化可防止选择偏倚，并通过平衡实验组之间的混杂变量（例如，性别、年龄、疾病严重程度）的频率来产生可比的组。使实验组尽可能相似（除了分配的治疗），可以消除这些特征可能对感兴趣结果产生的影响。\n\n例如，如果各组在疾病严重程度方面不同（即，不平衡），则可能会低估或高估治疗的效果，这取决于哪个组的重症病例比例更大。解决这些变量影响的最佳方法是将受试者随机分配到实验组。之后，对各组进行分析，以确保它们在潜在变量方面在统计学上相似，结果通常在基线特征表中报告（例如，体重、性别、年龄）。\n\n因此，随机化增加了在各组之间观察到的任何差异仅归因于治疗，而不是其他特征的可能性。\n\n（选项 A 和 B）盲法研究是一种临床试验，其中参与者或研究人员（即，单盲）或参与者和研究人员（即，双盲）都不知道治疗分配。尽管本研究使用随机化将患者分配到治疗组，但未提供有关参与者或研究人员对治疗分配的意识的信息。仅靠随机化并不能使研究盲法。\n\n（选项 C）一项研究在随机化后，无论研究期间发生什么情况，都按照最初的分配分析所有参与者，该研究正在使用意向性治疗 (ITT) 分析。ITT 并非随机化的结果；相反，它用于保留随机化的效果。\n\n（选项 D）根据用于将参与者分配到实验组的随机化方法（例如，简单、完整），一项研究可能产生或可能不产生样本量相似的组。无论如何，随机化的目标不是创建大小相似的组（通过在患者入组时交替组分配可以轻松实现），而是使实验组的潜在特征尽可能相似。\n\n教育目标：\n随机化是指使用随机方法将受试者分配到实验组的过程。其目的是使实验组尽可能相似（除了治疗分配），以确保在各组之间观察到的任何差异仅归因于治疗，而不是其他潜在因素。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of randomization in clinical trials and its purpose in creating comparable groups. Randomization aims to minimize selection bias and ensure that any observed differences between groups are attributable to the treatment rather than underlying characteristics.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize that randomization is primarily used to balance confounding variables and create groups that are as similar as possible at baseline. This helps to isolate the effect of the intervention being studied.",
