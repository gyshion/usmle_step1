    "en": "A 17-year-old boy is hospitalized with recent-onset insomnia, headaches, periodic agitation, and dysphagia. He is a high school student interested in becoming a veterinarian. He owns a snake, fish, and parrot. About 4 weeks ago, he went on a field trip to study bats in a cave. The patient has no known medical problems and is not taking any medications. He does not consume alcohol and has never used illicit drugs. Despite hospitalization and treatment, he develops painful spasms, progressive paralysis, and coma and dies. Which of the following interventions would have most likely prevented this student from developing this illness?",

    "en": "Restlessness, agitation, and dysphagia progressing to coma within weeks of exploring a bat cave is concerning for RABIES encephalitis. Although bats (and, almost as commonly, raccoons) are among the main sources of rabies in the United States, many patients with bat-derived rabies are not aware that they had been bitten.\n\nOnce in a wound, the virus travels retrograde via peripheral nerves to the dorsal root ganglia and then to the brain, where replication occurs. Common manifestations include a nonspecific, flu-like prodrome followed by an acute neurologic syndrome with agitation, persistent fever, variable consciousness, and painful spasms with swallowing or inspiration (causing dysphagia, hydrophobia, and aerophobia). Generalized flaccid paralysis and coma ensue, with most patients dying within weeks.\n\nProphylactic vaccination is recommended for individuals at high risk for exposure (eg, veterinarians, cave explorers, laboratory workers handling infected tissues, travelers to countries where rabid dogs are prevalent). Postexposure prophylaxis (a medical emergency) generally includes rabies immune globulin and vaccination: it is not effective after symptom onset. The approved rabies vaccines consist of various rhabdovirus strains grown in tissue cell culture and inactivated by beta-propiolactone.\n\n(Choices A, C, and F) No antirabies drugs targeting specific viral pathways (eg, cellular entry) are available, and interferon is not used in rabies management.\n\n(Choice D) Some live attenuated rabies vaccines have been used in wild animal populations, but none are currently recommended in humans. The varicella and yellow fever vaccines are live attenuated.\n\n(Choice E) Toxoid (prepared from formalin- or heat-treated toxin) can induce humoral immunity against the corresponding toxin without producing serious toxic effects. However, rabies does not appear predominantly toxin mediated. The tetanus-(reduced) diphtheria vaccine contains inactivated bacterial toxoids. Although tetanus presents with painful muscle spasms, there is no impairment in conciousness or awareness (unlike this patient).\n\nEducational objective:\nIn the United States, bats are the main source of rabies (only transmitted by mammals). Agitation and spasms progressing to coma within weeks of exposure is strongly suggestive of rabies encephalitis. Prophylactic vaccination is recommended for individuals at high risk for exposure to rabid animals or their tissues. The approved rabies vaccines consist of various rhabdovirus strains grown in tissue cell culture and then inactivated.",
    "zh": "在探索蝙蝠洞穴几周内，出现烦躁不安、激动和吞咽困难，并进展为昏迷，这提示患有狂犬病脑炎。虽然蝙蝠（以及几乎同样常见的浣熊）是美国狂犬病的主要来源，但许多蝙蝠来源的狂犬病患者并不知道自己被咬伤。\n\n一旦进入伤口，病毒通过周围神经逆行传播到背根神经节，然后传播到大脑，在那里发生复制。常见表现包括非特异性的、类似流感的先兆症状，随后出现急性神经系统综合征，表现为激动、持续发烧、意识改变和吞咽或吸气时出现疼痛性痉挛（导致吞咽困难、恐水症和恐气症）。出现全身性弛缓性麻痹和昏迷，大多数患者在几周内死亡。\n\n建议对高危人群（例如，兽医、洞穴探险者、处理感染组织的实验室工作人员、前往狂犬病犬猖獗国家的旅行者）进行预防性疫苗接种。暴露后预防（一种医疗急症）通常包括狂犬病免疫球蛋白和疫苗接种：在症状出现后无效。批准的狂犬病疫苗包括在组织细胞培养中生长的各种狂犬病毒株，并用β-丙内酯灭活。\n\n（选项A、C和F）没有针对特定病毒途径（例如，细胞进入）的抗狂犬病药物，并且干扰素不用于狂犬病的治疗。\n\n（选项D）一些减毒活狂犬病疫苗已用于野生动物种群，但目前不推荐用于人类。水痘和黄热病疫苗是减毒活疫苗。\n\n（选项E）类毒素（由福尔马林或热处理的毒素制备）可以诱导针对相应毒素的体液免疫力，而不会产生严重的毒性作用。然而，狂犬病似乎并非主要由毒素介导。破伤风-（减量）白喉疫苗含有灭活的细菌类毒素。虽然破伤风表现为疼痛性肌肉痉挛，但意识和警觉性没有受损（与该患者不同）。\n\n教育目标：\n在美国，蝙蝠是狂犬病的主要来源（仅由哺乳动物传播）。在接触后几周内出现激动和痉挛并进展为昏迷，强烈提示狂犬病脑炎。建议对有接触狂犬动物或其组织高风险的人员进行预防性疫苗接种。批准的狂犬病疫苗包括在组织细胞培养中生长的各种狂犬病毒株，然后灭活。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of rabies transmission, clinical presentation, and prevention strategies. It emphasizes the importance of considering rabies in patients with encephalitis symptoms after potential exposure to bats.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the patient's risk factors (bat cave exploration) and the classic symptoms of rabies encephalitis. Early prophylactic vaccination is crucial for preventing the disease progression.",
