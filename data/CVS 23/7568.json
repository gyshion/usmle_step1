    "en": "A 62-year-old, obese woman is brought to the hospital due to acute-onset chest pain and shortness of breath. Medical history includes hyperlipidemia, diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral artery disease. Two years ago, she had an ischemic stroke but had no residual neurologic deficits. The patient is a current smoker with a 30-pack-year history. After initial evaluation, she is taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where she has a cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmia and cannot be resuscitated. Autopsy reveals thrombotic occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. In addition, it shows 95% atherosclerotic narrowing of the proximal right renal artery but no significant stenosis of the left renal artery. Compared with the right kidney, this patient's left kidney is more likely to demonstrate which of the following findings?",

    "en": "Renal artery stenosis {{exhibit_1}} occurs most commonly in older individuals due to atherosclerosis. Hypoperfusion of the stenotic (right) kidney stimulates renin release by juxtaglomerular apparatus cells. Renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that causes systemic hypertension.\n\nUnilateral RAS causes morphologic changes that markedly differ in the stenotic (right) kidney and the nonstenotic (left) kidney. Narrowing of the renal artery in the stenotic (right) kidney leads to hypoperfusion and renal parenchymal ischemia, which manifests as diffuse cortical thinning, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and small crowded glomeruli. Juxtaglomerular apparatus enlargement can also occur due to chronic stimulation and increased renin release.\n\nIn contrast, the contralateral, nonstenotic (left) kidney is exposed to high blood pressure and therefore demonstrates typical signs of hypertensive nephrosclerosis, which is characterized by arteriolar wall thickening due to hyaline arteriolosclerosis (hyalinization of the arterioles due to extravasation of plasma proteins) and hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis (concentric smooth muscle cell proliferation in response to pressure [\"onion-skinning\"]).\n\n(Choices B, C, D, and E) With unilateral RAS, the nonstenotic (left) kidney develops significant arteriolosclerosis due to exposure to high blood pressure. This can lead to narrowing of the arteriolar lumen with subsequent ischemic changes. However, these ischemic findings would be much more prominent in the stenotic (right) kidney.\nEducational objective:\nIn unilateral renal artery stenosis, the narrowed renal artery causes hypoperfusion of the affected kidney with subsequent ischemic damage (eg, tubular atrophy, interstitial ischemia, glomerular crowding). In contrast, the contralateral kidney is exposed to high blood pressure and typically shows changes of hypertensive nephrosclerosis (eg, arteriolar wall thickening due to hyaline or hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis).",
    "zh": "肾动脉狭窄{{exhibit_1}}最常发生在老年人中，由动脉粥样硬化引起。狭窄（右侧）肾脏的灌注不足会刺激肾小球旁器细胞释放肾素。肾素将血管紧张素原转化为血管紧张素I，然后血管紧张素转换酶将其转化为血管紧张素II，后者是一种强效血管收缩剂，可引起全身性高血压。\n\n单侧RAS引起的形态学改变在狭窄（右侧）肾脏和非狭窄（左侧）肾脏中差异显着。狭窄（右侧）肾脏的肾动脉狭窄导致灌注不足和肾实质缺血，表现为弥漫性皮质变薄、肾小管萎缩、间质纤维化和小肾小球拥挤。由于慢性刺激和肾素释放增加，也可发生肾小球旁器增大。\n\n相比之下，对侧非狭窄（左侧）肾脏暴露于高血压，因此表现出高血压肾硬化的典型征象，其特征是由于透明变性动脉硬化（血浆蛋白外渗引起的动脉透明变性）和增生性动脉硬化（响应压力[“洋葱皮样”]的同心平滑肌细胞增生）导致的小动脉壁增厚。\n\n（选项 B、C、D 和 E） 对于单侧RAS，非狭窄（左侧）肾脏由于暴露于高血压而发展为显着的动脉硬化。这可导致小动脉管腔狭窄，继而发生缺血性改变。然而，这些缺血性发现将在狭窄（右侧）肾脏中更为突出。\n教育目标：\n在单侧肾动脉狭窄中，狭窄的肾动脉导致受影响的肾脏灌注不足，继而导致缺血性损伤（如肾小管萎缩、间质缺血、肾小球拥挤）。相反，对侧肾脏暴露于高血压，通常表现为高血压肾硬化的改变（例如，由于透明或增生性动脉硬化导致的小动脉壁增厚）。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology and morphological changes associated with unilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS) and its effects on both the stenotic and non-stenotic kidneys. It requires understanding of the renin-angiotensin system and the consequences of hypoperfusion and hypertension on renal tissue.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the right kidney is stenotic due to atherosclerosis, leading to hypoperfusion and ischemic changes. The left kidney, exposed to high blood pressure, will exhibit hypertensive nephrosclerosis, characterized by arteriolar wall thickening.",
