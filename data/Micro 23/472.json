    "en": "A 52-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to several days of vague chest pain and cough. He immigrated to the United States from Taiwan 20 years ago. Temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F). Physical examination reveals a decrescendo-type diastolic murmur over the right sternal border. Pulmonary auscultation reveals normal breath sounds with no wheezes or rales. Abdominal examination shows no organomegaly. Serum fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption testing is positive. Chest x-ray reveals mediastinal widening. The pathologic process most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms starts as which of the following?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's murmur is characteristic of AORTIC REGURGITATION, which, in the presence of mediastinal widening, suggests an AORTIC ANEURYSM that has dilated the aortic annulus. The positive serology for SYPHILIS (positive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS] test) suggests a \"luetic\" aneurysm, consistent with tertiary syphilis.\n\nTERTIARY SYPHILIS begins with VASA VASORUM ENDARTERITIS and obliteration, resulting in inflammation, ischemia, and weakening of the adventitia. Aneurysmal dilation of the thoracic aorta results and can extend to involve the aortic valve ring. Syphilitic aneurysms are uncommon in the United States.\n\n(Choice A) Intimal streaks are the earliest lesions of atherosclerosis. Severe, complicated intimal atheromas can destroy and weaken the underlying media, resulting in aortic aneurysms. However, the most common site of these lesions is in the abdominal aorta (below the origin of the renal arteries). Although atherosclerosis can promote aneurysm formation in the thoracic aorta, the positive FTA-ABS test makes atherosclerosis less likely to be the cause of this patient's symptoms.\n\n(Choices B and C) Intimal tear and medial degeneration (elastic tissue fragmentation and separation of the elastic and fibromuscular components of the tunica media by small, cleft-like spaces) are common histopathologic abnormalities seen with aortic dissections (severe chest pain radiating to the back), not aortic aneurysms.\n\n(Choice D) Large vessel arteritides with medial inflammation (eg, Takayasu, giant cell arteritis) might rarely promote an aortic aneurysm; however, they are not associated with a positive serology for syphilis.\n\nEducational objective: Tertiary syphilis can result in thoracic aortic aneurysm. If the aneurysm compresses adjacent structures and dilates the aortic valve ring, a murmur and mediastinal widening might be present. The pathogenesis begins with vasa vasorum endarteritis and obliteration, resulting in inflammation, ischemia, and weakening of the aortic adventitia. Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption testing is specific for syphilis.",
    "zh": "该患者的杂音是主动脉瓣关闭不全的特征，在纵隔增宽的情况下，提示主动脉瘤已扩张主动脉瓣环。梅毒血清学检查阳性（荧光密螺旋体抗体吸收试验[FTA-ABS]呈阳性）提示“梅毒性”动脉瘤，与三期梅毒一致。\n\n三期梅毒始于滋养血管内膜炎和闭塞，导致炎症、缺血和外膜减弱。出现胸主动脉瘤扩张并可延伸至累及主动脉瓣环。梅毒性动脉瘤在美国并不常见。\n\n（选项A）内膜条纹是动脉粥样硬化的最早病变。严重的、复杂的内膜粥样斑块会破坏并削弱潜在的中膜，导致主动脉瘤。然而，这些病变最常见的部位是在腹主动脉（肾动脉起始部以下）。虽然动脉粥样硬化可促进胸主动脉瘤的形成，但FTA-ABS试验阳性使得动脉粥样硬化不太可能是该患者症状的原因。\n\n（选项B和C）内膜撕裂和中膜变性（弹性组织碎裂以及中膜的弹性成分和纤维肌成分通过小的、类似裂隙的间隙分离）是常见于主动脉夹层（严重胸痛放射至背部）的组织病理学异常，而不是主动脉瘤。\n\n（选项D）伴有中膜炎症的大血管动脉炎（例如，高安氏病、巨细胞动脉炎）可能很少促进主动脉瘤；然而，它们与梅毒血清学检查阳性无关。\n\n教育目标：三期梅毒可导致胸主动脉瘤。如果动脉瘤压迫相邻结构并扩张主动脉瓣环，则可能出现杂音和纵隔增宽。发病机制始于滋养血管内膜炎和闭塞，导致炎症、缺血和主动脉外膜减弱。荧光密螺旋体抗体吸收试验对梅毒具有特异性。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of tertiary syphilis and its association with aortic aneurysms, specifically the pathogenesis involving vasa vasorum endarteritis. It also assesses the ability to differentiate between causes of aortic aneurysms based on clinical presentation and serological findings. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key findings: diastolic murmur, mediastinal widening, and positive syphilis serology. These findings point towards a syphilitic aneurysm, which is caused by vasa vasorum endarteritis in tertiary syphilis.",
