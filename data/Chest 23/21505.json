    "en": "Abnormal oxygen metabolism in sepsis {{exhibit_1}}\n\nThis patient has sepsis due to an infected diabetic foot ulcer with surrounding cellulitis. Sepsis is a florid host inflammatory response to infection that can lead to multiple organ system dysfunction.\n\nSeptic organ dysfunction is driven mainly by poor tissue oxygen use. This cellular dysoxia is caused by 3 major mechanisms:\n\n- Bacterial components (eg, endotoxin) and acute phase cytokines (eg, IL-1-beta) trigger production of free radicals that damage mitochondria and interfere with the electron transport chain. Immediate postmortem analysis of patients with sepsis reveals surprisingly minimal tissue necrosis but, often, extensive mitochondrial damage. This mitochondrial dysfunction leads to decreased oxidative phosphorylation with loss of ATP production. A compensatory bioenergetic shift toward glycolysis often results in lactic acidosis.\n\n- Widespread microcirculatory failure with vasodilation causes blood to shunt rapidly through organs, decreasing the opportunity for oxygen extraction.\n\n- Increased capillary permeability causes tissue edema (third spacing), which increases the diffusion distance for oxygen to reach mitochondria of target cells.\n\nBecause oxygen use decreases, the transorgan arteriovenous oxygen gradient is small; therefore, oxygen saturation of central venous blood (ScvO₂) (superior vena cava) – returning from the periphery – increases. Central venous catheters are often placed therapeutically to deliver medications; they can be used diagnostically to differentiate septic (↑ ScvO₂) from cardiogenic (↓ ScvO₂) shock.\n\n(Choice A) Cardiac output (oxygen delivery) is typically increased in sepsis due to systemic vasodilation (warm extremities, wide pulse pressure). Decreased cardiac output is the hallmark of severe heart failure (cold extremities, narrow pulse pressure), and ScvO₂ decreases with heart failure because peripheral oxygen consumption outstrips its delivery.\n\n(Choice C) Sepsis is associated with microvascular (rather than macrovascular) thrombosis due to endothelial injury and focal or disseminated intravascular coagulation, further impairing oxygenation. Widespread large-vessel thrombosis and infarction are seen in conditions such as catastrophic antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome.\n\n(Choice D) Sepsis can induce capillary permeability in the lung, leading to pulmonary edema with resultant arterial hypoxemia (acute respiratory distress syndrome). However, this patient's pulmonary function and oxygenation are intact, as evidenced by normal lung examination (no crackles) and arterial oxygen saturation.\n\n(Choice E) Hemoglobin oxygen unloading to peripheral tissues is facilitated by sepsis-induced (lactic) acidosis and fever, which lead to rightward shifting of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (ie, weaker oxygen-hemoglobin binding).\n\nEducational objective:\nSepsis is a host inflammatory response to infection that can lead to multiple organ dysfunction due to defective mitochondrial oxidative respiration, resulting in a widespread dissociation between oxygen delivery and extraction. This manifests as elevated central venous oxygen saturation. {{exhibit_2}}",
    "zh": "脓毒症中的异常氧代谢 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n该患者因足部糖尿病溃疡感染伴周围蜂窝织炎而患脓毒症。脓毒症是对感染的强烈宿主炎症反应，可导致多器官系统功能障碍。\n\n脓毒症引起的器官功能障碍主要由组织氧利用不良引起。这种细胞性缺氧由3个主要机制导致：\n\n- 细菌成分（如内毒素）和急性期细胞因子（如IL-1-β）触发自由基的产生，从而损伤线粒体并干扰电子传递链。脓毒症患者的即刻尸检分析显示，组织坏死出人意料地轻微，但往往有广泛的线粒体损伤。这种线粒体功能障碍导致氧化磷酸化降低，ATP 产生减少。代偿性生物能转移至糖酵解，通常导致乳酸性酸中毒。\n\n- 广泛的微循环衰竭伴有血管舒张，导致血液快速分流通过器官，降低了氧提取的机会。\n\n- 增加的毛细血管通透性导致组织水肿（第三间隙），从而增加了氧气到达靶细胞线粒体的扩散距离。\n\n由于氧气利用减少，器官间动静脉氧梯度很小；因此，中心静脉血（ScvO₂）（上腔静脉）的氧饱和度——从外周回流——增加。中心静脉导管通常用于治疗性给药；它们可用于诊断性地区分脓毒性（↑ ScvO₂）休克和心源性（↓ ScvO₂）休克。\n\n（选项A）在脓毒症中，由于全身血管舒张（肢端温暖，脉压增大），心输出量（氧输送）通常增加。心输出量减少是严重心力衰竭的标志（肢端冰冷，脉压变窄），并且在心力衰竭时，ScvO₂降低，因为外周氧消耗超过了其输送量。\n\n（选项C）脓毒症与微血管（而非大血管）血栓形成有关，这与内皮损伤以及局灶性或弥漫性血管内凝血有关，进一步损害氧合作用。广泛的大血管血栓形成和梗死可见于灾难性抗磷脂抗体综合征等疾病。\n\n（选项D）脓毒症可诱导肺毛细血管通透性，导致肺水肿和随之而来的动脉低氧血症（急性呼吸窘迫综合征）。然而，该患者的肺功能和氧合作用是完整的，这从正常的肺部检查（无啰音）和动脉血氧饱和度可见。\n\n（选项E）脓毒症引起的（乳酸性）酸中毒和发热促进血红蛋白对外周组织的氧释放，这导致氧合血红蛋白解离曲线右移（即，氧-血红蛋白结合减弱）。\n\n教学目标：\n脓毒症是对感染的宿主炎症反应，由于线粒体氧化呼吸缺陷，可导致多器官功能障碍，导致氧输送和提取之间广泛的分离。这表现为中心静脉氧饱和度升高。{{exhibit_2}}"
