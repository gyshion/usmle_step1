    "en": "A 45-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, fever, and confusion. The patient's husband reports that, yesterday,shebegan to have worsening right-sided abdominal pain associated with nausea and several episodes of vomiting. This morning, she has been slow to respond and is confused about where she is. The patient has a history of depression and takes sertraline. Temperature is 39.5 C (103.1 F), blood pressure is 88/50 mm Hg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 26/min. She appears ill and confused, and the sclera are icteric. Abdominal examination demonstrates significant tenderness with guarding in the right upper quadrant.",

    "en": "This patient with fever, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, jaundice, confusion, and hypotension has ACUTE CHOLANGITIS (AC). AC is a life-threatening infection that typically develops in the setting of biliary obstruction, which enables bacteria to proliferate within the biliary tree. Obstruction can occur in a variety of settings (eg, malignant biliary obstruction, biliary stricture) but is most commonly caused by a calculous obstruction of the common bile duct (ie, choledocholithiasis).\n\nAC is characterized by FEVER, RUQ PAIN, and JAUNDICE (Charcot triad); HYPOTENSION and ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (Reynold pentad) occur in severe cases. Laboratory findings include leukocytosis, direct hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated alkaline phosphatase. Abdominal imaging (eg, ultrasound) demonstrates common bile duct dilation, possibly with evidence of an obstructing stone. Management includes antibiotics, intravenous fluid resuscitation, and endoscopic or percutaneous techniques to relieve the biliary obstruction.\n\n(Choice A) Acute pancreatitis is characterized by acinar cell dysfunction and necrosis. Although patients can develop fever and hypotension, typical manifestations include epigastric pain radiating into the back, nausea/vomiting, and elevated lipase. Jaundice is unexpected unless a gallstone obstructs both the common bile and the pancreatic ducts, resulting in simultaneous AC.\n\n(Choice C) Hepatic sarcoidosis, which causes extensive noncaseating granuloma formation in the liver, can present with cholestasis (eg, elevated alkaline phosphatase, jaundice, pruritus) and hepatomegaly. However, sepsis, hypotension, and confusion are unexpected, and most patients have evidence of systemic sarcoidosis (eg, hilar adenopathy, cough).\n\n(Choice D) Autoimmune hepatitis causes immune-mediated hepatocyte destruction and usually presents with asymptomatic transaminitis or the insidious onset of fatigue and anorexia. Fever, tachycardia, and hypotension are unexpected and more consistent with infection due to AC.\n\n(Choice E) Acetaminophen overdose can cause RUQ pain, jaundice, vomiting, and confusion, typically around 72 hours after ingestion. However, fever is atypical and more consistent with AC.\n\n(Choice F) Although a mass in the pancreatic head can cause biliary obstruction, pancreatic tail masses are not located near the biliary tree and therefore are not usually associated with AC. They more commonly present with epigastric abdominal pain and weight loss.",
    "zh": "该患者出现发热、右上象限（RUQ）疼痛、黄疸、意识模糊和低血压，患有急性胆管炎（AC）。AC 是一种危及生命的感染，通常发生在胆道梗阻的情况下，这使得细菌能够在胆道内增殖。梗阻可能发生在多种情况下（例如，恶性胆道梗阻、胆道狭窄），但最常见的原因是胆总管结石梗阻（即，胆管结石病）。\n\nAC 的特征是发热、右上象限疼痛和黄疸（Charcot 三联征）；在严重病例中，会出现低血压和精神状态改变（Reynold 五联征）。实验室检查结果包括白细胞增多、直接胆红素血症和碱性磷酸酶升高。腹部影像学检查（例如，超声）显示胆总管扩张，可能伴有梗阻性结石的证据。治疗包括抗生素、静脉输液复苏以及内镜或经皮技术以缓解胆道梗阻。\n\n（选项 A）急性胰腺炎的特征是腺泡细胞功能障碍和坏死。尽管患者可能出现发热和低血压，但典型表现包括向后放射的上腹部疼痛、恶心/呕吐和脂肪酶升高。除非胆结石同时阻塞胆总管和胰管，导致同时发生 AC，否则黄疸是意料之外的。\n\n（选项 C）肝结节病可引起肝脏内广泛的非干酪性肉芽肿形成，可表现为胆汁淤积（例如，碱性磷酸酶升高、黄疸、瘙痒）和肝肿大。然而，脓毒症、低血压和意识模糊是意料之外的，并且大多数患者有全身性结节病的证据（例如，肺门淋巴结病、咳嗽）。\n\n（选项 D）自身免疫性肝炎会导致免疫介导的肝细胞破坏，通常表现为无症状的转氨酶升高或疲劳和厌食的隐匿性发作。发热、心动过速和低血压是意料之外的，并且更符合 AC 引起的感染。\n\n（选项 E）对乙酰氨基酚过量可引起 RUQ 疼痛、黄疸、呕吐和意识模糊，通常在摄入后约 72 小时发生。然而，发热是不典型的，更符合 AC。\n\n（选项 F）虽然胰头部肿瘤可引起胆道梗阻，但胰尾部肿瘤不在胆道附近，因此通常与 AC 无关。它们更常见地表现为上腹部腹痛和体重减轻。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of acute cholangitis, its clinical presentation (Charcot's triad and Reynold's pentad), and common underlying causes such as biliary obstruction. It also requires differentiating acute cholangitis from other conditions presenting with abdominal pain and jaundice. \n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic symptoms of acute cholangitis (fever, RUQ pain, jaundice, confusion, hypotension).
