    "en": "A 25-year-old man comes to the hospital due to worsening abdominal pain, distension, and nausea and vomiting for 3 days. He has a 4-year history of recurrent abdominal pain associated with diarrhea, low-grade fever, and easy fatigability. The symptoms usually occur after stress and resolve spontaneously in a few days. However, this time, the patient's symptoms persisted and worsened. He has no other medical problems and takes no medications on a regular basis. Temperature is 38.2 C (100.8 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 16/min. BMI is 19 kg/m². Examination shows a tender mass in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Imaging is consistent with small-bowel obstruction. Laparotomy reveals that the abdominal mass is composed of inflamed small bowel, adherent and indurated mesentery, and enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. The affected region of this patient's intestine is resected. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on histologic examination of this patient's intestine?",

    "en": "This patient with recurrent abdominal pain and diarrhea likely has Crohn disease (CD) complicated by small-bowel obstruction. CD is an inflammatory bowel disease that occurs most commonly in young adults. It typically presents as recurrent episodes of abdominal pain associated with diarrhea, low-grade fevers, and fatigue; symptoms may worsen during periods of stress. The inflammation can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus and is typically patchy with interspersed areas of normal bowel (skip lesions). CD is characterized by transmural inflammation (all layers of the bowel wall are involved), which predisposes to several complications:\n\nStrictures occur as a result of bowel wall edema, fibrosis, and hypertrophy (thickening) of the muscularis mucosae, which narrows the intestinal lumen. This can progress to bowel obstruction.\n\nFistulas occur when ulcers penetrate the entire thickness of the intestinal wall, leading to a sinus tract that communicates between multiple organs (eg, enterovesicular, enterovaginal, enterenteric).\n\nAbscesses form when sinus tracts become walled off. They can also perforate, leading to diffuse peritonitis.\n\n(Choice A) Caseating granulomas are typically seen in multiple infectious processes, most notably tuberculosis (TB). Abdominal TB can present with abdominal pain, fevers, and occasional obstruction; however, symptoms are unlikely to spontaneously wax and wane, and evidence of TB is often present in other sites (eg, hemoptysis with pulmonary TB). CD is associated with noncaseating, rather than caseating, granulomas.\n\n(Choice B) Flask-shaped ulcers in the cecum and colon are seen in Entamoeba histolytica infection, which occurs more commonly in developing countries and presents with bloody diarrhea. Severe cases can cause fulminant colitis with bowel necrosis, but obstruction is uncommon.\n\n(Choice C) Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease that involves only the mucosa and submucosa. Inflammation involves contiguous areas of the colon only, and the small bowel is not involved. Due to the superficial nature of the inflammation, strictures and fistulas are not seen.\n\n(Choice D) Pseudomembranes composed of fibrin and inflammatory debris are seen with Clostridium difficile infection, which is typically associated with antibiotic use. Complications include toxic megacolon; however, C difficile does not cause obstruction and the small bowel is not typically involved. {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "这位有反复腹痛和腹泻的患者可能患有克罗恩病(CD)，并伴有小肠梗阻。CD是一种炎症性肠病，最常发生在年轻人中。它通常表现为反复发作的腹痛，伴有腹泻、低热和疲劳；症状可能在应激期间加重。炎症可影响胃肠道的任何部位，从口腔到肛门，并且通常呈斑片状分布，散布着正常肠道的区域（跳跃性病灶）。CD的特征是全层炎症（涉及肠壁的所有层），这易于发生几种并发症：\n\n狭窄是由于肠壁水肿、纤维化和黏膜肌肥大（增厚）引起的，从而使肠腔变窄。这可能会发展成肠梗阻。\n\n瘘管发生在溃疡穿透肠壁的整个厚度时，从而导致在多个器官之间（例如，肠膀胱瘘，肠阴道瘘，肠肠瘘）建立交通的窦道。\n\n脓肿形成于窦道被封闭时。它们也可能穿孔，导致弥漫性腹膜炎。\n\n(选项 A) 干酪性肉芽肿通常见于多种感染过程，最显着的是结核病(TB)。腹部结核病可表现为腹痛、发热和偶尔的梗阻；然而，症状不太可能自发地缓解和恶化，并且通常在其他部位存在结核病证据（例如，咯血伴肺结核）。CD与非干酪性肉芽肿相关，而不是干酪性肉芽肿。\n\n(选项 B) 盲肠和结肠中的瓶状溃疡见于溶组织内阿米巴感染，这种感染更常见于发展中国家，并表现为血性腹泻。严重病例可引起暴发性结肠炎伴肠坏死，但梗阻不常见。\n\n(选项 C) 溃疡性结肠炎是一种炎症性肠病，仅涉及黏膜和黏膜下层。炎症仅涉及结肠的连续区域，并且不涉及小肠。由于炎症的表层性质，未见狭窄和瘘管。\n\n(选项 D)由纤维蛋白和炎性碎屑组成的假膜见于艰难梭菌感染，这通常与抗生素的使用有关。并发症包括中毒性巨结肠；然而，艰难梭菌不会引起梗阻，并且通常不涉及小肠。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"
