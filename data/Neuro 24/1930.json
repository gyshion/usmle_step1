    "en": "A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after sustaining stab injuries in a street fight. The patient feels lightheaded and dizzy. Blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg and pulse is 115/min. Physical examination shows profuse bleeding from penetrating wounds over the right neck and shoulder area. Intravenous fluids are administered, and a blood transfusion is initiated. Urgent surgical exploration is performed, and injured blood vessels are repaired. Further exploration shows complete transection of a specific nerve, which is indicated by the arrow in the image below. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "The image {{exhibit_2}} shows the radial nerve. The radial nerve is the largest branch of the brachial plexus and receives fibers from C5-T1. It innervates all the extensor muscles of the upper limb below the shoulder and provides sensory innervation to the skin of the posterior arm, forearm, and dorsal lateral hand. This nerve tracks within the radial groove on the humerus; therefore, it is vulnerable to traumatic injury at the humeral midshaft. The nerve can also be injured (eg, penetrating stab wound) during its superficial course within the axilla. Patients with proximal radial nerve neuropathy typically have weakness during wrist and finger extension (wrist drop) and variable sensory loss over the posterior arm and forearm. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}\n\n(Choices A, B, D, and E) Damage to the median or ulnar nerve can result in weakness on wrist flexion. Damage to the median nerve can also result in weakness on thumb opposition, whereas ulnar nerve damage may limit finger abduction and thumb adduction.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe radial nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin of the posterior arm, forearm, and dorsal lateral hand and provides motor innervation to all the extensor muscles of the upper limb below the shoulder. Damage to the proximal radial nerve (eg, at the axilla or midshaft humerus) may result in wrist drop.\n\nAnatomy\nNervous System\nBrachial plexus",
