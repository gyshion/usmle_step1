    "en": "A 57-year-old man is being evaluated for progressive shortness of breath. His respiratory flow-volume curve is shown below {{exhibit_1}}.\n\nFlow-volume loops plot air velocity in relation to lung volume during a cycle of maximal inspiration and expiration. This patient's flow-volume loop exhibits a leftward shift indicating INCREASED total lung capacity and residual volume. In addition, there is a characteristic \"scooped-out\" expiratory pattern consistent with the reduced expiratory flow rates seen in chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in COPD is partially due to anatomic narrowing of the bronchi (chronic bronchitis). In addition, decreased lung elasticity resulting from destruction of interalveolar walls (emphysema) promotes dynamic compression of the airways during expiration (intrapleural pressure becomes greater than airway pressure), further contributing to expiratory airflow obstruction.\n\nHyperinflation in COPD also reduces the inspiratory reserve volume, limiting the maximal tidal volume. This is especially true during exercise, when expiration time is limited. Because patients with COPD require extra time for exhalation, increasing amounts of air can be trapped in the lungs during rapid breathing, leading to further reduction in tidal volume. This is known as dynamic hyperinflation and is believed to be a major cause of dyspnea and exercise limitation in COPD.",
    "zh": "一名57岁男性因进行性呼吸困难就诊。他的呼吸流量-容积曲线如下图所示 {{exhibit_1}}。\n\n流量-容积环描绘了在最大吸气和呼气循环中，空气速度与肺容积的关系。该患者的流量-容积环表现出向左移位，表明总肺活量和残气量增加。此外，还存在特征性的“铲形”呼气模式，这与慢性阻塞性肺疾病 (COPD) 中看到的呼气流速降低相符。COPD 中的气流阻塞部分是由于支气管的解剖狭窄（慢性支气管炎）引起的。此外，由于肺泡间壁的破坏（肺气肿）导致肺弹性降低，从而促进呼气期间气道的动态压迫（胸腔内压力大于气道压力），进一步导致呼气气流阻塞。\n\nCOPD 中的过度充气也会降低吸气储备容积，从而限制最大潮气量。这在运动期间尤为明显，因为呼气时间受到限制。由于 COPD 患者需要额外的呼气时间，因此在快速呼吸期间，越来越多的空气可能滞留在肺部，导致潮气量进一步减少。这被称为动态过度充气，被认为是 COPD 患者呼吸困难和运动受限的主要原因。"

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "(Choice A) Alveolar hyaline membranes are seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome. The pulmonary edema tends to reduce lung compliance, causing a restrictive flow-volume pattern (purple curve).\n\n(Choice B) Atelectasis due to extrinsic pulmonary compression may occur when the pleural cavity fills with air (ie, pneumothorax) or fluid (eg, exudate, blood). Lung volumes and total lung compliance are likely reduced under such conditions, producing a restrictive flow-volume pattern.\n\n(Choice D) Diffuse intraalveolar hemorrhage tends to dilute alveolar surfactant, increasing alveolar surface tension and promoting alveolar atelectasis. These changes would reduce lung volumes and lung compliance, resulting in a restrictive flow-volume pattern.\n\n(Choice E) Pulmonary fibrosis tends to decrease lung volume and compliance, producing a restrictive pattern. In restrictive diseases, total lung capacity and residual volume are reduced. The expiratory flow rate is increased relative to the low lung volumes but is reduced compared to normal peak expiratory flow rates.\n\n(Choice F) In pulmonary thromboembolism there is decreased perfusion but minimal effect on ventilation. Therefore, the flow-volume curve will remain mostly normal.\n\nEducational objective: The flow-volume loop for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by increased residual volume and total lung capacity, as well as a \"scooped-out\" expiratory pattern due to reduced expiratory flow rates. Both airway narrowing due to chronic bronchitis and decreased elasticity due to emphysematous destruction of interalveolar walls are responsible for the hyperinflation and airflow limitation. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "(选项 A) 肺泡透明膜见于急性呼吸窘迫综合征。肺水肿往往会降低肺顺应性，导致限制性流量-容积模式（紫色曲线）。\n\n(选项 B) 当胸膜腔充满空气（即气胸）或液体（例如渗出液、血液）时，可能会发生由于外源性肺压迫引起的肺不张。在这种情况下，肺容积和总肺顺应性可能会降低，从而产生限制性流量-容积模式。\n\n(选项 D) 弥漫性肺泡内出血往往会稀释肺泡表面活性剂，增加肺泡表面张力，促进肺泡不张。这些变化将减少肺容积和肺顺应性，从而导致限制性流量-容积模式。\n\n(选项 E) 肺纤维化往往会降低肺容积和顺应性，产生限制性模式。在限制性疾病中，总肺活量和残气量减少。呼气流量相对于低肺容积增加，但与正常峰值呼气流量相比有所降低。\n\n(选项 F) 在肺血栓栓塞中，灌注减少，但对通气的影响很小。因此，流量-容积曲线将基本保持正常。\n\n教育目标：慢性阻塞性肺疾病的流量-容积环的特征是残气量和总肺活量增加，以及由于呼气流速降低而出现的“铲形”呼气模式。慢性支气管炎导致的气道狭窄和肺气肿性肺泡间壁破坏导致的弹性降低均是导致过度充气和气流受限的原因。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"
