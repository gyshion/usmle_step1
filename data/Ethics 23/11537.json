  "explanation": {
    "en": "New patient visits should always include a thorough review of current medications (including over-the-counter medications) to determine if any are inappropriate and/or causing adverse effects or problematic drug-drug interactions. The risk of adverse drug events increases with the number of medications, and minimizing the use of non-essential medications can reduce the risk of an adverse event. This patient is likely experiencing anticholinergic side effects (ie, urinary retention, constipation) due to the combined anticholinergic effects of amitriptyline and diphenhydramine. ANTICHOLINERGIC side effects are particularly common in older adults and can also include impaired memory, confusion, hallucinations, dry mouth, blurry vision, impaired sweating, tachycardia, and increased risk for falls. Physicians should prioritize discontinuing unnecessary medications prior to pursuing further workup or adding additional medications for chronic problems. In this case, diphenhydramine should be discontinued as it is highly anticholinergic and has not helped with the patient's chronic insomnia.\n\n(Choice A) Although topiramate can be considered for migraine prevention, discontinuing unnecessary medication that is causing adverse effects takes priority.\n\n(Choice B) Zolpidem is a pharmacological treatment option for insomnia but should not be added to the patient's regimen as it has adverse effects in older adults, including increased risk of falls and confusion. Non-pharmacological strategies (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy) are preferred for initial management of primary insomnia in older adults.\n\n(Choices C and E) Cystography is not indicated as this patient's urinary retention is more likely due to anticholinergic side effects. A head CT scan would be extremely low yield in this patient with chronic headaches.\n\n(Choice F) Increasing the dose of amitriptyline would likely exacerbate the patient's anticholinergic side effects.",
    "zh": "初诊复诊应始终包括对当前药物（包括非处方药）的彻底审查，以确定是否有任何药物不适宜和/或引起不良反应或有问题的药物-药物相互作用。不良药物事件的风险随着药物数量的增加而增加，并且尽量减少非必需药物的使用可以降低不良事件的风险。该患者可能正在经历抗胆碱能副作用（即，尿潴留、便秘），这归因于阿米替林和苯海拉明的联合抗胆碱能作用。抗胆碱能副作用在老年人中特别常见，也可能包括记忆力受损、意识模糊、幻觉、口干、视力模糊、出汗障碍、心动过速和跌倒风险增加。医生应优先停用不必要的药物，然后再进行进一步的检查或为慢性问题添加额外的药物。在这种情况下，应停用苯海拉明，因为它具有高度的抗胆碱能作用，并且对患者的慢性失眠没有帮助。\n\n（选项A）虽然可以考虑使用托吡酯预防偏头痛，但停用引起不良反应的不必要药物是优先事项。\n\n（选项B）唑吡坦是失眠的药物治疗选择，但不应添加到患者的治疗方案中，因为它在老年人中具有不良反应，包括跌倒和意识模糊的风险增加。对于老年人的原发性失眠的初始管理，首选非药物策略（例如，认知行为疗法）。\n\n（选项C和E）膀胱造影没有指征，因为该患者的尿潴留更可能是由于抗胆碱能副作用所致。对于患有慢性头痛的该患者，头部CT扫描的收益将极低。\n\n（选项F）增加阿米替林的剂量可能会加重患者的抗胆碱能副作用。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the ability to recognize anticholinergic side effects from multiple medications, particularly in elderly patients, and to prioritize medication review and discontinuation as a first step in management.\n\nThe best approach is to identify the patient's symptoms (urinary retention, constipation) and recognize that they are likely due to the combined anticholinergic effects of amitriptyline and diphenhydramine. Discontinuing the unnecessary diphenhydramine is the most appropriate initial step.",
