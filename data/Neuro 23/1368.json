    "en": "A pharmaceutical company has developed a novel medication for use in pregnancy. In preclinical studies, labor is induced in experimental pregnant animals using oxytocin. An intrauterine pressure catheter is used to monitor uterine contractions. After measurable, regular uterine contractions are achieved, intravenous infusion of the new medication is started. Observed changes in uterine activity are shown below {{exhibit_1}}.\n\nIn addition to its effects on uterine pressure, the new drug is found to lower serum potassium levels.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This novel medication that induces hypokalemia while reducing uterine contractions during pregnancy is most likely a beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist. Beta-2 receptors are ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, with the lungs and vasculature having the greatest tissue density. Receptor activation results in bronchodilation and vasodilation due to smooth muscle relaxation; in addition, beta-2 stimulation can also modulate key functions of other organs (eg, uterus).\n\nOnce a fetus grows to a sufficiently large size, myometrial distension signals the maternal hypothalamus to produce and release oxytocin into the bloodstream. Oxytocin then binds to receptors located on the myometrium, leading to opening of membrane-bound calcium channels and muscular contraction. In addition, oxytocin binding stimulates the production of prostaglandins (PGE₁, PGE₂, PGF₂α) that also induce contraction (Choice E). If contractions begin too early (ie, preterm labor), pregnancy may be prolonged by using inhibitors of uterine contraction (tocolytics). Stimulation of myometrial beta-2 receptors decreases intracellular calcium within myometrial cells, impairing uterine contraction.\n\nBeta-2 receptors also regulate activity of the sodium-potassium pump located on all cells. This pump maintains the resting membrane potential by driving sodium extracellularly and potassium intracellularly. Overstimulation of beta-2 receptors can lead to significant potassium internalization, resulting in hypokalemia.\n\n(Choices B and D) Magnesium sulfate and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) competitively block membrane calcium channels, preventing the influx of calcium needed to stimulate contraction. Magnesium inhibits renal outer medullary potassium excretion channels in the kidneys, leading to hyperkalemia. CCBs alone do not alter potassium levels.\n\n(Choice C) Methylergonovine, an ergot alkaloid, is used to increase uterine contractions (uterotonic) through its activity on the 5-HT₂ₐ receptor. It can be used to treat postpartum hemorrhage by stimulating the myometrium to clamp down on uterine vessels.\n\nEducational objective:\nAlthough beta-2 receptors are predominant in the lungs and vasculature, they are also found on all cell membranes, including those of the uterus. Stimulation of uterine receptors results in smooth muscle relaxation (tocolysis), while stimulation of sodium-potassium ATPase pumps can result in hypokalemia. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "这种在妊娠期间诱导低钾血症，同时减少子宫收缩的新型药物最有可能是一种β-2 肾上腺素能受体激动剂。β-2 受体在全身广泛表达，肺和血管的组织密度最高。受体激活导致支气管扩张和血管扩张，这是由于平滑肌松弛；此外，β-2 刺激还可以调节其他器官（例如，子宫）的关键功能。\n\n一旦胎儿生长到足够大的尺寸，子宫肌层扩张会向母体下丘脑发出信号，使其产生并将催产素释放到血液中。然后，催产素与位于子宫肌层的受体结合，导致膜结合的钙通道开放和肌肉收缩。此外，催产素结合刺激前列腺素（PGE₁、PGE₂、PGF₂α）的产生，这些前列腺素也会诱导收缩（选项E）。如果收缩开始过早（即早产），可以通过使用子宫收缩抑制剂（宫缩抑制剂）来延长妊娠。刺激子宫肌层β-2受体可减少子宫肌细胞内的钙，从而削弱子宫收缩。\n\nβ-2 受体还调节位于所有细胞上的钠钾泵的活性。该泵通过将钠驱动到细胞外，将钾驱动到细胞内来维持静息膜电位。过度刺激β-2 受体可导致钾的大量内化，从而导致低钾血症。\n\n（选项B和D）硫酸镁和钙通道阻滞剂（CCB）竞争性地阻断膜钙通道，阻止刺激收缩所需的钙内流。镁抑制肾脏中的肾髓质外钾排泄通道，导致高钾血症。CCB本身不会改变钾水平。\n\n（选项C）麦角生物碱甲基麦角新碱通过其对 5-HT₂ₐ 受体的活性用于增加子宫收缩（子宫收缩剂）。它可用于治疗产后出血，方法是刺激子宫肌层收缩子宫血管。\n\n教育目标：\n尽管β-2 受体主要存在于肺和血管中，但它们也存在于所有细胞膜上，包括子宫膜。刺激子宫受体导致平滑肌松弛（宫缩抑制），而刺激钠钾 ATP 酶泵可导致低钾血症。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of beta-2 adrenergic agonists and their effects on uterine contractions and potassium levels during pregnancy. It also assesses understanding of other agents used in obstetrics and their mechanisms of action.\n\nTo solve this question, analyze the provided information about the drug's effects (reducing uterine contractions and lowering potassium levels) and match it to the known effects of the answer choices. Beta-2 agonists are known to cause both of these effects.",
