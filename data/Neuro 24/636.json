    "en": "A 15-year-old girl comes to the office with gait instability. Since age 12, the patient has had mild weakness and \"clumsiness\" in her lower limbs that have progressed. She has to hold on to the railing when walking down stairs due to several recent falls. Physical examination reveals kyphoscoliosis, pes cavus, and bilateral lower extremity ataxia. Joint position and vibration sense are also impaired. Further evaluation reveals that she is suffering from an inherited disease. This patient is at greatest risk of dying from which of the following conditions?",

    "en": "This patient likely has FRIEDREICH ATAXIA, an autosomal recessive condition that typically presents during childhood/adolescence with progressive gait ataxia (due to degeneration of the spinocerebellar tracts) and impaired joint and vibration sense (due to degeneration of the posterior columns and dorsal root ganglia). Lateral corticospinal tract involvement may result in spastic muscle weakness and a positive Babinski sign. Other characteristic features of Friedreich ataxia include HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY, skeletal abnormalities (eg, kyphoscoliosis, pes cavus), and diabetes mellitus. Complications from cardiomyopathy (eg, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure) are the MOST COMMON CAUSE OF DEATH.\n\n(Choice A) Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder associated with aortic dissection, mitral valve prolapse, ectopia lentis, and skeletal findings (eg, pectus excavatum, arachnodactyly, joint hypermobility).\n\n(Choice B) Neurofibromatosis types 1 (NF1) and 2 (NF2) are autosomal dominant disorders. NF1 is associated with optic gliomas, whereas NF2 is associated with bilateral acoustic schwannomas and meningiomas.\n\n(Choices D and F) Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease usually presents in adults and is associated with hypertension, renal failure, and intracranial bleeding due to ruptured Berry aneurysms.\n\n(Choice E) Wilson disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with liver failure, movement abnormalities, and psychiatric symptoms.\n\nEducational objective:\nFriedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive condition that presents during childhood/adolescence with progressive gait ataxia (due to degeneration of the spinocerebellar tracts) and impaired joint and vibration sense (due to degeneration of the posterior columns and dorsal root ganglia). Other features include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (most common cause of death), skeletal abnormalities (eg, kyphoscoliosis, pes cavus), and diabetes mellitus.",
    "zh": "该患者可能患有FRIDREICH共济失调，这是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，通常在儿童/青少年时期出现，表现为进行性步态共济失调（由于脊髓小脑束变性）以及关节位置觉和振动觉受损（由于后柱和背根神经节变性）。侧皮质脊髓束受累可能导致痉挛性肌肉无力和Babinski征阳性。Friedreich共济失调的其他特征包括肥厚型心肌病、骨骼异常（如脊柱侧后凸、弓形足）和糖尿病。心肌病的并发症（如心律失常、充血性心力衰竭）是导致死亡的最常见原因。\n\n（选项A）马凡综合征是一种常染色体显性遗传结缔组织疾病，与主动脉夹层、二尖瓣脱垂、晶状体异位和骨骼表现（如漏斗胸、蜘蛛指、关节过度活动）相关。\n\n（选项B）神经纤维瘤病1型（NF1）和2型（NF2）是常染色体显性遗传病。NF1与视神经胶质瘤相关，而NF2与双侧听神经鞘瘤和脑膜瘤相关。\n\n（选项D和F）常染色体显性遗传性多囊肾病通常在成年人中出现，并与高血压、肾衰竭和因Berry动脉瘤破裂引起的颅内出血相关。\n\n（选项E）Wilson病（肝豆状核变性）是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，与肝衰竭、运动异常和精神症状相关。\n\n教育目标：\nFriedreich共济失调是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，在儿童/青少年时期出现，表现为进行性步态共济失调（由于脊髓小脑束变性）以及关节位置觉和振动觉受损（由于后柱和背根神经节变性）。其他特征包括肥厚型心肌病（最常见的死亡原因）、骨骼异常（如脊柱侧后凸、弓形足）和糖尿病。"
