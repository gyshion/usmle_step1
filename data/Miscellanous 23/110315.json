    "en": "A 35-year-old woman comes to the office due to weakness and double vision for the last month. She reports that she feels well at the beginning of the day, but by the end of her shift at the warehouse, she starts having double vision and difficulty getting boxes on and off shelves. Serum anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies are positive. Over the next few months, she has a poor response to anticholinesterase therapy, so thymectomy is recommended. The patient is concerned because she read that the thymus is part of the immune system and is wondering whether she will need to repeat her childhood vaccinations. Which of the following best explains the reason that the patient would not need repeat immunizations after the surgery?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "T-lymphocytes are produced in the bone marrow and migrate to the thymus. In the thymus, they undergo T-cell receptor gene rearrangement, positive selection, negative selection, and differentiation into helper (CD4+) and cytotoxic (CD8+) T-cells. Most naive T-cells are produced during gestation and early infancy, and congenital absence of the thymus (eg, DiGeorge syndrome) or its removal in infancy or early childhood leads to severe immunodeficiencies.\n\nProduction of T cells declines significantly after birth and even more so during infancy and early childhood; another sharp decline in production is seen during puberty. Although, very few naive T cells are produced in adults, the existing naive T cell pool is a relatively stable, self-sustaining population that only slowly declines with age.\n\nImmunization stimulates naive T and B cells to produce long-lasting populations of memory T and B cells. The long-lived protective immunity generated by vaccines relies on the longevity of the memory T and B cell populations, not the production of new, naive T cells from the thymus. Although removal of the thymus decrease new naive T cell production and somewhat accelerates the age-related decline in T-cell repertoire, it has little impact on memory cell populations established through childhood vaccinations.\n\n(Choice A) T-cell maturation is dependent on the thymus; lymph nodes cannot take over this function. The population of T cells in adults is maintained mostly by division of mature T cells rather than production and maturation of new ones. This is in contrast to B cells, which are generated in the bone marrow throughout life.\n\n(Choice C) The prevalence of ectopic thymic tissue is unclear, but the function of thymic tissue in producing naive T cells declines significantly with age regardless of location.\n\n(Choice D) Overexpression of the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) can suppress the ability of cytotoxic T-cells to induce apoptosis by converting them into regulatory T cells (ie, T-cell exhaustion). This is seen with several forms of cancer (eg, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma) but not with administration of vaccines.\n\n(Choice E) Autoantibodies produced in patients with myasthenia gravis are specific to the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction (eg, acetylcholine receptor, muscle-specific tyrosine kinase) and do not typically cross-react with vaccines.",
    "zh": "T 淋巴细胞在骨髓中产生并迁移到胸腺。在胸腺中，它们经历 T 细胞受体基因重排、阳性选择、阴性选择，并分化为辅助性（CD4+）和细胞毒性（CD8+）T 细胞。大多数初始 T 细胞是在妊娠期和婴儿早期产生的，先天性胸腺缺失（例如，DiGeorge 综合征）或在婴儿期或幼儿期切除胸腺会导致严重的免疫缺陷。\n\nT 细胞的产生在出生后显着下降，在婴儿期和幼儿期更是如此；在青春期，T 细胞的产生会再次急剧下降。虽然成年人产生的初始 T 细胞非常少，但现有的初始 T 细胞库是一个相对稳定的、自我维持的群体，仅随着年龄的增长而缓慢下降。\n\n免疫接种刺激初始 T 和 B 细胞产生长期的记忆 T 和 B 细胞群体。疫苗产生的长期保护性免疫力依赖于记忆 T 和 B 细胞群体的寿命，而不是胸腺产生新的初始 T 细胞。虽然切除胸腺会减少新的初始 T 细胞的产生并略微加速与年龄相关的 T 细胞谱的下降，但它对通过儿童疫苗接种建立的记忆细胞群体影响很小。\n\n（选项 A）T 细胞成熟依赖于胸腺；淋巴结不能接管此功能。成人 T 细胞群体的维持主要通过成熟 T 细胞的分裂，而不是新的 T 细胞的产生和成熟。这与终生在骨髓中产生的 B 细胞形成对比。\n\n（选项 C）异位胸腺组织的患病率尚不清楚，但胸腺组织产生初始 T 细胞的功能会随着年龄的增长而显着下降，无论其位置如何。\n\n（选项 D）程序性死亡配体-1 (PD-L1) 的过度表达可以抑制细胞毒性 T 细胞通过将其转化为调节性 T 细胞（即，T 细胞衰竭）来诱导细胞凋亡的能力。这见于几种癌症（例如，黑色素瘤、肾细胞癌），但不在疫苗接种中。\n\n（选项 E）重症肌无力患者产生的自身抗体特异于突触后神经肌肉接头（例如，乙酰胆碱受体、肌肉特异性酪氨酸激酶），通常不与疫苗发生交叉反应。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of T-lymphocyte development, the role of the thymus, and the long-term immunity conferred by vaccinations. Specifically, it assesses knowledge about why thymectomy does not necessitate repeat childhood immunizations due to the persistence of memory T-cell populations.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recognize that while the thymus is crucial for the development of naive T-cells, established immunological memory relies on long-lived memory T-cells. Therefore, removal of the thymus after childhood does not erase existing immunity, as these memory cells persist and can be reactivated by subsequent exposures to antigens.",
    "zh": "本题考察对 T 淋巴细胞发育、胸腺的作用以及疫苗接种赋予的长期免疫力的理解。具体而言，它评估了关于为什么胸腺切除术不需要重复接种儿童疫苗的知识，因为记忆 T 细胞群体持续存在。\n\n为了解决这个问题，必须认识到虽然胸腺对于初始 T 细胞的发育至关重要，但已建立的免疫记忆依赖于长寿命的记忆 T 细胞。因此，儿童期后切除胸腺不会消除现有的免疫力，因为这些记忆细胞持续存在，并且可以通过随后接触抗原来重新激活。"
