  "explanation": {
    "en": "The upper respiratory tract (eg, nasal passages, mouth, pharynx, larynx) accounts for about half of total airway resistance. The remainder comes from the lower respiratory tract, which begins at the trachea and proceeds through roughly 23 generations of airway bifurcation before reaching the alveoli (ie, the trachea divides into approximately 8 × 108 [223] smaller airways before reaching the alveoli). Because the airways at each level of the lower respiratory tract are arranged in parallel, airway resistance is determined by the total cross-sectional area of all the airways at that level; the greater the total cross-sectional area, the lower the airway resistance.\n\nThe cross-sectional area of the trachea is relatively small (~3.5 cm2), but the total area of the first few generations of bronchi is even smaller, leading to an initial small increase in resistance from the trachea to the bronchi. However, from the medium-sized bronchi on, the total cross-sectional area at each level of the lower respiratory tract increases in step-wise fashion, creating a progressive decline in airway resistance. By the time the alveoli are reached, the total cross-sectional area is massive (~5 × 103 cm2) and airway resistance is essentially zero.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe airway resistance at each level of the lower respiratory tract is inversely related to the total cross-sectional area of all the airways at that level. Airway resistance is high in the trachea and reaches a peak in the medium-sized bronchi, where total cross-sectional area is at a minimum. Airway resistance then progressively decreases as total cross-sectional area increases through the smaller bronchioles, terminal bronchioles, and alveoli.",
    "zh": "上呼吸道（例如，鼻腔、口腔、咽、喉）约占总气道阻力的一半。其余部分来自下呼吸道，下呼吸道始于气管，经过大约 23 代气道分支，然后到达肺泡（即，气管分成大约 8 × 108 [223] 个较小的气道，然后到达肺泡）。由于下呼吸道每个水平的气道排列成平行结构，气道阻力由该水平所有气道的总横截面积决定；总横截面积越大，气道阻力越小。\n\n气管的横截面积相对较小（~3.5 cm2），但前几代支气管的总面积更小，导致气管到支气管的初始阻力略有增加。然而，从中等大小的支气管开始，下呼吸道每个水平的总横截面积以阶梯式增加，从而导致气道阻力逐渐下降。当到达肺泡时，总横截面积巨大（~5 × 103 cm2），气道阻力基本为零。\n\n教育目标：下呼吸道每个水平的气道阻力与该水平所有气道的总横截面积成反比。气道阻力在气管中较高，并在中等大小的支气管中达到峰值，此时总横截面积最小。然后，随着总横截面积通过较小的细支气管、终末细支气管和肺泡增加，气道阻力逐渐降低。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of airway resistance changes throughout the respiratory tract generations. It assesses the relationship between total cross-sectional area and airway resistance in different parts of the lower respiratory tract.\n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that airway resistance is inversely proportional to the total cross-sectional area. The resistance is highest in the medium-sized bronchi and decreases towards the terminal bronchioles and alveoli due to the massive increase in total cross-sectional area.",
