    "en": "This patient with respiratory failure was found to have decreased LAMELLAR BODIES, which are organelles with concentric sheets of lipid membrane, within type II pneumocytes (cuboidal alveolar cells). Normally, type II pneumocytes use lamellar bodies to store surfactant, a substance composed of proteins and phospholipids that decreases alveolar surface tension {{exhibit_2}} and facilitates lung expansion during respiration. This lipoprotein complex is released from the lamellar bodies by exocytosis into the alveolar spaces, where the lamellar contents unravel into a structured array called tubular myelin. This lattice network adsorbs to the air-liquid interface of the alveoli and spreads along the alveolar lining, forming a surfactant film. As the film degrades, surfactant is recycled back into type II pneumocytes by endocytosis for reprocessing.\n\nSurfactant and the number of lamellar bodies in the fetus rise during the late second and the third trimesters. Therefore, a low lamellar body count reflects surfactant deficiency and lung immaturity, which typically occurs in premature infants with NEONATAL RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME. In this condition, alveolar surface tension increases and alveoli collapse. Diffuse atelectasis can lead to respiratory failure within minutes to hours after birth and, in severe cases, death.\n\n(Choice A) Emphysema is caused by alveolar wall destruction due to excessive activity of intra-alveolar proteases released by neutrophils and alveolar macrophages. Decreased lamellar bodies within type II pneumocytes would not be seen.\n\n(Choice B) Asthma is characterized by bronchial smooth muscle hyperresponsiveness, and histology typically shows inflammatory cell (eg, eosinophil) infiltration and bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy. A deficiency of lamellar bodies and surfactant does not cause bronchoconstriction.\n\n(Choice C) Chronic bronchitis manifests as excessive mucus production in the airways and increased inflammatory cells in the submucosa; lamellar body counts would not be affected.\n\n(Choice E) A pulmonary embolism appears on histology as organized layers of red cells, platelets, and fibrin within pulmonary arterial vasculature that is surrounded by ischemic lung changes. Decreased lamellar bodies within type 2 pneumocytes would not be seen. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\nEducational objective:\nLamellar bodies of type II pneumocytes store and release surfactant, which decreases alveolar surface tension and facilitates lung expansion. A low lamellar body count reflects surfactant deficiency and lung immaturity, as in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, which results in alveolar collapse and diffuse atelectasis.",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the function of lamellar bodies in type II pneumocytes and the consequences of surfactant deficiency, particularly in the context of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. It requires understanding the role of surfactant in reducing alveolar surface tension and preventing alveolar collapse. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that decreased lamellar bodies indicate surfactant deficiency, which leads to increased alveolar surface tension and a tendency for alveolar collapse. By linking the histological finding to its physiological consequence, the correct answer can be identified.",
