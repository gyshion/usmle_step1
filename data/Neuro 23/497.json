    "en": "Clinically, the abrupt onset of a severe headache is very characteristic of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and the above non-contrast CT scan confirms this diagnosis (note the hyperdensity seen within the cisterns/sulci, arrows) {{exhibit_2}}. The generalized, severe headache of SAH is often described by patients as \"the worst headache of my life.\" Fever and nuchal rigidity may also be present. Focal neurological deficits are usually not present.\n\nSaccular (berry) aneurysms are the most common cause of SAH. These aneurysms usually occur at the circle of Willis, with the anterior communicating artery being the most common site. Berry aneurysms are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Arteriovenous malformations also predispose certain individuals to SAH.\n\nIn SAH, blood accumulates between the arachnoid and pia mater. A CT scan without contrast is diagnostic. Lumbar puncture reveals gross blood or xanthochromia (yellow discoloration of cerebrospinal fluid).\n\n(Choice G) Cerebral amyloid angiopathy occurs in elderly patients. It may be asymptomatic or may lead to recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage. These bleeds usually affect small areas of the cerebral hemispheres and present with headache and focal neurologic deficits (i.e., paresis, sensory loss, etc).\n\n(Choice I) Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms are small in size (< 1 mm in diameter) and occur in patients with long-standing hypertension. They are found in the arterioles that supply the basal ganglia, internal capsule, and deep white matter. Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms can rupture and cause intracerebral hemorrhage, not SAH.\n\nEducational objective:\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage presents with a generalized, excruciating headache. It is classically described by patients as \"the worst headache of my life.\" Subarachnoid hemorrhage usually occurs due to rupture of saccular (berry) aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations. Berry aneurysms of the circle of Willis are associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.",
    "zh": "临床上，突发剧烈头痛是蛛网膜下腔出血 (SAH) 的一个非常典型的特征，上述非增强CT扫描证实了这一诊断（注意在脑池/脑沟内的高密度影，箭头所示） {{exhibit_2}}。SAH引起的弥漫性剧烈头痛通常被患者描述为“我一生中最严重的头痛”。还可能出现发烧和颈部僵硬。通常不存在局灶性神经功能缺损。\n\n囊性（浆果状）动脉瘤是SAH最常见的原因。这些动脉瘤通常发生在Willis环，前交通动脉是最常见的部位。浆果状动脉瘤与Ehlers-Danlos综合征和常染色体显性多囊肾病相关。动静脉畸形也使某些个体易患SAH。\n\n在SAH中，血液积聚在蛛网膜和软脑膜之间。无对比CT扫描具有诊断意义。腰椎穿刺显示肉眼可见血液或黄变（脑脊液呈黄色变色）。\n\n（选项G）脑淀粉样血管病发生在老年患者中。它可能无症状，也可能导致复发性脑内出血。这些出血通常影响大脑半球的小区域，并表现为头痛和局灶性神经功能缺损（即，轻瘫、感觉丧失等）。\n\n（选项I）Charcot-Bouchard动脉瘤很小（直径小于1 mm），发生在患有长期高血压的患者中。它们存在于供应基底节、内囊和深部白质的小动脉中。Charcot-Bouchard动脉瘤可能破裂并导致脑内出血，而不是SAH。\n\n教育目标：\n蛛网膜下腔出血表现为弥漫性、剧烈的头痛。它通常被患者描述为“我一生中最严重的头痛”。蛛网膜下腔出血通常是由于囊性（浆果状）动脉瘤或动静脉畸形破裂引起的。Willis环的浆果状动脉瘤与常染色体显性多囊肾病相关。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), its common causes, diagnostic findings on CT scan, and associated risk factors. It also differentiates SAH from other causes of headache and intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the classic presentation of SAH (sudden, severe headache) and correlate it with the CT scan findings (hyperdensity in cisterns/sulci). Recall that saccular aneurysms are the most common cause of SAH and are associated with conditions like autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.",
