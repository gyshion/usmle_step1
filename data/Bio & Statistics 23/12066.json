    "en": "Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is an enzyme complex located within the inner mitochondrial membrane that catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. An experiment is conducted to determine if malate alters the rate of SDH activity. Reaction velocity is measured with and without a fixed quantity of malate as succinate concentration is gradually increased. Obtained results are shown below. {{exhibit_1}}",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The Vmax remains constant (at 400 μmol/L/sec) while Km increases (from 8 to 16 mM) in the presence of malate. Therefore, malate is a COMPETITIVE INHIBITOR of succinate dehydrogenase for succinate.",
    "zh": "在苹果酸存在下，Vmax 保持不变（400 μmol/L/秒），而 Km 增加（从 8 到 16 mM）。因此，苹果酸是琥珀酸脱氢酶对琥珀酸的竞争性抑制剂。"
