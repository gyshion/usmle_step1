    "en": "A 44-year-old man is evaluated due to progressive dyspnea over the past several years. The patient has no associated chest pain or palpitations. Physical examination shows a prolonged expiratory phase without wheezes or rhonchi. CT scan of the chest demonstrates bilateral lower lobe–predominant emphysema. Further testing reveals that the patient has a protease inhibitor deficiency, which has led to increased elastin fiber breakdown. Elastin fibers within alveolar walls normally allow the lung to stretch during active inspiration and recoil during passive expiration. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient's emphysema is likely due to ALPHA-1 ANTITRYPSIN DEFICIENCY. Neutrophil-secreted elastase is an endogenous proteolytic enzyme that hydrolyzes elastin within alveolar walls. The liver synthesizes alpha-1 antitrypsin, a protein that inhibits neutrophil elastase and prevents alveolar wall degradation, particularly in the lower airways. Patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency consequently develop excessive alveolar ELASTIN DEGRADATION, which clinically manifests with EARLY-ONSET, lower lobe-predominant emphysema.\n\nElastin is a fibrous connective tissue protein that provides elasticity to the skin, blood vessels, and pulmonary alveoli. The fibers can stretch to several times their length and recoil back to their original size once stretching forces are withdrawn. Elastin assembly is closely related to that of collagen. Similar to collagen, elastin is synthesized as a large polypeptide precursor (tropoelastin) composed of about 700, mostly nonpolar, amino acids (eg, glycine, alanine, valine) (Choice D). Elastin also contains proline and lysine residues; however, in contrast to those found in collagen, few of these amino acids are hydroxylated (Choice C).\n\nAfter tropoelastin is formed, it is secreted into the extracellular space where it interacts with microfibrils (fibrillin) that function as a scaffold. Next, lysyl oxidase, a copper-dependent enzyme, oxidatively deaminates some of the lysine residues of tropoelastin, facilitating the formation of DESMOSINE CROSS-LINKS between neighboring polypeptides that hold the elastin molecules together. These cross-links, along with the high content of nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids, account for the rubber-like properties of elastin.\n\n(Choices A and B) Disulfide bridges are formed during collagen, not elastin, synthesis. After post-translational hydroxylation and glycosylation of procollagen molecules, disulfide bond formation between the C-terminal propeptide regions of 3 alpha chains brings the chains into a favorable alignment for triple helix assembly.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe rubber-like properties of elastin are due to high content of nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids and extensive cross-linking between elastin monomers facilitated by lysyl oxidase. Patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can develop early-onset, lower lobe-predominant emphysema due to excessive alveolar elastin degradation. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者的肺气肿很可能与α-1抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症有关。中性粒细胞分泌的弹性蛋白酶是一种内源性蛋白水解酶，可水解肺泡壁内的弹性蛋白。肝脏合成α-1抗胰蛋白酶，这是一种抑制中性粒细胞弹性蛋白酶并防止肺泡壁降解的蛋白质，尤其是在下呼吸道中。因此，α-1抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症患者会发生过度的肺泡弹性蛋白降解，临床表现为早发性、以下肺叶为主的肺气肿。\n\n弹性蛋白是一种纤维状结缔组织蛋白，可为皮肤、血管和肺泡提供弹性。纤维可以伸展到其长度的几倍，并在拉伸力撤回后回缩到其原始大小。弹性蛋白的组装与胶原蛋白的组装密切相关。与胶原蛋白类似，弹性蛋白由大约700个氨基酸（例如，甘氨酸、丙氨酸、缬氨酸）（选项D）组成的大型多肽前体（原弹性蛋白）合成。弹性蛋白还含有脯氨酸和赖氨酸残基；然而，与在胶原蛋白中发现的那些氨基酸相比，这些氨基酸的羟基化很少（选项C）。\n\n原弹性蛋白形成后，会分泌到细胞外空间，在那里它与充当支架的微原纤维（原纤维蛋白）相互作用。接下来，赖氨酰氧化酶（一种铜依赖性酶）会氧化脱氨一些原弹性蛋白的赖氨酸残基，从而促进相邻多肽之间去缩氨酸交联的形成，这些多肽将弹性蛋白分子保持在一起。这些交联以及非极性（疏水性）氨基酸的高含量构成了弹性蛋白的橡胶状特性。\n\n（选项A和B）二硫键在胶原蛋白而非弹性蛋白合成过程中形成。在翻译后羟基化和糖基化原胶原蛋白分子后，3条α链的C末端前肽区域之间的二硫键形成使这些链进入有利于三螺旋组装的对齐状态。\n\n教育目标：\n弹性蛋白的橡胶状特性归因于非极性（疏水性）氨基酸含量高以及赖氨酰氧化酶促进的弹性蛋白单体之间的广泛交联。由于过度的肺泡弹性蛋白降解，α-1抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症患者可发生早发性、以下肺叶为主的肺气肿。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"
