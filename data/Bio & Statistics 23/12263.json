    "en": "A 6-year-old girl with chronic anemia requiring repeated blood transfusions is undergoing genetic testing. The patient's mother and older sibling have a history of mild anemia. Her peripheral blood smear shows hypochromic, microcytic red blood cells, and hemoglobin electrophoresis reveals a predominance of hemoglobins F and A2. Sequencing of the β-globin gene is performed using the patient's erythroblast DNA. A schematic representation of the gene and its transcribed RNA is shown in the image below.",

    "en": "The base sequence indicated by the bold red arrow in this patient's β-globin gene represents the CAAT BOX, a highly conserved (consensus) sequence that functions as a PROMOTER of TRANSCRIPTION in the EUKARYOTIC genome. It is typically located 70-80 bases upstream from the transcription start site. The Hogness (TATA) box is a second promoter region in the eukaryotic genome and is seen to the right of the CAAT box in the above image. The TATA box is generally located 25 bases upstream from the transcription start site. Both the CAAT box and the TATA box promote INITIATION OF TRANSCRIPTION by acting as binding sites for general TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS and RNA POLYMERASE II.",
    "zh": "该患者的β-珠蛋白基因中，粗红箭头所指的碱基序列代表CAAT盒，它是一个高度保守（共有）的序列，在真核生物基因组中起转录启动子的作用。它通常位于转录起始位点上游70-80个碱基处。Hogness（TATA）盒是真核生物基因组中的第二个启动子区域，在上图中位于CAAT盒的右侧。TATA盒通常位于转录起始位点上游25个碱基处。CAAT盒和TATA盒都通过充当通用转录因子和RNA聚合酶II的结合位点来促进转录起始。"
