  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This afebrile patient with a normal lung examination most likely has a viral upper respiratory infection. The physician is faced with the common clinical issue of responding to a request for an unnecessary antibiotic prescription. Although many patients receive antibiotics for upper respiratory infections, antibiotic use in uncomplicated upper respiratory infections is associated with increased risk of adverse effects, no improvement compared to placebo, and a rise in ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE.\n\nThe most appropriate response is a patient-centered approach that validates the patient's concerns, educates the patient about the adverse effects of antibiotics and their lack of efficacy in treating viral infections, and provides options to treat the patient symptomatically. This must be done in an empathetic and nonjudgmental fashion that helps build, not undermine, the physician-patient relationship. The physician should refrain from prescribing antibiotics and advise the patient to return if symptoms persist or worsen.\n\n(Choice A) This statement does not explain why antibiotics are not an appropriate treatment at this time and may be interpreted as dismissive given the patient's specific request.\n\n(Choice B) Although this may be true, it is not constructive to criticize previous treatment providers.\n\n(Choice D) Although it is appropriate to explain that unnecessary antibiotic use can contribute to general antibiotic resistance, this response is not patient centered because it dismisses the patient's concerns and does not explain why antibiotics are inappropriate for his specific symptoms.\n\n(Choice E) This statement fails to explain why antibiotics are inappropriate and does not offer any treatment options. It may be perceived as invalidating or judgmental and have a detrimental effect on the physician-patient relationship.\n\nEducational objective:\nEmpiric antibiotic therapy for patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory infections is contraindicated.\nResponding to requests for inappropriate antibiotics involves a patient-centered approach that validates the patient's concerns, educates the patient about the adverse effects of antibiotics and their lack of efficacy in treating viral infections, and provides options to treat the patient symptomatically.",
