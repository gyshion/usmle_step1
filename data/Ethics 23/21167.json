The patient feels well overall but mentions that climbing the last flight of stairs to her 3rd-floor apartment has become harder. She says, \"Sometimes I have to stop at the landing to catch my breath.\" Medical history includes cocaine use disorder in remission for the past 4 years; it is otherwise unremarkable. The patient does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. She has a 25-pack-year smoking history and has been counseled to quit smoking in the past. The patient says, \"I've tried to quit several times. I can cut down to a few cigarettes or half a pack for a day or two, but then it's just too difficult.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician regarding this patient's smoking?",

  "correct_answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient is struggling to quit smoking and is discouraged by repeated failures. Rather than repeat the health risks of smoking or prematurely focus on treatment, the physician can be more productive by using motivational interviewing to build and support the patient's motivation to change. MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING is a patient-centered approach that invites collaboration, helps develop INTERNAL MOTIVATION to change, and enhances the patient's sense of optimism, self-confidence, and self-efficacy in reaching goals.\n\nThe physician's most appropriate response is to support the patient's sense of SELF-EFFICACY by helping her reflect on her PAST SUCCESS and apply it to her current difficulties. By reviewing successful methods that enabled the patient to stop using cocaine, the physician can build the patient's internal motivation and belief that she can change her smoking habits as well.\n\n(Choices A and D) This patient has been counseled about smoking and has tried to quit several times. She is likely aware that stopping smoking will improve her breathing and overall health. Rather than express concern and repeat the risks of smoking, the physician would be more effective by eliciting the patient's perspective and exploring her concerns about the effects of smoking on her breathing.\n\n(Choice B) Although this statement is empathic, it prematurely focuses on treatment without attempting to elicit the patient's strengths and build her intrinsic motivation.\n\n(Choice C) This statement is supportive and optimistic but reflects the physician's confidence, not the patient's. It does not help develop the patient's sense of self-efficacy.\n\nEducational objective:\nMotivational interviewing supports and develops patients' sense of self-efficacy in making behavioral changes. Eliciting patients' strengths and focusing on past successes can help build patients' internal motivation and confidence in their ability to make changes.",
    "zh": "这位患者正在努力戒烟，并且对反复失败感到沮丧。医生与其重复吸烟的健康风险或过早地侧重于治疗，不如运用动机性访谈来建立和支持患者改变的动机。动机性访谈是一种以患者为中心的方法，它邀请合作，帮助培养内在的改变动机，并增强患者在实现目标方面的乐观、自信和自我效能感。\n\n医生最合适的回答是通过帮助她反思过去的成功并将之应用于她目前的困难来支持患者的自我效能感。通过回顾使患者停止使用可卡因的成功方法，医生可以建立患者的内在动机和相信她也能改变吸烟习惯的信念。\n\n（选项A和D）这位患者已经接受过关于吸烟的咨询，并且尝试戒烟好几次了。她很可能知道戒烟会改善她的呼吸和整体健康。医生与其表达担忧并重复吸烟的风险，不如引出患者的观点，并探讨她对吸烟对其呼吸影响的担忧。\n\n（选项B）虽然这句话是富有同情心的，但它过早地侧重于治疗，而没有试图引出患者的优势并建立她的内在动机。\n\n（选项C）这句话是支持性和乐观的，但反映了医生的信心，而不是患者的信心。它无助于培养患者的自我效能感。\n\n教育目标：\n动机性访谈支持并发展患者在改变行为方面的自我效能感。引出患者的优势并关注过去的成功可以帮助建立患者改变能力的内在动机和信心。"
