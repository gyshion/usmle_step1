She also has a history of recurrent genital lesions, which begin with small vesicles with subsequent ulceration, crusting, and eventual healing. The patient has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. On physical examination, she appears comfortable. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F). She has small linear erosions in the oral mucosa. Skin findings are shown in the image below {{exhibit_1}}.",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's rash is consistent with erythema multiforme (EM), an acute inflammatory disorder that can involve the skin of the extremities, face, trunk, and neck. Severe cases (EM major) can also affect oral mucous membranes (eg, erosions) and the tongue. The appearance of EM can vary, but patients typically develop erythematous, round papules that evolve into TARGET LESIONS with a dusky central area, a dark red inflammatory zone surrounded by a pale ring, and an erythematous halo in the lesion's periphery.\n\nEM represents a cell-mediated immune process, with an inflammatory infiltrate predominated by cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes. EM is most frequently associated with infections (especially HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS and MYCOPLASMA) and may be due to an immune response against antigens deposited in the skin. EM can also be seen in association with certain medications (eg, sulfonamides), malignancy, and collagen vascular diseases.\n\n(Choice A) Disseminated herpes simplex infection is seen primarily in immunocompromised patients and presents with diffuse vesicles (eg, involving multiple skin regions or organs simultaneously) on an erythematous base. This patient's target-shaped lesions are more consistent with EM. EM does not represent disseminated infection but is a systemic immune response to a localized infection.\n\n(Choice C) Primary HIV infection can present with a macular or maculopapular rash associated with fever. The rash is usually well circumscribed and involves the trunk, face, and palms and soles. However, this patient's rash appears more typical of EM.\n\n(Choice D) Stevens-Johnson syndrome is characterized by rapid onset of erythematous macules with necrosis and skin sloughing. Systemic signs (eg, fever, hypotension) are common. Stevens-Johnson syndrome may also cause target lesions, but it is usually associated with medications (eg, sulfonamides, allopurinol, phenytoin).\n\n(Choice E) Varicella typically presents with fever and a vesicular eruption that can affect multiple areas, including the face, trunk, abdomen, and extremities. This patient's rash does not have the typical vesicular pattern seen in varicella.\n\nEducational objective:\nErythema multiforme is a cell-mediated inflammatory disorder of the skin characterized by erythematous papules that evolve into target lesions. It is most commonly associated with herpes simplex virus.",
    "zh": "该患者的皮疹与多形性红斑（EM）一致，多形性红斑是一种急性炎症性疾病，可累及四肢、面部、躯干和颈部的皮肤。严重病例（EM major）也可影响口腔黏膜（如糜烂）和舌头。EM的表现形式多种多样，但患者通常会出现红斑、圆形丘疹，这些丘疹演变成靶形病灶，具有暗沉的中央区域、被苍白环包围的深红色炎症区以及病灶周边的红斑光晕。\n\nEM代表一种细胞介导的免疫过程，其炎症浸润主要由细胞毒性 CD8+ 淋巴细胞主导。EM 最常与感染（尤其是单纯疱疹病毒和支原体）相关，并且可能由于针对沉积在皮肤中的抗原的免疫反应而发生。EM 也可见于某些药物（例如，磺胺类药物）、恶性肿瘤和胶原血管疾病相关。\n\n（选项A）播散性单纯疱疹病毒感染主要见于免疫功能低下的患者，表现为在红斑基础上出现弥漫性水疱（例如，同时累及多个皮肤区域或器官）。该患者的靶形病灶更符合EM。EM 并非代表播散性感染，而是对局部感染的全身性免疫反应。\n\n（选项C）原发性 HIV 感染可表现为与发热相关的斑丘疹或斑丘疹。皮疹通常界限分明，累及躯干、面部以及手掌和足底。然而，该患者的皮疹看起来更像是EM。\n\n（选项D）史蒂文斯-约翰逊综合征的特征是红斑性斑疹快速发病，伴有坏死和皮肤脱落。全身体征（例如，发热、低血压）很常见。史蒂文斯-约翰逊综合征也可能引起靶形病灶，但通常与药物（例如，磺胺类药物、别嘌呤醇、苯妥英）有关。\n\n（选项E）水痘通常表现为发热和水疱疹，可影响多个区域，包括面部、躯干、腹部和四肢。该患者的皮疹没有水痘中常见的典型水疱模式。\n\n教育目标：\n多形性红斑是一种细胞介导的皮肤炎症性疾病，其特征是红斑性丘疹演变成靶形病灶。它最常与单纯疱疹病毒相关。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of erythema multiforme (EM), its clinical presentation, and common associations, particularly with herpes simplex virus.
