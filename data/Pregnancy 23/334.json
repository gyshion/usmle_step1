    "en": "A 28-year-old woman comes to the office due to vaginal spotting. The patient normally has regular monthly menses with 3-4 days of moderate bleeding. However, she has had spotting for the past 2 days, and her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago. Vital signs are normal. Serum quantitative β-hCG level is 800 IU/mL (normal at 6 weeks gestation: 1,080-56,500), and a repeat level performed 2 days later shows an abnormal rise to 900 IU/mL. Pelvic ultrasound reveals no gestational sac in the uterus. If uterine curettage is performed, which of the following microscopic findings would most likely be found in this patient? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient presents with vaginal spotting, a low serum β-hCG level for gestational age, and an inappropriate rise in β-hCG. Pelvic ultrasound is negative for an intrauterine gestational sac. These findings are highly suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy. {{exhibit_2}} Ectopic pregnancy, despite its extrauterine location, leads to changes in the uterine endometrium due to the secretion of β-hCG. Progesterone, stimulated by the corpus luteum, promotes endometrial remodeling and decidualization, which is essential for supporting pregnancy. Therefore, if uterine curettage is performed, the endometrium would likely show features of decidualization, characterized by dilated, coiled endometrial glands and a vascularized, edematous stroma. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choice A) Atypical endometrial cells, disorganized glands, and multiple mitoses are characteristic of endometrial adenocarcinoma, a malignancy that typically presents with abnormal uterine bleeding, particularly in postmenopausal women. This finding is not associated with pregnancy or abnormal β-hCG levels.\n\n(Choice C) Inflammatory infiltration of the endometrial glands suggests endometritis, an infection of the uterine lining. Endometritis is not typically associated with the clinical presentation of abnormal bleeding in early pregnancy or abnormal β-hCG levels.\n\n(Choice D) Straight, short endometrial glands and compact stroma are characteristic of the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, which occurs in the early follicular phase (approximately days 4-7 following menses, prior to ovulation). This pattern is inconsistent with the secretory changes expected in a patient with a positive β-hCG level, even in the context of an ectopic pregnancy.\n\nEducational objective:\nEctopic pregnancy should be suspected in patients with a pregnancy of unknown location (ie, no visible intrauterine gestation) and abnormally rising β-hCG levels. Despite their extrauterine location, ectopic pregnancies promote endometrial decidualization, which appears as dilated, coiled endometrial glands and vascularized, edematous stroma. {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "该患者表现为阴道点滴出血，血清β-hCG水平低于孕龄，且β-hCG水平出现不适当的升高。盆腔超声未发现宫内孕囊。这些发现高度提示宫外孕。{{exhibit_2}} 宫外孕，尽管其位于宫外，但由于β-hCG的分泌，会导致子宫内膜发生改变。黄体刺激产生的孕酮促进子宫内膜重塑和蜕膜化，这对支持妊娠至关重要。因此，如果进行子宫刮宫，子宫内膜可能会表现出蜕膜化的特征，表现为扩张、卷曲的子宫内膜腺体和血管丰富的、水肿的间质。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n（选项A）非典型子宫内膜细胞、腺体紊乱和多次有丝分裂是子宫内膜腺癌的特征，这是一种恶性肿瘤，通常表现为异常子宫出血，尤其是在绝经后妇女中。这种发现与妊娠或异常的β-hCG水平无关。\n\n（选项C）子宫内膜腺体的炎症浸润提示子宫内膜炎，即子宫内膜的感染。子宫内膜炎通常与早孕或异常β-hCG水平下异常出血的临床表现无关。\n\n（选项D）笔直、短小的子宫内膜腺体和致密的间质是月经周期的增殖期的特征，发生于卵泡早期（月经后大约第4-7天，排卵前）。这种模式与β-hCG水平阳性患者的预期分泌变化不符，即使在宫外孕的情况下也是如此。\n\n教育目标：\n对于妊娠部位不明（即，没有可见的宫内妊娠）且β-hCG水平异常升高的患者，应怀疑宫外孕。尽管宫外孕位于子宫外，但其会促进子宫内膜蜕膜化，表现为扩张、卷曲的子宫内膜腺体和血管丰富的、水肿的间质。{{exhibit_5}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the endometrial changes that occur in response to pregnancy, specifically in the context of an ectopic pregnancy. It requires correlating clinical findings such as vaginal bleeding, β-hCG levels, and ultrasound results with the expected histological appearance of the endometrium.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first recognize the clinical suspicion for ectopic pregnancy based on the provided vignette. Then, recall the hormonal influences on the endometrium during pregnancy, particularly the role of progesterone in promoting decidualization. Finally, identify the histological features that represent decidualization and differentiate them from other endometrial pathologies.",
    "zh": "此题考察对妊娠反应中子宫内膜变化的理解，特别是在宫外孕的背景下。它需要将阴道出血、β-hCG水平和超声结果等临床发现与子宫内膜的预期组织学表现相关联。\n\n要解决这个问题，首先必须根据所提供的案例认识到对宫外孕的临床怀疑。然后，回忆妊娠期间对子宫内膜的激素影响，特别是孕酮在促进蜕膜化中的作用。最后，确定代表蜕膜化的组织学特征，并将它们与其他子宫内膜病理学区分开来。"
