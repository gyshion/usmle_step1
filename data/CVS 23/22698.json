    "en": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy {{exhibit_2}}\n\nGross examination of this patient's heart reveals asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (ie, wall thickening) that is most prominent in the interventricular septum, which is characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).\n\nHCM results from genetic mutations that affect cardiac sarcomere proteins; the phenotypic manifestations of the disease typically begin during adolescence and involve myocardial disarray and left ventricular (LV) thickening that mostly affects the interventricular septum. The septal thickening commonly leads to dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction that causes a mid-systolic murmur and reduces cardiac output, often leading to exertional symptoms (eg, dyspnea, angina, lightheadedness, syncope). Sudden cardiac death (SCD) can also occur.\n\nIn addition to obstructing cardiac output, the LVH in HCM also frequently impairs LV diastolic filling, with an S4 commonly heard as blood strikes the thick, stiffened LV wall.\n\n(Choices A and E) A weak and delayed carotid upstroke (ie, pulsus parvus et tardus) as well as a soft and single S2 (caused by delay of aortic valve closure to the point that it occurs simultaneously with pulmonic valve closure) are characteristic of aortic stenosis (AS). Severe AS commonly causes exertional symptoms (eg, dyspnea, lightheadedness) and can cause SCD, but it usually results from age-related calcification and affects older patients (eg, age >40 for a bicuspid aortic valve or older for a congenitally normal valve). Concentric LVH can develop with severe AS; the wall thickening is evenly distributed and does not favor the interventricular septum as it does in HCM.\n\n(Choices B and C) An early systolic murmur at the cardiac apex is consistent with mitral regurgitation (MR), and a mid-diastolic murmur at the cardiac apex is classic for mitral stenosis (MS). Both MR and MS commonly present with heart failure symptoms (eg, dyspnea, orthopnea, peripheral edema), and SCD is relatively uncommon. In addition, asymmetric LVH affecting the interventricular septum does not occur (eccentric LVH can develop with severe MR, and no LVH develops with MS as the left ventricle does not undergo pressure or volume overload).\n\nEducational objective:\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy typically involves asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) that is most prominent in the interventricular septum and commonly causes left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction. The LVH also impairs diastolic filling, with an S4 commonly heard as blood strikes the thick, stiffened LV wall. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), specifically its clinical presentation and associated auscultatory findings. It requires understanding the pathophysiology of HCM, including left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, and how these contribute to the presence of an S4 heart sound.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the patient's symptoms (exertional dyspnea, lightheadedness, sudden cardiac death) as suggestive of HCM. Then, recall that HCM often leads to impaired diastolic filling and a stiffened left ventricle, resulting in an S4 heart sound.",
