    "en": "Pulmonary function testing (PFT) usually involves spirometry, during which the patient completely inhales (to reach total lung capacity) and then forcefully exhales as much air as possible as quickly as possible. The graph in this question depicts the measured results following this procedure. The volume of air expelled during the first second of exhalation is the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and the total volume of air expelled represents the forced vital capacity (FVC). {{exhibit_2}}\n\nThe black curve on the graph depicts normal PFT results with an FEV1 of 4 liters, an FVC of 5 liters, and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 80%. The patient's red curve shows a reduced FEV1 of 3 liters, a reduced FVC of 3.5 liters, and a slightly increased FEV1/FVC ratio of 86%. These findings are consistent with a restrictive pattern; therefore, the patient's dyspnea is most likely due to interstitial lung disease. Neuromuscular weakness and obesity hypoventilation syndrome also demonstrate a restrictive pattern on PFT. {{exhibit_3}}\n\n(Choices A, B, and D) Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) both demonstrate an obstructive pattern on PFT with reduced FEV1 (eg, 2 liters), normal or reduced FVC (eg, 4.5 liters), and reduced FEV1/FVC ratio (eg, 45%). Bronchodilator testing may be helpful in differentiating asthma and COPD as airway obstruction due to asthma typically has a much higher degree of reversibility than that due to COPD. However, bronchodilator testing does not play a role in restrictive lung disease. {{exhibit_4}}\n\nEducational objective:\nPulmonary function testing involves having the patient inhale completely and then forcefully exhale as much air as possible as quickly as possible. Restrictive lung disease causes reduced total volume of air expelled (ie, reduced forced vital capacity [FVC]); reduced volume of air expelled in 1 second (ie, reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]); and a normal or sometimes increased FEV1/FVC ratio. {{exhibit_5}}",
    "zh": "肺功能检查 (PFT) 通常包括肺活量测定，在此过程中，患者完全吸气（达到肺总量），然后尽可能快地用力呼出尽可能多的空气。本题中的图表描述了该程序后的测量结果。呼气第一秒的空气量是 1 秒用力呼气量 (FEV1)，呼出的总空气量代表用力肺活量 (FVC)。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n图表上的黑线描绘了正常的 PFT 结果，FEV1 为 4 升，FVC 为 5 升，FEV1/FVC 比率为 80%。患者的红线显示 FEV1 降低至 3 升，FVC 降低至 3.5 升，FEV1/FVC 比率略有增加，为 86%。这些发现与限制性模式一致；因此，患者的呼吸困难最可能是由于间质性肺病所致。神经肌肉无力和肥胖通气不足综合征也在 PFT 上表现出限制性模式。{{exhibit_3}}\n\n（选项 A、B 和 D）哮喘和慢性阻塞性肺病 (COPD) 均在 PFT 上表现出阻塞性模式，FEV1 降低（例如，2 升），FVC 正常或降低（例如，4.5 升），FEV1/FVC 比率降低（例如，45%）。支气管扩张剂测试可能有助于区分哮喘和 COPD，因为哮喘引起的气道阻塞通常比 COPD 引起的可逆性高得多。然而，支气管扩张剂测试在限制性肺病中不起作用。{{exhibit_4}}\n\n教育目标：\n肺功能检查包括让患者完全吸气，然后尽可能快地用力呼出尽可能多的空气。限制性肺病导致呼出的总空气量减少（即，用力肺活量 [FVC] 减少）；1 秒内呼出的空气量减少（即，1 秒用力呼气量 [FEV1] 减少）；以及正常的或有时增加的 FEV1/FVC 比率。{{exhibit_5}}"
