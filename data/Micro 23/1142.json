    "en": "A 72-year-old man is brought to the emergency department from a skilled nursing facility due to altered mental status, skin flushing, and high fever. He uses a wheelchair for mobility since a stroke several years ago. Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 80/40 mm Hg, pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 26/min. A blood sample is obtained, and culture is positive for bacterial growth within a few hours. Multiplex PCR testing of the blood detects *Escherichia coli*.",

    "en": "This elderly patient with fever, hypotension, and altered mental status has sepsis. The presence of *Escherichia coli* bacteremia suggests the source is a URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI). *E coli* is a normal gastrointestinal commensal organism. UTI arises when the organism contaminates the periurethral area and uses special adhesive proteins called pili to attach to and ascend the uroepithelium. Predisposing factors include urinary obstruction (eg, benign prostatic hypertrophy), fecal incontinence, neurogenic bladder (eg, due to diabetes), and indwelling catheterization.\n\n*E coli* is the LEADING CAUSE of UTIs, and most cases of *E coli* bacteremia are due to hematologic dissemination from the urinary system. Bloodstream infection can lead to SEPSIS due to overwhelming release of inflammatory cytokines; clinical manifestations include hyper/hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, and ORGAN DYSFUNCTION (eg, confusion, acute kidney failure).\n\n(Choice A) Diverticulitis can cause *E coli* bacteremia due to spread of the organism through the colon wall. However, patients usually experience constant, worsening abdominal pain over several days. This patient is more likely to have a UTI, which frequently causes abrupt mental status changes in elderly patients.\n\n(Choice B) Intestinal perforation can occur as a consequence of surgery, trauma, or wall rupture from ischemia; it often causes septic shock and anaerobic or gram-negative rod bacteremia. This patient is less likely to have intestinal perforation than a UTI.\n\n(Choice C) Patients with a history of stroke are at risk for pneumonia due to aspiration. However, *E coli* is an atypical cause of pneumonia in those who are not intubated.\n\n(Choice D) Wheelchair use may increase risk of pressure ulcers. Although *E coli* can contaminate a pressure ulcer, most skin infections are caused by gram-positive organisms (eg, *Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus* species). This patient is far more likely to have *E coli* bacteremia due to a UTI.\n\nEducational objective:\n*Escherichia coli* is the most common cause of urinary tract infection (UTI) in both healthy adults and elderly patients. *E coli* is part of the normal gastrointestinal flora, and special adhesive proteins (pili) allow some strains to colonize and ascend the urinary tract, causing UTI, pyelonephritis, and bacteremia/sepsis. UTIs are the most common cause of *E coli* bacteremia.",
    "zh": "这位老年患者出现发烧、低血压和精神状态改变，提示患有脓毒症。*大肠杆菌*菌血症的存在提示来源是尿路感染(UTI)。*大肠杆菌*是正常的胃肠道共生菌。当细菌污染尿道周围区域并利用称为菌毛的特殊粘附蛋白附着在尿路上皮并沿其上行时，就会发生UTI。易感因素包括尿路梗阻（例如，良性前列腺增生）、大便失禁、神经源性膀胱（例如，由于糖尿病）和留置导管。\n\n*大肠杆菌*是UTI的主要病因，大多数*大肠杆菌*菌血症病例是由于血行播散自泌尿系统。血流感染可导致脓毒症，这是由于炎症细胞因子的大量释放；临床表现包括高/低体温、心动过速、呼吸急促、白细胞增多和器官功能障碍（例如，意识模糊、急性肾衰竭）。\n\n(选项A) 憩室炎可引起*大肠杆菌*菌血症，这是由于细菌通过结肠壁传播。然而，患者通常会经历持续恶化的腹痛数天。该患者更有可能患有UTI，这常常会导致老年患者的精神状态突然改变。\n\n(选项B) 肠穿孔可由手术、外伤或缺血引起的壁破裂引起；它通常会导致感染性休克和厌氧菌或革兰氏阴性杆菌菌血症。该患者发生肠穿孔的可能性低于UTI。\n\n(选项C) 有中风病史的患者因误吸而有患肺炎的风险。然而，*大肠杆菌*对于未插管的患者来说是肺炎的非典型病因。\n\n(选项D) 使用轮椅可能会增加压疮的风险。尽管*大肠杆菌*会污染压疮，但大多数皮肤感染是由革兰氏阳性菌（例如，*金黄色葡萄球菌、链球菌*属）引起的。该患者更有可能因UTI而发生*大肠杆菌*菌血症。\n\n教育目标：\n*大肠杆菌*是健康成人和老年患者尿路感染（UTI）最常见的病因。*大肠杆菌*是正常胃肠道菌群的一部分，特殊的粘附蛋白（菌毛）允许某些菌株定植并沿尿路向上蔓延，引起UTI、肾盂肾炎和菌血症/脓毒症。UTI是*大肠杆菌*菌血症最常见的原因。"
