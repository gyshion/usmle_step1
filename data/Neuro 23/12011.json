    "en": "During a genetic study, several members of a family are found to have an abnormality affecting a gene located on chromosome 21. The gene encodes a cell surface protein that is processed by proteolytic enzyme cleavage. In the affected individuals, there is an increased number of hydrophobic fragments of the protein, which are prone to aggregation into insoluble fibrils. Which of the following is the most likely result of the genetic abnormality in these individuals?",

    "en": "If beta amyloid is not sufficiently cleared by cellular processes, it can form insoluble fibrils and contribute to the generation of extracellular amyloid plaques that accumulate in the brain. These aggregates of beta amyloid are neurotoxic and associated with the development and progression of Alzheimer dementia, a disease characterized by accelerated neurodegeneration leading to progressive cognitive dysfunction. As a result, patients who have abnormal APP processing, impaired beta-amyloid clearance, or production of higher levels of APP (eg, trisomy 21 [Down syndrome]) are at increased risk of developing Alzheimer dementia. {{exhibit_1}}\n\n(Choice A) Patients with trisomy 21 have an increased risk of hematologic malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. This is thought to be related to the high susceptibility of megakaryocytic and B-cell precursors to increased dosage of chromosome 21 genes.\n\n(Choice C) Erythrocyte membrane distortion most often occurs with abnormalities affecting either the cytoskeleton (eg, spectrin/ankyrin in hereditary spherocytosis) or hemoglobin (eg, beta globin in sickle cell disease).\n\n(Choice D) Pulmonary elastic tissue loss can occur when there is excessive alveolar elastin degradation (eg, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency). Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a serine protease inhibitor that is synthesized in the liver and released into the systemic circulation.\n\n(Choice E) Skeletal myofiber disruption (eg, muscular & myotonic dystrophy) can occur with numerous mutations affecting the internal cytoskeletal system and contractile components (eg, sarcomere, costamere proteins). However, it is not typically related to impaired proteolytic cleavage and does not result in precipitation of insoluble fibrils.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene is located on chromosome 21 and encodes a cell-surface protein that can be degraded into beta amyloid. Abnormal APP processing, impaired beta-amyloid clearance, and production of higher levels of APP are associated with the increased formation of the neurotoxic plaques that characterize Alzheimer dementia. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "如果 β 淀粉样蛋白没有被细胞过程充分清除，它会形成不溶性原纤维，并促成在脑中积累的细胞外淀粉样斑块的产生。这些 β 淀粉样蛋白聚集物具有神经毒性，与阿尔茨海默病（一种以加速神经变性导致进行性认知功能障碍为特征的疾病）的发生和进展相关。因此，APP 加工异常、β 淀粉样蛋白清除受损或 APP 产量增加（例如，21 三体综合征 [唐氏综合征]）的患者发生阿尔茨海默病的风险增加。{{exhibit_1}}\n\n(选项 A) 21 三体综合征患者发生血液系统恶性肿瘤（如急性淋巴细胞白血病和急性巨核细胞白血病）的风险增加。这被认为与巨核细胞和 B 细胞前体对 21 号染色体基因剂量增加的高度易感性有关。\n\n(选项 C) 红细胞膜畸变最常发生在影响细胞骨架（例如，遗传性球形红细胞症中的血影蛋白/锚蛋白）或血红蛋白（例如，镰状细胞病中的 β 珠蛋白）的异常。\n\n(选项 D) 当肺泡弹性蛋白过度降解时（例如，α-1 抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症）会发生肺弹性组织缺失。α-1 抗胰蛋白酶是一种丝氨酸蛋白酶抑制剂，在肝脏中合成并释放到全身循环中。\n\n(选项 E) 骨骼肌纤维破坏（例如，肌肉和肌强直性营养不良）可能发生在影响内部细胞骨架系统和收缩成分（例如，肌节、肌节蛋白）的众多突变中。然而，它通常与蛋白水解切割受损无关，也不会导致不溶性原纤维的沉淀。\n\n教育目标：\n淀粉样前体蛋白 (APP) 基因位于 21 号染色体上，编码一种细胞表面蛋白，该蛋白可降解为 β 淀粉样蛋白。APP 加工异常、β 淀粉样蛋白清除受损和 APP 产量增加与特征性为阿尔茨海默病的神经毒性斑块的形成增加有关。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, specifically the role of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and beta-amyloid accumulation in neurodegeneration. It also assesses understanding of the genetic link between trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) and an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing that the genetic abnormality on chromosome 21 affects APP processing, leading to increased beta-amyloid production and aggregation. This process is directly linked to the accelerated neurodegeneration characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the alternative causes of the other options helps to eliminate them.",
