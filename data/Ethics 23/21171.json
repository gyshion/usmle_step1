    "en": "A 57-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and asthma comes to the office for a preventive visit during influenza season. The patient belongs to an ethnic minority group and is accompanied by her daughter. The patient's medical conditions are well controlled, and she currently has no symptoms. The provider explains that she is at high risk for complications from seasonal influenza and recommends that she get the seasonal influenza vaccine. The patient says, \"I don't trust that vaccine. It's from the government, so I don't think it's safe for people like me.\"",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Trust (eg, belief in the physician's skills, recommendations, and intentions) is central to the patient-provider therapeutic alliance and is associated with improved outcomes (eg, treatment adherence, quality, self-reported health). Among minority patients, distrust of physicians and health care systems may occur due to the following:\n\n*   Historical legacies of experimentation (eg, US Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee, which failed to obtain proper informed consent from Black men or provide them with curative and readily available treatment)\n*   Personal experience of discrimination, because minority patients are more likely to receive lower-quality health care and to experience suboptimal physician communication\n*   Low ethnic diversity in health care (eg, <5% of physicians are Black; <6% are Hispanic)\n\nDistrust can decrease vaccine use (eg, <40% of Black adults receive the influenza immunization). Given the patient's high risk for influenza complications (eg, history of asthma, diabetes), the physician should explore the reasons for her concerns and engage her in an OPEN-ENDED DISCUSSION using CULTURALLY INCLUSIVE health education materials; such materials may feature messages, images, or symbols that carry meaning to a minority community. Discussion should BUILD A PARTNERSHIP and establish alignment of patient and physician goals. Once the patient's concerns and priorities are understood, the physician may be able to provide reassurance through patient-centered education.\n\n(Choice A) Although the daughter's encouragement may be helpful, the physician should first attempt to directly engage the patient.\n\n(Choice B) Distrust in the medical system should be respectfully explored rather than viewed as delusional, given its legitimate relation to historical events and personal experience.\n\n(Choice D) Inquiring about the patient's understanding of federally funded health care systems is less focused and relevant compared to direct discussion, exploration of views, and reassurance regarding the influenza vaccination.\n\n(Choice E) Although the patient has the right to ultimately decline vaccination, the physician should first attempt to engage her with open-ended discussion about it.\n\nEducational objective:\nTrust is central to the provider-patient therapeutic alliance and is associated with improved outcomes. Distrust by minority patients may result from numerous factors (eg, historical legacy, experience of discrimination, low cultural inclusivity). Providers can build trust through open-ended discussion and focused reassurance using culturally relevant materials.",
    "zh": "信任（例如，相信医生的技能、建议和意图）是医患治疗联盟的核心，与改善的结果相关（例如，治疗依从性、质量、自我报告的健康状况）。在少数族裔患者中，由于以下原因，可能发生对医生和医疗保健系统的怀疑：\n\n*   历史遗留下来的实验（例如，塔斯基吉的美国公共卫生服务梅毒研究，未能获得黑人的适当知情同意，也未能为他们提供治愈和随时可用的治疗）\n*   歧视的个人经历，因为少数族裔患者更有可能获得较低质量的医疗保健，并经历次优的医生沟通\n*   医疗保健中的低种族多样性（例如，<5% 的医生是黑人；<6% 是西班牙裔）\n\n怀疑会降低疫苗的使用（例如，<40% 的黑人成年人接种流感疫苗）。鉴于患者患流感并发症的风险很高（例如，哮喘、糖尿病病史），医生应探讨她担忧的原因，并使用具有文化包容性的健康教育材料与她进行开放式讨论；此类材料可能包含对少数族裔社区有意义的信息、图像或符号。讨论应该建立伙伴关系，并建立患者和医生目标的统一。一旦理解了患者的担忧和优先事项，医生就可以通过以患者为中心的教育来提供保证。\n\n（选项 A）尽管女儿的鼓励可能有所帮助，但医生应该首先尝试直接与患者沟通。\n\n（选项 B）对医疗系统的怀疑应该被尊重地探索，而不是被视为妄想，因为它与历史事件和个人经历有合法的关系。\n\n（选项 D）与直接讨论、探索观点和关于流感疫苗接种的保证相比，询问患者对联邦资助的医疗保健系统的理解，缺乏重点且相关性较低。\n\n（选项 E）虽然患者有权最终拒绝接种疫苗，但医生应该首先尝试与她进行关于此事的开放式讨论。\n\n教育目标：\n信任是医患治疗联盟的核心，与改善的结果相关。少数族裔患者的不信任可能源于多种因素（例如，历史遗留问题、歧视经历、低文化包容性）。提供者可以通过开放式讨论和使用文化相关的材料进行重点保证来建立信任。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question assesses the importance of trust in the patient-physician relationship, particularly in minority populations, and the impact of historical and systemic factors on vaccine hesitancy. It also tests the ability to apply culturally sensitive communication techniques to address patient concerns and promote informed decision-making.\n\nThe best approach is to recognize the patient's distrust as potentially stemming from historical or personal experiences. Prioritize open-ended discussion, cultural sensitivity, and patient-centered education to build trust and address concerns before considering other interventions or respecting the patient's wishes without further engagement.",
