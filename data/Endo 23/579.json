    "en": "This patient has delayed puberty plus anosmia, consistent with a diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome. Kallmann syndrome results from a failure of GnRH-secreting neurons to migrate from their origin in the olfactory placode (situated outside the central nervous system) to their normal anatomic location in the hypothalamus. Most often, the cause is a mutation in the KAL-1 gene or the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 gene, which code for proteins required in this migration.\n\nPatients with Kallmann syndrome classically have central hypogonadism and anosmia, although there may be other midline defects as well (eg, cleft lip or cleft palate). Most often, these patients present with delayed puberty. On physical examination, the testes are often just 1-2 mL in volume. There is usually some pubic hair because adrenarche occurs normally.\n\nIn the United States, delayed puberty is defined as the absence or incomplete development of secondary sexual characteristics by age 14 in boys and by age 12 in girls. Testicular enlargement is the first sign of puberty in boys, and breast enlargement is the first sign of puberty in girls. The initiation of puberty and the maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics and fertility require the coordinated efforts of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads. Delayed puberty can result from a derangement anywhere in this axis.\n\n(Choices B, C, D, and E) These pathways represent normal feedback loops between the testes and the hypothalamus and pituitary. Pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates proliferation of the seminiferous tubules and spermatogenesis. The seminiferous tubules produce inhibin, which feeds back to inhibit pituitary FSH secretion. Luteinizing hormone from the pituitary stimulates the interstitial Leydig cells to produce testosterone, which also participates in feedback inhibition. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nEducational objective:\nIn Kallmann syndrome, there is an absence of GnRH secretory neurons in the hypothalamus due to defective migration from the olfactory placode. These patients have central hypogonadism and anosmia, and often present with delayed puberty.",
    "zh": "该患者有青春期延迟加上嗅觉缺失，符合Kallmann综合征的诊断。Kallmann综合征源于GnRH分泌神经元未能从其起源于嗅觉板（位于中枢神经系统外）迁移到其在下丘脑中的正常解剖位置。最常见的原因是KAL-1基因或成纤维细胞生长因子受体-1基因的突变，这些基因编码此迁移所需的蛋白质。\n\nKallmann综合征患者通常表现为中枢性性腺功能减退和嗅觉缺失，尽管也可能存在其他中线缺陷（例如，唇裂或腭裂）。最常见的是，这些患者表现为青春期延迟。在体格检查中，睾丸的体积通常只有1-2毫升。通常会有一些阴毛，因为肾上腺功能初现正常发生。\n\n在美国，青春期延迟定义为男孩在14岁，女孩在12岁时，第二性征缺失或发育不全。睾丸增大是男孩青春期的第一个迹象，乳房增大是女孩青春期的第一个迹象。青春期的启动和维持第二性征和生育能力需要下丘脑、垂体和性腺的协调努力。青春期延迟可能源于此轴系中的任何紊乱。\n\n（选项B、C、D和E）这些途径代表睾丸与下丘脑和垂体之间的正常反馈环。垂体促卵泡激素 (FSH) 刺激生精小管增殖和精子发生。生精小管产生抑制素，它反馈抑制垂体FSH的分泌。来自垂体的黄体生成素刺激间质间质细胞产生睾酮，后者也参与反馈抑制。{{exhibit_2}}\n\n教育目标：\n在Kallmann综合征中，由于嗅觉板的缺陷迁移，下丘脑中不存在GnRH分泌神经元。这些患者患有中枢性性腺功能减退和嗅觉缺失，并且经常表现为青春期延迟。"
