  "explanation": {
    "en": "Bile is stored and concentrated within the gallbladder and is involved in digestion and absorption of dietary fats and removal of waste products (eg, bilirubin, cholesterol) for excretion in feces. Gallstones usually occur when one such waste product supersaturates the bile, resulting in precipitation and eventual stone formation.\n\nIn the United States, most gallstones are due to the SUPERSATURATION of cholesterol, which usually precipitates out of bile with calcium salts and mucin, forming white or yellow cholesterol stones, as seen in this patient. Cholesterol stone formation occurs due to the following:\n\n*   **Increased cholesterol synthesis**: Hypercholesterolemia, caused by diet, genetics, diabetes mellitus, medications (eg, oral contraceptives), or obesity (increased HMG-CoA reductase activity), results in hypersecretion of cholesterol into the bile.\n*   **Gallbladder hypomotility**: Pregnancy, medications (eg, somatostatin), prolonged fasting, parenteral nutrition, and spinal cord injury lead to gallbladder stasis, which promotes excessive water resorption from bile and concentration of cholesterol.\n*   **Decreased bile acid synthesis** (or recirculation): Fibrates (eg, fenofibrate) inhibit bile acid synthesis, increasing cholesterol concentration within the bile. Decreased bile acid resorption at the ileum (eg, due to Crohn disease) also promotes cholesterol concentration.\n*   **Increased calcium or mucin concentration**: Rapid weight loss (eg, gastric bypass) promotes increased calcium and mucin concentrations in the bile, which trap cholesterol crystals and promote stone formation.\n\n(Choices A and E) Increased enterohepatic cycling of bilirubin occurs with ileal disease (eg, Crohn disease), as the loss of bile acids promotes reabsorption of unconjugated bilirubin. Increased efflux of bilirubin into bile also occurs with hyperbilirubinemia from chronic hemolysis (eg, sickle cell disease). Because of high bilirubin concentrations, these mechanisms promote the formation of black pigment stones, not cholesterol stones.\n\n(Choices B and C) Although both decreased bile acid synthesis (eg, due to fibrate medications) and gallbladder hypomotility (eg, due to pregnancy, prolonged fasting, or spinal cord injury) promote the formation of cholesterol gallstones, this patient does not have risk factors for either etiology.\n\nEducational objective:\nMost gallstones occur due to the supersaturation of cholesterol, which precipitates out of bile with mucin and calcium salts to form white or yellow cholesterol stones. Factors that promote the formation of cholesterol stones include increased cholesterol synthesis, gallbladder hypomotility, increased calcium or mucin concentration, and decreased bile acid synthesis or recirculation. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}",
    "zh": "胆汁储存在胆囊内并被浓缩，参与膳食脂肪的消化吸收以及废物（如胆红素、胆固醇）的清除，以便通过粪便排出。胆结石通常发生在其中一种废物使胆汁超饱和时，导致沉淀并最终形成结石。\n\n在美国，大多数胆结石是由于胆固醇的超饱和引起的，胆固醇通常与钙盐和粘蛋白从胆汁中析出，形成白色或黄色的胆固醇结石，如该患者所示。胆固醇结石的形成是由于以下原因：\n\n*   **胆固醇合成增加**：高胆固醇血症，由饮食、遗传、糖尿病、药物（如口服避孕药）或肥胖（HMG-CoA 还原酶活性增加）引起，导致胆固醇过度分泌到胆汁中。\n*   **胆囊运动功能减退**：妊娠、药物（如生长抑素）、长时间禁食、肠外营养和脊髓损伤可导致胆囊淤滞，从而促进胆汁中水分的过度吸收和胆固醇的浓缩。\n*   **胆汁酸合成减少**（或再循环）：贝特类药物（如非诺贝特）抑制胆汁酸合成，增加胆汁中胆固醇的浓度。回肠处胆汁酸吸收减少（如由于克罗恩病）也促进胆固醇浓缩。\n*   **钙或粘蛋白浓度增加**：快速减肥（如胃旁路手术）可促进胆汁中钙和粘蛋白浓度的增加，从而捕获胆固醇晶体并促进结石的形成。\n\n（选项 A 和 E）胆红素的肠肝循环增加发生在回肠疾病（如克罗恩病）中，因为胆汁酸的丢失促进了非结合胆红素的重吸收。胆红素进入胆汁的流出增加也发生在慢性溶血引起的高胆红素血症（如镰状细胞病）中。由于胆红素浓度高，这些机制促进了黑色色素结石的形成，而不是胆固醇结石。\n\n（选项 B 和 C）虽然胆汁酸合成减少（如由于贝特类药物）和胆囊运动功能减退（如由于妊娠、长时间禁食或脊髓损伤）都促进了胆固醇胆结石的形成，但该患者没有这两种病因的危险因素。\n\n教学目标：\n大多数胆结石的发生是由于胆固醇的超饱和，胆固醇与粘蛋白和钙盐一起从胆汁中析出，形成白色或黄色的胆固醇结石。促进胆固醇结石形成的因素包括胆固醇合成增加、胆囊运动功能减退、钙或粘蛋白浓度增加以及胆汁酸合成或再循环减少。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}"
