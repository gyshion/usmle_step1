The patient is Rh negative and received Rh(D) immunoglobulin at 28 weeks gestation. She has no chronic medical conditions and takes no medications. Blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg and pulse is 118/min. Physical examination shows a firm and tender uterus. Speculum examination reveals a moderate amount of bleeding coming from an open cervical os. Fetal heart tracing shows a baseline of 105/min and no variability. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient in the third trimester with PAINFUL vaginal bleeding and a TENDER, FIRM uterus has a presentation consistent with ABRUPTIO PLACENTAE (ie, premature separation of the placenta from the uterus prior to fetal delivery). {{exhibit_2}} Abruptio placentae is associated with MATERNAL HYPERTENSION, abdominal trauma, use of tobacco or cocaine (vasoconstrictors causing placental ischemia), and prior abruptio placentae. Abruptio placentae occurs when maternal vessels rupture at the uteroplacental interface, causing intrauterine bleeding. This bleeding results in DETACHMENT of the placenta from the uterus, an increase in intrauterine pressure (eg, tender, distended uterus), and UTERINE IRRITABILITY (eg, high-frequency, low-intensity contractions). Some cases are self-limiting and contained, whereas others progress as the bleeding and placental separation continue. As the degree of placental separation increases, the risk of FETAL COMPROMISE and mortality from hypoxia (eg, fetal bradycardia, minimal variability in the fetal heart rate tracing) also increases. Maternal complications include hemorrhage and DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION. Acute abruptio placentae with active bleeding is an indication for delivery; the mode of delivery depends on both maternal and fetal stability. {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}\n\n(Choice A) Placenta accreta, direct attachment of the placental villi onto the myometrium, typically presents after delivery of the fetus with postpartum hemorrhage and inability to remove the placenta.\n(Choice B) Uterine rupture, full-thickness disruption of the uterine wall, is associated with severe lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and fetal heart rate tracing abnormalities (eg, bradycardia). However, it typically occurs in patients with prior cesarean delivery (this patient is a primigravida) and typically has a uterus with palpable fetal parts, rather than uterine rigidity.\n(Choice C) In vasa previa, the fetal vessels traverse the internal cervical os and are vulnerable to injury. However, patients typically have PAINLESS, rather than painful, vaginal bleeding.\n(Choice D) Placental previa, placental implantation over the cervix, typically presents in the third trimester with PAINLESS, rather than painful, vaginal bleeding and no uterine tenderness.",
    "zh": "该患者孕晚期出现疼痛性阴道出血，子宫压痛、坚硬，其表现与胎盘早剥（即，胎盘在胎儿分娩前与子宫分离）一致。{{exhibit_2}} 胎盘早剥与孕妇高血压、腹部外伤、使用烟草或可卡因（血管收缩剂引起胎盘缺血）以及既往胎盘早剥有关。胎盘早剥发生在母体血管在子宫胎盘界面破裂时，导致宫内出血。这种出血导致胎盘与子宫分离，宫内压力升高（如子宫压痛、膨胀），以及子宫兴奋性增加（如高频、低强度宫缩）。一些病例具有自限性和局限性，而另一些病例则随着出血和胎盘分离的持续进行而进展。随着胎盘分离程度的增加，胎儿窘迫和缺氧死亡（如胎儿心动过缓、胎心率监护变异性最小）的风险也会增加。孕妇并发症包括出血和弥漫性血管内凝血。急性胎盘早剥伴活动性出血是分娩的指征；分娩方式取决于孕妇和胎儿的稳定性。{{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}}\n\n（选项A）胎盘植入，胎盘绒毛直接附着于子宫肌层，通常在胎儿分娩后出现，表现为产后出血和无法取出胎盘。\n（选项B）子宫破裂，子宫壁全层破裂，与严重的下腹痛、阴道出血和胎心率监护异常（如心动过缓）相关。然而，它通常发生在既往剖宫产的患者中（本患者为初孕妇），并且子宫通常有可触及的胎儿部分，而不是子宫僵硬。\n（选项C）在前置血管中，胎儿血管穿过宫颈内口，容易受到损伤。然而，患者通常有无痛性（而不是疼痛性）阴道出血。\n（选项D）前置胎盘，胎盘植入于宫颈上方，通常在孕晚期表现为无痛性（而不是疼痛性）阴道出血，且无子宫压痛。"
