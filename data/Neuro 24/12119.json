    "en": "A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he suddenly became unresponsive at home. When the paramedics arrived at his residence, they found him pulseless with ventricular fibrillation. After 10 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient regained spontaneous circulation. In the hospital, he is intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Vital signs remain stable. A therapeutic hypothermia protocol is initiated for the next 72 hours. Following rewarming, he remains comatose with fixed and dilated pupils. There is no direct or consensual pupillary response to light. MRI of the brain reveals diffuse loss of gray-white matter differentiation with sulcal effacement. {{exhibit_1}} This patient's pupillary findings are most likely caused by damage to which of the following brain regions?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "The correct answer is B. The patient's presentation of unresponsiveness, cardiac arrest, and subsequent coma with fixed and dilated pupils suggests severe anoxic brain injury. The pupillary light reflex is mediated by the oculomotor nerve (CN III) and its associated nuclei and pathways. The pretectal nucleus, located in the midbrain, plays a crucial role in the pupillary light reflex. When light shines on the retina, signals are transmitted via the optic nerve to the pretectal nucleus. From there, signals are relayed to the Edinger-Westphal nuclei, which are also located in the midbrain. These nuclei project preganglionic parasympathetic fibers through the oculomotor nerve to the ciliary ganglion, which then innervates the sphincter pupillae muscle, causing pupillary constriction. Damage to the midbrain, particularly the pretectal nucleus or the Edinger-Westphal nuclei, can result in fixed and dilated pupils, indicating a loss of pupillary light reflex. The MRI findings of diffuse loss of gray-white matter differentiation with sulcal effacement are consistent with global hypoxic-ischemic injury, which can affect the midbrain. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(Choice A) The medulla contains the glossopharyngeal (CN IX) and vagus (CN X) nerves, which are primarily involved in swallowing, taste, and autonomic functions, not the pupillary light reflex.\n\n(Choice C) The occipital lobe contains the primary visual cortex. Damage here can cause visual field deficits but does not directly cause fixed and dilated pupils.\n\n(Choice D) The superior optic radiations travel through the parietal lobe. Lesions here can lead to contralateral homonymous inferior quadrantanopia, not pupillary abnormalities.\n\n(Choice E) The pons contains the horizontal gaze center and nuclei for CN V and VII. While involved in some reflexes, it is not the primary center for the pupillary light reflex.\n\n(Choice F) The inferior optic radiations travel through the temporal lobe. Lesions here can cause contralateral homonymous superior quadrantanopia.\n\n(Choice G) The thalamus relays sensory information, including visual input, to the cortex. While it receives input from the optic tract, the primary processing for the pupillary light reflex occurs in the midbrain.\n\nEducational objective: The upper midbrain contains the neural structures (eg, optic nerve, pretectal nuclei, Edinger-Westphal nuclei, oculomotor nerve) that mediate the direct and consensual pupillary light reflex.",
    "zh": "正确答案是B。患者表现为无反应、心脏骤停以及随后的昏迷，伴有瞳孔固定和散大，提示严重的缺氧性脑损伤。瞳孔对光反射由动眼神经（CN III）及其相关核和通路介导。位于中脑的视前核在瞳孔对光反射中起着关键作用。当光线照射到视网膜上时，信号通过视神经传导到视前核。然后，信号被传递到Edinger-Westphal核，该核也位于中脑。这些核通过动眼神经投射节前副交感神经纤维到睫状神经节，然后支配瞳孔括约肌，导致瞳孔收缩。中脑损伤，特别是视前核或Edinger-Westphal核的损伤，可导致瞳孔固定和散大，表明瞳孔对光反射的丧失。MRI显示灰质-白质分化弥漫性缺失，伴有脑沟变浅，与全脑缺氧-缺血性损伤一致，这会影响中脑。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}}\n\n(选项A) 延髓包含舌咽神经（CN IX）和迷走神经（CN X），主要参与吞咽、味觉和自主神经功能，而不是瞳孔对光反射。\n\n(选项C) 枕叶包含主要的视觉皮层。这里的损伤可导致视野缺损，但不会直接导致瞳孔固定和散大。\n\n(选项D) 上视辐射通过顶叶。这里的病变可导致对侧同向性下象限盲，而不是瞳孔异常。\n\n(选项E) 脑桥包含水平凝视中心和CN V和VII的核。虽然参与一些反射，但它不是瞳孔对光反射的主要中心。\n\n(选项F) 下视辐射通过颞叶。这里的病变可导致对侧同向性上象限盲。\n\n(选项G) 丘脑传递感觉信息，包括视觉输入，到皮层。虽然它接收来自视束的输入，但瞳孔对光反射的主要处理发生在中脑。\n\n教育目标：上中脑包含调节直接和间接瞳孔对光反射的神经结构（例如，视神经、视前核、Edinger-Westphal核、动眼神经）。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the neuroanatomy and pathophysiology of the pupillary light reflex and its vulnerability to hypoxic-ischemic injury following cardiac arrest. It assesses the ability to correlate clinical findings (fixed and dilated pupils) with specific brain regions responsible for this reflex.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the clinical significance of fixed and dilated pupils in the context of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Then, recall the neural pathway of the pupillary light reflex, focusing on the structures located in the midbrain that are critical for this reflex. Finally, consider how diffuse brain injury might selectively impact these midbrain structures.",
