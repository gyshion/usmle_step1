    "en": "An 82-year-old man is brought to the office by his daughter due to behavioral changes. She reports that over the past year her father has become increasingly paranoid and frequently talks out loud as if in conversation when no one else is present. The daughter says, \"During a recent argument, he accused me of being an imposter and stealing his personal items. Also, he used to be very clean, but his personal hygiene has gotten really bad. He also stopped watching baseball, which used to be his favorite hobby.\" The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Medications include lisinopril, simvastatin, and metformin. The patient has been unable to live independently for the past 2 years due to increasing forgetfulness and an inability to perform self-care. Vital signs are stable, and physical examination and laboratory evaluation are unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's behavior?",
    "zh": "一位82岁男性由女儿带到诊室，原因是行为改变。她报告说，在过去一年里，她父亲变得越来越偏执，并且经常自言自语，好像在和别人交谈一样，但实际上周围并没有其他人。女儿说：“在最近的一次争吵中，他指责我是冒名顶替者，偷了他的个人物品。而且，他过去非常爱干净，但他的个人卫生变得很差。他还停止观看棒球比赛，这曾经是他最喜欢的爱好。” 患者的病史有高血压、高胆固醇血症和2型糖尿病。用药包括赖诺普利、辛伐他汀和二甲双胍。由于记忆力减退和无法进行自我护理，患者在过去2年内无法独立生活。生命体征稳定，体格检查和实验室评估无特殊发现。以下哪项最能解释该患者的行为？"

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's 2-year history of increasing forgetfulness and functional impairment, followed by the development of psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations), is most likely explained by Alzheimer disease (AD). AD is the most common type of dementia, characterized by insidious onset (typically age >65), early impairment of recent memory, executive dysfunction, and visuospatial deficits. As AD progresses, it is commonly complicated by the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as apathy, depressive symptoms, delusions, hallucinations, disinhibition, and agitation. Delusions with paranoid themes (eg, items being stolen, family members replaced by imposters [ie, Capgras delusion]) are common. Behavioral symptoms tend to become more common and problematic as the severity of AD worsens.\n\n(Choices B and D) Delusional disorder is characterized by one or more delusions in the absence of other psychotic symptoms (eg, hallucinations). Schizophrenia typically presents in young adulthood and is characterized by psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations), disorganized speech and behavior, negative symptoms) with associated functional decline lasting ≥6 months. These primary psychotic disorders are not diagnosed when psychotic symptoms are better explained by a medical condition, such as progressive dementia.\n\n(Choice C) Major depression with psychotic features is a subtype of major depressive disorder characterized by very severe depressive symptoms and delusions and/or hallucinations consistent with depressed themes (eg, guilt, worthlessness). This patient has insufficient depressive symptoms to diagnose an episode of major depressive disorder; his apathy and deterioration in personal hygiene are consistent with AD.\n\n(Choice E) Some medications (eg, corticosteroids, dopamine agonists) can induce psychotic symptoms and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of new-onset psychotic symptoms. This patient's medications are not known to induce psychosis, and his symptoms are better explained by AD.\n\nEducational objective: Psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations) are common in Alzheimer disease and increase with the severity of illness.",
    "zh": "该患者有2年记忆力减退和功能障碍史，随后出现精神病症状（如妄想、幻觉），最有可能由阿尔茨海默病（AD）解释。AD是最常见的痴呆症类型，其特征是隐匿起病（通常年龄>65岁）、近期记忆力早期受损、执行功能障碍和视觉空间缺陷。随着AD的进展，常伴发神经精神病学症状，如冷漠、抑郁症状、妄想、幻觉、失抑制和激动。伴有偏执主题的妄想（例如，物品被盗、家庭成员被冒名顶替者取代[即，Capgras妄想症]）很常见。随着AD严重程度的加剧，行为症状往往会变得更常见且更成问题。\n\n（选项 B 和 D）妄想症的特征是在没有其他精神病症状（例如，幻觉）的情况下出现一种或多种妄想。精神分裂症通常在青年期发病，其特征是精神病症状（例如，妄想、幻觉）、言语和行为紊乱、阴性症状，并伴有持续≥6个月的功能衰退。当精神病症状能被医疗状况（如进行性痴呆）更好地解释时，不会诊断这些原发性精神病性障碍。\n\n（选项 C）伴有精神病特征的重度抑郁症是重度抑郁症的一种亚型，其特征是严重的抑郁症状以及与抑郁主题一致的妄想和/或幻觉（例如，内疚感、无价值感）。该患者的抑郁症状不足以诊断为重度抑郁症发作；他的冷漠和个人卫生恶化与AD一致。\n\n（选项 E）一些药物（例如，皮质类固醇、多巴胺激动剂）可诱发精神病症状，应纳入新发精神病症状的鉴别诊断。该患者的药物已知不会诱发精神病，并且他的症状能更好地被AD解释。\n\n教育目标：精神病症状（例如，妄想、幻觉）在阿尔茨海默病中很常见，并随着疾病的严重程度而增加。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the presentation of Alzheimer disease, particularly the development of psychotic symptoms in the context of cognitive decline and functional impairment. It requires differentiating Alzheimer disease with neuropsychiatric features from primary psychotic disorders and other causes of psychosis.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully evaluating the patient's history, focusing on the timeline of cognitive decline, functional impairment, and the nature of the psychotic symptoms. The presence of progressive forgetfulness and functional decline preceding the psychotic symptoms strongly suggests a neurodegenerative process like Alzheimer disease.",
    "zh": "此题考察对阿尔茨海默病的表现，特别是认知能力下降和功能障碍背景下精神病症状发展的理解。它需要区分具有神经精神病学特征的阿尔茨海默病与原发性精神病性障碍和其他精神病原因。\n\n解决此问题的方法涉及仔细评估患者病史，重点关注认知能力下降、功能障碍的时间线以及精神病症状的性质。进行性遗忘和功能衰退先于精神病症状的出现强烈提示了阿尔茨海默病等神经退行性过程。"
