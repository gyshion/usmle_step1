    "en": "A dermatology researcher is studying the role of different amino acids in wound healing. She cultures mature dermal fibroblasts in growth media. After several days, the fibroblasts begin synthesizing polypeptide chains that assemble into triple helical structures, followed by fibrils. The fibrillar proteins are hydrolyzed and separated into their constituent amino acids via paper chromatography.",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and is synthesized by fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and chondroblasts. It consists of 3 polypeptide alpha chains held together by hydrogen bonds, forming a rope-like triple helix (collagen molecule). Collagen molecules self-assemble into fibrils, which subsequently crosslink to form collagen fibers.\n\nThe triple helical conformation of collagen molecules occurs due to the simple and repetitive amino acid sequence within each alpha chain, in which glycine (Gly) occupies every third amino acid position (Gly-X-Y). Glycine is the most abundant amino acid in collagen and, due to its small size, is the only amino acid that can fit into the confined space between individual alpha chains.\n\n(Choices A, B, D, E, and F) None of the other amino acids are as abundant as glycine in collagen. X often represents proline and Y is often hydroxyproline or hydroxylysine. Proline residues are essential for alpha helix formation because their ring configuration introduces a kink in the polypeptide chain, enhancing the rigidity of the helical structure. Hydroxylysine is necessary for cross-linking, which greatly increases the tensile strength of assembled collagen fibers.",
    "zh": "胶原蛋白是人体内最丰富的蛋白质，由成纤维细胞、成骨细胞和软骨细胞合成。它由3条多肽α链组成，这些α链通过氢键连接在一起，形成绳索状的三重螺旋结构（胶原蛋白分子）。胶原蛋白分子自组装成原纤维，随后交联形成胶原纤维。\n\n胶原蛋白分子的三重螺旋构象是由于每条α链内简单而重复的氨基酸序列，其中甘氨酸（Gly）占据每三个氨基酸的位置（Gly-X-Y）。甘氨酸是胶原蛋白中最丰富的氨基酸，由于其分子量小，是唯一能够融入各个α链之间的狭窄空间中的氨基酸。\n\n（选项A、B、D、E和F）其他氨基酸在胶原蛋白中不如甘氨酸丰富。X通常代表脯氨酸，Y通常是羟脯氨酸或羟赖氨酸。脯氨酸残基对于α螺旋的形成至关重要，因为它们的环状结构在多肽链中引入了扭结，从而增强了螺旋结构的刚性。羟赖氨酸是交联所必需的，这大大增加了组装的胶原纤维的抗张强度。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of collagen structure and the amino acid composition that contributes to its triple helical conformation. Glycine's unique structural properties allow it to occupy every third position in the collagen's alpha chains. \n\nTo answer this question, recall that the scenario describes proteins forming triple helices and fibrils. Remembering that collagen has this specific structure, and that glycine is the most abundant amino acid in collagen due to its small size and repetitive positioning, leads to the correct answer.",
