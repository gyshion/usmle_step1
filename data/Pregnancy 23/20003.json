    "en": "A 38-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 0, at 34 weeks gestation comes to the office due to increasing swelling in her hands and legs. The patient first noticed the swelling a few weeks ago but now cannot stand for more than an hour without needing to elevate her legs. She has no orthopnea, dyspnea, or chest pain. The patient has no chronic medical conditions and takes no daily medications. Vital signs are normal. Cardiac examination is within normal limits. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Bilateral lower extremities have 2+ pitting edema to the midshin. Urine dipstick shows no protein. Compared to a healthy nonpregnant woman, which of the following parameters is most likely to be decreased in this patient?",

    "en": "During pregnancy, the maternal cardiovascular system undergoes physiologic adaptations to increase cardiac output and optimize fetal perfusion. The most significant hemodynamic change is a marked decrease in SYSTEMIC VASCULAR RESISTANCE (SVR), which occurs due to increased release of peripheral vasodilators (eg, nitric oxide, prostacyclin) and decreased vascular sensitivity to vasoconstrictors (eg, norepinephrine, angiotensin II). The formation of a high-flow, low-resistance circuit within the uterus and placenta also contributes to decreased SVR.\n\nDecreased SVR induces mild hypotension, which along with direct stimulation by placental hormones, leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This results in fluid retention and an INCREASE IN PLASMA BLOOD VOLUME of up to 40% in pregnancy (Choice D). This physiologic increase in plasma blood volume inevitably results in increased venous return (ie, increased cardiac preload), which together with reduced SVR (ie, decreased cardiac afterload) facilitates a GREATER STROKE VOLUME and INCREASED CARDIAC OUTPUT (Choices A and B).\n\nPulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) also decreases during pregnancy, likely via the same vasodilatory mechanisms as SVR. This helps accommodate the increased preload to the right heart while maintaining a NORMAL CENTRAL VENOUS PRESSURE (CVP) (Choice C). Vascular capacitance (ie, the ability of systemic veins to stretch) also helps accommodate increased total blood volume without affecting the CVP.\n\nDespite normal CVP, PERIPHERAL EDEMA is common in pregnancy due to decreased oncotic pressure; this change encourages leakage of intravascular fluid into dependent peripheral tissues (eg, lower extremities).\n\nEducational objective:\nDuring pregnancy, systemic vascular resistance decreases and plasma blood volume increases. Venous capacitance and a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance allow for accommodation of increased blood volume without affecting central venous pressure. Despite a normal CVP, peripheral edema is common in pregnancy due to decreased capillary oncotic pressure that encourages leakage of fluid into dependent peripheral tissues (eg, lower extremities).",
    "zh": "在怀孕期间，孕妇心血管系统会发生生理适应以增加心输出量并优化胎儿灌注。最重要的血流动力学变化是全身血管阻力 (SVR) 显着降低，这是由于外周血管舒张剂（例如，一氧化氮、前列环素）释放增加以及血管对血管收缩剂（例如，去甲肾上腺素、血管紧张素 II）的敏感性降低所致。子宫和胎盘内形成高流量、低阻力循环也有助于降低 SVR。\n\nSVR 降低会导致轻度低血压，这与胎盘激素的直接刺激一起，导致肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统激活。这会导致液体潴留，并使妊娠期血浆血容量增加多达 40%（选项 D）。这种血浆血容量的生理性增加不可避免地导致静脉回流增加（即，心脏前负荷增加），这与 SVR 降低（即，心脏后负荷降低）一起，促进更大的每搏输出量和心输出量增加（选项 A 和 B）。\n\n妊娠期间，肺血管阻力 (PVR) 也会降低，这很可能通过与 SVR 相同的血管舒张机制。这有助于适应右心前负荷的增加，同时保持正常的中心静脉压 (CVP)（选项 C）。血管容量（即，全身静脉的扩张能力）也有助于适应总血容量的增加，而不会影响 CVP。\n\n尽管 CVP 正常，但妊娠期间周围水肿很常见，这是由于胶体渗透压降低所致；这种变化会导致血管内液体渗漏到依赖性外周组织（例如，下肢）。\n\n教育目标：\n在怀孕期间，全身血管阻力降低，血浆血容量增加。静脉容量和肺血管阻力的降低允许适应血容量的增加，而不会影响中心静脉压。尽管 CVP 正常，但妊娠期间周围水肿很常见，这是由于毛细血管胶体渗透压降低，这会导致液体渗漏到依赖性外周组织（例如，下肢）。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the maternal cardiopulmonary adaptations to pregnancy, specifically the hemodynamic changes that occur. It requires knowledge of how systemic vascular resistance, cardiac output, plasma volume, and central venous pressure are altered to support fetal development.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall the physiological changes in pregnancy. The key is to identify which parameter is decreased compared to the nonpregnant state, considering the body's compensatory mechanisms for increased blood volume and the demands of pregnancy.",
