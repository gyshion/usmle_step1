    "en": "A 22-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a bar fight during which he received a knife wound to his neck. The patient is in moderate distress but is alert and can follow commands. Vital signs are stable. Neurologic examination shows right-sided hemiplegia. Loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation is present below the C8 dermatome on the right side. On the left side, there is loss of pain and temperature sensation below the T2 dermatome. MRI of this patient's spine will most likely reveal which of the following?",

    "en": "This patient has a penetrating injury resulting in right-sided hemisection of the spinal cord at the C8 level. Spinal cord hemisection classically causes BROWN-SÉQUARD SYNDROME, which is characterized by the following tract lesions and clinical signs:\n\n* Anterior horn (lower motor neuron) injury produces ipsilateral paralysis at the level of the lesion.\n* Lateral corticospinal tract (upper motor neuron) injury results in ipsilateral paralysis below the level of the lesion.\n* Dorsal column (gracile and cuneate fasciculi) involvement causes ipsilateral loss of vibration, proprioception, and light touch (ie, 2-point discrimination) sensation below the level of the lesion.\n* Spinothalamic tract injury causes contralateral loss of pain and temperature (lateral spinothalamic) and crude touch (anterior spinothalamic) sensation 1-2 levels below the lesion.\n\nSpinal cord injury above T1 can also cause ipsilateral Horner syndrome (ie, ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) if there is concurrent damage to the oculosympathetic pathway.\n\n(Choice A) Complete transection of the spinal cord would result in bilateral loss of all sensation and voluntary movement below the level of the lesion.\n\n(Choice B) A lesion of the dorsal sensory roots would lead to ipsilateral loss of sensation and areflexia from the specific dermatome(s) affected.\n\n(Choice C) A lesion of the dorsal columns on the right side would result only in ipsilateral loss of vibratory, proprioceptive, and light touch (ie, 2-point discrimination) sensation below the level of the lesion.\n\n(Choice D) A lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus is associated with internuclear ophthalmoplegia, which is commonly seen in multiple sclerosis; it presents with impaired horizontal eye movement and weak adduction of the ipsilateral eye with simultaneous abduction nystagmus of the contralateral eye.\n\nEducational objective:\nBrown-Séquard syndrome results from hemisection of the spinal cord. It is characterized by ipsilateral paralysis due to corticospinal tract injury; ipsilateral loss of vibratory, proprioceptive, and light touch sensation (dorsal columns); and contralateral loss of pain, temperature, and crude touch sensation (spinothalamic tract) below the level of the injury.",
    "zh": "该患者有穿透性损伤，导致C8水平脊髓右侧半切。脊髓半切典型地导致布朗-塞夸尔综合征，其特征是以下束损伤和临床体征：\n\n* 前角（低位运动神经元）损伤导致病变水平的同侧瘫痪。\n* 侧皮质脊髓束（上位运动神经元）损伤导致病变水平以下的同侧瘫痪。\n* 后索（薄束和楔束）受累导致病变水平以下的同侧振动觉、本体感觉和触觉（即，两点辨别觉）丧失。\n* 脊髓丘脑束损伤导致病变以下1-2个水平的对侧疼痛和温度觉（侧脊髓丘脑）和粗触觉（前脊髓丘脑）丧失。\n\nT1以上的脊髓损伤如果同时伴有眼交感神经通路损伤，也可能导致同侧霍纳综合征（即，眼睑下垂、瞳孔缩小、无汗症）。\n\n（选项A）脊髓完全横断将导致病变水平以下所有感觉和自主运动的双侧丧失。\n\n（选项B）背感觉根的损伤将导致受影响特定皮节的同侧感觉丧失和反射消失。\n\n（选项C）右侧后索病变仅会导致病变水平以下的同侧振动觉、本体感觉和触觉（即，两点辨别觉）丧失。\n\n（选项D）内侧纵束病变与核间性眼肌麻痹有关，这在多发性硬化症中很常见；其表现为水平眼球运动受损和同侧眼内收无力，同时对侧眼外展性眼震。\n\n教育目标：\n布朗-塞夸尔综合征由脊髓半切引起。其特征是由于皮质脊髓束损伤引起的同侧瘫痪；同侧振动觉、本体感觉和触觉丧失（后索）；以及病变水平以下的对侧疼痛、温度觉和粗触觉丧失（脊髓丘脑束）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the clinical presentation and neuroanatomical correlates of Brown-Séquard syndrome, which results from a spinal cord hemisection. It requires the integration of motor and sensory deficits to localize the lesion.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing the pattern of ipsilateral motor loss and ipsilateral proprioception/vibration loss, combined with contralateral pain/temperature loss, as characteristic of a spinal cord hemisection. Identifying the specific tracts involved based on the described deficits allows for the selection of the correct anatomical lesion.",
