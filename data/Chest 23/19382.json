    "en": "This patient with chronic lung problems has autopsy findings consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a genetic mutation (eg, ΔF508) affecting the CF transmembrane conductance regulator. A defect in this chloride channel prevents normal hydration of mucus and results in the accumulation of thick, viscous secretions throughout the body (eg, lungs, pancreas, vas deferens).\n\nRespiratory disease, the most common CF manifestation, is the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality. Patients typically have chronic cough due to impaired clearance of inspissated secretions in the bronchioles. This buildup leads to mucus plugging (ie, obstructive lung disease), bacterial colonization (ie, recurrent pneumonia), and chronic infiltration of inflammatory cells. Over time, elastase produced by neutrophils causes bronchiectasis (weakened, dilated bronchial walls) and parenchymal destruction. Advanced disease is associated with irreversible damage, progressive respiratory failure, and shortened life expectancy.\n\n(Choice A) Accumulation of proteinaceous material within alveoli occurs with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, a condition in which clearance of surfactant by alveolar macrophages is impaired. Inflammatory cells are not present in this disorder.\n\n(Choice B) Antigen-mediated aggregation of macrophages describes the formation of granulomas, as occurs with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Histoplasma capsulatum infection. The inciting organism can usually be identified on microscopy and mucus plugs are not characteristically present.\n\n(Choice C) Deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin (protease inhibitor of elastase) causes liver dysfunction, emphysema, and eventually bronchiectasis. The onset of pulmonary symptoms typically occurs at age >20, and mucus plugs would not be expected.\n\n(Choice E) Increased pulmonary venous pressure is characteristic of left-sided heart failure, which results in pulmonary congestion and interstitial and alveolar edema. Bronchiectasis is not an associated finding.\n\nEducational objective:\nCystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder in which a defective chloride channel causes impaired clearance of thick, viscous airway secretions. Patients typically develop a chronic cough, recurrent pulmonary infections, and bronchiectasis (dilated bronchial tree). {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "这位患有慢性肺部疾病的患者的尸检结果与囊性纤维化 (CF) 相符，囊性纤维化是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，由影响 CF 跨膜电导调节器的基因突变（例如，ΔF508）引起。该氯离子通道的缺陷阻止了粘液的正常水合作用，导致全身（例如，肺、胰腺、输精管）积聚浓稠、粘稠的分泌物。\n\n呼吸系统疾病是最常见的 CF 表现，是发病率和死亡率的主要原因。患者通常由于细支气管内浓缩分泌物的清除受损而出现慢性咳嗽。这种积聚导致粘液栓塞（即，阻塞性肺病）、细菌定植（即，复发性肺炎）和炎性细胞的慢性浸润。随着时间的推移，中性粒细胞产生的弹性蛋白酶会导致支气管扩张（支气管壁变弱、扩张）和实质破坏。晚期疾病与不可逆损伤、进行性呼吸衰竭和预期寿命缩短有关。\n\n(选项 A) 肺泡内蛋白质样物质的积聚发生在肺泡蛋白沉积症中，在这种疾病中，肺泡巨噬细胞对表面活性物质的清除受损。这种疾病中不存在炎性细胞。\n\n(选项 B) 抗原介导的巨噬细胞聚集描述了肉芽肿的形成，如结核分枝杆菌和荚膜组织胞浆菌感染所发生的那样。致病病原体通常可以在显微镜下识别，并且特征性地不存在粘液栓。\n\n(选项 C) α-1 抗胰蛋白酶（弹性蛋白酶的蛋白酶抑制剂）缺乏症会导致肝功能障碍、肺气肿，并最终导致支气管扩张。肺部症状的出现通常发生在 20 岁以后，并且不应出现粘液栓。\n\n(选项 E) 肺静脉压升高是左心衰竭的特征，会导致肺充血以及间质性和肺泡性水肿。支气管扩张不是相关的发现。\n\n教育目标：\n囊性纤维化是一种常染色体隐性遗传病，其中有缺陷的氯离子通道会导致浓稠、粘稠的气道分泌物清除受损。患者通常会发生慢性咳嗽、复发性肺部感染和支气管扩张（支气管树扩张）。 {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of cystic fibrosis (CF), its pathophysiology related to defective chloride channels, and the resulting accumulation of thick mucus leading to impaired clearance of airway secretions and bronchiectasis. It also tests the ability to differentiate CF from other pulmonary conditions based on autopsy findings.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the key features of CF described in the vignette, such as chronic lung problems, dilation of the bronchial tree, and mucin plugs. Then, select the option that aligns with the underlying pathophysiology of CF, which is impaired clearance of airway secretions.",
