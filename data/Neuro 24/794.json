Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is most likely to show atrophy of which of the following structures? {{exhibit_1}}",

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the neurodegenerative changes associated with Alzheimer's disease, specifically the pattern of brain atrophy seen on MRI. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing hippocampal atrophy as an early and characteristic finding.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to recall that Alzheimer's disease preferentially affects the hippocampus early in the disease course. Recognizing the clinical presentation of progressive memory loss and functional decline should prompt consideration of Alzheimer's, and knowledge of the associated neuroimaging findings will lead to the correct answer.",
    "zh": "这个问题测试了对与阿尔茨海默病相关的神经退行性变的了解，特别是MRI上看到的脑萎缩模式。它强调了将海马体萎缩识别为早期和特征性发现的重要性。\n\n解决这个问题的关键是回忆阿尔茨海默病在疾病早期主要影响海马体。 认识到进行性记忆丧失和功能下降的临床表现应促使考虑阿尔茨海默病，而对相关神经影像学发现的了解将导致正确答案。"
