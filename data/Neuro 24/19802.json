    "en": "A 62-year-old, right-handed man is evaluated for an episode of left leg weakness that spontaneously resolved within 30 minutes of onset. The patient also has had transient vision loss in the right eye. Medical history is significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Evaluation reveals an atherosclerotic plaque in the extracranial portion of the supplying artery. During percutaneous stenting of the lesion, the vascular catheter is inserted into the right common femoral artery and gradually advanced to the level of the aortic arch. Which of the following is the most likely path of the catheter before stenting of the culprit lesion can be performed?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's symptoms of transient left leg weakness and transient right monocular blindness (amaurosis fugax) are suggestive of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to emboli originating from atherosclerotic plaques in the cerebrovascular circulation. The left leg weakness suggests involvement of the anterior circulation supplying the motor cortex, and the transient vision loss in the right eye suggests involvement of the ophthalmic artery, which branches from the internal carotid artery. Therefore, the most likely location of the atherosclerotic plaque is in the right internal carotid artery.\n\nWhen a vascular catheter is inserted into the right common femoral artery, it travels superiorly through the aorta. The first major branch from the aortic arch is the brachiocephalic artery, which then bifurcates into the right subclavian artery and the right common carotid artery. The common carotid artery then bifurcates into the external carotid artery (supplying the face and neck) and the internal carotid artery (supplying the brain). Therefore, to reach the right internal carotid artery, the catheter must pass through the aorta, then the brachiocephalic artery, then the right common carotid artery, and finally into the right internal carotid artery.\n\n(Choice A) This path leads to the external carotid artery, which supplies blood to the face and neck, not the brain or retina. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the source of the patient's symptoms.\n\n(Choices C and D) The common carotid artery branches directly from the aortic arch (left common carotid) or from the brachiocephalic artery (right common carotid). If the catheter were to directly access the common carotid artery without passing through the brachiocephalic artery (in the case of the right side), it would imply a different anatomical origin or a different access point. However, given the standard anatomy and femoral artery access, the brachiocephalic artery is the correct intermediate step for the right common carotid artery.\n\n(Choice E) This path leads to the vertebral arteries, which supply the posterior circulation of the brain (brainstem, cerebellum, occipital lobe). While posterior circulation TIAs can cause leg weakness, the monocular vision loss is more characteristic of anterior circulation involvement, specifically the internal carotid artery.\n\nKey concepts: TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK (TIA), AMUROSIS FUGAX, ANTERIOR CIRCULATION STROKE, CEREBROVASCULAR ANATOMY, CATHETER PATHWAY. The combination of left leg weakness and right monocular vision loss strongly points to a lesion in the right internal carotid artery. The catheterization pathway from the right common femoral artery involves the aorta, brachiocephalic artery, right common carotid artery, and then the right internal carotid artery.",
    "zh": "患者的左腿无力和右眼短暂单眼失明（短暂性黑矇）症状提示脑血管循环中因动脉粥样硬化斑块引起的短暂性脑缺血发作 (TIA)。左腿无力提示供应运动皮质的前循环受累，右眼短暂视力丧失提示眼动脉受累，眼动脉源自颈内动脉。因此，动脉粥样硬化斑块最有可能的位置是在右侧颈内动脉。\n\n当血管导管插入右侧股总动脉时，它会向上通过主动脉。主动脉弓的第一条主要分支是头臂干动脉，然后头臂干动脉分叉成右侧锁骨下动脉和右侧颈总动脉。颈总动脉然后分叉成颈外动脉（供应面部和颈部）和颈内动脉（供应大脑）。因此，要到达右侧颈内动脉，导管必须通过主动脉，然后是头臂干动脉，然后是右侧颈总动脉，最后进入右侧颈内动脉。\n\n(选项 A) 这条路径通向颈外动脉，颈外动脉向面部和颈部供血，而不是大脑或视网膜。因此，它不太可能是患者症状的来源。\n\n(选项 C 和 D) 颈总动脉直接源于主动脉弓（左侧颈总动脉）或头臂干动脉（右侧颈总动脉）。如果导管未经头臂干动脉（在右侧情况下）直接进入颈总动脉，则意味着不同的解剖来源或不同的入路点。然而，鉴于标准解剖结构和股动脉入路，头臂干动脉是右侧颈总动脉的正确中间步骤。\n\n(选项 E) 这条路径通向椎动脉，椎动脉供应大脑的后循环（脑干、小脑、枕叶）。虽然后循环 TIA 可引起腿部无力，但单眼视力丧失更具前循环受累的特征，特别是颈内动脉。\n\n关键概念：短暂性脑缺血发作 (TIA)，短暂性黑矇，前循环卒中，脑血管解剖，导管通路。左腿无力和右眼单眼视力丧失的结合强烈表明右侧颈内动脉存在病变。从右侧股总动脉的导管插入途径涉及主动脉、头臂干动脉、右侧颈总动脉，然后是右侧颈内动脉。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of cerebrovascular anatomy and the typical pathway of a catheter during endovascular procedures for conditions like transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). It requires correlating clinical symptoms with the most likely affected artery and tracing the anatomical route from the femoral artery access point.\n\nTo solve this question, one must first identify the most likely culprit artery based on the patient's neurological deficits. Then, recall the major branches of the aortic arch and the subsequent branching of the carotid arteries to determine the correct path the catheter would take from the femoral artery to reach the identified lesion.",
