    "en": "A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and tobacco smoking comes to the office reporting mild back pain. Abdominal examination reveals a bruit, but no pulsatile mass is palpated. Femoral and pedal pulses are symmetric. The patient is sent for ultrasound and is found to have a large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Open aneurysm repair is performed. During the procedure, the inferior mesenteric artery is ligated, the diseased portion of the aorta is dissected, and a graft is placed from below the renal arteries to the bifurcation of the aorta. Collateral circulation from which of the following vessels is most likely responsible for preventing ischemia of the descending colon?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The gastrointestinal tract receives its blood supply from 3 main arteries:\n\n•\tCeliac trunk\n•\tSuperior mesenteric artery (SMA)\n•\tInferior mesenteric artery (IMA)\n\nThe celiac trunk supplies the stomach, part of the duodenum, gallbladder, liver, spleen, and pancreas (Choice A). The SMA and IMA are the 2 main vessels supplying the small and large intestines and are connected by a pair of anastomoses: the marginal artery of Drummond, which is the principal anastomosis, and the inconsistently present arc of Riolan (mesenteric meandering artery). These anastomoses protect the intestines from ischemia and, due to the marginal artery, the IMA is not always reconnected during aortic aneurysm repair.\n\n(Choice B) The external iliac artery supplies the inferior epigastric artery and the deep circumflex iliac artery before becoming the femoral artery. Although the inferior epigastric artery anastomoses with the superior epigastric artery, these provide blood supply to the abdominal wall, not the intestines.\n\n(Choices C and E) The inferior vena cava (IVC) has little role in the direct drainage of the intestines except from the rectum, which partially drains via the middle and inferior rectal veins into the internal iliac veins. The remainder of the venous drainage occurs via the superior and inferior mesenteric veins, which drain into the portal vein. After perfusing the liver, the portal vein drains into the IVC via the hepatic veins.\n\n(Choice D) The internal iliac artery supplies part of the rectum via the middle rectal artery. An anastomosis exists between the superior and middle rectal arteries, which can help prevent rectal ischemia after IMA occlusion. However, the SMA is more likely to prevent ischemia in the descending colon due to its proximity and the extensive collateral arcades between the SMA and IMA.\n\n(Choice F) Although the renal arteries arise from the abdominal aorta just inferior to the SMA, they do not provide collateral circulation to the intestines.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe superior mesenteric artery and inferior mesenteric artery are the 2 main vessels supplying the small and large intestines. They are connected by a pair of anastomoses: the marginal artery of Drummond, which is the principal anastomosis, and the inconsistently present arc of Riolan (mesenteric meandering artery). {{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "胃肠道由3条主要动脉供血：\n\n•\t腹腔干\n•\t肠系膜上动脉 (SMA)\n•\t肠系膜下动脉 (IMA)\n\n腹腔干为胃、部分十二指肠、胆囊、肝脏、脾脏和胰腺供血 (选项A)。SMA和IMA是供应小肠和大肠的2条主要血管，它们通过一对吻合连接：Drummond边缘动脉是主要的吻合，Riolan弓（肠系膜蜿蜒动脉）是不稳定存在的吻合。这些吻合保护肠道免受缺血，并且由于边缘动脉的存在，在主动脉瘤修复术中IMA不总是重新连接。\n\n(选项B) 髂外动脉在成为股动脉之前，供应腹壁下动脉和旋髂深动脉。尽管腹壁下动脉与腹壁上动脉吻合，但它们为腹壁供血，而不是肠道。\n\n(选项C和E) 下腔静脉 (IVC) 在肠道的直接引流中作用很小，除了来自直肠，直肠部分通过中间和下直肠静脉引流入髂内静脉。其余的静脉引流通过肠系膜上静脉和肠系膜下静脉发生，这些静脉引流入门静脉。在灌注肝脏后，门静脉通过肝静脉引流入IVC。\n\n(选项D) 髂内动脉通过中间直肠动脉供应部分直肠。在IMA闭塞后，上直肠动脉和中间直肠动脉之间存在吻合，这可以帮助预防直肠缺血。然而，由于其邻近性以及SMA和IMA之间广泛的侧支血管网，SMA更有可能预防降结肠缺血。\n\n(选项F) 虽然肾动脉从腹主动脉发出，就在SMA下方，但它们不为肠道提供侧支循环。\n\n教育目标：\n肠系膜上动脉和肠系膜下动脉是供应小肠和大肠的2条主要血管。它们通过一对吻合连接：Drummond边缘动脉是主要的吻合，Riolan弓（肠系膜蜿蜒动脉）是不稳定存在的吻合。{{exhibit_1}} {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the arterial supply to the colon and the collateral circulation that can maintain perfusion in the event of inferior mesenteric artery ligation during aortic aneurysm repair. Understanding the anastomoses between the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries is crucial.\n\nTo solve this question, recall that the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) are connected by the marginal artery of Drummond. Ligation of the IMA necessitates collateral flow from the SMA to prevent ischemia of the descending colon.",
