She has no chronic medical conditions and takes no medications. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. The patient is not sexually active and has received all age-appropriate vaccinations. BMI is 30 kg/m². Blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg and pulse is 78/min. Examination shows truncal obesity but is otherwise normal. Fasting laboratory results are as follows:\n\nGlucose 127 mg/dL\nCreatinine 1.0 mg/dL\nAspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) 76 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (SGPT) 80 U/L\nTotal cholesterol 270 mg/dL\nHDL-cholesterol 31 mg/dL\nTriglycerides 247 mg/dL {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient with truncal obesity (correlating to visceral adiposity), an elevated fasting glucose level, and dyslipidemia (ie, low HDL, high triglycerides) has metabolic syndrome. In addition, she has elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels indicative of hepatocellular injury. This presentation suggests nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which commonly occurs in patients with metabolic syndrome due to the shared pathophysiology of insulin resistance. {{exhibit_2}}\n\nPatients with NAFLD have an increased risk of cirrhosis due to chronic hepatocellular injury and inflammation triggered by hepatic free fatty acid accumulation. In the presence of inflammation, hepatic stellate (Ito) cells in the space of Disse are activated and transform into myofibroblasts that produce collagen in large quantities, leading to progressive fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis.\n\nWeight loss is the cornerstone of management and has been shown to reverse fibrosis.\n\n(Choice A) NAFLD typically follows an indolent and asymptomatic course, requiring decades to progress to cirrhosis. Acute hepatitis is not a clinical presentation of NAFLD.\n\n(Choice B) Chronic adrenal insufficiency can cause fatigue, however, affected patients also frequently have weight loss, hypotension, and skin hyperpigmentation. Characteristic laboratory abnormalities include hyponatremia and hyperkalemia due to mineralocorticoid deficiency.\n\n(Choice C) Certain strains of hepatitis viruses can cause aplastic anemia due to T-cell-mediated destruction of bone marrow cells. Viral hepatitis is unlikely in this patient without any risk factors.\n\n(Choice E) Hepatic adenomas are solitary, benign liver tumors typically found in young women who are taking estrogen-containing oral contraceptive pills. NAFLD does not increase the risk of hepatic adenoma. {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "这位患者有躯干肥胖（与内脏脂肪相关）、空腹血糖水平升高和血脂异常（即，低HDL、高甘油三酯），患有代谢综合征。此外，她有肝转氨酶水平升高，提示肝细胞损伤。这种表现提示非酒精性脂肪性肝病（NAFLD），这在代谢综合征患者中很常见，原因是胰岛素抵抗的病理生理学相同。{{exhibit_2}}\n\nNAFLD 患者由于慢性肝细胞损伤和肝脏游离脂肪酸积聚引起的炎症，肝硬化的风险增加。在炎症存在的情况下，狄斯间隙中的肝星状（伊藤）细胞被激活并转化为成肌纤维母细胞，产生大量胶原蛋白，导致进行性纤维化，最终导致肝硬化。\n\n减肥是管理的关键，并已被证明可以逆转纤维化。\n\n（选项 A）NAFLD 通常呈惰性和无症状病程，需要数十年才能发展为肝硬化。急性肝炎不是 NAFLD 的临床表现。\n\n（选项 B）慢性肾上腺皮质功能不全可引起疲劳，但受影响的患者也经常出现体重减轻、低血压和皮肤色素沉着过度。特征性的实验室异常包括由于盐皮质激素缺乏引起的低钠血症和高钾血症。\n\n（选项 C）某些型肝炎病毒可引起再生障碍性贫血，这是由于 T 细胞介导的骨髓细胞破坏所致。该患者不太可能患有病毒性肝炎，因为她没有任何危险因素。\n\n（选项 E）肝腺瘤是单发的良性肝肿瘤，通常见于服用含雌激素口服避孕药的年轻女性。NAFLD 不会增加肝腺瘤的风险。{{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its association with metabolic syndrome and increased risk of cirrhosis. It requires recognizing the clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of NAFLD and understanding its potential long-term complications. \n\nTo solve this question, identify the risk factors for metabolic syndrome (obesity, dyslipidemia, elevated glucose) and the elevated liver enzymes indicating hepatocellular injury. Then, recall that NAFLD is a common consequence of metabolic syndrome and can progress to cirrhosis if left untreated.",
