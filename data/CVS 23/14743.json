    "en": "A 50-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to intermittent palpitations over the last 6 months. The patient describes them as \"very uncomfortable\" and says the episodes occur randomly, last for several hours, and resolve spontaneously or with sleep. The current episode started an hour ago and has been accompanied by lightheadedness. He has no medical history. Temperature is normal and blood pressure is 122/75 mm Hg. BMI is 30 kg/m². Chest examination reveals no murmurs and the lungs are clear on auscultation. There is trace peripheral edema. Cardiac rhythm strip obtained in the emergency department is shown in the exhibit {{exhibit_1}}. Aberrant electrical activity in which of the following anatomic structures is the most likely trigger for this patient's current condition?",

    "en": "This patient's presentation with intermittent palpitations and cardiac rhythm strip showing an irregularly irregular rhythm with varying R-R intervals and no discernible P waves is consistent with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF).\n\nThe development of AF involves structural and electrical changes that predispose to the initiation and maintenance of electrical reentrant circuits and/or ectopic foci. These pathologic changes, termed atrial remodeling, can occur as a result of normal aging or diseases that cause atrial dilation (eg, hypertension, mitral regurgitation). The remodeling leads to shortening of the atrial refractory period and heterogeneity in localized electrical conduction between atrial myocytes, creating a substrate for the development of AF.\n\nIn predisposed patients, AF can spawn from specific triggers such as focal electrical discharges, increased atrial stretch, elevated sympathetic activity (eg, sepsis, emotional stress), and ingestion of alcohol. The most common trigger is aberrant electrical foci in the pulmonary veins near their ostia into the left atrium; therefore, catheter ablation of pulmonary vein trigger sites (pulmonary vein isolation) is used for the treatment of symptomatic, paroxysmal AF.\n\n(Choice A) Aberrant electrical conduction in the atrioventricular node is the cause of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). ECG during AVNRT shows a rapid rate with regular R-R intervals and often nonvisible P waves because they are buried within the QRS complexes.\n\n(Choices B and F) The cavotricuspid isthmus is the area of right atrial tissue between the crista terminalis (ridge that runs along the vena cava) and the tricuspid annulus, and is usually part of the reentry circuit in atrial flutter. ECG during atrial flutter typically shows a saw-tooth pattern of flutter waves, and the ventricular rhythm can be regular or irregular.\n\n(Choices C and E) Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia most commonly originates from areas of ischemic myocardium; however, it can sometimes originate from nonischemic sites in the papillary muscles or right ventricular outflow tract. ECG of ventricular tachycardia typically demonstrates regular R-R intervals and wide QRS complexes. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现为间歇性心悸，心律带显示心律不规则，R-R间期变化，无明显的P波，与阵发性房颤（AF）一致。\n\nAF的发生涉及结构性和电学改变，这些改变易于引发和维持电复归环路和/或异位病灶。这些病理改变，称为心房重塑，可因正常衰老或导致心房扩张的疾病（如高血压、二尖瓣反流）而发生。重塑导致心房不应期缩短和心房肌细胞之间局部电传导的异质性，从而为AF的发展创造了基础。\n\n在易感患者中，AF可能源于特定的触发因素，如局灶性电放电、心房扩张增加、交感神经活性升高（如败血症、情绪应激）和饮酒。最常见的触发因素是位于肺静脉靠近其开口到左心房的异常电灶；因此，肺静脉触发位点导管消融术（肺静脉隔离）用于治疗有症状的阵发性AF。\n\n（选项A）房室结的异常电传导是房室结折返性心动过速（AVNRT）的原因。AVNRT期间的ECG显示心率加快，R-R间期规则，并且通常P波不可见，因为它们被埋藏在QRS波群中。\n\n（选项B和F）腔三尖瓣峡部是界嵴（沿腔静脉延伸的脊）和三尖瓣环之间的右心房组织区域，通常是房扑折返环路的一部分。房扑期间的ECG通常显示锯齿状的扑动波，心室节律可以是规则的或不规则的。\n\n（选项C和E）单形性室性心动过速最常起源于缺血性心肌区域；然而，它有时可能起源于乳头肌或右心室流出道中的非缺血性部位。室性心动过速的ECG通常显示规则的R-R间期和宽QRS波群。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}} {{exhibit_4}} {{exhibit_5}} {{exhibit_6}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of atrial fibrillation (AFib) pathophysiology, specifically the common triggers and anatomical locations of aberrant electrical activity that initiate and maintain AFib. It also assesses the ability to differentiate AFib from other supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias based on ECG characteristics.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the irregularly irregular rhythm and absence of P waves on the ECG as characteristic of AFib.
