Everything seems fine with him; we just want to make sure his vaccinations are up to date before our family trip overseas.\" The physician administers the appropriate vaccinations. Just before leaving, the father says, \"I think you should know that my son is playing with his sister's dolls and doesn't seem to like cars or trucks like most other boys. Is that normal?\"",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Gender is the innate feeling someone has of being male, female, or a combination of both. Children develop an understanding of the concept of gender by age 3-4 and have a sense of the permanence of gender around age 5-6. It is developmentally normal for them to explore the world by engaging in activities that may be culturally associated with the opposite gender. It is important to follow a child's lead and allow this exploration to occur.\n\nIn contrast to occasional play and exploration, if there is a prolonged and intense feeling that a person's gender does not match one's assigned birth sex, it is more likely to continue into puberty. When this feeling is associated with significant distress, it is diagnosed as gender dysphoria. Patients with this condition have associated rates of psychiatric illness, including depression and anxiety, and need monitoring and support.\n\n(Choice B) Although it is important to allow the child to play freely, this response does not answer the father's question and is unlikely to decrease his concern. The father should be educated that his child's type of play is part of normal exploration.\n\n(Choice C) It is normal for a child to explore gender activities. There is no evidence that boys need increased exposure to male figures to understand their own gender.\n\n(Choice D) Playing with dolls is consistent with normal explorative play, not gender dysphoria. Further evaluation and professional support might be warranted in this child if he had a more persistent desire to be the opposite sex or disliked his own genitalia.\n\n(Choice E) Children usually know their gender by age 4 and understand that it is permanent by age 5-6.\n\nEducational objective:\nAlthough children understand the concept of gender by age 4, it is normal for them to explore activities culturally associated with the opposite gender. In contrast, gender dysphoria is diagnosed when there is marked distress associated with a prolonged and intense feeling that gender is different from one's birth sex.",
    "zh": "性别是一个人天生对男性、女性或两者的结合的感觉。儿童在3-4岁时开始理解性别的概念，在5-6岁左右对性别的永久性有概念。他们通过参与可能在文化上与异性相关的活动来探索世界，这在发展上是正常的。重要的是要跟随孩子的引导，并允许这种探索发生。\n\n与偶尔的游戏和探索相比，如果一个人长期且强烈地感觉到自己的性别与指定的出生性别不符，则更有可能持续到青春期。当这种感觉与显着的痛苦相关时，诊断为性别焦虑症。患有此病的患者伴有精神疾病的发病率，包括抑郁症和焦虑症，需要监测和支持。\n\n（选项B）虽然让孩子自由玩耍很重要，但这种回答并没有回答父亲的问题，而且不太可能减轻他的担忧。应该教育父亲，他孩子的游戏方式是正常探索的一部分。\n\n（选项C）孩子探索性别活动是正常的。没有证据表明男孩需要更多地接触男性形象来了解自己的性别。\n\n（选项D）玩洋娃娃与正常的探索性游戏一致，而不是性别焦虑症。如果这个孩子有更持久的想要成为异性的愿望或不喜欢自己的生殖器，可能需要进一步的评估和专业支持。\n\n（选项E）儿童通常在4岁时就知道自己的性别，并在5-6岁时理解其是永久性的。\n\n教育目标：\n尽管儿童在4岁时就理解了性别的概念，但他们探索与异性文化相关的活动是正常的。相比之下，当与长期且强烈的性别与出生性别不同的感觉相关的明显痛苦时，诊断为性别焦虑症。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of normal childhood gender exploration versus the diagnosis of gender dysphoria. It assesses the ability to differentiate between age-appropriate play and behaviors that may indicate a more significant underlying issue.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing that childhood play, including engaging with toys typically associated with the opposite gender, is often a normal part of development and exploration. The key is to distinguish this from persistent distress or a strong identification with the opposite gender, which would warrant further evaluation for gender dysphoria.",
    "zh": "这个问题考察了对正常儿童性别探索与性别焦虑症诊断的理解。它评估了区分适合年龄的游戏和可能表明更重要的潜在问题的行为的能力。\n\n解决此问题的方法包括认识到儿童游戏，包括玩通常与异性相关的玩具，通常是发展和探索的正常组成部分。关键是要将此与持续的痛苦或对异性的强烈认同区分开来，这需要进一步评估性别焦虑症。"
