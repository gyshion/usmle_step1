    "en": "An 11-month-old boy is brought to the office due to irregular jerking movements. His mother states that for 2 weeks he has looked pale and tired, and he has been more fussy and less playful than usual. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, pulse is 114/min, and respirations are 16/min. Physical examination reveals spontaneous bursts of nonrhythmic conjugate eye movements in various directions. The patient also has myoclonus involving the trunk and limbs as well as generalized hypotonia. A right-sided, nontender, immobile abdominal mass is palpated. There is no hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds are normal. Complete blood count reveals anemia, and urine is positive for elevated levels of catecholamine breakdown products. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "en": "Nonrhythmic conjugate eye movements and involuntary jerking movements of the trunk and limbs (opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome) in a young patient should prompt evaluation for neuroblastoma {{exhibit_1}}. This is the most common extracranial solid neoplasm of childhood and arises from neural crest cells of the adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia.\n\nPatients typically present at age <2 with a firm abdominal mass, most often involving the adrenal gland, and constitutional symptoms (eg, weight loss, fatigue). Bone marrow infiltration can cause anemia or pancytopenia, and orbital metastases may result in proptosis and/or periorbital ecchymoses. Although rare, opsoclonus-myoclonus is a paraneoplastic syndrome highly associated with neuroblastoma and is believed to be an autoantibody response to central nervous system antigens.\n\nThe majority of patients with neuroblastoma have elevated catecholamine metabolites (eg, HVA, VMA) due to the neural crest origin. Biopsy of the mass is diagnostic and will reveal small round blue cells and Homer Wright rosettes. Tumor tissue is subsequently tested for N-myc amplification, which predicts a poor prognosis.\n\n(Choice A) Carcinoid tumor is a neuroendocrine tumor that is rare in children. Tumor secretion of serotonin causes carcinoid syndrome (eg, flushing, diarrhea, bronchospasm) and increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (serotonin metabolite) in the urine.\n\n(Choice B) Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that arises predominantly in long bones. This neoplasm typically presents in older children and teenagers with pain and swelling over the mass.\n\n(Choice C) Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. It arises in the cerebellum and causes ataxia, not opsoclonus-myoclonus. As in neuroblastoma, Homer Wright rosettes may be identified; however, urine catecholamine metabolites would not be present.\n\n(Choice E) Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can present as an abdominal mass but is rare in infants and not associated with opsoclonus-myoclonus or increased urine catecholamines.\n\n(Choice F) Pheochromocytoma is an adrenal tumor that also secretes catecholamines; however, this neoplasm occurs more commonly in adults and is not associated with opsoclonus-myoclonus.\n\n(Choice G) Wilms tumor is a renal cancer that presents in early childhood (median age 3-4) with an abdominal/flank mass. In contrast to neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor does not cause opsoclonus-myoclonus or result in catecholamines in the urine.\n\nEducational objective:\nOpsoclonus-myoclonus is a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid neoplasm in children. The tumor typically arises from the neural crest cells of the adrenal medulla and presents with an abdominal mass and elevated catecholamine breakdown products.",
    "zh": "年轻患者出现不规则的共轭眼球运动和躯干及四肢的不自主抽搐（眼阵挛-肌阵挛综合征）应促使评估神经母细胞瘤{{exhibit_1}}。这是儿童中最常见的颅外实体肿瘤，起源于肾上腺髓质或交感神经节的神经嵴细胞。\n\n患者通常在<2岁时出现，表现为腹部坚硬肿块，最常累及肾上腺，并伴有全身症状（例如，体重减轻、疲劳）。骨髓浸润可引起贫血或全血细胞减少，眼眶转移可导致眼球突出和/或眶周瘀斑。虽然罕见，但眼阵挛-肌阵挛是一种高度与神经母细胞瘤相关的副肿瘤综合征，被认为是针对中枢神经系统抗原的自身抗体反应。\n\n大多数神经母细胞瘤患者由于神经嵴起源而具有升高的儿茶酚胺代谢物（例如，高香草酸、香草扁桃酸）。肿块活检具有诊断意义，将显示小的圆形蓝细胞和Homer Wright玫瑰花结。随后对肿瘤组织进行N-myc扩增检测，这预示着预后不良。\n\n（选项A）类癌肿瘤是一种神经内分泌肿瘤，在儿童中罕见。肿瘤分泌血清素会导致类癌综合征（例如，潮红、腹泻、支气管痉挛）和尿液中5-羟吲哚乙酸（血清素代谢物）增加。\n\n（选项B）尤因肉瘤是一种恶性骨肿瘤，主要起源于长骨。这种肿瘤通常在年长儿童和青少年中表现为肿块疼痛和肿胀。\n\n（选项C）髓母细胞瘤是儿童中最常见的恶性脑肿瘤。它起源于小脑并引起共济失调，而不是眼阵挛-肌阵挛。与神经母细胞瘤一样，可以识别出Homer Wright玫瑰花结；然而，尿儿茶酚胺代谢物不会存在。\n\n（选项E）非霍奇金淋巴瘤可表现为腹部肿块，但在婴儿中罕见，并且与眼阵挛-肌阵挛或尿儿茶酚胺升高无关。\n\n（选项F）嗜铬细胞瘤是一种也分泌儿茶酚胺的肾上腺肿瘤；然而，这种肿瘤更常见于成年人，并且与眼阵挛-肌阵挛无关。\n\n（选项G）肾母细胞瘤是一种在幼儿时期（中位年龄3-4岁）出现的肾癌，表现为腹部/侧腹肿块。与神经母细胞瘤相比，肾母细胞瘤不会引起眼阵挛-肌阵挛或导致尿中儿茶酚胺升高。\n\n教育目标：\n眼阵挛-肌阵挛是一种与神经母细胞瘤相关的副肿瘤综合征，神经母细胞瘤是儿童中最常见的颅外实体瘤。该肿瘤通常起源于肾上腺髓质的神经嵴细胞，表现为腹部肿块和儿茶酚胺分解产物升高。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of neuroblastoma presentation, including paraneoplastic syndromes like opsoclonus-myoclonus, and the significance of elevated catecholamine metabolites in urine. It also requires differentiating neuroblastoma from other pediatric tumors based on clinical features and lab findings.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the constellation of symptoms (abdominal mass, opsoclonus-myoclonus, elevated catecholamines) as highly suggestive of neuroblastoma. Rule out other options based on age of presentation, typical location, and associated findings.",
