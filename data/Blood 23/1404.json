    "en": "A 41-year-old previously healthy woman comes to the office due to weakness and easy fatigability. She also has had several episodes of epistaxis and gum bleeding. Physical examination reveals mucosal pallor. Further evaluation demonstrates that the patient has a clonal proliferation of white blood cells containing an abnormal protein. In an experiment, the abnormal cells from the patient are purified and cultured in 2 different plates, one with a vitamin A derivative (plate 1) and the other with control (plate 2). After several days of incubation, cells in plate 1 are well differentiated compared to those in plate 2, and clonal proliferation is inhibited. This patient most likely has which of the following conditions?",

    "en": "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), type M3 of acute myelogenous leukemia in the French-American-British classification system, results from a t(15;17) mutation whereby the gene for retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) is transferred from chromosome 17 to chromosome 15, where it fuses with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene. This leads to the formation of a new gene called PML/RARα. Normally, RARα plays a role in the proper differentiation of myeloid precursors, as the receptor interacts with retinoic acid to affect transcription of genes required for maturation. However, the t(15;17) mutation in APML causes transcription repression and produces an abnormal receptor that is unable to signal for the differentiation of myeloid precursors at physiologic doses of retinoic acid.\n\nTreatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), a vitamin A derivative, overcomes this (partly by inducing PML/RARα proteolysis) and stimulates differentiation of myeloblasts into mature granulocytes. ATRA therapy induces remission in about 90% of patients with APL. APL is associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n(Choice A) Acute lymphocytic leukemia predominantly affects children. Blast cells positive for the CD10 antigen (CALLA) suggest a good prognosis.\n\n(Choice C) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is frequently seen in elderly patients. It presents with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia, and has an indolent course. Neoplastic cells resemble mature B lymphocytes.\n\n(Choice D) In chronic myeloid leukemia (also commonly manifesting in elderly patients with fatigue, leukocytosis, and splenomegaly), myeloid precursors in different stages of differentiation proliferate. This disease is caused by a t(9;22) translocation that forms the BCR-ABL fusion gene, which codes for an abnormal tyrosine kinase.\n\n(Choice E) Several high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas are associated with cytogenetic abnormalities. t(8;14), t(2;8), and t(8;22) are typical for Burkitt lymphoma; these translocations involve the c-myc oncogene. Burkitt lymphoma is associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection and classically has a \"starry sky\" histologic appearance.\n\nEducational objective:\nAcute promyelocytic leukemia is the M3 variant of acute myelogenous leukemia. It affects adult patients and may present with disseminated intravascular coagulation. The cytogenetic abnormality t(15;17) leads to formation of the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML/RARα) fusion gene, which is unable to signal for proper cellular differentiation, unlike the normal retinoic acid receptor.",
    "zh": "急性早幼粒细胞白血病（APL），法国-美国-英国分类系统中急性髓细胞白血病的M3型，由t(15;17)突变引起，其中视黄酸受体α (RARα)基因从17号染色体转移到15号染色体，与早幼粒细胞白血病(PML)基因融合。这导致形成一个名为PML/RARα的新基因。通常，RARα在髓样前体的适当分化中起作用，因为受体与视黄酸相互作用以影响成熟所需的基因的转录。然而，APML中的t(15;17)突变导致转录抑制，并产生异常受体，该受体无法在生理剂量的视黄酸下发出髓样前体分化的信号。\n\n用全反式视黄酸 (ATRA，一种维生素A衍生物) 治疗可以克服此问题（部分通过诱导PML/RARα蛋白水解），并刺激成髓细胞分化为成熟的粒细胞。ATRA疗法可使约90%的APL患者缓解。APL与弥散性血管内凝血相关。\n\n(选项A) 急性淋巴细胞白血病主要影响儿童。CD10抗原（CALLA）阳性的原始细胞提示预后良好。\n\n(选项C) 慢性淋巴细胞白血病常发生于老年患者。它表现为淋巴结病、肝脾肿大和贫血，病程缓慢。肿瘤细胞类似于成熟的B淋巴细胞。\n\n(选项D) 在慢性髓细胞白血病（也常见于老年患者，表现为疲劳、白细胞增多和脾肿大）中，不同分化阶段的髓样前体增殖。这种疾病是由t(9;22)易位引起的，该易位形成BCR-ABL融合基因，该基因编码异常酪氨酸激酶。\n\n(选项E) 几种高级别非霍奇金淋巴瘤与细胞遗传学异常相关。t(8;14)、t(2;8)和t(8;22)是Burkitt淋巴瘤的典型特征；这些易位涉及c-myc癌基因。Burkitt淋巴瘤与爱泼斯坦-巴尔病毒感染相关，并且在组织学上通常具有“星空”外观。\n\n教学目标：\n急性早幼粒细胞白血病是急性髓细胞白血病的M3变体。它影响成人患者，并可能出现弥散性血管内凝血。细胞遗传学异常t(15;17)导致早幼粒细胞白血病-视黄酸受体α (PML/RARα)融合基因的形成，该基因无法像正常的视黄酸受体一样发出适当的细胞分化信号。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), specifically its pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and response to vitamin A derivative treatment. It assesses the understanding of the t(15;17) translocation and its impact on myeloid cell differentiation. \n\nThe key to solving this question is recognizing the link between the vitamin A derivative (ATRA) and the differentiation of cells in plate 1. The inhibition of clonal proliferation and the improved differentiation with vitamin A derivative strongly suggest APL, as ATRA is a targeted therapy for this specific leukemia subtype.",
