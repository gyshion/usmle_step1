    "en": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after a teacher found him staggering and falling in the school parking lot between classes. When she found him, the patient seemed lethargic and disoriented, and his speech was slurred. His condition slowly improved over the next 30 minutes; when the patient is evaluated in the emergency department an hour after the teacher found him, he is alert, oriented, and able to speak clearly. The patient has no known medical history. Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 102/65 mm Hg, and pulse is 62/min. On physical examination, there are abrasions on the right forearm and shin and a rash around the nostrils and mouth.",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient's initial symptoms (eg, lethargy, ataxia [falling/abrasions], disorientation, slurred speech) followed by rapid improvement along with a perioral and paranasal rash on examination are highly suggestive of inhalant use disorder. Inhalants, in the form of glue, toluene, nitrous oxide, amyl nitrite, and spray paints, are often the first drugs that adolescents misuse as they are inexpensive and readily available. They may be inhaled from a saturated cloth held near the face, from a bag placed over the nose and mouth, or by sniffing directly. A dermatitis known as \"glue sniffer's rash\" may be seen around the mouth or nostrils of chronic users.\n\nInhalants cause immediate effects as they are highly lipid soluble and act as CNS depressants. They can produce brief transient euphoria, lethargy, disorientation, loss of consciousness, poor coordination, and slurred speech. Effects typically last 15-45 minutes. Severe complications include cardiac dysrhythmias, dangerous behavior, seizures, and death. Nitrous oxide misuse in particular is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency and resultant symptoms of polyneuropathy (eg, symmetric numbness, gait abnormalities).\n\n(Choices A and B) Although alcohol and benzodiazepine use can cause similar mental status changes, this patient's rapid improvement and facial rash are more consistent with inhalant use disorder. Alcohol and benzodiazepine intoxication would likely result in a significantly longer period of intoxication.\n\n(Choice C) Cocaine is a CNS stimulant that typically produces euphoria, increased arousal, psychomotor agitation, tachycardia, and hypertension. It would not explain this patient's lethargy and ataxia.\n\n(Choice E) Classic signs of opioid intoxication include depressed mental status, respiratory depression, and miosis. The time course of symptoms and facial rash make inhalant use disorder a better explanation for this patient's symptoms.\n\n(Choice F) Phencyclidine (ie, PCP) intoxication is characterized by nystagmus, altered mental status, and agitated or violent behavior.\n\nEducational objective:\nInhalant intoxication is characterized by immediate onset of euphoria, lethargy, ataxia, and/or loss of consciousness followed by rapid recovery within 45 minutes. Perioral and perinasal dermatitis (ie, \"glue sniffer's rash\") may be seen in chronic users.",
    "zh": "该患者的初始症状（例如，嗜睡、共济失调[跌倒/擦伤]、定向障碍、言语不清）以及随后迅速好转以及体格检查时的口周和鼻周皮疹，高度提示吸入剂使用障碍。吸入剂，以胶水、甲苯、一氧化二氮、亚硝酸戊酯和喷漆的形式存在，通常是青少年滥用的第一批药物，因为它们便宜且容易获得。它们可能通过将浸湿的布靠近面部吸入、从罩在鼻子和嘴上的袋子中吸入或直接嗅吸。在慢性使用者中，可能会在嘴或鼻孔周围看到一种称为“胶水吸入者皮疹”的皮炎。\n\n吸入剂会引起即时效应，因为它们具有高脂溶性，并充当CNS抑制剂。它们可以产生短暂的欣快感、嗜睡、定向障碍、意识丧失、协调性差和言语不清。效应通常持续15-45分钟。严重的并发症包括心律失常、危险行为、癫痫发作和死亡。特别是滥用一氧化二氮与维生素B12缺乏症和随之而来的多发性神经病症状（例如，对称性麻木、步态异常）有关。\n\n（选项A和B）尽管酒精和苯二氮卓类药物的使用会导致类似的精神状态改变，但该患者的快速改善和面部皮疹与吸入剂使用障碍更为一致。酒精和苯二氮卓类药物中毒可能会导致更长的中毒时间。\n\n（选项C）可卡因是一种CNS兴奋剂，通常会产生欣快感、觉醒增加、精神运动性激动、心动过速和高血压。它无法解释该患者的嗜睡和共济失调。\n\n（选项E）阿片类药物中毒的典型体征包括精神状态抑制、呼吸抑制和瞳孔缩小。症状的时间进程和面部皮疹使吸入剂使用障碍成为该患者症状的更好解释。\n\n（选项F）苯环利定（即，PCP）中毒的特征是眼球震颤、精神状态改变以及激动或暴力行为。\n\n教育目标：\n吸入剂中毒的特征是即时出现的欣快感、嗜睡、共济失调和/或意识丧失，随后在45分钟内迅速恢复。在慢性使用者中，可能会出现口周和鼻周皮炎（即，“胶水吸入者皮疹”）。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the recognition of inhalant abuse based on a patient's presentation, including symptoms, rapid improvement, and characteristic rash. It requires differentiating inhalant intoxication from other substance abuse syndromes.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves carefully analyzing the patient's symptoms, the temporal course of their improvement, and the physical examination findings, particularly the rash. Comparing these findings to the known effects of various substances of abuse is crucial for accurate diagnosis.",
