    "en": "A 34-year-old man comes to the office due to heart palpitations that are particularly prominent at night. With moderate exertion he also experiences head-pounding accompanied by involuntary head-bobbing. The patient recently emigrated from Southeast Asia and remembers being diagnosed with a heart murmur years before, but he cannot recall the type of murmur and has never received any treatment. He has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. The patient's father has coronary artery disease and his mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. Based on this patient's history, which of the following findings is most likely to be present on further evaluation?",

    "en": "This patient has a number of clinical findings that are characteristic of chronic aortic regurgitation (AR). Failure of the aortic valve to tightly seal off the aorta from the left ventricle at the end of systole leads to rapid loss of aortic pressure and an overall decrease in diastolic blood pressure. In addition, the left ventricle undergoes eccentric hypertrophy to initially compensate for an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume, which leads to increased stroke volume and cardiac output. Because pulse pressure (the difference between diastolic and systolic blood pressure) is proportional to stroke volume, the compensatory increased stroke volume on top of reduced diastolic pressure causes the characteristic widened pulse pressure seen with AR. {{exhibit_1}}\n\nThis high-amplitude pulsation with rapid diastolic collapse is responsible for the unusual pulsation findings in AR. Forceful pulsations in the intracranial arteries can cause head bobbing with each heart beat (de Musset sign), and patients may experience palpitations due to forceful left ventricular contraction. In addition, physical examination can show abrupt distension and collapse of the carotid arteries (Corrigan sign) and peripheral arteries (\"water-hammer\" pulse), and reveal \"pistol-shot\" femoral pulses (Traube sign) on auscultation.\n\n(Choice A) Impaired left ventricular contractility occurs later in the course of AR and eventually leads to heart failure. Because head-bobbing and other characteristic findings in AR are due to increased stroke volume and high-amplitude, rapid rise-rapid fall pulsation, these findings are less prominent once impaired left ventricular contractility (and decreased stroke volume) sets in.\n\n(Choices B and C) Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, such as occurs with aortic stenosis, leads to reduced stroke volume and characteristic weak and delayed pulses (pulsus parvus et tardus). Restriction of left ventricular filling, as occurs in mitral stenosis, also reduces stroke volume due to reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume (reduced preload). Clinical findings associated with high-amplitude pulsation will not be present with reduced stroke volume.\n\n(Choice D) Combined systolic and diastolic hypertension is not necessarily accompanied by widened pulse pressure; the signs of high amplitude, rapid rise-rapid fall pulsation are more characteristic of chronic AR.\n\nEducational objective: Chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) causes a reduction in diastolic blood pressure and a compensatory increase in left ventricular stroke volume. These changes create a high-amplitude, rapid rise-rapid fall pulsation (ie, widened pulse pressure) and the other characteristic findings of AR (eg, head bobbing, \"pistol-shot\" femoral pulses).",
    "zh": "该患者有一些临床表现，是慢性主动脉瓣关闭不全 (AR) 的特征。收缩末期主动脉瓣无法将主动脉与左心室紧密隔离开，导致主动脉压力迅速下降，舒张压全面降低。此外，左心室经历向心性肥大，最初代偿左心室舒张末期容积的增加，从而导致心搏量和心输出量增加。由于脉压（舒张压和收缩压之差）与心搏量成正比，舒张压降低的基础上，代偿性增加的心搏量会导致AR患者出现特征性的脉压增宽。 {{exhibit_1}}\n\n这种高振幅脉动伴快速舒张期崩溃是AR中异常脉动发现的原因。颅内动脉的有力搏动会导致每次心跳时头部摇晃（de Musset征），患者可能会因左心室的有力收缩而出现心悸。此外，体格检查可显示颈动脉的突然扩张和塌陷（Corrigan征）和周围动脉（“水锤”脉搏），并在听诊时显示“枪声”股动脉搏动（Traube征）。\n\n（选项A）左心室收缩力受损发生在AR病程的晚期，最终导致心力衰竭。由于头部摇晃和其他AR的特征性发现是由于心搏量增加和高振幅、快速上升-快速下降的脉动，一旦左心室收缩力受损（心搏量减少），这些发现就不那么明显了。\n\n（选项B和C）左心室流出道梗阻，如主动脉瓣狭窄，导致心搏量减少和特征性的弱脉和延迟脉搏（脉搏细小且迟缓）。左心室充盈受限，如二尖瓣狭窄，也由于左心室舒张末期容积减少（前负荷减少）而减少心搏量。与高振幅脉动相关的临床发现将不会出现在心搏量减少的情况下。\n\n（选项D）收缩压和舒张压高血压不一定伴有脉压增宽；高振幅、快速上升-快速下降脉动的体征更具慢性AR特征。\n\n教育目标：慢性主动脉瓣关闭不全 (AR) 导致舒张压降低和左心室心搏量代偿性增加。这些变化产生高振幅、快速上升-快速下降的脉动（即，脉压增宽）以及AR的其他特征性发现（例如，头部摇晃、“枪声”股动脉搏动）。"
