    "en": "An 8-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother for a routine checkup. He was diagnosed with absence seizures a year ago and was started on appropriate treatment. The mother says that the patient is doing well and that he has had no seizures since starting medical therapy. School performance has improved significantly, and he no longer gets in trouble for \"staring\" in class. The patient has a well-balanced diet and is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of action of the medication used in this patient?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "Ethosuximide is the first-line treatment for ABSENCE SEIZURES. This drug blocks T-type Ca2+ channels that trigger and sustain rhythmic burst discharges in THALAMIC NEURONS. It is not an effective treatment for other types of generalized or focal seizures.\n\nIf ethosuximide is not tolerated due to adverse effects (eg, nausea/vomiting, drowsiness) or if it is ineffective in suppressing seizure activity, valproic acid is used as a second-line treatment for absence epilepsy. Valproic acid is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug that blocks voltage-dependent Na+ channels and raises GABA concentration in the CNS.\n\n(Choice A) Benzodiazepines and barbiturates (eg, phenobarbital) bind to GABA receptors and allow increased chloride current through the ion channel. This hyperpolarizes the cell membrane, making it harder to trigger an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron.\n\n(Choice B) Levetiracetam binds to a synaptic vesicle protein (SV2A) to modulate the release of GABA and glutamate neurotransmitters.\n\n(Choice D) Phenytoin decreases the sodium current in cortical neurons by reducing the ability of Na+ channels to recover from inactivation. This increases the refractory period of the neuron, inhibiting neuronal high-frequency firing. Carbamazepine has a similar mechanism of action.\n\n(Choice E) Increasing the levels of brain beta-hydroxybutyrate (ketone bodies) is the goal of the ketogenic diet. This high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet may benefit some patients with refractory epilepsy.\n\nEducational objective:\nEthosuximide, the first-line treatment for absence seizures, prevents neuronal burst firing by blocking thalamic T-type Ca2+ channels. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid inhibit high-frequency neuronal firing by blocking Na+ channels.",
    "zh": "乙琥胺是失神发作的一线治疗药物。该药物阻断了T型Ca2+通道，这些通道触发并维持丘脑神经元中有节律的爆发性放电。它对其他类型的全身性或局灶性癫痫发作无效。\n\n如果由于不良反应（如恶心/呕吐、嗜睡）而无法耐受乙琥胺，或者它无法有效抑制癫痫发作活动，则使用丙戊酸作为失神发作的二线治疗。丙戊酸是一种广谱抗癫痫药物，可阻断电压依赖性Na+通道并提高中枢神经系统中GABA的浓度。\n\n（选项A）苯二氮卓类药物和巴比妥类药物（例如苯巴比妥）与GABA受体结合，并允许通过离子通道增加氯离子电流。这使细胞膜超极化，从而更难以在突触后神经元中触发动作电位。\n\n（选项B）左乙拉西坦与突触小泡蛋白（SV2A）结合，调节GABA和谷氨酸神经递质的释放。\n\n（选项D）苯妥英通过降低Na+通道从失活中恢复的能力来减少皮质神经元中的钠离子电流。这增加了神经元的难复期，从而抑制神经元高频放电。卡马西平具有相似的作用机制。\n\n（选项E）增加脑β-羟基丁酸（酮体）的水平是生酮饮食的目标。这种高脂肪、低碳水化合物饮食可能对某些难治性癫痫患者有益。\n\n教育目标：\n乙琥胺是失神发作的一线治疗药物，通过阻断丘脑T型Ca2+通道来防止神经元爆发性放电。苯妥英、卡马西平和丙戊酸通过阻断Na+通道来抑制高频神经元放电。"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the first-line treatment for absence seizures and its specific mechanism of action. It requires understanding the pathophysiology of absence seizures and how different antiepileptic drugs target specific ion channels or neurotransmitter systems.\n\nTo solve this question, identify the seizure type (absence seizures) and recall the first-line medication. Then, match the mechanism of action of that medication to the provided options, using knowledge of antiepileptic drug pharmacology and ion channel function.",
