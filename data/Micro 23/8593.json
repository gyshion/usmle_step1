    "en": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician for a health maintenance examination. She has been well and has no specific complaints. She eats a well-balanced diet and exercises on a stationary bicycle 3 days a week. She works as a nursing assistant at a local hospital. Review of her records shows that she is due for her annual influenza vaccination. Prior to administration of the vaccine, her skin is disinfected with 70% isopropanol.",

  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "Alcohols, including ethanol and isopropanol, are widely used as disinfecting agents in the health care setting. They are commonly used to clean the skin before immunization or venipuncture and to disinfect external surfaces of equipment. They function by DISORGANIZING the lipid structure in membranes, causing them to be leaky, and by denaturing cellular proteins. Alcohols require the presence of water for maximal activity and are most effective at 60%-90% concentration. They are rapidly bactericidal and also tuberculocidal, fungicidal, and virucidal, but do not destroy bacterial spores.\n\n(Choice A) Chlorhexidine works by destabilizing cell membranes and coagulating intracellular constituents. In combination with 70% alcohol, it is the antiseptic of choice for many surgical and percutaneous procedures. Its use is contraindicated in neurologic, otologic, and ophthalmologic procedures due to neurotoxicity.\n\n(Choice B) Formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde function by alkylating and cross-linking DNA and proteins. They are most commonly used for sterilization of hospital instruments that cannot withstand autoclave temperatures.\n\n(Choice D) Iodine causes halogenation of proteins and DNA. Solutions containing iodine are frequently used for antisepsis in surgical and percutaneous procedures. However, they are less effective than chlorhexidine-alcohol and cause more skin irritation and toxicity.\n\n(Choice E) Hydrogen peroxide functions as an oxidant by producing hydroxyl free radicals that attack cellular components. It is excellent at disinfecting inanimate objects but is less effective when used on organic materials. Hydrogen peroxide is often used for skin cleansing and wound debridement due to its effervescent quality.\n\nEducational objective:\nAlcohols function by disorganizing the lipid structure in membranes, causing them to be leaky, and by denaturing cellular proteins. They are bactericidal, tuberculocidal, fungicidal, and virucidal, but do not destroy bacterial spores.",
    "zh": "包括乙醇和异丙醇在内的醇类广泛应用于医疗保健环境中作为消毒剂。它们通常用于在免疫接种或静脉穿刺前清洁皮肤，以及对设备的外表面进行消毒。它们的起效机制是破坏细胞膜中的脂质结构，导致细胞膜渗漏，并通过使细胞蛋白质变性。醇类需要水的存在才能发挥最大活性，并且在60%-90%的浓度下最有效。它们具有快速杀菌作用，也可杀灭结核杆菌、真菌和病毒，但不能破坏细菌孢子。\n\n(选项A) 氯己定通过破坏细胞膜和凝固细胞内成分起作用。与70%酒精结合使用时，它是许多外科和经皮手术的首选防腐剂。由于神经毒性，它在神经、耳科和眼科手术中禁用。\n\n(选项B) 甲醛和戊二醛通过烷基化和交联DNA和蛋白质起作用。它们最常用于无法承受高压灭菌温度的医院器械的消毒。\n\n(选项D) 碘引起蛋白质和DNA的卤化。含碘溶液常用于外科和经皮手术中的防腐。然而，它们不如氯己定-酒精有效，并且会导致更多的皮肤刺激和毒性。\n\n(选项E) 过氧化氢通过产生攻击细胞成分的羟基自由基作为氧化剂发挥作用。它非常适合对无生命物体进行消毒，但用于有机材料时效果较差。过氧化氢常用于皮肤清洁和伤口清创，因为它具有起泡特性。\n\n教育目标：\n醇类通过破坏细胞膜中的脂质结构，导致细胞膜渗漏，并通过使细胞蛋白质变性起作用。它们具有杀菌、杀结核杆菌、杀真菌和杀病毒作用，但不能破坏细菌孢子。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the mechanism of action of commonly used antiseptic agents, specifically isopropanol. Isopropanol disrupts cell membranes and denatures proteins, leading to its antiseptic properties.\n\nTo solve this question, recall the mechanism of action of different antiseptic agents. Isopropanol, being an alcohol, primarily disrupts cell membranes and denatures proteins, making option C the most likely answer.",
