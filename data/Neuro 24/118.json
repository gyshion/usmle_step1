    "en": "A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to a week of progressive headaches and confusion. He was treated for viral esophagitis 6 months ago and Pneumocystis pneumonia 2 months ago. Temperature is 38 C (100.4 F), blood pressure is 142/86 mm Hg, and pulse is 64/min. {{exhibit_1}} The patient is lethargic and oriented to person and place only. CT scan of the head shows a mildly increased ventricle size but no other abnormalities. Lumbar puncture reveals an elevated opening pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows moderately increased protein concentration and pleocytosis. The latex agglutination test is positive for soluble polysaccharide antigen. Light microscopy of this patient's cerebrospinal fluid is most likely to reveal which of the following?",
    "zh": "一名54岁男性因进行性头痛和意识模糊一周被送入急诊科。他6个月前接受了病毒性食管炎的治疗，2个月前接受了肺孢子虫肺炎的治疗。体温38摄氏度（100.4华氏度），血压142/86毫米汞柱，脉搏64次/分钟。{{exhibit_1}}患者嗜睡，仅能定向于人和地点。头部CT扫描显示脑室轻度增大，但无其他异常。腰椎穿刺显示开放压升高，脑脊液分析显示蛋白浓度中度升高和细胞增多。乳胶凝集试验对可溶性多糖抗原呈阳性。该患者的脑脊液的光学显微镜检查最有可能揭示以下哪一项？"

    "en": "This patient's opportunistic infections (viral esophagitis, Pneumocystis pneumonia) raise suspicion for untreated AIDS. He now has headache, fever, confusion, and polysaccharide antigens in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indicating likely cryptococcal meningitis. This opportunistic infection is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, a yeast with a thick polysaccharide capsule. Diagnosis is often made by identifying polysaccharide (cryptococcal) antigens in the CSF. Round or oval budding yeast can also be visualized with India ink stain. {{exhibit_2}} Most patients have elevated opening pressures on lumbar puncture due to increased vascular permeability secondary to inflammation and/or yeasts obstructing CSF outflow from the arachnoid villi. {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者的条件性感染（病毒性食管炎、肺孢子虫肺炎）提示未治疗的艾滋病。他现在出现头痛、发烧、意识模糊，并且脑脊液（CSF）中存在多糖抗原，表明可能患有隐球菌性脑膜炎。这种机会性感染由新型隐球菌引起，这是一种具有厚多糖荚膜的酵母菌。诊断通常通过识别CSF中的多糖（隐球菌）抗原来做出。使用墨汁染色也可以观察到圆形或卵圆形出芽酵母。{{exhibit_2}}大多数患者在腰椎穿刺时开放压升高，这归因于炎症引起的血管通透性增加和/或酵母菌阻塞了脑脊液从蛛网膜绒毛的流出。{{exhibit_3}}"
