    "en": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the office due to 2 weeks of persistent back pain. She has also had excessive fatigue, anorexia, and unintentional weight loss over the past several months. The patient has no prior medical problems but has a history of cancer in the family. An imaging study reveals a lytic lesion in the T10 vertebral body. Analysis of the biopsy sample shows cell lineage with abnormally high replicative potential. A genetic study reveals a single nucleotide substitution causing an activating mutation. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "Normal growth of neoplastic cells can arise due to mutation of either proto-oncogenes or anti-oncogenes (tumor suppressors). Proto-oncogenes stimulate cell proliferation, and their overexpression/amplification leads to increased cellular proliferation and neoplastic growth. KRAS is a proto-oncogene often activated in tumor cells, thereby increasing the cellular response to mitogenic stimuli.\n\nIn contrast, anti-oncogenes are tumor suppressors as they inhibit cellular proliferation. Their inactivation (eg, loss-of-function mutation) contributes to tumor development. APC, BRCA1, RB, and TP53 are anti-oncogenes and are therefore more likely to be inactivated in neoplastic cells:\n\n- APC is inactivated in familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome. Similar mutations are found in many sporadic colon cancers (Choice A).\n- BRCA1 is responsible for DNA repair. Its inactivation increases the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer (Choice B).\n- When active, RB suppresses the transition of cells from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, thereby inhibiting cellular proliferation. An inactivated RB is found in many tumors (Choice D).\n- Mutated TP53 is the most common abnormality associated with cancer development. TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene that produces p53, a protein that inhibits proliferation of cells with genetic abnormalities (Choice E).\n\nSome of the important proto-oncogenes, anti-oncogenes, and their associated tumors are listed in the table.\n\nEducational objective:\nMost tumors possess multiple cytogenetic abnormalities. Activation of proto-oncogenes results in stimulation of cellular proliferation. Inactivation of anti-oncogenes eliminates oversight of the cell cycle.",
    "zh": "肿瘤细胞的正常生长可能由于原癌基因或抑癌基因（肿瘤抑制基因）的突变而产生。原癌基因刺激细胞增殖，其过度表达/扩增会导致细胞增殖增加和肿瘤生长。 KRAS是一种原癌基因，常在肿瘤细胞中被激活，从而增加细胞对有丝分裂刺激的反应。\n\n相比之下，抑癌基因是肿瘤抑制基因，因为它们抑制细胞增殖。它们的失活（例如，功能丧失突变）有助于肿瘤的发展。 APC、BRCA1、RB和TP53是抑癌基因，因此更可能在肿瘤细胞中失活：\n\n- APC在家族性腺瘤性息肉病综合征中失活。 在许多散发性结肠癌中也发现了类似的突变（选项A）。\n- BRCA1负责DNA修复。它的失活增加了患乳腺癌和卵巢癌的风险（选项B）。\n- 当RB激活时，它会抑制细胞从G1期到细胞周期的S期的转变，从而抑制细胞增殖。 在许多肿瘤中都发现了失活的RB（选项D）。\n- 突变的TP53是与癌症发生相关的最常见的异常。 TP53是一种抑癌基因，产生p53，这是一种抑制具有遗传异常的细胞增殖的蛋白质（选项E）。\n\n一些重要的原癌基因、抑癌基因及其相关的肿瘤列于表中。\n\n教学目标：\n大多数肿瘤具有多种细胞遗传学异常。原癌基因的激活导致细胞增殖的刺激。 抑癌基因的失活消除了对细胞周期的监督。"

    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the roles of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in cancer development, specifically identifying which gene mutation is most likely given the clinical presentation of an activating mutation leading to a lytic bone lesion and high replicative potential.\n\nThe approach to solving this question involves recognizing that an activating mutation points towards a proto-oncogene. Then, considering the options provided, identifying KRAS as a proto-oncogene commonly activated in various cancers, especially those with aggressive or metastatic potential, aligns with the patient's presentation.",
