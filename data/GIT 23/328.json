    "en": "A 30-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to severe abdominal pain. The patient first developed the pain yesterday, and it has become increasingly worse. Over the last few hours, he has also developed bilious emesis. The patient has had no previous surgeries. Temperature is 37.8 C (100 F) and pulse is 110/min. Physical examination shows diffuse abdominal tenderness with guarding during palpation. Abdominal imaging reveals bowel wall thickening within a blind pouch connected to the ileum. A laparotomy is performed. During the procedure, a fibrous band is seen attaching the end of the pouch to the umbilicus. The walls of this pouch are most likely composed of which of the following? {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient's outpouching from the ileum with a fibrous band connected to the umbilicus is characteristic of a Meckel diverticulum.\n\nThis congenital anomaly is due to incomplete obliteration of the vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct in utero; the duct normally serves as a communication between the yolk sac and the primitive midgut in early gestation. Meckel diverticulum is typically located in the small bowel 2 feet from the ileocecal valve and, if symptomatic, often presents by age 2 (ie, rule of 2s); however, it can cause complications at any age.\n\nMeckel diverticulum is a true diverticulum, consisting of all 3 layers of the intestinal wall: mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis. It often contains heterotopic gastric mucosa, which secretes hydrochloric acid and leads to the classic presentation of painless lower gastrointestinal bleeding (hematochezia) due to the ulceration of adjacent intestine. Patients may also develop diverticular inflammation with signs of acute intestinal obstruction (eg, abdominal pain, guarding, bilious emesis), as seen in this patient. Other complications of a Meckel diverticulum can include intussusception, volvulus, and bowel perforation.\n\n(Choice A) Fibrous scar tissue, which can be present postoperatively or due to chronic inflammation, can cause intestinal obstruction with severe abdominal pain, bilious emesis, and guarding. However, a blind pouch connected to the ileum with an attachment to the umbilicus would not be present.\n\n(Choice B) Granulation tissue is new connective tissue that forms in response to wound healing, and the peritoneum is the lining of the abdominal cavity. These tissues are not contained in a Meckel diverticulum.\n\n(Choice C) False diverticula contain only mucosa and submucosa. These layers herniate through defects in the muscular layer. Colonic and Zenker (upper esophageal) diverticula are examples of false diverticula.\n\n(Choice D) Tumors of the omentum (ie, adipose tissue covering the abdominal organs) are a rare cause of abdominal pain and vomiting but are not associated with an outpouching of the ileum.\n\nEducational objective:\nMeckel diverticulum, which classically causes painless hematochezia but can present with acute abdominal pain if inflamed (ie, diverticulitis), is an anatomic connection between the ileum and umbilicus resulting from incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct. This congenital anomaly is a true diverticulum, consisting of all 3 layers of the intestinal wall (mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis).",
    "zh": "该患者从回肠突出的盲袋，伴有与脐部相连的纤维带，是梅克尔憩室的特征。\n\n这种先天性异常是由于子宫内卵黄管（脐肠管）未完全闭塞所致；该管通常在妊娠早期作为卵黄囊和原始中肠之间的通道。梅克尔憩室通常位于距回盲瓣2英尺的小肠中，如果出现症状，通常在2岁时出现（即，2的法则）；然而，它可能在任何年龄引起并发症。\n\n梅克尔憩室是真性憩室，由肠壁的所有3层组成：黏膜、黏膜下层和肌层。它通常包含异位胃黏膜，分泌盐酸，导致典型的无痛性下消化道出血（便血），这是由于邻近肠道的溃疡所致。患者还可能出现憩室炎，伴有急性肠梗阻的体征（例如，腹痛、腹肌紧张、胆汁性呕吐），如该患者所见。梅克尔憩室的其他并发症可包括肠套叠、肠扭转和肠穿孔。\n\n（选项A）纤维瘢痕组织，可在术后或慢性炎症后出现，可引起肠梗阻，伴有剧烈腹痛、胆汁性呕吐和腹肌紧张。然而，与回肠相连并附着于脐部的盲袋不会出现。\n\n（选项B）肉芽组织是响应伤口愈合而形成的新结缔组织，腹膜是腹腔的内衬。这些组织不包含在梅克尔憩室中。\n\n（选项C）假性憩室仅包含黏膜和黏膜下层。这些层通过肌层的缺陷疝出。结肠憩室和Zenker（上食管）憩室是假性憩室的例子。\n\n（选项D）大网膜（即覆盖腹部器官的脂肪组织）肿瘤是腹痛和呕吐的罕见原因，但与回肠的突出无关。\n\n教育目标：\n梅克尔憩室，典型地引起无痛性便血，但如果发炎（即，憩室炎），则可表现为急性腹痛，它是回肠和脐部之间的解剖学连接，是由于卵黄管未完全闭塞所致。这种先天性异常是真性憩室，由肠壁的所有3层（黏膜、黏膜下层和肌层）组成。"
