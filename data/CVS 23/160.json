    "en": "A 57-year-old man is seen in the office after an episode of acute pancreatitis. Hospital evaluation found no evidence of gallstones. The patient does not consume alcohol, but he does have a history of severe hypertriglyceridemia. He was treated with a fibrate medication in the past but could not tolerate it due to liver toxicity. He has no history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension. On examination, the patient has no abdominal tenderness. Laboratory studies show normal hepatic and pancreatic enzyme levels, but the patient again has a severely elevated triglyceride level. The physician prescribes the appropriate medications and explains that the patient is likely to experience skin flushing and warmth after taking the pills.",
    "zh": "一名57岁男性在急性胰腺炎发作后到诊所就诊。住院评估未发现胆结石的证据。患者不饮酒，但有严重高甘油三酯血症病史。过去曾用贝特类药物治疗，但由于肝毒性而无法耐受。他没有糖尿病或高血压病史。体格检查显示患者腹部无压痛。实验室检查显示肝酶和胰酶水平正常，但患者再次出现甘油三酯水平严重升高。医生开了合适的药物，并解释说患者在服药后可能会出现皮肤潮红和发热。"

    "en": "Nicotinic acid, or niacin, has been used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia for almost 4 decades. It is effective in raising HDL cholesterol levels, as well as lowering triglycerides and LDL levels.\n\nNiacin's main side effects are cutaneous flushing, warmth, and itching; these are primarily mediated by release of prostaglandins (particularly PGD2 and PGE2). Aspirin, which inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, can significantly reduce these side effects if given 30-60 minutes before niacin administration. The side effects are also reduced with slow-release preparations or if niacin is taken with meals. They are worst when niacin is first initiated and tend to fade over time due to tachyphylaxis.\n\n(Choice A) Vancomycin infusion reaction is mediated by histamine release due to non-IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation.\n\n(Choice B) Platelet-activating factor is a powerful phospholipid activator produced by a number of cells, including neutrophils, basophils, platelets, and endothelial cells. It is a mediator of platelet aggregation.\n\n(Choice D) Serotonin syndrome is a potential side effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. It is characterized by abnormal mental status, autonomic hyperactivity, and muscular rigidity with hyperreflexia.\n\n(Choice E) Substance P is a polypeptide neurotransmitter involved in mediating pain signals in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Topical capsaicin causes release of substance P, resulting in burning pain in the area of application. Prolonged use causes depletion of substance P, and the pain diminishes with time.\n\nEducational objective:\nNiacin is used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. It increases HDL levels and decreases LDL levels and triglycerides. Niacin causes cutaneous flushing, which is mediated by prostaglandins and can be diminished by pretreatment with aspirin.",
    "zh": "烟酸（或称烟酰胺）已被用于治疗高脂血症近40年。它能有效提高高密度脂蛋白（HDL）胆固醇水平，并降低甘油三酯和低密度脂蛋白（LDL）水平。\n\n烟酸的主要副作用是皮肤潮红、发热和瘙痒；这些主要由前列腺素（特别是PGD2和PGE2）的释放介导。阿司匹林抑制前列腺素的合成，如果在服用烟酸前30-60分钟服用，可以显著减少这些副作用。缓释制剂或与餐同服烟酸也能减轻副作用。这些副作用在首次使用烟酸时最为严重，并往往会随着时间推移而消退，这归因于快速耐受。\n\n（选项A）万古霉素输注反应是由组胺释放介导的，这是由于非IgE介导的肥大细胞脱颗粒引起的。\n\n（选项B）血小板活化因子是一种强大的磷脂活化剂，由多种细胞产生，包括中性粒细胞、嗜碱性粒细胞、血小板和内皮细胞。它是血小板聚集的介质。\n\n（选项D）血清素综合征是选择性血清素再摄取抑制剂的潜在副作用。其特征是精神状态异常、自主神经系统过度活跃以及伴有反射亢进的肌肉僵硬。\n\n（选项E）P物质是一种多肽神经递质，参与介导周围和中枢神经系统中的疼痛信号。局部辣椒素会导致P物质的释放，从而导致应用部位的灼痛。长期使用会导致P物质的耗竭，并且疼痛会随着时间推移而减轻。\n\n教育目标：\n烟酸用于治疗高脂血症。它能提高HDL水平并降低LDL水平和甘油三酯。烟酸引起皮肤潮红，这由前列腺素介导，并且可以通过阿司匹林预处理来减轻。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests knowledge of niacin's mechanism of action and its common side effects, specifically cutaneous flushing. It also assesses understanding of the role of prostaglandins in mediating these side effects and how aspirin can mitigate them.\n\nTo solve this question, recognize the patient's symptoms as niacin-induced flushing. Recall that prostaglandins are the primary mediators of this effect, and aspirin can be used to reduce it by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.",
    "zh": "本题测试对烟酸作用机制及其常见副作用（特别是皮肤潮红）的了解。它还评估对前列腺素在介导这些副作用中的作用以及阿司匹林如何减轻这些副作用的理解。\n\n要解决这个问题，要认识到患者的症状是烟酸引起的潮红。回想一下，前列腺素是这种效应的主要介质，而阿司匹林可以通过抑制前列腺素的合成来减少它。"
