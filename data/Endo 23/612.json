    "en": "A 56-year-old woman comes to the office due to progressive weight gain and fatigue over the last 4 months. She also has had increasing difficulty in lifting heavy objects and climbing stairs. The patient has moderate, persistent bronchial asthma for which she uses inhaled corticosteroids and beta-2 agonists. Family history is significant for colon cancer in her father. Blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg and pulse is 80/min. On physical examination, there is symmetric proximal muscle weakness of the upper and lower extremities. Fasting plasma glucose level is 135 mg/dL and 24-hour urinary cortisol is increased. Further evaluation reveals that high-dose, but not low-dose, dexamethasone suppresses serum cortisol levels. Serum ACTH levels are high-normal. {{exhibit_1}}",

    "en": "This patient has weight gain, proximal muscle weakness, hypertension, and hyperglycemia, which are prominent features of Cushing syndrome. Screening tests for endogenous Cushing syndrome include low-dose dexamethasone suppression testing. In normal individuals, low doses of dexamethasone (a potent glucocorticoid) suppress ACTH and cortisol levels through negative feedback. However, in endogenous Cushing syndrome, ACTH and cortisol levels are not suppressed.\n\nThe most common causes of Cushing syndrome are shown in the flowchart and can be categorized on the basis of serum ACTH levels as either ACTH dependent (ACTH is high or inappropriately normal) or ACTH independent (ACTH is suppressed). In ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome, if high-dose dexamethasone suppresses ACTH and cortisol secretion, a pituitary source (ie, ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma) is likely. In contrast, ectopic ACTH production (eg, from malignant tumors such as small cell lung cancer) is not suppressed by high-dose dexamethasone (Choice E).\n\nThis patient has excessive cortisol production that is suppressed by high-dose but not low-dose dexamethasone. This is consistent with an ACTH-secreting corticotroph pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease), the most common cause of endogenous Cushing syndrome.\n\n(Choices A and B) Excess cortisol production due to an autonomously functioning adrenal adenoma, adrenal carcinoma, or primary adrenocortical hyperplasia will cause Cushing syndrome with a suppressed ACTH level (ACTH independent). This patient's ACTH is elevated.\n\n(Choice C) Administration of exogenous glucocorticoids is a common cause of Cushing syndrome. This is most common with systemic agents (eg, prednisone), but can occasionally be seen with topical or inhaled glucocorticoids. However, ACTH is suppressed in these cases.\n\nEducational objective:\nIn Cushing syndrome due to an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease), ACTH is high and cortisol production can be suppressed by high-dose, but not low-dose, dexamethasone. In patients with ectopic ACTH production (eg, from malignant tumors), cortisol and ACTH production are not suppressed by low- or high-dose dexamethasone. {{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}",
    "zh": "该患者体重增加、近端肌无力、高血压和高血糖，这些都是库欣综合征的突出特征。内源性库欣综合征的筛查试验包括小剂量地塞米松抑制试验。在正常个体中，小剂量地塞米松（一种强效糖皮质激素）通过负反馈抑制ACTH和皮质醇水平。然而，在内源性库欣综合征中，ACTH和皮质醇水平不会受到抑制。\n\n库欣综合征最常见的原因显示在流程图中，可以根据血清ACTH水平分为ACTH依赖性（ACTH升高或不适当正常）或ACTH非依赖性（ACTH受到抑制）。在ACTH依赖性库欣综合征中，如果大剂量地塞米松抑制ACTH和皮质醇的分泌，则可能来自垂体来源（即，分泌ACTH的垂体腺瘤）。相比之下，异位ACTH产生（例如，来自恶性肿瘤，如小细胞肺癌）不会被大剂量地塞米松抑制（选项E）。\n\n该患者皮质醇产生过多，但可被大剂量而非小剂量地塞米松抑制。这与分泌ACTH的促皮质素垂体腺瘤（库欣病）一致，库欣病是内源性库欣综合征最常见的原因。\n\n（选项A和B）由于自主功能性肾上腺腺瘤、肾上腺癌或原发性肾上腺皮质增生引起的皮质醇过度产生将导致ACTH水平受到抑制的库欣综合征（ACTH非依赖性）。该患者的ACTH升高。\n\n（选项C）外源性糖皮质激素的给药是库欣综合征的常见原因。这在全身性药物（例如，泼尼松）中最常见，但偶尔也会在局部或吸入性糖皮质激素中观察到。然而，在这些情况下，ACTH受到抑制。\n\n教育目标：\n在由分泌ACTH的垂体腺瘤（库欣病）引起的库欣综合征中，ACTH升高，皮质醇的产生可被大剂量而非小剂量地塞米松抑制。在异位ACTH产生的患者中（例如，来自恶性肿瘤），皮质醇和ACTH的产生不会被低剂量或大剂量地塞米松抑制。{{exhibit_2}} {{exhibit_3}}"

    "en": "This question tests knowledge of the etiology and diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome, specifically differentiating between ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent causes based on dexamethasone suppression testing. It requires understanding the feedback mechanisms of cortisol and ACTH.\n\nTo solve this question, analyze the patient's symptoms suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, interpret the dexamethasone suppression test results, and correlate them with the ACTH level to determine the most likely underlying cause. Consider the flowchart provided to narrow down the differential diagnosis.",
