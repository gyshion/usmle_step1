    "en": "A 64-year-old woman is brought to the clinic by her husband due to a fall. She was walking in her living room when she tripped over an electrical cord. The patient has had several other ground-level falls in the last 6 months but has had no significant injuries. She also gave up driving a year ago following a near-miss motor vehicle accident. Past medical history is notable for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, for which she takes appropriate medications. Mental status and neurologic examinations are normal. Ophthalmic examination reveals reduced vision in her peripheral visual fields bilaterally and an elevated intraocular pressure. After discussion of treatment options, the patient is initiated on timolol ophthalmic drops.",

  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient presents with findings suggestive of open-angle glaucoma, characterized by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and reduced peripheral vision. Timolol is a nonselective beta-blocker that is commonly used to treat glaucoma. Beta-blockers work by decreasing the production of aqueous humor, which in turn lowers IOP. The aqueous humor is produced by the ciliary epithelium. Therefore, the ciliary epithelium is the primary target of timolol.\n\n(Choices B, D, and E) The ciliary muscle is involved in accommodation and is innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system. Cholinergic agonists, such as pilocarpine, cause contraction of the ciliary muscle, which can increase the outflow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork and also cause miosis (constriction of the pupil). The pupil sphincter is responsible for pupillary constriction and is also innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system. The trabecular meshwork is the primary site of aqueous humor outflow. While decreasing aqueous humor production indirectly affects the pressure gradient across the trabecular meshwork, the trabecular meshwork itself is not the direct target of beta-blockers like timolol. The lens is not directly affected by timolol.\n\nKey pearls:\n- Glaucoma is characterized by elevated IOP and progressive loss of peripheral vision.\n- Timolol is a beta-blocker that reduces aqueous humor production.\n- Aqueous humor is produced by the CILIARY EPITHELIUM.\n- Cholinergic agonists cause miosis and affect the ciliary muscle and trabecular meshwork.",
    "zh": "该患者的临床表现提示开角型青光眼，其特征是眼内压 (IOP) 升高和周边视野视力下降。噻吗洛尔是一种非选择性β受体阻滞剂，常用于治疗青光眼。β受体阻滞剂通过减少房水的产生来降低眼内压。房水由睫状体上皮产生。因此，睫状体上皮是噻吗洛尔的主要靶点。\n\n（选项 B、D 和 E）睫状肌参与调节，并由副交感神经系统支配。胆碱能激动剂（如毛果芸香碱）可引起睫状肌收缩，从而增加房水通过小梁网的流出，并导致瞳孔缩小。瞳孔括约肌负责瞳孔收缩，也由副交感神经系统支配。小梁网是房水外流的主要部位。虽然减少房水产生间接影响了小梁网的压力梯度，但小梁网本身并不是噻吗洛尔等β受体阻滞剂的直接靶点。晶状体不受噻吗洛尔的直接影响。\n\n关键要点：\n- 青光眼的特征是眼内压升高和周边视野进行性丧失。\n- 噻吗洛尔是一种β受体阻滞剂，可减少房水的产生。\n- 房水由睫状体上皮产生。\n- 胆碱能激动剂引起瞳孔缩小，并影响睫状肌和小梁网。"

  "summary": {
    "en": "This question tests the understanding of the mechanism of action of timolol, a common medication used to treat glaucoma. Specifically, it assesses knowledge of which ocular structure is the primary target for reducing intraocular pressure by decreasing aqueous humor production.\n\nTo solve this question, one must recall that timolol is a beta-blocker and that beta-blockers used for glaucoma work by reducing aqueous humor production. The next step is to identify the ocular structure responsible for producing aqueous humor, which is the ciliary epithelium.",
    "zh": "本题考察对噻吗洛尔（一种用于治疗青光眼的常见药物）作用机制的理解。具体来说，它评估了对哪种眼部结构是主要靶点，通过减少房水产生来降低眼内压的知识。\n\n要解决这个问题，必须回忆起噻吗洛尔是一种β受体阻滞剂，并且用于治疗青光眼的β受体阻滞剂通过减少房水产生而起作用。下一步是确定负责产生房水的眼部结构，即睫状体上皮。"
