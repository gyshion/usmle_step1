    "en": "A 52-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up to discuss the results of his colonoscopy. The physician informs the patient that a cancerous polyp was removed and that there is no evidence of invasive cancer at the resection margins.

You don't know what you're doing!\" Which of the following is the most appropriate response to the patient?",

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": {
    "en": "This patient is angry and verbally abusive after receiving an unexpected cancer diagnosis. Anxiety and distress likely exacerbate his sense of entitlement and demanding personality characteristics, and the physician must face the challenge of responding to his insulting comments. When patients are upset, they may have difficulty fully processing information. Instead, they may express anger at the physician rather than acknowledging their own fears.\n\nThe best approach is to defuse the situation by being NONDEFENSIVE and acknowledging the patient's anger. This should be followed by an open-ended approach that elicits the patient's understanding about his condition and encourages him to express his concerns and fears about the diagnosis that likely underlie his behavior.\n\n(Choice A) This statement initially expresses empathy but then assumes a defensive stance, which is unlikely to engage the patient or defuse his anger.\n\n(Choice C) This statement assumes that the patient did not understand the information provided, which may be perceived as judgmental. The best initial approach is to acknowledge the patient's anger while exploring his understanding of the results. Reassurance that the cancer was removed would be the appropriate next step if discussion revealed that he misunderstood his prognosis.\n\n(Choice D) Suggesting that the patient should calm down is likely to be perceived as condescending and judgmental, leading to further deterioration of rapport.\n\n(Choice E) Suggesting referral to another provider may be perceived as an attempt to get rid of the patient. The first step should be to defuse the patient's anger and attempt to preserve the physician-patient relationship.\n\nEducational objective:\nWhen confronting an angry patient, the physician should use a nondefensive, empathic approach that acknowledges the patient's anger and attempts to explore the patient's underlying concerns.",
    "zh": "这位患者在收到意外的癌症诊断后，表现出愤怒和言语辱骂。焦虑和痛苦可能会加剧他自以为是和要求过高的个性特征，医生必须面对回应他侮辱性言论的挑战。当患者心烦意乱时，他们可能难以完全处理信息。相反，他们可能会对医生表达愤怒，而不是承认自己的恐惧。\n\n最好的方法是通过不采取防御姿态并承认患者的愤怒来化解局面。随后应采用开放式方法，以了解患者对其病情的理解，并鼓励他表达他对可能构成其行为基础的诊断的担忧和恐惧。\n\n（选项 A）该陈述最初表达了同情，但随后采取了防御姿态，这不太可能与患者互动或化解他的愤怒。\n\n（选项 C）该陈述假定患者不理解所提供的信息，这可能被认为是评判性的。最好的初始方法是承认患者的愤怒，同时探索他对结果的理解。如果讨论表明他误解了他的预后，那么保证癌症已被切除将是适当的下一步。\n\n（选项 D）建议患者冷静下来很可能被认为是居高临下和评判性的，导致医患关系的进一步恶化。\n\n（选项 E）建议转诊给另一位提供者可能被认为是试图摆脱患者。第一步应该是化解患者的愤怒，并试图维持医患关系。\n\n教育目标：\n当面对愤怒的患者时，医生应使用一种非防御性的、富有同情心的方法，承认患者的愤怒并试图探索患者潜在的担忧。"
