    "en": "A 16-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother due to nonspecific stomachaches and pains. She has no other medical history. The patient has missed more than 10 days of school due to the symptoms since the academic year started 6 months ago. The mother says that her daughter has always been anxious with a \"sensitive stomach,\" but the symptoms have worsened since the patient's best friend moved away a month ago. She has a few other friends but prefers to stay home and does not participate in after-school activities. The mother says, \"She worried for weeks about going to a party. On the night of the party she had an anxiety attack and started hyperventilating. She ended up not going to the party at all.\" The patient says she is \"just very shy\" and is afraid of being embarrassed or \"looking stupid\" around others. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. During the interview, the patient makes little eye contact and gives brief answers to questions.",

    "en": "This patient's intense social anxiety, in which she fears embarrassment and scrutiny by others, is characteristic of SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER (SOCIAL PHOBIA). It is a common psychiatric disorder with typical onset in ADOLESCENCE that can result in significant impairment in functioning and quality of life. Social interactions with peers and meeting new people cause significant distress. Anticipatory anxiety weeks before a social event and AVOIDANCE (not going to parties, school refusal) are common.\n\nPatients with social anxiety disorder frequently appear ill at ease during the interview, avoid eye contact, give overly brief responses, and may exhibit physical manifestations of anxiety (eg, blushing, sweating, trembling, tachycardia). The specifier \"performance-only\" is given to patients who have symptoms only in performance situations (eg, speaking or performing in public).\n\n(Choice A) This patient's social anxiety predates the stressor of her friend moving away. Stressors often exacerbate symptoms of other disorders. Adjustment disorder is not diagnosed when symptoms meet criteria for another disorder.\n\n(Choice B) Individuals with agoraphobia avoid public situations (eg, movie theaters) as escape might be difficult or help might not be available if they are incapacitated or have panic symptoms. Although individuals with social anxiety disorder may avoid leaving the house, this is primarily due to fear of embarrassment and scrutiny by others.\n\n(Choice C) This patient's anxiety is restricted to social situations, whereas generalized anxiety is characterized by multiple worries.\n\n(Choice D) Shyness is a common nonpathological personality trait. However, this patient's severe and pervasive anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by social situations. It is causing significant distress and functional impairment in both academic and social contexts.\n\n(Choice E) Patients with anxiety disorder may have panic attacks related to social situations. In panic disorder, however, attacks are unexpected and there is no clear trigger.\n\n(Choice G) Patients with anxiety disorder often present with somatic symptoms. This patient's stomachaches are a physical manifestation of her anxiety. She does not exhibit the excessive preoccupation with physical symptoms that characterizes somatic symptom disorder.\n\nEducational objective: Social anxiety disorder involves excessive fear of scrutiny or embarrassment in social or performance situations, resulting in significant distress and functional impairment.",
    "zh": "该患者强烈的社交焦虑，她害怕被他人羞辱和审视，这是社交焦虑症（社交恐惧症）的特征。这是一种常见的精神疾病，通常在青春期发病，会导致功能和生活质量的严重损害。与同伴的社交互动和结识新朋友会引起严重的痛苦。在社交活动前的几周内出现预期性焦虑和回避行为（不去参加聚会，拒绝上学）很常见。\n\n患有社交焦虑症的患者在访谈期间常常显得局促不安，避免眼神交流，给出过于简短的回答，并且可能表现出焦虑的身体表现（例如，脸红、出汗、颤抖、心动过速）。“仅表现”的限定词用于仅在表现场合（例如，在公共场合演讲或表演）出现症状的患者。\n\n（选项A）该患者的社交焦虑症早于她朋友搬走这一应激源。应激源通常会加剧其他疾病的症状。当症状符合另一种疾病的标准时，不诊断为适应障碍。\n\n（选项B）广场恐惧症患者会避免公共场合（例如，电影院），因为如果他们无行为能力或出现惊恐症状，可能难以逃脱或无法获得帮助。虽然社交焦虑症患者可能会避免离开家，但这主要是由于害怕被他人羞辱和审视。\n\n（选项C）该患者的焦虑仅限于社交场合，而广泛性焦虑症的特征是多种担忧。\n\n（选项D）害羞是一种常见的非病理性人格特质。然而，该患者的严重和普遍的焦虑与社交情境所造成的实际威胁不成比例。这正在导致学术和社会环境中的严重痛苦和功能障碍。\n\n（选项E）患有焦虑症的患者可能会出现与社交场合相关的惊恐发作。然而，在惊恐障碍中，发作是意想不到的，而且没有明确的诱因。\n\n（选项G）患有焦虑症的患者通常会出现躯体症状。该患者的胃痛是她焦虑的身体表现。她没有表现出以躯体症状障碍为特征的过度关注身体症状。\n\n教育目标：社交焦虑症涉及在社交或表现场合中对审视或尴尬的过度恐惧，导致严重的痛苦和功能障碍。"
