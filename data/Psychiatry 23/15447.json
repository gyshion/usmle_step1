    "en": "A 79-year-old man is brought to the office by his wife for evaluation of memory impairment. The patient is a recently retired professor who began having memory problems a month ago. He has been forgetting to take his medication, has had difficulty remembering the names of his grandchildren, and has neglected to turn off the stove on more than one occasion. The patient used to enjoy reading and playing with his grandchildren but has recently stopped doing both of these activities. He also has difficulty staying asleep, low appetite, and decreased energy. {{exhibit_1}} The patient has hypertension and type 2 diabetes, for which he takes medications. He has a family history of Alzheimer disease. The patient says, \"I just feel so worthless since retiring.\" Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 119/78 mm Hg, pulse is 74/min, and respirations are 14/min. Neurological examination reveals no focal deficits. Montreal Cognitive Assessment score is 23 (normal: ≥26/30). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

  "explanation": {
    "en": "The patient's acute development of cognitive impairment (~1 month) in conjunction with his depressive symptoms (sleep disturbance, decreased appetite, low energy, feelings of worthlessness) makes Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) a more likely diagnosis. Depression-related cognitive impairment, previously termed pseudodementia, refers to a syndrome of reversible cognitive impairment that can mimic mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The cognitive and mood symptoms should resolve with adequate treatment of MDD. In contrast, the cognitive deficits in patients with dementia are irreversible and will gradually worsen despite treatment. Choices A, B, D, and F are subtypes of dementia, which are characterized by irreversible and progressive cognitive decline. Choice E, normal aging, may include some mild cognitive changes, but the patient's objective evidence of global cognitive impairment on cognitive testing (abnormal Montreal Cognitive Assessment score) is not normal and represents depression-related cognitive impairment.",
    "zh": "患者的认知障碍急性发展（约1个月），并伴有抑郁症状（睡眠障碍、食欲下降、精力不足、无价值感），使得重度抑郁症（MDD）成为更可能的诊断。抑郁相关认知障碍，以前称为假性痴呆，是指一种可逆性认知障碍综合征，可以模拟轻度认知障碍或痴呆。认知和情绪症状应通过充分治疗MDD而得到缓解。相比之下，痴呆患者的认知缺陷是不可逆的，并且尽管接受治疗也会逐渐恶化。选项A、B、D和F是痴呆的亚型，其特征是不可逆且进行性认知衰退。选项E，正常衰老，可能包括一些轻微的认知改变，但患者在认知测试中客观存在的全面认知障碍证据（异常的蒙特利尔认知评估量表得分）并不正常，代表了抑郁相关的认知障碍。"

    "en": "A 79-year-old retired professor presents with a one-month history of memory impairment, difficulty with activities of daily living, and depressive symptoms. His Montreal Cognitive Assessment score is 23/30. The most likely diagnosis is depression-related cognitive impairment, as his symptoms are acute, reversible, and associated with significant depressive features, which can mimic dementia.",
